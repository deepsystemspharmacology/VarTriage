27993705	20161221	Mutations in two large pedigrees highlight the role of ZNF711 in X-linked intellectual disability.	Intellectual disability (ID) affects approximately 1-2% of the general population and is characterized by impaired cognitive abilities. ID is both clinically as well as genetically heterogeneous, up to 2000 genes are estimated to be involved in the emergence of the disease with various clinical presentations. For many genes, only a few patients have been reported and causality of some genes has been questioned upon the discovery of apparent loss-of-function mutations in healthy controls. Description of additional patients strengthens the evidence for the involvement of a gene in the disease and can clarify the clinical phenotype associated with mutations in a particular gene. Here, we present two large four-generation families with a total of 11 males affected with ID caused by mutations in ZNF711, thereby expanding the total number of families with ID and a ZNF711 mutation to four. Patients with mutations in ZNF711 all present with mild to moderate ID and poor speech accompanied by additional features in some patients, including autistic features and mild facial dysmorphisms, suggesting that ZNF711 mutations cause non-syndromic ID.

28180184	20170210	GRIK2</i>gene causes neurodevelopmental deficits.	To identify inherited or de novo mutations associated with a suite of neurodevelopmental abnormalities in a 10-year-old patient displaying ataxia, motor and speech delay, and intellectual disability. We performed whole-exome sequencing of the proband and her parents. A pathogenic gene variant was identified as damaging based on sequence conservation, gene function, and association with disorders having similar phenotypic profiles. Functional characterization of the mutated protein was performed in vitro using a heterologous expression system. A single de novo point mutation in theGRIK2gene was identified as causative for the neurologic symptoms of the proband. The mutation is predicted to change a codon for alanine to that of a threonine at position 657 (A657T) in the GluK2 kainate receptor (KAR) subunit, a member of the ionotropic glutamate receptor gene family. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings revealed that KARs incorporating the GluK2(A657T) subunits show profoundly altered channel gating and are constitutively active in nominally glutamate-free extracellular media. In this study, we associate a de novo gain-of-function mutation in theGRIK2gene with deficits in motor and higher order cognitive function. These results suggest that disruption of physiologic KAR function precludes appropriate development of the nervous system. 	Neurol_Genet	D016428
27760266	20161021	Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris Type V as an Autoinflammatory Disease by CARD14 Mutations.	We found CARD14 mutations (2 de novo novel mutations and another previously reported mutation) in 3 of 3 patients with pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) type V, but not in patients with PRP of other types. Our findings, combined with the published literature, suggest that type V PRP, both familial and sporadic, can be caused by CARD14 mutations. Detailed clinical observation revealed that all 3 patients displayed unique patchy macular brown hyperpigmentation. To further determine how often patients with PRP have pathogenic mutations in CARD14 and to elucidate which clinical subtype of PRP is caused by CARD14 mutations. We sequenced the entire coding regions of CARD14 in genomic DNA from patients with 5 clinical subtypes of PRP. The detailed clinical features were analyzed in all the patients. The pathogenicity of each mutation was evaluated by several computational predictions. PRP was classified into 6 subgroups, types I to VI, based on clinical criteria. We categorized all the patients with PRP into the clinical subtypes using the classic PRP classification; 22 cases of PRP with varying subtypes were studied. The prevalence of CARD14 mutations in each subtype of PRP was evaluated. Clinical features and characteristics of patients with PRP with CARD14 mutations were analyzed. Overall 22 patients with PRP were included in our study (12 men, 10 women; mean [SD] age, 26 [18] years). Among 3 patients with PRP type V, all were found to have CARD14 mutations: 2 de novo novel mutations (p.Cys127Ser and p.Gln136Leu), and another previously reported mutation (p.Gly117Ser). All were close to the reported pathogenic domains. In silico analysis of all 3 mutations suggested that they are functionally relevant to pathogenesis. All 3 patients displayed unique patchy macular brown hyperpigmentation additionally to other typical features of PRP. Patients with PRP type I and type IV, 1 patient each, had the rare variants in CARD14. Pityriasis rubra pilaris type V is a distinct variant of PRP that is caused by CARD14 mutations. In addition, a rare variant of CARD14 might also be implicated in the pathophysiology of other forms of PRP. 	JAMA_Dermatol	D002363 D016428
28092684	20170117	Biallelic mutations in the 3' exonuclease TOE1 cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia and uncover a role in snRNA processing.	Deadenylases are best known for degrading the poly(A) tail during mRNA decay. The deadenylase family has expanded throughout evolution and, in mammals, consists of 12 Mg2+-dependent 3'-end RNases with substrate specificity that is mostly unknown. Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 7 (PCH7) is a unique recessive syndrome characterized by neurodegeneration and ambiguous genitalia. We studied 12 human families with PCH7, uncovering biallelic, loss-of-function mutations in TOE1, which encodes an unconventional deadenylase. toe1-morphant zebrafish displayed midbrain and hindbrain degeneration, modeling PCH-like structural defects in vivo. Surprisingly, we found that TOE1 associated with small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) incompletely processed spliceosomal. These pre-snRNAs contained 3' genome-encoded tails often followed by post-transcriptionally added adenosines. Human cells with reduced levels of TOE1 accumulated 3'-end-extended pre-snRNAs, and the immunoisolated TOE1 complex was sufficient for 3'-end maturation of snRNAs. Our findings identify the cause of a neurodegenerative syndrome linked to snRNA maturation and uncover a key factor involved in the processing of snRNA 3' ends. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428
27094308	20160421	A multicenter experience on the prevalence of ARMC5 mutations in patients with primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia: from genetic characterization to clinical phenotype.	ARMC5 mutations have recently been identified as a common genetic cause of primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PBMAH). We aimed to assess the prevalence of ARMC5 germline mutations and correlate genotype with phenotype in a large cohort of PBMAH patients. A multicenter study was performed, collecting patients from different endocrinology units in Italy. Seventy-one PBMAH patients were screened for small mutations and large rearrangements in the ARMC5 gene: 53 were cortisol-secreting (two with a family history of adrenal hyperplasia) and 18 were non-secreting cases of PBMAH. Non-mutated and mutated patients' clinical phenotypes were compared and related to the type of mutation. A likely causative germline ARMC5 mutation was only identified in cortisol-secreting PBMAH patients (one with a family history of adrenal hyperplasia and ten apparently sporadic cases). Screening in eight first-degree relatives of three index cases revealed four carriers of an ARMC5 mutation. Evidence of a second hit at somatic level was identified in five nodules. Mutated patients had higher cortisol levels (p = 0.062), and more severe hypertension and diabetes (p &lt; 0.05). Adrenal glands were significantly larger, with a multinodular phenotype, in the mutant group (p &lt; 0.01). No correlation emerged between type of mutation and clinical parameters. ARMC5 mutations are frequent in cortisol-secreting PBMAH and seem to be associated with a particular pattern of the adrenal masses. Their identification may have implications for the clinical care of PBMAH cases and their relatives. 	Endocrine	D016428 D016448
27799408	20161102	PLD1</i>gene.	The underlying molecular aetiology of congenital heart defects is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the genetic basis of non-syndromic severe congenital valve malformations in two unrelated families. Whole-exome analysis was used to identify the mutations in five patients who suffered from severe valvular malformations involving the pulmonic, tricuspid and mitral valves. The significance of the findings was assessed by studying sporulation of yeast carrying a homologous Phospholipase D (PLD1) mutation, in situ hybridisation in chick embryo and echocardiography and histological examination of hearts ofPLD1knockout mice. Three mutations, p.His442Pro, p.Thr495fs32* and c.2882+2T&gt;C, were identified in thePLD1gene. The mutations affected highly conserved sites in the PLD1 protein and the p.His442Pro mutation produced a strong loss of function phenotype in yeast homologous mutant strain. Here we show that in chick embryosPLD1expression is confined to the forming heart (E2-E8) and homogeneously expressed all over the heart during days E2-E3. Thereafter its expression decreases, remaining only adjacent to the atrioventricular valves and the right ventricular outflow tract. This pattern of expression follows the known dynamic patterning of apoptosis in the developing heart, consistent with the known role of PLD1 in the promotion of apoptosis. In hearts ofPLD1knockout mice, we detected marked tricuspid regurgitation, right atrial enlargement, and increased flow velocity, narrowing and thickened leaflets of the pulmonic valve. The findings support a role for PLD1 in normal heart valvulogenesis. 	J._Med._Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013485
28144995	20170202	Axonal Neuropathies due to Mutations in Small Heat Shock Proteins: Clinical, Genetic, and Functional Insights into Novel Mutations.	In this study, we describe the phenotypic spectrum of distal hereditary motor neuropathy caused by mutations in the small heat shock proteins HSPB1 and HSPB8 and investigate the functional consequences of newly discovered variants. Among 510 unrelated patients with distal motor neuropathy, we identified mutations in HSPB1 (28 index patients/510; 5.5%) and HSPB8 (four index patients/510; 0.8%) genes. Patients have slowly progressive distal (100%) and proximal (13%) weakness in lower limbs (100%), mild lower limbs sensory involvement (31%), foot deformities (73%), progressive distal upper limb weakness (29%), mildly raised serum creatine kinase levels (100%), and central nervous system involvement (9%). We identified 12 HSPB1 and four HSPB8 mutations, including five and three not previously reported. Transmission was either dominant (78%), recessive (3%), or de novo (19%). Three missense mutations in HSPB1 (Pro7Ser, Gly53Asp, and Gln128Arg) cause hyperphosphorylation of neurofilaments, whereas the C-terminal mutant Ser187Leu triggers protein aggregation. Two frameshift mutations (Leu58fs and Ala61fs) create a premature stop codon leading to proteasomal degradation. Two mutations in HSPB8 (Lys141Met/Asn) exhibited increased binding to Bag3. We demonstrate that HSPB1 and HSPB8 mutations are a major cause of inherited motor axonal neuropathy. Mutations lead to diverse functional outcomes further demonstrating the pleotropic character of small heat shock proteins. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428
28285769	20170314	Mutations in the Spliceosome Component CWC27 Cause Retinal Degeneration with or without Additional Developmental Anomalies.	Pre-mRNA splicing factors play a fundamental role in regulating transcript diversity both temporally and spatially. Genetic defects in several spliceosome components have been linked to a set of non-overlapping spliceosomopathy phenotypes in humans, among which skeletal developmental defects and non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP) are frequent findings. Here we report that defects in spliceosome-associated protein CWC27 are associated with a spectrum of disease phenotypes ranging from isolated RP to severe syndromic forms. By whole-exome sequencing, recessive protein-truncating mutations in CWC27 were found in seven unrelated families that show a range of clinical phenotypes, including retinal degeneration, brachydactyly, craniofacial abnormalities, short stature, and neurological defects. Remarkably, variable expressivity of the human phenotype can be recapitulated in Cwc27 mutant mouse models, with significant embryonic lethality and severe phenotypes in the complete knockout mice while mice with a partial loss-of-function allele mimic the isolated retinal degeneration phenotype. Our study describes a retinal dystrophy-related phenotype spectrum as well as its genetic etiology and highlights the complexity of the spliceosomal gene network. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428
27729211	20161013	A new missense mutation in UMOD gene leads to severely reduced serum uromodulin concentrations - A tool for the diagnosis of uromodulin-associated kidney disease.	Uromodulin-associated Autosomal Dominant Tubulointerstitial Kidney Disease (ADTKD-UMOD) belongs to a group of autosomal dominant inherited diseases caused by mutations in the UMOD gene, which codes for uromodulin, a protein exclusively expressed in renal tubular cells of the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The diagnosis is hampered by non-specific clinical, laboratory and histological findings. In this study, we evaluated serum uromodulin as diagnostic marker for ADTKD-UMOD in a family with a novel mutation in UMOD. We investigated a family with five members suffering from chronic kidney disease of unknown origin (CKD) and three healthy members using whole exome sequencing. Serum uromodulin was measured by ELISA. The uromodulin concentration of each CKD family member was compared to reference CKD groups with similar eGFR and to non-CKD individuals in case of the healthy family members, respectively. Whole exome sequencing revealed novel missense mutation c.457T&gt;G, p.(Cys153Gly) in UMOD. Serum uromodulin concentration was lower in all affected patients compared to all patients of the reference CKD groups, while healthy family members showed normal values comparable to those of the non-CKD reference group. The mutation detected in our family leads to severely reduced serum uromodulin concentrations, distinguishing these patients clearly from CKD patients with comparable eGFR. Therefore, serum uromodulin could serve as a simple, new diagnostic marker to identify patients with ADTKD-UMOD. 	Clin._Biochem.	D002363 D016428
26940431	20160305	New THAP1 mutation and role of putative modifier in TOR1A.	The prevalence of DYT1 (mutation in TOR1A) and DYT6 (mutation in THAP1) may vary in different populations, which can have important implications in clinical investigation. Our goal was to characterize patients with inherited and isolated dystonia and determine the frequency of mutations responsible for DYT1 and DYT6 in Brazilian patients. Two movement disorder specialists examined 78 patients with idiopathic isolated dystonia using a standardized questionnaire, before sequencing TOR1A and THAP1 genes. Clinically, our cohort was similar to those described in the international literature. Molecular studies of 68 subjects revealed only one potentially deleterious variant in THAP1 (1/68 patients, 1.47%). This was a novel 10-bp deletion at the end of exon 1, g.5308_5317del (ng_011837.1), which is predicted to create an alternative splicing and the insertion of a premature stop codon. Although we did not observe any potentially deleterious mutations in TOR1A, we found the missense variant rs1801968 (TOR1A p.D216H), previously reported as either a modifier of dystonia phenotype or a predisposing factor for dystonia. However, we did not identify any phenotypic impact related to the missense variant rs1801968 (P = 0.3387). Although clinically similar to most cohorts with dystonia worldwide, the classical mutation (c.907_909delGAG) in TOR1A (causing DYT1) is absent in our patients. However, we found a potentially deleterious THAP1 mutation not previously reported. In addition, we found no association of rs1801968 with dystonia. 	Acta_Neurol._Scand.	D016428
28065471	20170110	Mutations in ATP6V1E1 or ATP6V1A Cause Autosomal-Recessive Cutis Laxa.	Defects of the V-type proton (H+) ATPase (V-ATPase) impair acidification and intracellular trafficking of membrane-enclosed compartments, including secretory granules, endosomes, and lysosomes. Whole-exome sequencing in five families affected by mild to severe cutis laxa, dysmorphic facial features, and cardiopulmonary involvement identified biallelic missense mutations in ATP6V1E1 and ATP6V1A, which encode the E1 and A subunits, respectively, of the V1domain of the heteromultimeric V-ATPase complex. Structural modeling indicated that all substitutions affect critical residues and inter- or intrasubunit interactions. Furthermore, complexome profiling, a method combining blue-native gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, showed that they disturb either the assembly or the stability of the V-ATPase complex. Protein glycosylation was variably affected. Abnormal vesicular trafficking was evidenced by delayed retrograde transport after brefeldin A treatment and abnormal swelling and fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus. In addition to showing reduced and fragmented elastic fibers, the histopathological hallmark of cutis laxa, transmission electron microscopy of the dermis also showed pronounced changes in the structure and organization of the collagen fibers. Our findings expand the clinical and molecular spectrum of metabolic cutis laxa syndromes and further link defective extracellular matrix assembly to faulty protein processing and cellular trafficking caused by genetic defects in the V-ATPase complex.

27864847	20161120	Diagnostic Targeted Resequencing in 349 Patients with Drug-Resistant Pediatric Epilepsies Identifies Causative Mutations in 30 Different Genes.	Targeted resequencing gene panels are used in the diagnostic setting to identify gene defects in epilepsy. We performed targeted resequencing using a 30-genes panel and a 95-genes panel in 349 patients with drug-resistant epilepsies beginning in the first years of life. We identified 71 pathogenic variants, 42 of which novel, in 30 genes, corresponding to 20.3% of the probands. In 66% of mutation positive patients, epilepsy onset occurred before the age of 6 months. The 95-genes panel allowed a genetic diagnosis in 22 (6.3%) patients that would have otherwise been missed using the 30-gene panel. About 50% of mutations were identified in genes coding for sodium and potassium channel components. SCN2A was the most frequently mutated gene followed by SCN1A, KCNQ2, STXBP1, SCN8A, CDKL5, and MECP2. Twenty-nine mutations were identified in 23 additional genes, most of them recently associated with epilepsy. Our data show that panels targeting about 100 genes represent the best cost-effective diagnostic option in pediatric drug-resistant epilepsies. They enable molecular diagnosis of atypical phenotypes, allowing to broaden phenotype-genotype correlations. Molecular diagnosis might influence patients' management and translate into better and specific treatment recommendations in some conditions. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428
28101991	20170120	Clinically Distinct Phenotypes of Canavan Disease Correlate with Residual Aspartoacylase Enzyme Activity.	We describe 14 patients with 12 novel missense mutations in ASPA, the gene causing Canavan disease (CD). We developed a method to study the effect of these 12 variants on the function of aspartoacylase-the hydrolysis of N-acetyl-l-aspartic acid (NAA) to aspartate and acetate. The wild-type ASPA open reading frame (ORF) and the ORFs containing each of the variants were transfected into HEK293 cells. Enzyme activity was determined by incubating cell lysates with NAA and measuring the released aspartic acid by LC-MS/MS. Clinical data were obtained for 11 patients by means of questionnaires. Four patients presented with a non-typical clinical picture or with the milder form of CD, whereas seven presented with severe CD. The mutations found in the mild patients corresponded to the variants with the highest residual enzyme activities, suggesting that this assay can help evaluate unknown variants found in patients with atypical presentation. We have detected a correlation between clinical presentation, enzyme activity, and genotype for CD. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428
28258662	20170305	A novel GJA1 mutation in oculodentodigital dysplasia with extensive loss of enamel.	To characterize clinical features and identify genetic causes of a patient with oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD). Clinical, dental, radiological features were obtained. DNA was collected from an affected Thai family. Whole-exome sequencing was employed to identify the disease-causing mutation causing ODDD. The presence of the identified variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The proband suffered with extensive enamel hypoplasia, polysyndactyly and clinodactyly of the 3rd-5th fingers, microphthalmia, and unique facial characteristics of ODDD. Mutation analysis revealed a novel missense mutation, c. 31C&gt;A, p.L11I, in the GJA1 gene which encodes gap junction channel protein connexin 43. Bioinformatics and structural modeling suggested the mutation to be pathogenic. The parents did not harbor the mutation. This study identified a novel de novo mutation in the GJA1 gene associated with severe tooth defects. These results expand the mutation spectrum and understanding of pathologic dental phenotypes related to ODDD. 	Oral_Dis	D016428
28132692	20170131	A Recurrent De Novo Variant in NACC1 Causes a Syndrome Characterized by Infantile Epilepsy, Cataracts, and Profound Developmental Delay.	Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has increasingly enabled new pathogenic gene variant identification for undiagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders and provided insights into both gene function and disease biology. Here, we describe seven children with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by microcephaly, profound developmental delays and/or intellectual disability, cataracts, severe epilepsy including infantile spasms, irritability, failure to thrive, and stereotypic hand movements. Brain imaging in these individuals reveals delay in myelination and cerebral atrophy. We observe an identical recurrent de novo heterozygous c.892C&gt;T (p.Arg298Trp) variant in the nucleus accumbens associated 1 (NACC1) gene in seven affected individuals. One of the seven individuals is mosaic for this variant. NACC1 encodes a transcriptional repressor implicated in gene expression and has not previously been associated with germline disorders. The probability of finding the same missense NACC1 variant by chance in 7 out of 17,228 individuals who underwent WES for diagnoses of neurodevelopmental phenotypes is extremely small and achieves genome-wide significance (p = 1.25 × 10-14). Selective constraint against missense variants in NACC1 makes this excess of an identical missense variant in all seven individuals more remarkable. Our findings are consistent with a germline recurrent mutational hotspot associated with an allele-specific neurodevelopmental phenotype in NACC1. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D002363 D016428
28193117	20170215	Exome Sequencing Identifies De Novo DYNC1H1 Mutations Associated With Distal Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Malformations of Cortical Development.	Exome sequencing has become a formidable tool for identifying potential de novo variants in causative genes of human diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders. This article describes a 16-month-old girl with spinal muscular atrophy with lower extremity predominance and a 13-month-old girl with malformations of cortical development. Exome sequencing identified a novel de novo heterozygous missense mutation c.3395G&gt;A (p.Gly1132Glu) and a previously reported de novo heterozygous missense mutation c.10151G&gt;A (p.Arg3384Gln) in the DYNC1H1 gene. Bioinformatics predictions for c.3395G&gt;A and c.10151G&gt;A indicated pathogenicity of the mutations. DYNC1H1 is a pivotal component of cytoplasmic dynein complex, which is a microtubule-related motor involved in retrograde transport. Previous studies indicated that mutant dynein showed decreased run-length of the motor proteins and diminished retrograde transport, which were clearly associated with neuronal death and neurologic diseases. The present findings expand the mutational spectrum of the DYNC1H1 gene, reemphasizing the significance of the DYNC1H1 protein in the functioning of neurons. 	J._Child_Neurol.

28150103	20170203	Purification, Biochemical Characterization, and Amino Acid Sequence of a Novel Type of Lectin from Aplysia dactylomela Eggs with Antibacterial/Antibiofilm Potential.	A new lectin from Aplysia dactylomela eggs (ADEL) was isolated by affinity chromatography on HCl-activated Sepharose media. Hemagglutination caused by ADEL was inhibited by several galactosides, mainly galacturonic acid (Ka = 6.05 × 106 M-1). The primary structure of ADEL consists of 217 residues, including 11 half-cystines involved in five intrachain and one interchain disulfide bond, resulting in a molecular mass of 57,228 ± 2 Da, as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. ADEL showed high similarity with lectins isolated from Aplysia eggs, but not with other known lectins, indicating that these lectins could be grouped into a new family of animal lectins. Three glycosylation sites were found in its polypeptide backbone. Data from peptide-N-glycosidase F digestion and MS suggest that all oligosaccharides attached to ADEL are high in mannose. The secondary structure of ADEL is predominantly ?-sheet, and its tertiary structure is sensitive to the presence of ligands, as observed by CD. A 3D structure model of ADEL was created and shows two domains connected by a short loop. Domain A is composed of a flat three-stranded and a curved five-stranded ?-sheet, while domain B presents a flat three-stranded and a curved four-stranded ?-sheet. Molecular docking revealed favorable binding energies for interactions between lectin and galacturonic acid, lactose, galactosamine, and galactose. Moreover, ADEL was able to agglutinate and inhibit biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus, suggesting that this lectin may be a potential alternative to conventional use of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of infections caused by Staphylococcal biofilms.

28111830	20170124	Mutations in the Human Argininosuccinate Synthetase (ASS1) Gene, Impact on Patients, Common Changes, and Structural Considerations.	Citrullinemia type 1 is an autosomal recessive urea cycle disorder caused by defects in the argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) enzyme due to mutations in ASS1 gene. An impairment of ASS function can lead to a wide spectrum of phenotypes, from life-threatening neonatal hyperammonemia to a later onset with mild symptoms, and even some asymptomatic patients exhibiting an only biochemical phenotype. The disease is panethnic. In this update, we report 137 mutations (64 of which are novel), consisting of 89 missense mutations, 19 nonsense mutations, 17 mutations that affect splicing, and 12 deletions. The change p.Gly390Arg is by far the most common mutation and is widely spread throughout the world. Other frequent mutations (p.Arg157His, p.Trp179Arg, p.Val263Met, p.Arg304Trp, p.Gly324Ser, p.Gly362Val, and p.Arg363Trp), each found in at least 12 independent families, are mainly carried by patients from the Indian subcontinent, Turkey, Germany, and Japan. To better understand the disease, we collected clinical data of &gt;360 patients, including all published information available. This information is related to the patients' genetic background, the conservation of the mutated residues and a structural rationalization of the effect of the most frequent mutations. In addition, we review ASS regulation, animal models, diagnostic strategies, newborn screening, and treatment options. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428 D016454
27939641	20161213	Loss-of-Function Mutations in YY1AP1 Lead to Grange Syndrome and a Fibromuscular Dysplasia-Like Vascular Disease.	Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a heterogeneous group of non-atherosclerotic and non-inflammatory arterial diseases that primarily involves the renal and cerebrovascular arteries. Grange syndrome is an autosomal-recessive condition characterized by severe and early-onset vascular disease similar to FMD and variable penetrance of brachydactyly, syndactyly, bone fragility, and learning disabilities. Exome-sequencing analysis of DNA from three affected siblings with Grange syndrome identified compound heterozygous nonsense variants in YY1AP1, and homozygous nonsense or frameshift YY1AP1 variants were subsequently identified in additional unrelated probands with Grange syndrome. YY1AP1 encodes yin yang 1 (YY1)-associated protein 1 and is an activator of the YY1 transcription factor. We determined that YY1AP1 localizes to the nucleus and is a component of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, which is responsible for transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and replication. Molecular studies revealed that loss of YY1AP1 in vascular smooth muscle cells leads to cell cycle arrest with decreased proliferation and increased levels of the cell cycle regulator p21/WAF/CDKN1A and disrupts TGF-?-driven differentiation of smooth muscle cells. Identification of YY1AP1 mutations as a cause of FMD indicates that this condition can result from underlying genetic variants that significantly alter the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells.

27939639	20161213	Mutations in Histone Acetylase Modifier BRPF1 Cause an Autosomal-Dominant Form of Intellectual Disability with Associated Ptosis.	Intellectual disability (ID) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder exhibiting extreme genetic heterogeneity, and more than 500 genes have been implicated in Mendelian forms of ID. We performed exome sequencing in a large family affected by an autosomal-dominant form of mild syndromic ID with ptosis, growth retardation, and hypotonia, and we identified an inherited 2 bp deletion causing a frameshift in BRPF1 (c.1052_1053del) in five affected family members. BRPF1 encodes a protein modifier of two histone acetyltransferases associated with ID: KAT6A (also known as MOZ or MYST3) and KAT6B (MORF or MYST4). The mRNA transcript was not significantly reduced in affected fibroblasts and most likely produces a truncated protein (p.Val351Glyfs?8). The protein variant shows an aberrant cellular location, loss of certain protein interactions, and decreased histone H3K23 acetylation. We identified BRPF1 deletions or point mutations in six additional individuals with a similar phenotype. Deletions of the 3p25 region, containing BRPF1 and SETD5, cause a defined ID syndrome where most of the clinical features are attributed to SETD5 deficiency. We compared the clinical symptoms of individuals carrying mutations or small deletions of BRPF1 alone or SETD5 alone with those of individuals with deletions encompassing both BRPF1 and SETD5. We conclude that both genes contribute to the phenotypic severity of 3p25 deletion syndrome but that some specific features, such as ptosis and blepharophimosis, are mostly driven by BRPF1 haploinsufficiency.

28530676	20170523	Mutations in DZIP1L, which encodes a ciliary-transition-zone protein, cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.	Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), usually considered to be a genetically homogeneous disease caused by mutations in PKHD1, has been associated with ciliary dysfunction. Here, we describe mutations in DZIP1L, which encodes DAZ interacting protein 1-like, in patients with ARPKD. We further validated these findings through loss-of-function studies in mice and zebrafish. DZIP1L localizes to centrioles and to the distal ends of basal bodies, and interacts with septin2, a protein implicated in maintenance of the periciliary diffusion barrier at the ciliary transition zone. In agreement with a defect in the diffusion barrier, we found that the ciliary-membrane translocation of the PKD proteins polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 is compromised in DZIP1L-mutant cells. Together, these data provide what is, to our knowledge, the first conclusive evidence that ARPKD is not a homogeneous disorder and further establish DZIP1L as a second gene involved in ARPKD pathogenesis.

27431290	20160720	Clinical genomics expands the morbid genome of intellectual disability and offers a high diagnostic yield.	Intellectual disability (ID) is a measurable phenotypic consequence of genetic and environmental factors. In this study, we prospectively assessed the diagnostic yield of genomic tools (molecular karyotyping, multi-gene panel and exome sequencing) in a cohort of 337 ID subjects as a first-tier test and compared it with a standard clinical evaluation performed in parallel. Standard clinical evaluation suggested a diagnosis in 16% of cases (54/337) but only 70% of these (38/54) were subsequently confirmed. On the other hand, the genomic approach revealed a likely diagnosis in 58% (n=196). These included copy number variants in 14% (n=54, 15% are novel), and point mutations revealed by multi-gene panel and exome sequencing in the remaining 43% (1% were found to have Fragile-X). The identified point mutations were mostly recessive (n=117, 81%), consistent with the high consanguinity of the study cohort, but also X-linked (n=8, 6%) and de novo dominant (n=19, 13%). When applied directly on all cases with negative molecular karyotyping, the diagnostic yield of exome sequencing was 60% (77/129). Exome sequencing also identified likely pathogenic variants in three novel candidate genes (DENND5A, NEMF and DNHD1) each of which harbored independent homozygous mutations in patients with overlapping phenotypes. In addition, exome sequencing revealed de novo and recessive variants in 32 genes (MAMDC2, TUBAL3, CPNE6, KLHL24, USP2, PIP5K1A, UBE4A, TP53TG5, ATOH1, C16ORF90, SLC39A14, TRERF1, RGL1, CDH11, SYDE2, HIRA, FEZF2, PROCA1, PIANP, PLK2, QRFPR, AP3B2, NUDT2, UFC1, BTN3A2, TADA1, ARFGEF3, FAM160B1, ZMYM5, SLC45A1, ARHGAP33 and CAPS2), which we highlight as potential candidates on the basis of several lines of evidence, and one of these genes (SLC39A14) was biallelically inactivated in a potentially treatable form of hypermanganesemia and neurodegeneration. Finally, likely causal variants in previously published candidate genes were identified (ASTN1, HELZ, THOC6, WDR45B, ADRA2B and CLIP1), thus supporting their involvement in ID pathogenesis. Our results expand the morbid genome of ID and support the adoption of genomics as a first-tier test for individuals with ID. 	Mol._Psychiatry	D016428
28067909	20170110	SMCHD1 mutations associated with a rare muscular dystrophy can also cause isolated arhinia and Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome.	Arhinia, or absence of the nose, is a rare malformation of unknown etiology that is often accompanied by ocular and reproductive defects. Sequencing of 40 people with arhinia revealed that 84% of probands harbor a missense mutation localized to a constrained region of SMCHD1 encompassing the ATPase domain. SMCHD1 mutations cause facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 (FSHD2) via a trans-acting loss-of-function epigenetic mechanism. We discovered shared mutations and comparable DNA hypomethylation patterning between these distinct disorders. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated alteration of smchd1 in zebrafish yielded arhinia-relevant phenotypes. Transcriptome and protein analyses in arhinia probands and controls showed no differences in SMCHD1 mRNA or protein abundance but revealed regulatory changes in genes and pathways associated with craniofacial patterning. Mutations in SMCHD1 thus contribute to distinct phenotypic spectra, from craniofacial malformation and reproductive disorders to muscular dystrophy, which we speculate to be consistent with oligogenic mechanisms resulting in pleiotropic outcomes.

28244183	20170301	Nonketotic hyperglycinemia: Functional assessment of missense variants in GLDC to understand phenotypes of the disease.	The rapid analysis of genomic data is providing effective mutational confirmation in patients with clinical and biochemical hallmarks of a specific disease. This is the case for nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), a Mendelian disorder causing seizures in neonates and early-infants, primarily due to mutations in the GLDC gene. However, understanding the impact of missense variants identified in this gene is a major challenge for the application of genomics into clinical practice. Herein, a comprehensive functional and structural analysis of 19 GLDC missense variants identified in a cohort of 26 NKH patients was performed. Mutant cDNA constructs were expressed in COS7 cells followed by enzymatic assays and Western blot analysis of the GCS P-protein to assess the residual activity and mutant protein stability. Structural analysis, based on molecular modeling of the 3D structure of GCS P-protein, was also performed. We identify hypomorphic variants that produce attenuated phenotypes with improved prognosis of the disease. Structural analysis allows us to interpret the effects of mutations on protein stability and catalytic activity, providing molecular evidence for clinical outcome and disease severity. Moreover, we identify an important number of mutants whose loss-of-functionality is associated with instability and, thus, are potential targets for rescue using folding therapeutic approaches.

27738187	20161015	ERF</i>gene.	In 1993, Chitayatet al., reported a newborn with hyperphalangism, facial anomalies, and bronchomalacia. We identified three additional families with similar findings. Features include bilateral accessory phalanx resulting in shortened index fingers; hallux valgus; distinctive face; respiratory compromise. To identify the genetic aetiology of Chitayat syndrome and identify a unifying cause for this specific form of hyperphalangism. Through ongoing collaboration, we had collected patients with strikingly-similar phenotype. Trio-based exome sequencing was first performed in Patient 2 through Deciphering Developmental Disorders study. Proband-only exome sequencing had previously been independently performed in Patient 4. Following identification of a candidate gene variant in Patient 2, the same variant was subsequently confirmed from exome data in Patient 4. Sanger sequencing was used to validate this variant in Patients 1, 3; confirm paternal inheritance in Patient 5. A recurrent, novel variant NM_006494.2:c.266A&gt;G p.(Tyr89Cys) inERFwas identified in five affected individuals: de novo (patient 1, 2 and 3) and inherited from an affected father (patient 4 and 5). p.Tyr89Cys is an aromatic polar neutral to polar neutral amino acid substitution, at a highly conserved position and lies within the functionally important ETS-domain of the protein. The recurrentERFc.266A&gt;C p.(Tyr89Cys) variant causes Chitayat syndrome. ERF variants have previously been associated with complex craniosynostosis. In contrast, none of the patients with the c.266A&gt;G p.(Tyr89Cys) variant have craniosynostosis. We report the molecular aetiology of Chitayat syndrome and discuss potential mechanisms for this distinctive phenotype associated with the p.Tyr89Cys substitution inERF. 	J._Med._Genet.

28301481	20170317	COLEC10 is mutated in 3MC patients and regulates early craniofacial development.	3MC syndrome is an autosomal recessive heterogeneous disorder with features linked to developmental abnormalities. The main features include facial dysmorphism, craniosynostosis and cleft lip/palate; skeletal structures derived from cranial neural crest cells (cNCC). We previously reported that lectin complement pathway genes COLEC11 and MASP1/3 are mutated in 3MC syndrome patients. Here we define a new gene, COLEC10, also mutated in 3MC families and present novel mutations in COLEC11 and MASP1/3 genes in a further five families. The protein products of COLEC11 and COLEC10, CL-K1 and CL-L1 respectively, form heteromeric complexes. We show COLEC10 is expressed in the base membrane of the palate during murine embryo development. We demonstrate how mutations in COLEC10 (c.25C&gt;T; p.Arg9Ter, c.226delA; p.Gly77Glufs*66 and c.528C&gt;G p.Cys176Trp) impair the expression and/or secretion of CL-L1 highlighting their pathogenicity. Together, these findings provide further evidence linking the lectin complement pathway and complement factors COLEC11 and COLEC10 to morphogenesis of craniofacial structures and 3MC etiology.

27610946	20160910	Identical NR5A1 Missense Mutations in Two Unrelated 46,XX Individuals with Testicular Tissues.	The role of monogenic mutations in the development of 46,XX testicular/ovotesticular disorders of sex development (DSD) remains speculative. Although mutations in NR5A1 are known to cause 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis and 46,XX ovarian insufficiency, such mutations have not been implicated in testicular development of 46,XX gonads. Here, we identified identical NR5A1 mutations in two unrelated Japanese patients with 46,XX testicular/ovotesticular DSD. The p.Arg92Trp mutation was absent from the clinically normal mothers and from 200 unaffected Japanese individuals. In silico analyses scored p.Arg92Trp as probably pathogenic. In vitro assays demonstrated that compared with wild-type NR5A1, the mutant protein was less sensitive to NR0B1-induced suppression on the SOX9 enhancer element. Other sequence variants found in the patients were unlikely to be associated with the phenotype. The results raise the possibility that specific mutations in NR5A1 underlie testicular development in genetic females. 	Hum._Mutat.	D002363 D016428
27557811	20160826	Novel PEX3 Gene Mutations Resulting in a Moderate Zellweger Spectrum Disorder.	Peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) may have a variable clinical expression, ranging from severe, lethal to mild phenotypes with progressive evolution. PBDs are autosomal recessive disorders caused by mutations in PEX genes, which encode proteins called peroxins, involved in the assembly of the peroxisome. Patient Description: We herein report a patient who is currently 9 years old and who is compound heterozygous for two novel mutations in the PEX3 gene. Mild biochemical abnormalities of the peroxisomal parameters suggested a Zellweger spectrum defect in the patient. Sequence analysis of the PEX3 gene identified two novel heterozygous, pathogenic mutations. Mutations in PEX3 usually result in a severe, early lethal phenotype. We report a patient compound heterozygous for two novel mutations in the PEX3 gene, who is less affected than previously reported patients with a defect in the PEX3 gene. Our findings indicate that PEX3 defects may cause a disease spectrum similar as previously observed for other PEX gene defects. 	JIMD_Rep	D016428
28067412	20170110	Broadening the phenotypic spectrum of POP1-skeletal dysplasias: identification of POP1 mutations in a mild and severe skeletal dysplasia.	Processing of Precursor 1 (POP1) is a large protein common to the ribonuclease-mitochondrial RNA processing (RNase-MRP) and RNase-P (RMRP) endoribonucleoprotein complexes. Although its precise function is unknown, it appears to participate in the assembly or stability of both complexes. Numerous RMRP mutations have been reported in individuals with cartilage-hair hypoplasia (CHH) but, to date, only three POP1 mutations have been described in two families with features similar to anauxetic dysplasia (AD). We present two further individuals, one with severe short stature and a relatively mild skeletal dysplasia and another in whom AD was suspected. Biallelic POP1 mutations were identified in both. A missense mutation and a novel single base deletion were detected in proband 1, p.[Pro582Ser]:[Glu870fs*5]. Markedly reduced abundance of RMRP and elevated levels of pre5.8s rRNA was observed. In proband 2, a homozygous novel POP1 mutation was identified, p.[(Asp511Tyr)];[(Asp511Tyr)]. These two individuals show the phenotypic extremes in the clinical presentation of POP1-dysplasias. Although CHH and other skeletal dysplasias caused by mutations in RMRP or POP1 are commonly cited as ribosomal biogenesis disorders, recent studies question this assumption. We discuss the past and present knowledge about the function of the RMRP complex in skeletal development. 	Clin._Genet.	D016428
28067911	20170110	De novo mutations in SMCHD1 cause Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome and abrogate nasal development.	Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome (BAMS) is an extremely rare and striking condition characterized by complete absence of the nose with or without ocular defects. We report here that missense mutations in the epigenetic regulator SMCHD1 mapping to the extended ATPase domain of the encoded protein cause BAMS in all 14 cases studied. All mutations were de novo where parental DNA was available. Biochemical tests and in vivo assays in Xenopus laevis embryos suggest that these mutations may behave as gain-of-function alleles. This finding is in contrast to the loss-of-function mutations in SMCHD1 that have been associated with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) type 2. Our results establish SMCHD1 as a key player in nasal development and provide biochemical insight into its enzymatic function that may be exploited for development of therapeutics for FSHD.

27389779	20160709	De novo missense variants in HECW2 are associated with neurodevelopmental delay and hypotonia.	The causes of intellectual disability (ID) are diverse and de novo mutations are increasingly recognised to account for a significant proportion of ID. In this study, we performed whole exome sequencing on a large cohort of patients with ID or neurodevelopmental delay and identified four novel de novo predicted deleterious missense variants in HECW2 in six probands with ID/developmental delay and hypotonia. Other common features include seizures, strabismus, nystagmus, cortical visual impairment and dysmorphic facial features. HECW2 is an ubiquitin ligase that stabilises p73, a crucial mediator of neurodevelopment and neurogenesis. This study implicates pathogenic genetic variants in HECW2 as potential causes of neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. 	J._Med._Genet.	D016428 D013485
28229514	20170224	Mutations in genes encoding polycomb repressive complex 2 subunits cause Weaver syndrome.	Weaver syndrome (WS) is a rare congenital overgrowth disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2) or EED (embryonic ectoderm development). EZH2 and EED are core components of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which possesses histone methyltransferase activity and catalyzes trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27. Here, we analyzed eight probands with clinically suspected WS by whole-exome sequencing and identified three mutations: a 25.4-kb deletion partially involving EZH2 and CUL1 (individual 1), a missense mutation (c.707G&gt;C, p.Arg236Thr) in EED (individual 2), and a missense mutation (c.1829A&gt;T, p.Glu610Val) in SUZ12 (suppressor of zeste 12 homolog) (individual 3) inherited from her father (individual 4) with a mosaic mutation. SUZ12 is another component of PRC2 and germline mutations in SUZ12 have not been previously reported in humans. In vitro functional analyses demonstrated that the identified EED and SUZ12 missense mutations cause decreased trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3. These data indicate that loss-of-function mutations of PRC2 components are an important cause of WS. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428
27607563	20160909	Loss of the proprioception and touch sensation channel PIEZO2 in siblings with a progressive form of contractures.	Dominant mutations in PIEZO2, which codes for the principal mechanotransduction channel for proprioception and touch sensation, have been found to cause different forms of distal arthrogryposis. Some observations suggest that these dominant mutations induce a gain-of-function effect on the channel. Here, we report a consanguineous family with three siblings who showed short stature, scoliosis, gross motor impairment, and a progressive form of contractures involving the distal joints that is distinct from that found in patients with dominant mutations in PIEZO2. These siblings also displayed deficits in proprioception and touch sensation. Whole-exome sequencing performed in the three affected siblings revealed the presence of a rare homozygous variant (c.2708C&gt;G; p.S903*) in PIEZO2. This variant is predicted to disrupt PIEZO2 function by abolishing the pore domain. Sanger sequencing confirmed that all three siblings are homozygous whereas their parents and an unaffected sibling are heterozygous for this variant. Recessive mutations in PIEZO2 thus appear to cause a progressive phenotype that overlaps with, while being mostly distinct from that associated with dominant mutations in the same gene. 	Clin._Genet.

28132693	20170131	Biallelic Mutation of ARHGEF18, Involved in the Determination of Epithelial Apicobasal Polarity, Causes Adult-Onset Retinal Degeneration.	Mutations in more than 250 genes are implicated in inherited retinal dystrophy; the encoded proteins are involved in a broad spectrum of pathways. The presence of unsolved families after highly parallel sequencing strategies suggests that further genes remain to be identified. Whole-exome and -genome sequencing studies employed here in large cohorts of affected individuals revealed biallelic mutations in ARHGEF18 in three such individuals. ARHGEF18 encodes ARHGEF18, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates RHOA, a small GTPase protein that is a key component of tight junctions and adherens junctions. This biological pathway is known to be important for retinal development and function, as mutation of CRB1, encoding another component, causes retinal dystrophy. The retinal structure in individuals with ARHGEF18 mutations resembled that seen in subjects with CRB1 mutations. Five mutations were found on six alleles in the three individuals: c.808A&gt;G (p.Thr270Ala), c.1617+5G&gt;A (p.Asp540Glyfs?63), c.1996C&gt;T (p.Arg666?), c.2632G&gt;T (p.Glu878?), and c.2738_2761del (p.Arg913_Glu920del). Functional tests suggest that each disease genotype might retain some ARHGEF18 activity, such that the phenotype described here is not the consequence of nullizygosity. In particular, the p.Thr270Ala missense variant affects a highly conserved residue in the DBL homology domain, which is required for the interaction and activation of RHOA. Previously, knock-out of Arhgef18 in the medaka fish has been shown to cause larval lethality which is preceded by retinal defects that resemble those seen in zebrafish Crumbs complex knock-outs. The findings described here emphasize the peculiar sensitivity of the retina to perturbations of this pathway, which is highlighted as a target for potential therapeutic strategies.

28334956	20170324	PRUNE is crucial for normal brain development and mutated in microcephaly with neurodevelopmental impairment.	PRUNE is a member of the DHH (Asp-His-His) phosphoesterase protein superfamily of molecules important for cell motility, and implicated in cancer progression. Here we investigated multiple families from Oman, India, Iran and Italy with individuals affected by a new autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental and degenerative disorder in which the cardinal features include primary microcephaly and profound global developmental delay. Our genetic studies identified biallelic mutations of PRUNE1 as responsible. Our functional assays of disease-associated variant alleles revealed impaired microtubule polymerization, as well as cell migration and proliferation properties, of mutant PRUNE. Additionally, our studies also highlight a potential new role for PRUNE during microtubule polymerization, which is essential for the cytoskeletal rearrangements that occur during cellular division and proliferation. Together these studies define PRUNE as a molecule fundamental for normal human cortical development and define cellular and clinical consequences associated with PRUNE mutation. 	Brain	D016428

28256248	20170304	Whole-Exome Sequencing Identifies a Novel Mutation of Desmocollin 2 in a Chinese Family With Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy.	Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a rare heart disorder characterized by myocyte loss and fibro-fatty tissue replacement. With the progress of ARVC, patient can present serious ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure, and even sudden cardiac death. Previous studies have revealed that the generation and development of ARVC are related to structural changes of desmosomes. To date, at least 5 genes associated with desmosomes have been identified in patients with ARVC, including Desmoplakin, Plakophilin 2, Desmoglein 2, Desmocollin 2, and Junction plakoglobin. In this study, we applied whole-exome sequencing to explore the potential causative gene in a Chinese family with suspicious ARVC. A novel missense mutation (c.1090 G &gt; A/p.V364 M) of DSC2 was identified and co-segregated with the affected family members. This mutation leads to a substitution of valine by methionine and is predicted to be damaging by bioinformatics tools. In conclusion, our study not only expands the spectrum of DSC2 mutations and contributes to genetic counseling of families with ARVC but also improves the awareness of pathogenesis in Chinese patients with ARVC.

28374019	20170405	CNTNAP1 mutations cause CNS hypomyelination and neuropathy with or without arthrogryposis.	To explore the phenotypic spectrum and pathophysiology of human disease deriving from mutations in theCNTNAP1gene. In a field study on consanguineous Palestinian families, we identified 3 patients carrying homozygous mutations in theCNTNAP1gene using whole-exome sequencing. An unrelated Irish family was detected by screening the GENESIS database for furtherCNTNAP1mutations. Neurophysiology, MRI, and nerve biopsy including electron microscopy were performed for deep phenotyping. We identified 3 novelCNTNAP1mutations in 5 patients from 2 families: c.2015G&gt;A:p.(Trp672*) in a homozygous state in family 1 and c.2011C&gt;T:p.(Gln671*) in a compound heterozygous state with c.2290C&gt;T:p.(Arg764Cys) in family 2. Affected patients suffered from a severe CNS disorder with hypomyelinating leukodystrophy and peripheral neuropathy of sensory-motor type. Arthrogryposis was present in 2 patients but absent in 3 patients. Brain MRI demonstrated severe hypomyelination and secondary cerebral and cerebellar atrophy as well as a mega cisterna magna and corpus callosum hypoplasia. Nerve biopsy revealed very distinct features with lack of transverse bands at the paranodes and widened paranodal junctional gaps. CNTNAP1 mutations have recently been linked to patients with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. However, we show that arthrogryposis is not an obligate feature.CNTNAP1-related disorders are foremost severe hypomyelinating disorders of the CNS and the peripheral nervous system. The pathology is partly explained by the involvement of CNTNAP1 in the proper formation and preservation of paranodal junctions and partly by the assumed role of CNTNAP1 as a key regulator in the development of the cerebral cortex.

28112733	20170124	Site-specific mapping of the human SUMO proteome reveals co-modification with phosphorylation.	Small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) are post-translational modifications (PTMs) that regulate nuclear cellular processes. Here we used an augmented K0-SUMO proteomics strategy to identify 40,765 SUMO acceptor sites and quantify their fractional contribution for 6,747 human proteins. Structural-predictive analyses revealed that lysines residing in disordered regions are preferentially targeted by SUMO, in notable contrast to other widespread lysine modifications. In our data set, we identified 807 SUMOylated peptides that were co-modified by phosphorylation, along with dozens of SUMOylated peptides that were co-modified by ubiquitylation, acetylation and methylation. Notably, 9% of the identified SUMOylome occurred proximal to phosphorylation, and numerous SUMOylation sites were found to be fully dependent on prior phosphorylation events. SUMO-proximal phosphorylation occurred primarily in a proline-directed manner, and inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases dynamically affected co-modification. Collectively, we present a comprehensive analysis of the SUMOylated proteome, uncovering the structural preferences for SUMO and providing system-wide evidence for a remarkable degree of cross-talk between SUMOylation and other major PTMs. 	Nat._Struct._Mol._Biol.

28132690	20170131	Mutations in EXTL3 Cause Neuro-immuno-skeletal Dysplasia Syndrome.	EXTL3 regulates the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), important for both skeletal development and hematopoiesis, through the formation of HS proteoglycans (HSPGs). By whole-exome sequencing, we identified homozygous missense mutations c.1382C&gt;T, c.1537C&gt;T, c.1970A&gt;G, and c.2008T&gt;G in EXTL3 in nine affected individuals from five unrelated families. Notably, we found the identical homozygous missense mutation c.1382C&gt;T (p.Pro461Leu) in four affected individuals from two unrelated families. Affected individuals presented with variable skeletal abnormalities and neurodevelopmental defects. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with a complete absence of T cells was observed in three families. EXTL3 was most abundant in hematopoietic stem cells and early progenitor T cells, which is in line with a SCID phenotype at the level of early T cell development in the thymus. To provide further support for the hypothesis that mutations in EXTL3 cause a neuro-immuno-skeletal dysplasia syndrome, and to gain insight into the pathogenesis of the disorder, we analyzed the localization of EXTL3 in fibroblasts derived from affected individuals and determined glycosaminoglycan concentrations in these cells as well as in urine and blood. We observed abnormal glycosaminoglycan concentrations and increased concentrations of the non-sulfated chondroitin disaccharide D0a0 and the disaccharide D0a4 in serum and urine of all analyzed affected individuals. In summary, we show that biallelic mutations in EXTL3 disturb glycosaminoglycan synthesis and thus lead to a recognizable syndrome characterized by variable expression of skeletal, neurological, and immunological abnormalities.

27234031	20160529	Improved diagnostic yield of neuromuscular disorders applying clinical exome sequencing in patients arising from a consanguineous population.	Neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) include a broad range of disorders affecting muscles, nerves and neuromuscular junctions. Their overlapping phenotypes and heterogeneous genetic nature have created challenges in diagnosis which calls for the implementation of massive parallel sequencing as a candidate strategy to increase the diagnostic yield. In this study, total of 45 patients, mostly offspring of consanguineous marriages were examined using whole exome sequencing. Data analysis was performed to identify the most probable pathogenic rare variants in known NMD genes which led to identification of causal variants for 33 out of 45 patients (73.3%) in the following known genes: CAPN3, Col6A1, Col6A3, DMD, DYSF, FHL1, GJB1, ISPD, LAMA2, LMNA, PLEC1, RYR1, SGCA, SGCB, SYNE1, TNNT1 and 22 novel pathogenic variants were detected. Today, the advantage of whole exome sequencing in clinical diagnostic strategies of heterogeneous disorders is clear. In this cohort, a diagnostic yield of 73.3% was achieved which is quite high compared to the overall reported diagnostic yield of 25% to 50%. This could be explained by the consanguineous background of these patients and is another strong advantage of offering clinical exome sequencing in diagnostic laboratories, especially in populations with high rate of consanguinity.
