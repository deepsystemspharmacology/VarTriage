9205127	19970615	Isolation and chromosomal localization of GPR31, a human gene encoding a putative G protein-coupled receptor.	The screening of a human genomic library with a chemokine receptor-like probe allowed us to obtain a putative member of the G protein-coupled receptor gene (GPCR) family, designated GPR31. Its deduced amino acid sequence encodes a polypeptide of 319 amino acids that shares 25-33% homology with members of the chemokine, purino, and somatostatin receptor gene families. Amino acid sequence comparison reveals that the best match in the protein databases is with the human orphan GPCR called HM74 (33% identity). Southern genomic analysis of the GPR31 gene shows a hybridization pattern consistent with that of a single-copy gene. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we have determined the chromosomal and regional localization of the GPR31 gene at 6q27. The GPR31 mRNA is expressed at low levels by several human cell lines of different cellular origins. The phylogenetic analysis suggests that the GPR31 receptor may represent a member of a new GPCR subfamily. 	Genomics	D016428 D013485
12082049	20020626	Familial isolated hyperCKaemia associated with a new mutation in the caveolin-3 (CAV-3) gene.	An 18 year old man and his mother both presented with persistent, isolated raised serum creatine kinase (hyperCKaemia) without muscle symptoms. Analysis of caveolin-3 protein expression in muscle biopsy of the propositus showed a reduction in the protein. Genetic analysis revealed a new heterozygous mutation in the caveolin-3 (CAV-3) gene: a C--&gt;T transition at nucleotide position 83 in exon 1 leading to a substitution of a proline for a leucine at amino acid position 28 (P28L). This is the first pathogenic mutation in the CAV-3 gene associated with isolated familial hyperCKaemia. It expands the genetic heterogeneity in patients with caveolin-3 deficiency and confirms that caveolin-3 deficiency should be considered in the differential diagnosis of isolated hyperCKaemia.

10630424	20000112	The utilization of alanine, glutamic acid, and serine as amino acid substrates for glycine N-acyltransferase.	The conjugation of benzoyl-CoA with the aliphatic and acidic amino acids by glycine N-acyltransferase, as well as the amides of the latter group, was investigated. Bovine and human liver benzoyl-amino acid conjugation were investigated using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS-MS). Bovine glycine N-acyltransferase catalyzed conjugation of benzoyl-CoA with Gly (Km(Gly) = 6.2 mM), Asn (Km(Asn) = 129 mM), Gln (Km(Gln) = 353 mM), Ala (Km(Ala) = 1573 mM), Glu (Km(Glu) = 1148 mM) as well as Ser in a sequential mechanism. In the case of the human form, conjugation with Gly (Km(Gly) = 6.4 mM), Ala (Km(Ala) = 997 mM), and Glu was detected. The presence of these alternative conjugates did not inhibit bovine glycine N-acyltransferase activity significantly. Considering the relatively low levels at which these conjugates are formed, it is unlikely that they will have a significant contribution to acyl-amino acid conjugation under normal conditions in vivo. However, their cumulative contribution to acyl-amino acid conjugation under metabolic disease states may prove to have a useful contribution to detoxification of elevated acyl-CoAs.

20159111	20100218	Next-generation sequencing of a 40 Mb linkage interval reveals TSPAN12 mutations in patients with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy.	Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is a genetically heterogeneous retinal disorder characterized by abnormal vascularisation of the peripheral retina, often accompanied by retinal detachment. To date, mutations in three genes (FZD4, LRP5, and NDP) have been shown to be causative for FEVR. In two large Dutch pedigrees segregating autosomal-dominant FEVR, genome-wide SNP analysis identified an FEVR locus of approximately 40 Mb on chromosome 7. Microsatellite marker analysis suggested similar at risk haplotypes in patients of both families. To identify the causative gene, we applied next-generation sequencing in the proband of one of the families, by analyzing all exons and intron-exon boundaries of 338 genes, in addition to microRNAs, noncoding RNAs, and other highly conserved genomic regions in the 40 Mb linkage interval. After detailed bioinformatic analysis of the sequence data, prioritization of all detected sequence variants led to three candidates to be considered as the causative genetic defect in this family. One of these variants was an alanine-to-proline substitution in the transmembrane 4 superfamily member 12 protein, encoded by TSPAN12. This protein has very recently been implicated in regulating the development of retinal vasculature, together with the proteins encoded by FZD4, LRP5, and NDP. Sequence analysis of TSPAN12 revealed two mutations segregating in five of 11 FEVR families, indicating that mutations in TSPAN12 are a relatively frequent cause of FEVR. Furthermore, we demonstrate the power of targeted next-generation sequencing technology to identify disease genes in linkage intervals. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
12038791	20020601	A novel polymorphism, 70Leu/Phe, disrupts a consensus Leu residue within the leucine-rich repeat sequence of platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha.	Platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib/IX/V complex mediates high-shear dependent platelet activation through an interaction with the von Willebrand factor (vWF). All four subunits of the complex have a structural motif, the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) sequence, with leucines in conserved positions. Here we report a new polymorphism, Leu/Phe at residue 70 of GPIbalpha, which disrupts the consensus sequence of the LRR in the vWF binding domain. Genotype frequencies among 142 healthy Japanese subjects were 92.3%, 7.7%, and 0.0%, for the 70Leu/Leu, 70Leu/Phe, and 75Phe/Phe genotypes, respectively. Ristocetin-induced or shear-induced platelet aggregation was not significantly different between the 70Leu/Leu and 70Leu/Phe genotypes. In in vitro studies, a recombinant GPIbalpha fragment with 70Phe (L70F) as compared to that with 70Leu (WT) had low reactivity to anti-GPIbalpha monoclonal antibodies, GUR20-5 and Hip1, both of which recognize conformation-specific epitopes within the 45-kDa domain. Ristocetin-induced 125I-vWF binding to L70F, however, did not differ from that to WT. 	Thromb._Haemost.	D016428
12381896	20021017	Four novel mutations in the PITX2 gene in patients with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome.	Mutational screening and sequence analysis of the PITX2 gene was performed in four families previously diagnosed with Rieger syndrome. The results of this analysis identified four novel mutations within the coding sequence of PITX2. These mutations were not identified in the sequence of 50 control individuals. Two mutations were found in the homeobox and would be expected to result in nonconservative amino acid changes within the second and third helixes. The remaining two mutations were found in the region downstream of the homeobox and are also predicted to result in missense mutations. In conclusion, mutations within the homeobox sequence and the adjacent coding sequence of PITX2 lead to various Rieger syndrome phenotypes characterized by a high incidence of glaucoma.

7705836	19950401	Molecular basis and PCR-DNA typing of the Fya/fyb blood group polymorphism.	The Duffy blood group antigens are carried by the erythrocyte membrane glycoprotein gpD, which has a molecular weight of 35-45 kDa and which has been recently cloned. In this report, we have determined, at the nucleic acid level, the molecular basis for the blood group Fya/Fyb polymorphism. The gpD cDNAs isolated by reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from Fy(a+b-) and Fy(a-b+) donors differed by only one base substitution (G131A) changing Gly to Asp at position 44 of the gpD protein. When expressed in simian Cos-7 cells, the Gy(a+b-) and Fy(a-b+) gpD cDNA produce cell surface proteins that react with the anti-Fya and anti-Fyb antisera, respectively, demonstrating that they represent the FY*A and FY*B alleles of the Duffy blood group locus. The G131A nucleotide substitution has been correlated with a BanI restriction site polymorphism, which has allowed us to develop a method for the DNA typing of the main Duffy blood group antigens, by means of PCR/restriction fragment length polymorphisms.

9751798	19980930	Restricted tissue expression pattern of a novel human rasGAP-related gene and its murine ortholog.	The mammalian rasGAPs constitute a group of widely expressed proteins involved in the negative regulation of ras-mediated signaling. In this study we have isolated a novel human gene, RASAL (Ras GTPase-activating-like) and its murine ortholog, MRASAL which are most similar to the GAP1 family of rasGAP proteins, based upon the presence and organization of specific conserved domains. Full-length human and murine mRNA sequences are predicted to encode 804 and 799 amino acid polypeptides, respectively. Sequence analysis of these two proteins revealed the presence of two N-terminal calcium-dependent phospholipid binding C2 domains, a conserved GAP related domain (GRD) and a C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Northern blot and mRNA in situ hybridization analyses indicate that RASAL, in contrast to other mammalian rasGAP proteins, has a limited expression pattern; RASAL is highly expressed in the follicular cells of the thyroid and the adrenal medulla and expressed at lower levels in brain, spinal cord and trachea. Human RASAL has been localized by radiation hybrid mapping to chromosome 12q23-24. 	Gene	D016428 D013487
10802661	20000510	Mutation of a gene encoding a putative chaperonin causes McKusick-Kaufman syndrome.	McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (MKKS, MIM 236700) is a human developmental anomaly syndrome comprising hydrometrocolpos (HMC), postaxial polydactyly (PAP) and congenital heart disease (CHD). MKKS has been mapped in the Old Order Amish population to 20p12, between D20S162 and D20S894 (ref. 3). Here we describe the identification of a gene mutated in MKKS. We analysed the approximately 450-kb candidate region by sample sequencing, which revealed the presence of several known genes and EST clusters. We evaluated candidate transcripts by northern-blot analysis of adult and fetal tissues. We selected one transcript with widespread expression, MKKS, for analysis in a patient from the Amish pedigree and a sporadic, non-Amish case. The Old Order Amish patient was found to be homozygous for an allele that had two missense substitutions and the non-Amish patient was a compound heterozygote for a frameshift mutation predicting premature protein truncation and a distinct missense mutation. The MKKS predicted protein shows amino acid similarity to the chaperonin family of proteins, suggesting a role for protein processing in limb, cardiac and reproductive system development. We believe that this is the first description of a human disorder caused by mutations affecting a putative chaperonin molecule. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428
1847055	19910131	A 17-bp insertion and a Phe215----Cys missense mutation in the dihydrolipoyl transacylase (E2) mRNA from a thiamine-responsive maple syrup urine disease patient WG-34.	We have amplified the cDNA for the transacylase (E2) subunit of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKAD) complex from a thiamine-responsive MSUD cell line (WG-34) by the polymerase chain reaction. Sequencing of the amplified WG-34 cDNA showed a 17-bp insertion (AAATACCTTGTTACCAG) apparently resulting from an aberrant splicing of the E2 gene, and a missense (T----G) mutation that changes Phe215 to Cys in the E2 subunit. The existence of these two mutations was confirmed by probing the amplified E2 cDNA or genomic DNA with allele-specific oligonucleotides. The above results support the thesis that the thiamine-responsive MSUD patient (WG-34) is a compound heterozygote at the E2 locus. The implication of the E2 mutations for the thiamine-responsiveness observed in this patient is discussed. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.	D016428 D013485 D013487
7633419	19950401	Rapid isolation and characterization of 118 novel C2H2-type zinc finger cDNAs expressed in human brain.	C2H2-type zinc finger genes comprise one of the largest gene families in the human genome. These proteins are involved in genetic regulation and development and are quite conserved throughout evolution. The finger domains commonly contain the small linker peptide TGEKP between some finger units. Here, we report the isolation of 133 human zinc finger cDNAs, of which 118 are novel. These clones were isolated from human brain cDNA libraries using oligonucleotide hybridization followed by expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis, sequencing from the conserved linker region using degenerate oligonucleotide primers. This directed partial sequencing approach to cDNA isolation and characterization, signature sequencing, combines the speed of EST automatic sequencing with the focus of specific cDNA family analysis. Signature sequencing minimizes the generation of less informative random EST sequences and provides a unique relative position for sequence comparison. We also show that there is an even distribution of these RNAs from this brain cDNA library, and that these cDNAs contain N-terminal domains found in other zinc finger genes. This rapid focused sequencing approach should be applicable to any family of cDNAs containing short conserved signature peptide sequences. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428
9768693	19981013	Systematic mutation screening of the pro-opiomelanocortin gene: identification of several genetic variants including three different insertions, one nonsense and two missense point mutations in probands of different weight extremes.	Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) is the precursor of melanocortins (adrenocorticotropin: ACTH, beta-endorphin, beta-lipotropin: beta-LPH, corticotropin like intermediate peptide, alpha-, beta- and gamma-melanocyte-stimulating hormone: alpha-, beta- and gamma-MSH) some of which act in the brain to reduce food intake and are potential mediators of leptin action. Recently, three different mutations in the POMC gene (POMC) were identified in two unrelated children that lead to early-onset extreme obesity, adrenal insufficiency, and red hair pigmentation. In the present study we systematically screened the coding region of POMC in 96 extremely obese children and adolescents, 60 healthy underweight individuals and 46 patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and identified several variants. a) A 9 and an 18 base pair insertion (9bp and 18bp: AGC AGC GGC and AGC AGC GGC AGC AGC GGC, respectively, between codon 73 and 74; 1,2). These in-frame variants lead to the insertion of three or six amino acids (Ser-Ser-Gly; Ser-Ser-Gly-Ser-Ser-Gly) carboxy-terminal to gamma-MSH. Frequencies of the 9bp insertion allele varied between 3 and 5% among the different study groups (Pearson's chi2 P&gt;0.5). b) Both an out-of-frame 6 bp insertion (within codon 176: GGG CCC) leading to the insertion of two amino acids (Arg-Ala) and a premature stop-codon (G-7316-T: Glu-180-Stop) within the gamma-LPH sequence were maternally inherited in an obese female proband. This proband inherited another missense mutation from her father (Glu-188-Gly). c) A missense mutation (G-7016-A; Asp-80-Asn) was observed in a single patient with AN who also harboured the 9bp insertion on a paternally derived haplotype. d) The allelic co-occurence of two silent mutations (C-6982-T and C-7285-T) was detected in two obese subjects. e) Two further silent mutations (C-3832-T; C-7111-G) were detected in an underweight and an obese subject, respectively. We conclude that the POMC gene harbors several different polymorphisms and mutations, none of which can readily be associated with the phenotypes under study. 	J._Clin._Endocrinol._Metab.

3034889	19870525	Delineation of the intronless nature of the genes for the human and hamster beta 2-adrenergic receptor and their putative promoter regions.	The beta 2-adrenergic receptor is the first adenylate cyclase-coupled receptor to be cloned. We provide here a detailed characterization of its complete gene in both the human and hamster which reveals several unusual and provocative features. The genes are present in a single copy, are intronless, and are bounded by homologous 18-bp (base pair) direct repeats. These findings suggest that the beta 2-adrenergic receptor may have arisen as a processed gene for another related gene. Genomic Southern blots done at reduced stringency in fact reveal additional weak signals. The human and hamster gene sequences 5' to the principal site of transcription initiation are highly homologous and share many characteristics of promoters for housekeeping genes. Moreover, there is present in the human genome a long (777 bp) open reading frame which is in frame with the beta-adrenergic receptor coding block and which ends only 234 bp 5' to the initiator methionine of the receptor. An unusual cDNA has been found, transcribed from a putative second more 5' promoter which contains the 5' half of the beta-adrenergic receptor as well as 1065-bp 5' to the receptor coding region, including the entire upstream long open reading frame (sufficient to encode a putative protein of Mr approximately 28,000).

1684614	19911101	Phospholipase C-delta gene of the spontaneously hypertensive rat harbors point mutations causing amino acid substitutions in a catalytic domain.	This study was undertaken in order to investigate the newly discovered spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR)-specific restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) at the genomic locus of (poly)phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC)-delta at a DNA sequence level. Our aim was to clone the PLC-delta complimentary DNA (cDNA) from SHR and analyse the genomic DNA obtained from two hypertensive rat strains such as SHR and its stroke-prone substrain (SHR-SP) and three normotensive rat strains such as Sprague-Dawley, Donryu and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) by preparing an aortic cDNA library of SHR, hybridization cloning of PLC-delta cDNA and an analysis of the genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction. By digesting with restriction enzyme XhoI, we discovered an RFLP band displaying only in SHR and SHR-SP, not in Sprague-Dawley, Donryu and WKY rats. DNA sequencing of PLC-delta cDNA cloned from an aortic cDNA library of SHR revealed a total of three SHR-specific point mutations, two of which resulted in amino acid substitutions. The first point mutation (A to T) was detected at the XhoI site, changing a threonine(ACG) to a serine(TCG), and the second point mutation (A to G) was discovered in the vicinity of the first one, changing an isoleucine(ATA) to a methionine(ATG). This is the first demonstration of the mutations in the SHR genome changing amino acid sequences. These amino acid substitutions, situated in the putative catalytic X domain of PLC-delta, may be the major cause of the augmented PLC activity observed in the SHR, possibly leading to hypertension-related phenonemoma such as abnormal calcium homeostasis and increased intracellular calcium ion concentrations.

12920575	20030816	Novel mutations in the IRF6 gene for Van der Woude syndrome.	Van der Woude syndrome (VWS, OMIM 119300) is an autosomal dominant craniofacial disorder characterized by pits of the lower lip, hypodontia, and cleft lip and/or cleft palate. It is the most common form of syndromic orofacial clefting and has very high penetrance with varied expressivity. The disease locus for VWS has been mapped to a 1.6-cM region on 1q32-41 between D1S205 and D1S491. Recently, mutations have been found in the interferon regulatory factor 6 ( IRF6) gene in patients with VWS and popliteal pterygium syndrome. To identify novel mutations of IRF6 in VWS patients, we screened four Chinese VWS families in all nine exons and their flanking splice junctions by direct sequencing. We identified three missense mutations and one nonsense mutation in IRF6. Our study further confirmed that IRF6 is essential for craniofacial development. 	Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
9482737	19980418	The Arabidopsis gene MONOPTEROS encodes a transcription factor mediating embryo axis formation and vascular development.	The vascular tissues of flowering plants form networks of interconnected cells throughout the plant body. The molecular mechanisms directing the routes of vascular strands and ensuring tissue continuity within the vascular system are not known, but are likely to depend on general cues directing plant cell orientation along the apical-basal axis. Mutations in the Arabidopsis gene MONOPTEROS (MP) interfere with the formation of vascular strands at all stages and also with the initiation of the body axis in the early embryo. Here we report the isolation of the MP gene by positional cloning. The predicted protein product contains functional nuclear localization sequences and a DNA binding domain highly similar to a domain shown to bind to control elements of auxin inducible promoters. During embryogenesis, as well as organ development, MP is initially expressed in broad domains that become gradually confined towards the vascular tissues. These observations suggest that the MP gene has an early function in the establishment of vascular and body patterns in embryonic and post-embryonic development. 	EMBO_J.	D016428 D013485
16799052	20060627	Prevalence of disease-causing mutations in families with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa: a screen of known genes in 200 families.	To survey families with clinical evidence of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) for mutations in genes known to cause adRP. Two hundred adRP families, drawn from a cohort of more than 400 potential families, were selected by analysis of pedigrees. Minimum criteria for inclusion in the adRP cohort included either evidence of at least three generations of affected individuals or two generations with evidence of male-to-male transmission. Probands from each family were screened for mutations in 13 genes known to cause adRP: CA4, CRX, FSCN2, IMPDH1, NRL, PRPF3 (RP18), PRPF8 (RP13), PRPF31 (RP11), RDS, RHO, ROM1, RP1, and RP9. Families without mutations in autosomal genes and in which an X-linked mode of inheritance could not be excluded were tested for mutations in ORF 15 of X-linked RPGR. Potentially pathogenic variants were evaluated based on a variety of genetic and computational criteria, to confirm or exclude pathogenicity. A total of 82 distinct, rare (nonpolymorphic) variants were detected among the genes tested. Of these, 57 are clearly pathogenic based on multiple criteria, 10 are probably pathogenic, and 15 are probably benign. In the cohort of 200 families, 94 (47%) have one of the clearly pathogenic variants and 10 (5%) have one of the probably pathogenic variants. One family (0.5%) has digenic RDS-ROM1 mutations. Two families (1%) have a pathogenic RPGR mutation, indicating that families with apparent autosomal transmission of RP may actually have X-linked genetic disease. Thus, 107 families (53.5%) have mutations in known genes, leaving 93 whose underlying cause is still unknown. Together, the known adRP genes account for retinal disease in approximately half of the families in this survey, mostly Americans of European origin. Among the adRP genes, IMPDH1, PRPF8, PRPF31, RDS, RHO, and RP1 each accounts for more than 2% of the total; CRX, PRPF3, and RPGR each accounts for roughly 1%. Disease-causing mutations were not found in CA4, FSCN2, NRL, or RP9. Because some mutations are frequent and some regions are more likely to harbor mutations than others, more than two thirds of the detected mutations can be found by screening less than 10% of the total gene sequences. Among the remaining families, mutations may lie in regions of known genes that were not tested, mutations may not be detectable by PCR-based sequencing, or other loci may be involved.

18204051	20080122	A common SNP of MCPH1 is associated with cranial volume variation in Chinese population.	Microcephaly (MCPH) genes are informative in understanding the genetics and evolution of human brain volume. MCPH1 and abnormal spindle-like MCPH associated (ASPM) are the two known MCPH causing genes that were suggested undergone recent positive selection in human populations. However, previous studies focusing only on the two tag single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) of MCPH1 and ASPM failed to detect any correlation between gene polymorphisms and variations of brain volume and cognitive abilities. We conducted an association study on eight common SNPs of MCPH1 and ASPM in a Chinese population of 867 unrelated individuals. We demonstrate that a non-synonymous SNP (rs1057090, V761A in BRCA1 C-terminus (BRCT) domain) of MCPH1 other than the two known tag SNPs is significantly associated with cranial volume in Chinese males. The haplotype analysis confirmed the association of rs1057090 with cranial volume, and the homozygote males containing the derived alleles of rs1057090 have larger cranial volumes compared with those containing the ancestral alleles. No recent selection signal can be detected on this SNP, suggesting that the brain volume variation in human populations is likely neutral or under very weak selection in recent human history.

We have isolated a cDNA for a novel human amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel isoform (called delta) which is expressed mainly in brain, pancreas, testis, and ovary. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, it generates an amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel with biophysical and pharmacological properties distinct from those of the epithelial Na+ channel, a multimeric assembly of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. The Na+ current produced by the new delta isoform is increased by two orders of magnitude after coexpression of the beta and gamma subunit of the epithelial Na+ channel showing that delta can associate with other subunits and is part of a novel multisubunit ion channel.

8243830	19931201	Ala1048--&gt;Asp mutation in the kinase domain of insulin receptor causes defective kinase activity and insulin resistance.	We identified a heterozygous missense mutation that substituted aspartic acid (GAC) for alanine (GCC) at codon 1048 of the insulin receptor gene in a patient who displayed typical symptoms of Type A syndrome of insulin resistance. The proband's mother and younger brother were also found to be heterozygous for the mutation. We constructed the identified mutant insulin receptor cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis, transfected the mutant cDNA into COS 7 cells, and found that kinase activity of the mutant insulin receptors was markedly impaired. Ala1048 is located in the kinase domain of the insulin receptor beta-subunit and is conserved in most of protein-tyrosine kinases. Besides, neighboring Glu1047 is invariant in all protein kinases and is thought to be involved in interaction with ATP. Photoaffinity labeling of the mutant insulin receptor with ATP analogue, 8-azido (alpha-32P)ATP was not influenced by the mutation, suggesting that the mutation did not inhibit ATP binding but possibly interfered with subsequent phosphoryl transfer. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of exogenous substrate by partially purified insulin receptors prepared from COS 7 cells that were cotransfected with wild-type and mutant insulin receptor cDNAs was markedly impaired, whereas autophosphorylation was decreased by approximately 50% of wild-type receptors. These results indicated that the identified heterozygous substitution of Asp for Ala1048 in insulin receptor was responsible for insulin resistance of this patient. 	Diabetes	D002363 D016428 D013485
8946682	19961001	NK cell receptor gene of the KIR family with two IG domains but highest homology to KIR receptors with three IG domains.	The killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIRs) are surface glycoproteins expressed by natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells. They recognize polymorphic human HLA class I molecules. Two families of KIRs have been identified and named p58 and p70. The p58 family of genes encode type I membrane proteins with two extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, while the p70 genes have three Ig domains. We here report the cloning and characterization of a novel KIR cDNA obtained from tumor cell lines with NK reactivity (YT and NK-92). This gene is also expressed in the normal cell line NK 3.3 and in NK cells obtained from some but not all normal donors. The clone, KIR103AS, has an open reading frame consistent with a KIR with two extracellular Ig domains, a transmembrane region and a 114 amino acid long cytoplasmic domain containing a single src homology 2 (SH2) binding motif. The membrane distal Ig domain of KIR103AS has highest homology with the first Ig domain of p70 KIRs and differs significantly from the first Ig domain of p58 KIRs. The second, membrane proximal Ig domain of KIR103AS has similar and high homology with the membrane proximal Ig domains of both p70 and p58 KIRs. The extracellular domains of KIR103AS therefore share characteristic features with both p70 and p58 genes: the domain structure is identical to p58 KIRs but the sequence homology matches closely with p70 KIRs. The putative transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are distinctly different from all previously reported KIR cDNAs. 	Tissue_Antigens	D016428 D013485 D013487
2839839	19880701	Single base mutation in the pro alpha 2(I) collagen gene that causes efficient splicing of RNA from exon 27 to exon 29 and synthesis of a shortened but in-frame pro alpha 2(I) chain.	Previous observations demonstrated that a lethal variant of osteogenesis imperfecta had two altered alleles for pro alpha 2(I) chains of type I procollagen. One mutation produced a nonfunctioning allele in that there was synthesis of mRNA but no detectable synthesis of pro alpha 2(I) chains from the allele. The mutation in the other allele caused synthesis of shortened pro alpha 2(I) chains that lacked most or all of the 18 amino acids encoded by exon 28. Subclones of the pro alpha 2(I) gene were prepared from the proband's DNA and the DNA sequence was determined for a 582-base-pair (bp) region that extended from the last 30 bp of intervening sequence 26 to the first 26 bp of intervening sequence 29. Data from six independent subclones demonstrated that all had the same sequence as a previously isolated normal clone for the pro alpha 2(I) gene except that four subclones had a single base mutation at the 3' end of intervening sequence 27. The mutation was a substitution of guanine for adenine that changed the universal consensus sequence for the 3' splicing site of RNA from -AG- to -GG-. S1 nuclease experiments demonstrated that about half the pro alpha 2(I) mRNA in the proband's fibroblasts was abnormally spliced and that the major species of abnormal pro alpha 2(I) mRNA was completely spliced from the last codon of exon 27 to the first codon of exon 29. The mutation is apparently unique among RNA splicing mutations of mammalian systems in producing a shortened polypeptide chain that is in-frame in terms of coding sequences, that is used in the subunit assembly of a protein, and that contributes to a lethal phenotype.

21070897	20101113	Mutations in FLVCR1 cause posterior column ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa.	The study of inherited retinal diseases has advanced our knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in sensory neural signaling. Dysfunction of two specific sensory modalities, vision and proprioception, characterizes the phenotype of the rare, autosomal-recessive disorder posterior column ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (PCARP). Using targeted DNA capture and high-throughput sequencing, we analyzed the entire 4.2 Mb candidate sequence on chromosome 1q32 to find the gene mutated in PCARP in a single family. Employing comprehensive bioinformatic analysis and filtering, we identified a single-nucleotide coding variant in the feline leukemia virus subgroup C cellular receptor 1 (FLVCR1), a gene encoding a heme-transporter protein. Sanger sequencing confirmed the FLVCR1 mutation in this family and identified different homozygous missense mutations located within the protein's transmembrane channel segment in two other unrelated families with PCARP. To determine whether the selective pathologic features of PCARP correlated with FLVCR1 expression, we examined wild-type mouse Flvcr1 mRNA levels in the posterior column of the spinal cord and the retina via quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR. The Flvcr1 mRNA levels were most abundant in the retina, followed by the posterior column of the spinal cord and other brain regions. These results suggest that aberrant FLVCR1 causes a selective degeneration of a subpopulation of neurons in the retina and the posterior columns of the spinal cord via dysregulation of heme or iron homeostasis. This finding broadens the molecular basis of sensory neural signaling to include common mechanisms that involve proprioception and vision. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D052060 D013485
12663448	20030329	A novel missense mutation in the gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase catalytic subunit gene causes both decreased enzymatic activity and glutathione production.	Gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis: the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent ligation of glutamate and cysteine. gamma-GCS consists of a catalytic (gamma-GCSH) and modifier (gamma-GCSL) subunit. Hereditary deficiency of gamma-GCS has been reported in a small number of patients and is associated with low erythrocyte levels of gamma-GCS and GSH leading to hemolytic anemia. Here we report a novel gamma-GCSH mutation, isolated from the cDNA of 2 related patients diagnosed with gamma-GCS deficiency. Each was found to be homozygous for a C&gt;T missense mutation at nucleotide 379, encoding for a predicted Arg127Cys amino acid change. Computerized structure modeling identified that the mutated amino acid lies within a cleft on the protein surface of gamma-GCSH, and the border of this cleft was shown to contain Cys249, an evolutionarily conserved residue that has been proven to lie near the binding site of gamma-GCSH. Transfection studies showed that the mutation is associated with decreased GSH production, and binding studies using purified recombinant protein showed that the mutant protein has markedly decreased enzymatic activity compared to wild type.

19857465	20091028	Neucrin is a novel neural-specific secreted antagonist to canonical Wnt signaling.	A gene encoding a novel secreted protein in mice and humans was identified, and named Neucrin. Mouse Neucrin consists of 343 amino acids with a cysteine-rich domain in its carboxyl terminal region. The positions of 10 cysteine residues in the cysteine-rich domain are similar to those of Dickkopfs (Dkks), secreted Wnt antagonists. However, whereas Dkks have two cysteine-rich domains, Neucrin has only one. Neucrin as well as Dkks bound to LDL receptor-related protein 6 and inhibited the stabilization of cytosolic beta-catenin, indicating that Neucrin is an antagonist of canonical Wnt signaling. Mouse Neucrin expression was not detected in any major tissues in the adult, but was detected in developing neural tissues, including the brain and spinal cord. The expression pattern of Neucrin is distinct from that of any Dkk. Neucrin is a unique secreted Wnt antagonist that is predominantly expressed in developing neural tissues.

24319334	20131210	Mutations in the small nuclear riboprotein 200 kDa gene (SNRNP200) cause 1.6% of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.	The purpose of this project was to determine the spectrum and frequency of mutations in the small nuclear riboprotein 200 kDa gene (SNRNP200) that cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP). A well-characterized adRP cohort of 251 families was tested for mutations in the exons and intron/exon junctions of SNRNP200 using fluorescent dideoxy sequencing. An additional 21 adRP families from the eyeGENE® Network were tested for possible mutations. Bioinformatic and segregation analysis was performed on novel variants. SNRNP200 mutations were identified in seven of the families tested. Two previously reported mutations, p.Arg681Cys and p.Ser1087Leu, were found in two families each. One family had the previously reported p.Arg681His mutation. Two novel SNRNP200 variants, p.Pro682Ser and p.Ala542Val, were also identified in one family each. Bioinformatic and segregation analyses suggested that these novel variants are likely to be pathogenic. Clinical examination of patients with SNRNP200 mutations showed a wide range of clinical symptoms and severity, including one instance of non-penetrance. Mutations in SNRNP200 caused 1.6% of disease in our adRP cohort. Pathogenic mutations were found primarily in exons 16 and 25, but the novel p.Ala542Val mutation in exon 13 suggests that variation in other genetic regions is also responsible for causing dominant disease. SNRNP200 mutations were associated with a wide range of clinical symptoms similar to those of individuals with other splice-factor gene mutations. 	Mol._Vis.	D016428 D052061 D013485
25681614	20150215	Novel GAA mutations in patients with Pompe disease.	Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder linked to GAA gene that leads to a multi-system intralysosomal accumulation of glycogen. Mutation identification in the GAA gene can be very important for early diagnosis, correlation between genotype-phenotype and therapeutic intervention. For this purpose, peripheral blood from 57 individuals susceptible to Pompe disease was collected and all exons of GAA gene were amplified; the sequences and the mutations were analyzed in silico to predict possible impact on the structure and function of the human protein. In this study, 46 individuals presented 33 alterations in the GAA gene sequence, among which five (c.547-67C&gt;G, c.547-39T&gt;G, p.R437H, p.L641V and p.L705P) have not been previously described in the literature. The alterations in the coding region included 15 missense mutations, three nonsense mutations and one deletion. One insertion and other 13 single base changes were found in the non-coding region. The mutation p.G611D was found in homozygosis in a one-year-old child, who presented low levels of GAA activity, hypotonia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Two patients presented the new mutation p.L705P in association with c.-32-13T&gt;G. They had low levels of GAA activity and developed late onset Pompe disease. In our study, we observed alterations in the GAA gene originating from Asians, African-Americans and Caucasians, highlighting the high heterogeneity of the Brazilian population. Considering that Pompe disease studies are not very common in Brazil, this study will help to better understand the potential pathogenic role of each change in the GAA gene. Furthermore, a precise and early molecular analysis improves genetic counseling besides allowing for a more efficient treatment in potential candidates. 	Gene	D016428 D013485
16357040	20051217	Rapid evolution and gene-specific patterns of selection for three genes of spermatogenesis in Drosophila.	Hybrid males resulting from crosses between closely related species of Drosophila are sterile. The F1 hybrid sterility phenotype is mainly due to defects occurring during late stages of development that relate to sperm individualization, and so genes controlling sperm development may have been subjected to selective diversification between species. It is also possible that genes of spermatogenesis experience selective constraints given their role in a developmental pathway. We analyzed the molecular evolution of three genes playing a role during the sperm developmental pathway in Drosophila at an early (bam), a mid (aly), and a late (dj) stage. The complete coding region of these genes was sequenced in different strains of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans. All three genes showed rapid divergence between species, with larger numbers of nonsynonymous to synonymous differences between species than polymorphisms. Although this could be interpreted as evidence for positive selection at all three genes, formal tests of selection do not support such a conclusion. Departures from neutrality were detected only for dj and bam but not aly. The role played by selection is unique and determined by gene-specific characteristics rather than site of expression. In dj, the departure was due to a high proportion of neutral synonymous polymorphisms in D. simulans, and there was evidence of purifying selection maintaining a high lysine amino acid protein content that is characteristic of other DNA-binding proteins. The earliest spermatogenesis gene surveyed, which plays a role in both male and female gametogenesis, was bam, and its significant departure from neutrality was due to an excess of nonsynonymous substitutions between species. Bam is degraded at the end of mitosis, and rapid evolutionary changes among species might be a characteristic shared with other degradable transient proteins. However, the large number of nonsynonymous changes between D. melanogaster and D. simulans and a phylogenetic comparative analysis among species confirms evidence of positive selection driving the evolution of Bam and suggests an yet unknown germ cell line developmental adaptive change between these two species.

16289032	20051118	Identification of human and rat FAD-AMP lyase (cyclic FMN forming) as ATP-dependent dihydroxyacetone kinases.	Rat liver FAD-AMP lyase or FMN cyclase is the only known enzymatic source of the unusual flavin nucleotide riboflavin 4',5'-cyclic phosphate. To determine its molecular identity, a peptide-mass fingerprint of the purified rat enzyme was obtained. It pointed to highly related, mammalian hypothetical proteins putatively classified as dihydroxyacetone (Dha) kinases due to weaker homologies to biochemically proven Dha kinases of plants, yeasts, and bacteria. The human protein LOC26007 cDNA was used to design PCR primers. The product amplified from human brain cDNA was cloned, sequenced (GenBank Accession No. ), and found to differ from protein LOC26007 cDNA by three SNPs. Its heterologous expression yielded a protein active both as FMN cyclase and ATP-dependent Dha kinase, each activity being inhibited by the substrate(s) of the other. Cyclase and kinase activities copurified from rat liver extracts. Evidence supports that a single protein sustains both activities, probably in a single active center. Putative Dha kinases from other mammals are likely to be FMN cyclases too. Future work will profit from the availability of the structure of Citrobacter freundii Dha kinase, which contains substrate-interacting residues conserved in human Dha kinase/FMN cyclase.

15077010	20040413	Sequence analysis of bile salt export pump (ABCB11) and multidrug resistance p-glycoprotein 3 (ABCB4, MDR3) in patients with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.	Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a liver disorder associated with increased risk of intrauterine fetal death and prematurity. There is increasing evidence that genetically determined dysfunction in the canalicular ABC transporters bile salt export pump (BSEP, ABCB11) and multidrug resistance protein 3 (MDR3, ABCB4) might be risk factors for ICP development. This study aimed to (i). describe the extent of genetic variability in BSEP and MDR3 in ICP and (ii). identify new disease-causing mutations. Twenty-one women with ICP and 40 women with uneventful pregnancies were recruited between April 2001 and April 2003. Sequencing of BSEP and MDR3 spanned 8-10 kb per gene and comprised the promoter region and 100-350 bp of the flanking intronic region around each exon. DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction fragments was performed on an ABI3700 capillary sequencer. MDR3 promoter activity of promoter constructs carrying different ICP-specific mutations was studied using reporter assays. A total of 37 and 51 variant sites were detected in BSEP and MDR3, respectively. Three non-synonymous sites in codons for evolutionarily conserved amino acids were specific for the ICP collective (BSEP, N591S; MDR3, S320F and G762E). Furthermore, four ICP-specific splicing mutations were detected in MDR3 [intron 21, G(+1)A; intron 25, G(+5)C and C(-3)G; and intron 26, T(+2)A]. Activity of the mutated MDR3 promoter was similar to that observed for the wild-type promoter. Our data further support an involvement of MDR3 genetic variation in the pathogenesis of ICP, whereas analysis of BSEP sequence variation indicates that this gene is probably less important for the development of pregnancy-associated cholestasis.

7874163	19941101	CAG expansions in a novel gene for Machado-Joseph disease at chromosome 14q32.1.	We have identified a novel gene containing CAG repeats and mapped it to chromosome 14q32.1, the genetic locus for Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). In normal individuals the gene contains between 13 and 36 CAG repeats, whereas most of the clinically diagnosed patients and all of the affected members of a family with the clinical and pathological diagnosis of MJD show expansion of the repeat-number (from 68-79). Southern blot analyses and genomic cloning demonstrates the existence of related genes. These results raise the possibility that similar abnormalities in related genes may give rise to diseases similar to MJD. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D013485
18553548	20080617	Czech dysplasia: report of a large family and further delineation of the phenotype.	Czech dysplasia (OMIM 609162) is a recently delineated COL2A1 disorder characterized by early-onset progressive pseudorheumatoid arthritis, platyspondyly, short third and fourth metatarsals, normal height, and the absence of ophthalmological problems or cleft palate. Czech dysplasia is caused by a specific missense mutation (R275C, c.823C &gt; T) in the triple helical domain of the COL2A1 gene. We report on a large family with 11 patients with typical Czech dysplasia and sensorineural hearing loss. Hearing loss has hitherto not been considered as a major manifestation of Czech dysplasia. Mutation analysis documented the COL2A1 c.823C &gt; T (R275C) mutation in all affected individuals. Thus, Czech dysplasia is possibly caused exclusively by the R275C mutation, which is a unique situation among the COL2A1 disorders. The family provides further evidence for the remarkably uniform manifestation of the clinical and radiological abnormalities and adds hearing loss to the list of major anomalies of Czech dysplasia.

20825472	20100910	Clinical and genetic evaluation of DYT1 and DYT6 primary dystonia in China.	Dystonia is defined as the presence of sustained involuntary muscle contractions, often leading to abnormal posture and movement. DYT1 is caused by a mutation in the TOR1A gene, whilst mutations in THAP1 gene have been identified as responsible for DYT6. The relative frequency and phenotype differences between DYT1 and DYT6 amongst Chinese primary dystonia patients have not been well-characterized. One hundred eleven unrelated Chinese patients with primary dystonia were screened for mutations in TOR1A and THAP1 genes, and correlate this with clinical presentation. Exon 5 of TOR1A and all three exons and exon-intron conjunctions in THAP1 were screened by direct sequencing. Three subjects were found to have the GAG deletion in the TOR1A gene, and two patients were detected with THAP1 gene mutations/variations (c.224A&gt;T, c.449A&gt;C). The overall mutation frequency was 4.5% in this cohort with TOR1A mutations found in 2.7% and THAP1 mutations found in 1.8%. No mutations were detected in the controls composed of 100 normal Chinese subjects. The clinical presentations of the DYT1 cases included onset in the limbs that could progress to the generalized dystonia within several years but without cranial involvement. Whilst in the DYT6 cases, the onset was cranial or cervical and progresses very slowly. The major clinical differences between DYT1 and DYT6 dystonia in China were the cranial involvement in DYT6 and progress to general dystonia within several years in DYT1. 	Eur._J._Neurol.

11526492	20010830	Identification of AXUD1, a novel human gene induced by AXIN1 and its reduced expression in human carcinomas of the lung, liver, colon and kidney.	Axin, an important regulator of beta-catenin, is frequently mutated in human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), and transduction of the wild-type Axin gene (AXIN1) induces apoptosis in HCC cells as well as in colon cancer cells. To investigate the detailed biological function of Axin, we searched on a cDNA microarray for genes whose expression was altered by transfer of wild-type AXIN1 into colon-cancer cell line LoVo. Among the genes showing altered expression, we focused on one, termed AXUD1 (AXIN1 up-regulated), that revealed enhanced expression in response to exogenously expressed AXIN1 but not to LacZ, a control gene. The AXUD1 gene consists of five exons and encodes a transcript with an open reading frame of 1767 bp. A 3.2-kb transcript of AXUD1 was expressed in all human tissues examined, most abundantly in lung, placenta, skeletal muscle, pancreas and leukocyte. By radiation-hybrid mapping we assigned its chromosomal location at 3p22, a region where frequent loss of heterozygosity has been reported in lung, renal, prostate, breast and cervical cancers. AXUD1 was frequently down-regulated in lung, kidney, liver and colon cancers compared with their corresponding normal tissues, suggesting that AXUD1 may have a tumor-suppressor function in those organs.

14680976	20031219	Mild citrullinemia in Caucasians is an allelic variant of argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency (citrullinemia type 1).	Citrullinemia is caused by either deficiency of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS, citrullinemia type 1) or a defect of the SLC25A13 gene encoding a mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate transporter (citrullinemia type II). Citrullinemia type 1-referred to as classical citrullinemia-is characterized by largely elevated concentrations of citrulline, manifesting with acute hyperammonemic crises predominantly early in life and occurs panethnically. Citrullinemia type II is a rare multisystem-disorder nearly exclusively observed in the Japanese population and characterized by less pronounced elevations of plasma citrulline and mainly a late onset of clinical symptoms. Here, we investigated 21 citrullinemic patients (mean peak plasma citrulline 1023 micromol/l, range 152-3360), all of whom remained asymptomatic during the observation period (6-156 months). These patients were referred to as mild citrullinemia due to less striking peak citrulline concentrations or absent clinical symptoms. Extended newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry detected 15/21 patients, 4/21 patients were identified by investigation of siblings, 2/21 during metabolic work-up of unspecific neurological symptoms. We characterized the genetic defects in all affected families and found all patients affected by citrullinemia type 1 due to mutations of the ASS gene. We identified 15 different mutations, 14/15 missense and 1/15 nonsense, 6/15 were novel mutations. This is the first genetic study in a series of patients with hitherto asymptomatic citrullinemia. According to the mutations found in this study, mild citrullinemia seems to be primarily related to the human ASS gene, at least in patients of caucasian origin. 	Mol._Genet._Metab.	D016428 D013485
8422236	19930115	Cloning of a functional cDNA for human cytidine deaminase (CDD) and its use as a marker of monocyte/macrophage differentiation.	We have identified a cDNA clone for human cytidine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.5) during an investigation which aimed at cloning novel gene expression products related to monocyte/macrophage differentiation. The derived amino acid sequence of the clone comprises 145 residues yielding a molecular mass for the polypeptide of 16.1 kDa and exhibits a nearly 50% homology to cytidine deaminase from Bacillus subtilis. Cytidine deaminase activity of the cloned sequence could be demonstrated in a prokaryotic expression system. The mRNA is highly expressed in granulocytes while expression is very low in fibroblasts, chondrocytes, monocytes, and T- as well as B-cell lines. The mRNA can be induced in monocytes, the monocytoid cell line U937 and the myeloblastic line HL 60 by the differentiation inducer calcitriol. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.	D003160 D016428

10229681	19990507	Human stearoyl-CoA desaturase: alternative transcripts generated from a single gene by usage of tandem polyadenylation sites.	A critical step in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids is catalysed by stearoyl-CoA desaturase (Scd). To determine the regulation of human Scd, we characterized the gene and its transcripts. Screening a human keratinocyte cDNA library and analysis of 3'-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) products from various tissues yielded a 5.2 kb cDNA encoding a 359 amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 41.5 kDa. Analysis of 3'-RACE products suggested that alternative usage of polyadenylation sites generates two transcripts of 3.9 and 5.2 kb, a result consistent with Northern analysis. Southern analysis demonstrated the existance of two SCD loci in the human genome. Chromosomal mapping localized one locus to chromosome 10, and the second locus to chromosome 17. Characterization of genomic clones isolated from chromosome-specific libraries revealed that only the locus on chromosome 10 contained introns. Sequence analysis of the intron-less locus displayed multiple nucleotide insertions and deletions, as well as in-frame stop codons. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis performed with primers specific to the intron-less locus failed to produce a PCR product from brain, liver and skin RNA, indicating that the locus on chromosome 17 is most likely a transcriptionally inactive, fully processed pseudogene. These results suggest strongly that there is one structural SCD gene in the human genome, and that it generates two transcripts by use of alternative polyadenyation sites. Although the primary sequence and intron-exon structure of SCD is phylogenetically conserved, divergence between rodent and human is seen in the number of SCD genes and in the generation of alternative transcripts, suggesting a species-specific component of SCD regulation and function.

2153461	19900126	Genetic transfer of a functional human interferon alpha receptor into mouse cells: cloning and expression of its cDNA.	A cDNA coding for the human interferon alpha receptor has been cloned using a gene transfer approach. This consists of transferring human DNA to mouse cells and selecting for cells sensitive to human interferon alpha. The transfected cells expressed the human interferon alpha receptor, and a 5 kb human DNA was isolated from a secondary transfectant. This DNA defects an mRNA present in human cells and was used to clone a 2.7 kb cDNA from a library constructed from human Daudi cells. The sequence of the cDNA is presented. It codes for a glycoprotein of 557 amino acids with an N-terminal hydrophobic region and a single transmembrane-spanning segment. Mouse cells expressing the cDNA become sensitive to the antiviral activity of and express binding sites for human interferon alpha, demonstrating that the cloned cDNA encodes a functional human interferon alpha receptor.

9331348	19971023	Neuropilin-2, a novel member of the neuropilin family, is a high affinity receptor for the semaphorins Sema E and Sema IV but not Sema III.	Semaphorins are a large family of secreted and transmembrane proteins, several of which are implicated in repulsive axon guidance. Neuropilin (neuropilin-1) was recently identified as a receptor for Collapsin-1/Semaphorin III/D (Sema III). We report the identification of a related protein, neuropilin-2, whose mRNA is expressed by developing neurons in a pattern largely, though not completely, nonoverlapping with that of neuropilin-1. Unlike neuropilin-1, which binds with high affinity to the three structurally related semaphorins Sema III, Sema E, and Sema IV, neuropilin-2 shows high affinity binding only to Sema E and Sema IV, not Sema III. These results identify neuropilins as a family of receptors (or components of receptors) for at least one semaphorin subfamily. They also suggest that the specificity of action of different members of this subfamily may be determined by the complement of neuropilins expressed by responsive cells.

CDKN2A is a major melanoma susceptibility gene in familial malignant melanoma. In this study a novel L94Q missense mutation of the CDKN2A gene is described in a melanoma kindred with two affected second-degree family members. To detect the mutation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification methods and direct sequencing were used. The presence of the mutation was confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis after digestion of the PCR amplicons with the restriction endonuclease BspMI. The penetrance of the novel mutation was shown to be incomplete. Functional importance of the mutation was assumed from the protein p16 structure. 	Melanoma_Res.	D016428 D013485
11875053	20020305	Coding haplotype analysis supports HCR as the putative susceptibility gene for psoriasis at the MHC PSORS1 locus.	PSORS1, near HLA-C, is the major genetic determinant of psoriasis. We present genetic and structural evidence suggesting a major role for the HCR gene at the PSORS1 locus. Genotyping of 419 families from six populations revealed that coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms of HCR formed a conserved allele HCR*WWCC that associated highly significantly with psoriasis and with the HLA-Cw6 allele in all populations. Because of strong linkage disequilibrium between HLA-Cw6 and HCR*WWCC, the two genes could not be genetically distinguished by this sample size. However, the variant HCR allele was predicted to differ in secondary structure from the wild-type protein. HCR protein expression in lesional psoriatic skin differed considerably from that observed in normal skin. These results provide strong evidence for the HCR*WWCC allele as a major genetic determinant for psoriasis, probably by a mechanism impacting on keratinocyte proliferation. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.

22617256	20120524	A p.C343S missense mutation in PJVK causes progressive hearing loss.	Mutations in PJVK, encoding Pejvakin, cause autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss in humans at the DFNB59 locus on chromosome 2q31.2. Pejvakin is involved in generating auditory and neural signals in the inner ear. We have identified a consanguineous Pakistani family segregating sensorineural progressive hearing loss as a recessive trait, consistent with linkage to DFNB59. We sequenced PJVK and identified a novel missense mutation, c.1028G&gt;C in exon 7 (p.C343S) co-segregating with the phenotype in the family. The p.C343 residue is fully conserved among orthologs from different vertebrate species. We have also determined that mutations in PJVK are not a common cause of hearing loss in families with moderate to severe hearing loss in Pakistan. This is the first report of PJVK mutation in a Pakistani family and pinpoints an important residue for PJVK function. 	Gene	D016428 D052061

As other groups have reported that, in the mouse, the synthesis of mRNA encoding the 47-kDa cytokeratin corresponding to human cytokeratin 13 is induced in epidermal keratinocytes during malignant transformation, we have examined the synthesis of cytokeratin 13 mRNA and protein in human epidermis and epidermal tumors, using specific cDNA probes and cytokeratin 13 antibodies. We isolated two different cDNA clones from the vulvar carcinoma cell line A-431, in which this protein is abundant: One clone seems to represent the entire mRNA, whereas the other is only a minor component and encodes a truncated cytokeratin 13 lacking most of the carboxy-terminal tail domain, probably a product of alternative, &quot;incorrect&quot; splicing. Comparison of the amino acid sequences with those of other cytokeratins revealed a high degree of conservation with respect to several other human type I cytokeratins, notably cytokeratin 15, and to the murine 47-kDa cytokeratin. When human epidermis and a series of benign and malignant epidermal tumors were examined with these cDNA probes and cytokeratin-13-specific antibodies we did not find an induction of expression in keratinocytes, normal or malignantly transformed, except for some scattered, sparse cytokeratin-13-positive cells and very low levels of cytokeratin 13 mRNA, detectable only with the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We conclude that the gene(s) encoding cytokeratin 13 are not induced in human keratinocytes during epidermal carcinogenesis, in apparent contrast to reports of murine epidermal tumors, and we discuss possible explanations for this interspecies difference.

25382614	20141111	Identification of eight novel mutations and transcript analysis of two splicing mutations in Chinese newborns with MCC deficiency.	3-Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC) deficiency is an autosomal recessive inborn error of leucine metabolism, caused by mutations in either MCCC1 or MCCC2 gene. We identified eight novel mutations of MCCC1 or MCCC2 in six Chinese newborns screened by tandem mass spectrometry. Transcript analysis revealed that the novel splice mutation c.639+5G&gt;T produced a normal transcript and a transcript of exon 6 skipping which led to truncated MCCC1 protein. The remaining seven novel mutations may cause structure damage and dysfunction of MCC as predicted by in silico analysis. In conclusion, our study expands the spectrum of mutations found in MCCC1 and MCCC2 and provides a rough prevalence of 1 of 68,333 in Chinese population. Although the affected patients remained asymptomatic during follow-up, we hold the view that early detection through newborn screening, early intervention and follow-up may provide an important guidance to prevent subsequent metabolic disorders and deal with crisis later in life.

10383749	19990626	Allelic heterogeneity of dominant and recessive COL7A1 mutations underlying epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa.	The inherited mechanobullous disease, dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, is caused by type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) mutations. We studied six unrelated patients with a distinct clinical subtype of this disease, epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa, characterized by pruritus, excoriated prurigo nodules, and skin fragility. Mutation analysis using polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA, heteroduplex analysis and direct nucleotide sequencing demonstrated pathogenetic COL7A1 mutations in each case. Four patients had a glycine substitution mutation on one COL7A1 allele (G1791E, G2242R, G2369S, and G2713R), a fifth was a compound heterozygote for a splice site mutation (5532 + 1G-to-A) and a single base pair deletion (7786delG), and a sixth patient was heterozygous for an out-of-frame deletion mutation (6863del16). This study shows that the molecular pathology in patients with the distinctive clinical features of epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa is heterogeneous and suggests that other factors, in addition to the inherent COL7A1 mutation(s), may be responsible for an epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa phenotype.

15370539	20040917	Autosomal dominant familial exudative vitreoretinopathy in two Japanese families with FZD4 mutations (H69Y and C181R).	Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is a hereditary disorder characterized by impaired vascularization of parts of the peripheral retina. Autosomal dominant FEVR (adFEVR), a major form of FEVR and assigned to chromosome 11q13-23 (EVR1) locus, is caused by deletion mutations in the C- terminal region of the frizzled-4 (FZD4) gene. This paper describes the clinical phenotype of adFEVR in two Japanese families with two different mutations in the FZD4 gene. We encountered three Japanese patients with adFEVR and studied them using mutation analysis of the FZD4 gene with PCR, sequencing, and a restriction enzyme digestion. Two previously unreported missense mutations, p.H69Y and p.C181R, were identified in the N-terminal extra- cellular region of two of the patients. This region was highly conserved among other vertebrate species and FZD family members, unlike the C-terminal region. Co-segregation analysis revealed that all affected individuals carried one of these mutations, while unaffected individuals did not. The mutations were not detected in normal individuals (n=120). The affected individuals had mild to severe retinal abnormalities. FZD4 mutations in either the N- or C-terminal region underlie adFEVR, which indicates that FZD4 plays an important role in retinal angiogenesis. Analysis of FZD4 mutations in families with adFEVR is useful for genetic counseling and for early diagnosis 	Ophthalmic_Genet.	D016428 D013485
25913037	20150428	Acrofacial Dysostosis, Cincinnati Type, a Mandibulofacial Dysostosis Syndrome with Limb Anomalies, Is Caused by POLR1A Dysfunction.	We report three individuals with a cranioskeletal malformation syndrome that we define as acrofacial dysostosis, Cincinnati type. Each individual has a heterozygous mutation in POLR1A, which encodes a core component of RNA polymerase 1. All three individuals exhibit varying degrees of mandibulofacial dysostosis, and two additionally have limb anomalies. Consistent with this observation, we discovered that polr1a mutant zebrafish exhibited cranioskeletal anomalies mimicking the human phenotype. polr1a loss of function led to perturbed ribosome biogenesis and p53-dependent cell death, resulting in a deficiency of neural-crest-derived skeletal precursor cells and consequently craniofacial anomalies. Our findings expand the genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of congenital acrofacial disorders caused by disruption of ribosome biogenesis. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013485
8823308	19960915	A novel missense mutation in the amino-terminal domain of the human androgen receptor gene in a family with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome causes reduced efficiency of protein translation.	The role of the androgen receptor (AR) in male sexual differentiation is revealed in part by the analysis of naturally occurring mutations in families with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). We have investigated a family with partial AIS affecting three generations and have identified a G to A substitution in the AR gene at the fourth position 3' from the A of the ATG initiation codon changing the second amino acid residue from glutamic acid to lysine (EK2). Transient expression of the mutant EK2-pCMVhAR expression vector in COS cells revealed decreased translation with a 20-50% reduction in mutant protein relative to wild type AR by immunoblot analysis. The rate of dissociation of [3H]methyltrienolone from the EK2 mutant (half-time [t1/2] = 1.7 +/- 0.08 SE h) was increased compared with wild type AR (t1/2 = 2.4 +/- 0.11 h). Cotransfection studies using an androgen responsive luciferase reporter vector demonstrated a 50% reduction in transcriptional activation by EK2. These functional alterations are consistent with the partial AIS phenotype in affected males, corroborate the AR amino-terminal domain effect on kinetics of androgen binding, and provide physiological evidence for earlier translation experiments identifying the nucleotide sequence for optimal translation initiation.

10092505	19990327	Molecular cloning of the human ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (hABC1): evidence for sterol-dependent regulation in macrophages.	We have cloned the full-length cDNA for the human ATP binding cassette transporter 1 (hABC1). The 6603-bp open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 2201 amino acids resulting in a deduced molecular weight of 220 kDa. The hABC1 cDNA is highly homologous (62%) to the human rim ABC transporter (ABCR). hABC1 is expressed in a variety of human tissues with highest expression levels found in placenta, liver, lung, adrenal glands, and fetal tissues. We demonstrate that the hABC1 expression is induced during differentiation of human monocytes into macrophages in vitro. In macrophages, both the hABC1 mRNA and protein expression are upregulated in the presence of acetylated low-density lipoprotein (AcLDL). The AcLDL-induced increase in hABC1 expression is reversed by cholesterol depletion mediated by the addition of high-density lipoprotein (HDL3). Our data, demonstrating sterol-dependent regulation of hABC1 in human monocytes/macrophages, suggest a novel role for this transporter molecule in membrane lipid transport.

12859407	20030716	Nine novel mutations in the protoporphyrinogen oxidase gene in Swedish families with variegate porphyria.	Variegate porphyria (VP) is an autosomal-dominant disorder that is caused by inheritance of a partial deficiency of the enzyme protoporphyrinogen oxidase (EC 1.3.3.4). It is characterized by cutaneous photosensitivity and/or various neurological manifestations. Protoporphyrinogen oxidase catalyses the penultimate step of haem biosynthesis, and mutations in the PPOX gene have been coupled to VP. In the present study, sequencing analysis revealed 10 different mutations in the PPOX gene in 14 out of 17 apparently unrelated Swedish VP families. Six of the identified mutations, 3G &gt; A (exon 2), 454C &gt; T (exon 5), 472G &gt; C (exon 6), 614C &gt; T (exon 6), 988G &gt; C (exon 10) and IVS12 + 2T &gt; G (intron 12), are single nucleotide substitutions, while 604delC (exon 6), 916-17delCT (exon 9) and 1330-31delCT (exon 13) are small deletions, and IVS12 + 2-3insT (intron 12) is a small insertion. Only one of these 10 mutations has been reported previously. Three of the mutations were each identified in two or more families, while the remaining mutations were specific for an individual family. In addition to the 10 mutations, one previously unreported single nucleotide polymorphism was identified. Mutation analysis of family members revealed two adults and four children who were silent carriers of the VP trait. Genetic analysis can now be added to the conventional biochemical analyses and used in investigation of putative carriers of a VP trait in these families. 	Clin._Genet.	D016428 D013485
9326325	19971027	Characterization of 18 new mutations in COL7A1 in recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa provides evidence for distinct molecular mechanisms underlying defective anchoring fibril formation.	We have characterized 21 mutations in the type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) encoding the anchoring fibrils, 18 of which were not previously reported, in patients from 15 unrelated families with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). COL7A1 mutations in both alleles were identified by screening the 118 exons of COL7A1 and flanking intron regions. Fourteen mutations created premature termination codons (PTCs) and consisted of nonsense mutations, small insertions, deletions, and splice-site mutations. A further seven mutations predicted glycine or arginine substitutions in the collagenous domain of the molecule. Two mutations were found in more than one family reported in this study, and six of the seven missense mutations showed clustering within exons 72-74 next to the hinge region of the protein. Patients who were homozygous or compound heterozygotes for mutations leading to PTCs displayed both absence or drastic reduction of COL7A1 transcripts and undetectable type VII collagen protein in skin. In contrast, missense mutations were associated with clearly detectable COL7A1 transcripts and with normal or reduced expression of type VII collagen protein at the dermo/epidermal junction. Our results provide evidence for at least two distinct molecular mechanisms underlying defective anchoring fibril formation in RDEB: one involving PTCs leading to mRNA instability and absence of protein synthesis, the other implicating missense mutations resulting in the synthesis of type VII collagen polypeptide with decreased stability and/or altered function. Genotype-phenotype correlations suggested that the nature and location of these mutations are important determinants of the disease phenotype and showed evidence for interfamilial phenotypic variability.

11427181	20010628	Novel mutations in the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase gene of 13 patients with Smith--Lemli--Opitz syndrome.	Smith--Lemli--Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is caused by mutations in the DHCR7 gene leading to deficient activity of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7; EC 1.3.1.21), the final enzyme of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, resulting in low cholesterol and high concentrations of its direct precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol in plasma and tissues. We here report mutations identified in the DHCR7 gene of 13 children diagnosed with SLOS by clinical and biochemical criteria. We found a high frequency of the previously described IVS8--1 G &gt; C splice acceptor site mutation (two homozygotes, eight compound heterozygotes). In addition, 13 missense mutations and one splice acceptor mutation were detected in eleven patients with a mild to moderate SLOS-phenotype. The mutations include three novel missense mutations (W182L, C183Y, F255L) and one novel splice acceptor site mutation (IVS8--1 G &gt; T). Two patients, homozygous for the IVS8--1 G &gt; C mutation, presented with a severe clinical phenotype and died shortly after birth. Seven patients with a mild to moderate SLOS-phenotype disclosed compound heterozygosity of the IVS8--1 G &gt; C mutation in combination with different novel and known missense mutations.

7718898	19950415	Four new mutations in the NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase gene from patients with recessive congenital methemoglobinemia type II.	Recessive congenital methemoglobinemia (RCM) due to NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (cytb5r) deficiency leads to two different types of diseases. In the type I form, cyanosis is the only symptom, and the soluble enzyme is defective in red blood cells. In the type II form, cyanosis is associated with severe mental retardation and neurologic impairment; the enzymatic defect is systemic, involving both soluble and membrane-bound isoforms. We characterized mutations responsible for cytb5r deficiency in three unrelated patients with severe RCM type II. The first patient presented a homozygous exon 5 skipping. The only mutation detected was a homozygous G to C transversion at position +8, downstream from the 5' splice site of exon 5. We suggest that this unusual mutation might be responsible for the abnormal splicing of the primary transcripts, resulting in frameshift with premature STOP codon. The second mutation found corresponds to a homozygous C to T transition changing the Arg-218 codon to a premature STOP codon in exon 8. The third case was a compound heterozygote, carrying two different mutant alleles in the cyb5r gene. One allele presented a missense mutation with replacement of Cys-203 (TGC) by Arg (CGC) in exon 7. The second allele carried a 3-bp deletion (TGA) of nucleotides 815 to 817, modifying two contiguous codons in exon 9 of the cDNA with loss of Met-272. These results confirm the genetic polymorphism of cytb5r gene mutations identified in RCM type II, as observed for the mutations described in the RCM type I, and shed light on the molecular bases of the two different diseases associated with cytb5r deficiency.

9551946	19980429	Lymphocyte inhibitor of TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand): a new receptor protecting lymphocytes from the death ligand TRAIL.	Apoptosis can be triggered by the engagement of cell surface receptors by their ligands. A growing number of receptors belonging to the TNF receptor family have been identified that contain a conserved cytoplasmic death domain. These include Fas, TNF-R1, lymphocyte-associated receptor of death (LARD), DR4, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor inducer of cell killing-2 (TRICK2). The latter two are receptors for the cytotoxic ligand TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and one of the paradoxes raised by the cloning of these molecules was why do most cells not die upon contact with the widely expressed TRAIL molecule? This is a particular problem for lymphocytes that express DR4 and TRICK2 and are in constant circulation through TRAIL-expressing tissues. We have cloned LIT (lymphocyte inhibitor of TRAIL), which lacks a death domain. LIT is expressed predominantly on PBL, where it can competitively inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis through DR4/TRICK2, and may function to modulate lymphocyte sensitivity to TRAIL. 	J._Immunol.

16380919	20051229	NF1 gene mutations represent the major molecular event underlying neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome.	Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) demonstrates phenotypic overlap with Noonan syndrome (NS) in some patients, which results in the so-called neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS). From a genetic point of view, NFNS is a poorly understood condition, and controversy remains as to whether it represents a variable manifestation of either NF1 or NS or is a distinct clinical entity. To answer this question, we screened a cohort with clinically well-characterized NFNS for mutations in the entire coding sequence of the NF1 and PTPN11 genes. Heterozygous NF1 defects were identified in 16 of the 17 unrelated subjects included in the study, which provides evidence that mutations in NF1 represent the major molecular event underlying this condition. Lesions included nonsense mutations, out-of-frame deletions, missense changes, small inframe deletions, and one large multiexon deletion. Remarkably, a high prevalence of inframe defects affecting exons 24 and 25, which encode a portion of the GAP-related domain of the protein, was observed. On the other hand, no defect in PTPN11 was observed, and no lesion affecting exons 11-27 of the NF1 gene was identified in 100 PTPN11 mutation-negative subjects with NS, which provides further evidence that NFNS and NS are genetically distinct disorders. These results support the view that NFNS represents a variant of NF1 and is caused by mutations of the NF1 gene, some of which have been demonstrated to cause classic NF1 in other individuals.

10318851	19990513	Translational control of specific genes during differentiation of HL-60 cells.	Eukaryotic gene expression can be regulated through selective translation of specific mRNA species. Nevertheless, the limited number of known examples hampers the identification of common mechanisms that regulate translation of specific groups of genes in mammalian cells. We developed a method to identify translationally regulated genes. This method was used to examine the regulation of protein synthesis in HL-60 cells undergoing monocytic differentiation. A partial screening of cellular mRNAs identified five mRNAs whose translation was specifically inhibited and five others that were activated as was indicated by their mobilization onto polysomes. The specifically inhibited mRNAs encoded ribosomal proteins, identified as members of the 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine tract mRNA family. Most of the activated transcripts represented uncharacterized genes. The most actively mobilized transcript (termed TA-40) was an untranslated 1.3-kilobase polyadenylated RNA with unusual structural features, including two Alu-like elements. Following differentiation, a significant change in the cytoplasmic distribution of Alu-containing mRNAs was observed, namely, the enhancement of Alu-containing mRNAs in the polysomes. Our findings support the notion that protein synthesis is regulated during differentiation of HL-60 cells by both global and gene-specific mechanisms and that Alu-like sequences within cytoplasmic mRNAs are involved in such specific regulation.

8338947	19930801	Identification of three candidate mutations causing type IIA von Willebrand disease using a rapid, nonradioactive, allele-specific hybridization method.	Type IIA von Willebrand disease (vWD), the most common type II vWD variant, is characterized by decreased binding of von Willebrand factor (vWF) to platelet glycoprotein Ib (Gplb) and by a decrease in large and intermediate vWF multimers. Mutations reported to cause vWD type IIA are clustered within the A2 domain of vWF, which is encoded by exon 28. Genomic DNA from affected members of 12 unrelated families with type IIA vWD were screened for these mutations by a rapid, nonradioactive, allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization method. Oligonucleotides containing each of eight mutations were cross-linked onto a nylon membrane by UV irradiation. A fragment of vWF exon 28 was amplified from peripheral blood leukocyte DNA using biotinylated primers and hybridized to the immobilized oligonucleotides. Positive signals were detected with an avidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and chemiluminescent substrate. Thus, in a single hybridization reaction, a patient sample could be analyzed for a large number of mutations simultaneously. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products from four patients did not contain any of the tested mutations and therefore were sequenced. Three additional candidate missense mutations, two of them novel, were identified: Arg(834)--&gt;Gln in one patient, Gly(846)--&gt;Arg in one patient, and Val(902)--&gt;Glu in three ostensibly unrelated patients. By ASO hybridization, the mutations were confirmed in the affected patients and excluded in unaffected relatives and 50 normal controls. In one family, the Val(902)--&gt;Glu mutation was shown to be a de novo mutation. This rapid screening method is applicable to other subtypes of vWD for which mutations have been identified.

14560308	20031016	Phenotypic and molecular characterisation of the Aarskog-Scott syndrome: a survey of the clinical variability in light of FGD1 mutation analysis in 46 patients.	Faciogenital dysplasia or Aarskog-Scott syndrome (AAS) is a genetically heterogeneous developmental disorder. The X-linked form of AAS has been ascribed to mutations in the FGD1 gene. However, although AAS may be considered as a relatively frequent clinical diagnosis, mutations have been established in few patients. Genetic heterogeneity and the clinical overlap with a number of other syndromes might explain this discrepancy. In this study, we have conducted a single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of the entire coding region of FGD1 in 46 AAS patients and identified eight novel mutations, including one insertion, four deletions and three missense mutations (19.56% detection rate). One mutation (528insC) was found in two independent families. The mutations are scattered all along the coding sequence. Phenotypically, all affected males present with the characteristic AAS phenotype. FGD1 mutations were not associated with severe mental retardation. However, neuropsychiatric disorders, mainly behavioural and learning problems in childhood, were observed in five out of 12 mutated individuals. The current study provides further evidence that mutations of FGD1 may cause AAS and expands the spectrum of disease-causing mutations. The importance of considering the neuropsychological phenotype of AAS patients is discussed. 	Eur._J._Hum._Genet.	D002363 D016428 D013485
12442286	20021121	DHPLC mutation analysis of Jagged1 (JAG1) reveals six novel mutations in Australian alagille syndrome patients.	Alagille syndrome (AGS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by abnormal development of the liver, heart, skeleton, eye, and face. Mutations in the Jagged1 gene have been found to result in the AGS phenotype. Using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) mutation analysis we have screened 20 individuals with symptoms of AGS from 14 families for mutations within Jagged1. Eleven distinct Jagged1 mutations, six of which are novel, were identified in the 14 probands and affected family members. The mutations include four small deletions (36.6%), one small insertion (9.1%), three missense mutations (27.3%), one nonsense mutation (9.1%) and two splice donor site mutations (18.2%). The two newly identified splice site mutations were shown to cause the aberrant splicing of Jagged1 mRNA resulting in premature truncation of JAG1. A splice acceptor site mutation previously identified by our group in intron 13 was also shown to cause multiple splicing abnormalities of Jagged1 mRNA, consequently removing exons 14 and 15. The results of this study are consistent with the proposal that either haploinsufficiency for wild-type JAG1 and/or dominant negative effects produced by mutated JAG1 are responsible for the AGS phenotype.

8581357	19950401	GM2 gangliosidosis B1 variant: biochemical and molecular characterization of hexosaminidase A.	The biochemical properties of hexosaminidase A (HexA) and the coding sequence of the alpha-subunit were examined in a patient of Syrian ancestry with the B1 form of Tay-Sachs disease (TSD). The biochemical characteristics of the variant HexA suggest that both active sites are affected by the mutation(s). Kinetic studies with the beta-subunit specific substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-N-acetylglucosamine (MUG), revealed a significant difference between the Km values. of normal and variant HexA, while no difference was found when the sulfated substrate MUG-6-sulfate (MUGS), which is specific for the alpha-subunit active site, was used. The Vmax values for both substrates were significantly lower in extracts from B1 variant cells than in control extracts, implying a reduced enzyme level in the variant cells. A noncompetitive inhibitor of the reaction with MUGS, N-acetylglucosamine (NAG), induced a significant inhibition (30%) in the mutant cells only. When MUG was used as substrate, variant HexA was found to be more heat stable (T50 = 170 min) than normal HexA (T50 = 65 min). Furthermore, the mutant cell preparation differed from control in the relation between Hex thermosensitivity and protein concentration in the reaction. Two new mutations were identified in exon 5 of the HexA gene: a C496 to G transversion, which produced an Arg166 --&gt;Gly alteration and a deletion of C498 which generated a shift in the reading frame. The patient was a heterozygote for both mutations even though her parents are first cousins. There is no evidence as yet which of these mutations accounts for the B1 phenotype. 	Biochem._Mol._Med.

9689128	19980805	Single-nucleotide polymorphism in the human mu opioid receptor gene alters beta-endorphin binding and activity: possible implications for opiate addiction.	Opioid drugs play important roles in the clinical management of pain, as well as in the development and treatment of drug abuse. The mu opioid receptor is the primary site of action for the most commonly used opioids, including morphine, heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. By sequencing DNA from 113 former heroin addicts in methadone maintenance and 39 individuals with no history of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence, we have identified five different single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region of the mu opioid receptor gene. The most prevalent SNP is a nucleotide substitution at position 118 (A118G), predicting an amino acid change at a putative N-glycosylation site. This SNP displays an allelic frequency of approximately 10% in our study population. Significant differences in allele distribution were observed among ethnic groups studied. The variant receptor resulting from the A118G SNP did not show altered binding affinities for most opioid peptides and alkaloids tested. However, the A118G variant receptor binds beta-endorphin, an endogenous opioid that activates the mu opioid receptor, approximately three times more tightly than the most common allelic form of the receptor. Furthermore, beta-endorphin is approximately three times more potent at the A118G variant receptor than at the most common allelic form in agonist-induced activation of G protein-coupled potassium channels. These results show that SNPs in the mu opioid receptor gene can alter binding and signal transduction in the resulting receptor and may have implications for normal physiology, therapeutics, and vulnerability to develop or protection from diverse diseases including the addictive diseases.

25380965	20141109	A novel NKX2.6 mutation associated with congenital ventricular septal defect.	Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect and is the most prevalent non-infectious cause of infant death. Aggregating evidence demonstrates that genetic defects are involved in the pathogenesis of CHD. However, CHD is genetically heterogeneous and the genetic determinants for CHD in an overwhelming majority of patients remain unknown. In this study, the coding regions and splice junctions of the NKX2.6 gene, which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor crucial for cardiovascular development, were sequenced in 210 unrelated CHD patients. As a result, a novel heterozygous NKX2.6 mutation, p.K152Q, was identified in an index patient with ventricular septal defect (VSD). Genetic analysis of the proband's available family members showed that the mutation cosegregated with VSD transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with complete penetrance. The missense mutation was absent in 400 control chromosomes and the altered amino acid was completely conserved evolutionarily across species. Due to unknown transcriptional targets of NKX2.6, the functional characteristics of the identified mutation at transcriptional activity were analyzed by using NKX2.5 as a surrogate. Alignment between human NKX2.6 and NKX2.5 proteins displayed that K152Q-mutant NKX2.6 was equivalent to K158Q-mutant NKX2.5, and introduction of K158Q into NKX2.5 significantly reduced its transcriptional activating function when compared with its wild-type counterpart. This study firstly links NKX2.6 loss-of-function mutation with increased susceptibility to isolated VSD, providing novel insight into the molecular mechanism underpinning VSD and contributing to the development of new preventive and therapeutic strategies for this common form of CHD.

16570191	20060330	Novel mutations in CLN8 in Italian variant late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis: Another genetic hit in the Mediterranean.	Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorders typically characterized by the accumulation of autofluorescent material in tissues. On the basis of clinical features, age at onset, and molecular genetic defects, it is possible to distinguish at least nine forms. The CLN8 form was first described in Finland, where all the patients are homozygous for a p.Arg24Gly mutation in CLN8. More recently, it has been found that a subset of a Turkish variant of late infantile NCL (v-LINCL) is also associated with CLN8 mutations. To identify the molecular defect in Italian patients with v-LINCL, the CLN8 gene was directly sequenced in 10 patients. Controls were screened by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. Five fluorescent-labeled microsatellite markers covering 1 cM around the gene were used for haplotype analysis. In three Italian v-LINCL patients, identified in a small area in southern Italy, we detected four new mutations in CLN8: c.66delG (p.Gly22fs), c.88G&gt;C (p.Ala30Pro), c.473A&gt;G (p.Tyr158Cys), and c.581A&gt;G (p.Gln194Arg). The single-base deletion was found in two unrelated patients. The novel missense mutations were not identified in ethnically matched control chromosomes. Our findings expand the number of CLN8 variants and corroborate the notion that CLN8 patients are not confined to the Finnish population. 	Neurogenetics	D016428 D013485
12364586	20021005	Genetic and physiological data implicating the new human gene G72 and the gene for D-amino acid oxidase in schizophrenia.	A map of 191 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) was built across a 5-Mb segment from chromosome 13q34 that has been genetically linked to schizophrenia. DNA from 213 schizophrenic patients and 241 normal individuals from Canada were genotyped with this marker set. Two 1,400- and 65-kb regions contained markers associated with the disease. Two markers from the 65-kb region were also found to be associated to schizophrenia in a Russian sample. Two overlapping genes G72 and G30 transcribed in brain were experimentally annotated in this 65-kb region. Transfection experiments point to the existence of a 153-aa protein coded by the G72 gene. This protein is rapidly evolving in primates, is localized to endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi in transfected cells, is able to form multimers and specifically binds to carbohydrates. Yeast two-hybrid experiments with the G72 protein identified the enzyme d-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) as an interacting partner. DAAO is expressed in human brain where it oxidizes d-serine, a potent activator of N-methyl-D-aspartate type glutamate receptor. The interaction between G72 and DAAO was confirmed in vitro and resulted in activation of DAAO. Four SNP markers from DAAO were found to be associated with schizophrenia in the Canadian samples. Logistic regression revealed genetic interaction between associated SNPs in vicinity of two genes. The association of both DAAO and a new gene G72 from 13q34 with schizophrenia together with activation of DAAO activity by a G72 protein product points to the involvement of this N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor regulation pathway in schizophrenia.

21653323	20110610	ALAS2 acts as a modifier gene in patients with congenital erythropoietic porphyria.	Mutations in the uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS) gene cause congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), an autosomal-recessive inborn error of erythroid heme biosynthesis. Clinical features of CEP include dermatologic and hematologic abnormalities of variable severity. The discovery of a new type of erythroid porphyria, X-linked dominant protoporphyria (XLDPP), which results from increased activity of 5-aminolevulinate synthase 2 (ALAS2), the rate-controlling enzyme of erythroid heme synthesis, led us to hypothesize that the CEP phenotype may be modulated by sequence variations in the ALAS2 gene. We genotyped ALAS2 in 4 unrelated CEP patients exhibiting the same C73R/P248Q UROS genotype. The most severe of the CEP patients, a young girl, proved to be heterozygous for a novel ALAS2 mutation: c.1757 A &gt; T in exon 11. This mutation is predicted to affect the highly conserved and penultimate C-terminal amino acid of ALAS2 (Y586). The rate of 5-aminolevulinate release from Y586F was significantly increased over that of wild-type ALAS2. The contribution of the ALAS2 gain-of-function mutation to the CEP phenotype underscores the importance of modifier genes underlying CEP. We propose that ALAS2 gene mutations should be considered not only as causative of X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) and XLDPP but may also modulate gene function in other erythropoietic disorders.

9686753	19980801	Novel LQT-3 mutation affects Na+ channel activity through interactions between alpha- and beta1-subunits.	The congenital long-QT syndrome (LQT), an inherited cardiac arrhythmia characterized in part by prolonged ventricular repolarization, has been linked to 5 loci, 4 of which have been shown to harbor genes that encode ion channels. Previously studied LQT-3 mutations of SCN5A (or hH1), the gene that encodes the human Na+ channel alpha-subunit, have been shown to encode voltage-gated Na+ channels that reopen during prolonged depolarization and hence directly contribute to the disease phenotype: delayed repolarization. Here, we report the functional consequences of a novel SCN5A mutation discovered in an extended LQT family. The mutation, a single A--&gt;G base substitution at nucleotide 5519 of the SCN5A cDNA, is expected to cause a nonconservative change from an aspartate to a glycine at position 1790 (D1790G) of the SCN5A gene product. We investigated ion channel activity in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells transiently transfected with wild-type (hH1) or mutant (D1790G) cDNA alone or in combination with cDNA encoding the human Na+ channel beta1-subunit (hbeta1) using whole-cell patch-clamp procedures. Heteromeric channels formed by coexpression of alpha- and beta1-subunits are affected: steady-state inactivation is shifted by -16 mV, but there is no D1790G-induced sustained inward current. This effect is independent of the beta1-subunit isoform. We find no significant effect of D1790G on the biophysical properties of monomeric alpha- (hH1) channels. We conclude that the effects of the novel LQT-3 mutation on inactivation of heteromeric channels are due to D1790G-induced changes in alpha- and beta1-interactions. 	Circ._Res.	D016428
26096313	20150623	KIAA0586 is Mutated in Joubert Syndrome.	Joubert syndrome (JS) is a recessive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a distinctive mid-hindbrain malformation. JS is part of a group of disorders called ciliopathies based on their overlapping phenotypes and common underlying pathophysiology linked to primary cilium dysfunction. Biallelic mutations in one of 28 genes, all encoding proteins localizing to the primary cilium or basal body, can cause JS. Despite this large number of genes, the genetic cause can currently be determined in about 62% of individuals with JS. To identify novel JS genes, we performed whole exome sequencing on 35 individuals with JS and found biallelic rare deleterious variants (RDVs) in KIAA0586, encoding a centrosomal protein required for ciliogenesis, in one individual. Targeted next-generation sequencing in a large JS cohort identified biallelic RDVs in eight additional families for an estimated prevalence of 2.5% (9/366 JS families). All affected individuals displayed JS phenotypes toward the mild end of the spectrum. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428 D052061 D013485
9524238	19980403	Molecular cloning of human and bovine LECT2 having a neutrophil chemotactic activity and its specific expression in the liver.	We previously reported the purification and amino acid sequence of a novel neutrophil chemotactic protein termed LECT2 (leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2). In this paper we report molecular cloning of human and bovine LECT2 cDNAs based on the amino acid sequence of the purified protein. The deduced amino acid sequence of human LECT2 (hLECT2) shows an 86% identity to bovine LECT2 (bLECT2). The deduced primary structures of LECT2 were highly homologous to the repeated units of Mim-1 protein (myb induced myeloid protein-1). The mim-1 gene is one of the known myb target genes and is specifically expressed in normal and transformed immature granulocytes in the chicken. Northern blot analysis of normal human tissues demonstrated that the hLECT2 gene is specifically expressed in the adult and fetal livers. In addition, several human hepatoma cell lines also expressed LECT2 mRNA, suggesting that hepatic cells in the liver produce LECT2 protein. 	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D013485
10512762	19991008	Isolation of two novel metalloproteinase-disintegrin (ADAM) cDNAs that show testis-specific gene expression.	Metalloproteinase-disintegrins (ADAMs) are type 1 transmembrane proteins that contain a unique domain structure including a zinc-binding metalloproteinase domain. We have isolated cDNAs encoding two novel members of this family, ADAM29 and ADAM30 which show testis-specific expression. Three forms of ADAM29 were found that encode proteins of 820, 786 and 767 amino acids. All of the amino acid differences are located in the cytoplasmic domain. Two forms of ADAM30 were isolated that encode proteins of 790 and 781 amino acids, with the difference in the coding region occurring in the cytoplasmic domain. ADAM29 and ADAM30 map to human chromosome 4q34 and 1p11-13, respectively. An ancestral analysis of all known mammalian ADAMs indicates that the zinc-binding motif in the catalytic domain arose once in a common ancestor and was subsequently lost by those members lacking this motif.

7925474	19941001	Protein structure of fetal antigen 1 (FA1). A novel circulating human epidermal-growth-factor-like protein expressed in neuroendocrine tumors and its relation to the gene products of dlk and pG2.	The present paper describes the primary structure, glycosylation and tissue localization of fetal antigen 1 (FA1) isolated from second-trimester human amniotic fluid. FA1 is a single-chained, heterogeneous glycoprotein of 225-262 amino acid residues. FA1 has six well conserved epidermal-growth-factor motifs and contains up to ten O-glycosylation and N-glycosylation sites, six of which are differentially glycosylated. Alignment to the translated sequences of Mus. musculus dlk and human dlk revealed 86% and 99% identity, respectively, to a 259-amino-acid residue overlap, and this high similarity extends with minor corrections to the human adrenal-specific mRNA, pG2 as well. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the presence of FA1 in 10 out of 14 lung tumors containing neuroendocrine elements, and in the placental villi where FA1 was exclusively seen in stromal cells in close contact to the vascular structure. In the pancreas, FA1 co-localized with insulin in the insulin secretory granules of the beta cells within the islets of Langerhans. Our findings suggest that FA1 is synthesized as a membrane anchored protein and released into the circulation after enzymic cleavage, and that circulating FA1 represents the post-translationally modified gene product of human dlk which, in turn, is identical to human adrenal-specific mRNA pG2.

3600759	19870618	Cloning and sequencing of human cholesteryl ester transfer protein cDNA.	The transfer of insoluble cholesteryl esters among lipoprotein particles is a vital step in normal cholesterol homeostasis and may be involved in the development of atherosclerosis. Extrahepatic tissues lack the enzymes required for the degradation of sterols to the excretable form of bile acids. Cholesterol synthesized in these tissues in excess of that needed for the synthesis of cell membranes or steroid hormones must accordingly be returned through the plasma to the liver for catabolism. The series of reactions involved has been termed reverse cholesterol transport. Catalysed steps of this pathway are believed to include an efflux from peripheral cells, which generates a diffusion gradient between these membranes and extracellular fluid; esterification of this cholesterol by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) (phosphatidylcholine-sterol acyltransferase) acting on species of high-density lipoproteins; transfer of the cholesteryl esters formed (largely to low- and very low-density lipoproteins) (LDL and VLDL) by a cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP); and removal of these lipoproteins, together with their cholesteryl ester content, by the liver through receptor-mediated and nonspecific endocytosis. Of these steps, the CETP reaction is the least characterized. Several laboratories have reported the purification from human plasma of proteins active on cholesteryl ester transfer between lipoprotein particles and possibly between cells and plasma. However, the reported relative molecular mass (Mr), abundance and specificity of the purified activities have differed considerably. We have recently described the preparation of a highly active CETP of Mr 74,000 purified about 100,000-fold from human plasma, which may represent the functional component of earlier preparations. Using a partial amino-acid sequence from this purified protein, CETP complementary DNA derived from human liver DNA has been cloned and sequenced and the cloned DNA used to detect CETP messenger RNA in a number of human tissues.

12498782	20021225	The calsyntenins--a family of postsynaptic membrane proteins with distinct neuronal expression patterns.	We have identified two novel postsynaptic membrane proteins that are highly similar to calsyntenin-1 in their extracellular parts but vary considerably in their cytoplasmic segment. Calsyntenin-1 has recently been identified in our lab as a postsynaptic membrane protein with a highly acidic cytoplasmic segment with putative Ca(2+)-binding capacity (Vogt et al., 2001, Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 17: 151-166). Based on their structural similarity to calsyntenin-1, we have called the novel proteins calsyntenin-2 and -3, respectively. By immunoelectron microscopy, the calsyntenin protein family was localized in the postsynaptic membrane of excitatory central nervous system (CNS) synapses. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that calsyntenin-1 was abundant in most neurons of the CNS with relatively little variation in its expression level. Calsyntenin-2 and -3 expressions varied much more with highest levels in GABAergic neurons. Based on their distinct expression patterns and the differences in their cytoplasmic segments, we suggest a cell-type-specific functional role for the three calsyntenins in excitatory synaptic transmission.

9419403	19980107	Identification of concurrent germ-line mutations in hMSH2 and/or hMLH1 in Japanese hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer kindreds.	We analyzed microsatellite instability, alterations of the polyadenine tract in TGF-beta RII (transforming growth factor beta type II receptor gene), and mutations of hMSH2 and hMLH1 in 32 patients with familial colorectal cancer (29 kindreds) fulfilling the clinical criteria for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), defined at the 34th Annual Meeting of Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum (Tokushima, Japan, 1991), including five kindreds fulfilling the Amsterdam criteria. Eighteen of 32 (56%) cases were replication error positive (RER+) at two or more microsatellite loci analyzed. The clinicopathological characteristics of RER+ cases corresponded well with those reported previously. Eleven of 18 RER+ cases showed RER+ at most of the microsatellite loci examined. Among these 11 cases (10 kindreds), 3 kindreds fulfilled the Amsterdam criteria and 7 kindreds did not. For these 10 kindreds, germ-line mutations in hMSH2 and hMLH1 were detected for 6 kindreds by PCR-SSCP analysis and direct sequencing. Only two of these six fulfilled the Amsterdam criteria; more than one germ-line mutation was detected in hMSH2 and/or hMLH1. Specifically, two point mutations of hMSH2 were detected in two kindreds, one point mutation of both hMSH2 and hMLH1 was detected in one kindred, two point mutations of hMSH2 and one point mutation of hMLH1 were detected in one kindred, and two point mutations of hMLH1 and one point mutation of hMSH2 were detected in one kindred. In addition, 19 of 26 (74%) cancer lesions of these 11 cases with the RER phenotype showed alterations of the polyadenine tract in TGF-beta RII. From our data, although seven kindreds did not fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, we considered them as HNPCC. Therefore, we suggest that the &quot;Japanese criteria&quot; have the advantage of being able to detect more HNPCC kindreds from borderline HNPCC kindreds. 	Cancer_Epidemiol._Biomarkers_Prev.

7531707	19950217	Human tenascin gene. Structure of the 5'-region, identification, and characterization of the transcription regulatory sequences.	This report describes the genomic organization of the 5'-region of the human tenascin-C (TN) gene and the functional characterization of its promoter. Approximately 2300 base pairs of the TN gene 5'-flanking region have been cloned and sequenced. This genomic region contains several potential binding sites for transcription factors. By primer extension and S1 nuclease analysis we have localized the transcription start site. The first exon of the TN gene (179 base pairs long) is present in the two major TN transcripts, showing that the expression of these two mRNAs is regulated by a single promoter. The 220 bases upstream to the transcription start site are equally active in directing the expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene in TN producer and nonproducer cells. Using deletion fragments of the human 5'-flanking region we have shown the presence of putative &quot;silencer&quot; elements in the -220 to -2300 region active in both TN producer and nonproducer cell lines. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the selective transcription in TN producing cells requires the presence of a 1.3-kilobase portion of the TN gene intron 1 in the CAT expression vectors. These findings indicate that complex mechanisms control the transcriptional regulation of TN gene. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
16399879	20060110	Mutation in the epsilon subunit of the cytosolic chaperonin-containing t-complex peptide-1 (Cct5) gene causes autosomal recessive mutilating sensory neuropathy with spastic paraplegia.	Mutilating sensory neuropathy with spastic paraplegia is a very rare disease with both autosomal dominant and recessive modes of inheritance. We previously mapped the locus of the autosomal recessive form to a 25 cM interval between markers D5S2048 and D5S648 on chromosome 5p. In this candidate interval, the Cct5 gene encoding the epsilon subunit of the cytosolic chaperonin-containing t-complex peptide-1 (CCT) was the most obvious candidate gene since mutation in the Cct4 gene encoding the CCT delta subunit has been reported to be associated with autosomal recessive mutilating sensory neuropathy in mutilated foot (mf) rat mutant. A consanguineous Moroccan family with four patients displaying mutilating sensory neuropathy associated with spastic paraplegia was investigated. To identify the disease causing gene, the 11 coding exons of the Cct5 gene were screened for mutations by direct sequencing in all family members including the four patients, parents, and six at risk relatives. Sequence analysis of the Cct5 gene revealed a missense A492G mutation in exon 4 that results in the substitution of a highly conserved histidine for arginine amino acid 147. Interestingly, R147 was absent in 384 control matched chromosomes tested. This is the first disease causing mutation that has been identified in the human CCT subunit genes; the mf rat mutant could serve as an animal model for studying these chaperonopathies.

23933820	20130813	GRIN2A mutations in acquired epileptic aphasia and related childhood focal epilepsies and encephalopathies with speech and language dysfunction.	Epileptic encephalopathies are severe brain disorders with the epileptic component contributing to the worsening of cognitive and behavioral manifestations. Acquired epileptic aphasia (Landau-Kleffner syndrome, LKS) and continuous spike and waves during slow-wave sleep syndrome (CSWSS) represent rare and closely related childhood focal epileptic encephalopathies of unknown etiology. They show electroclinical overlap with rolandic epilepsy (the most frequent childhood focal epilepsy) and can be viewed as different clinical expressions of a single pathological entity situated at the crossroads of epileptic, speech, language, cognitive and behavioral disorders. Here we demonstrate that about 20% of cases of LKS, CSWSS and electroclinically atypical rolandic epilepsy often associated with speech impairment can have a genetic origin sustained by de novo or inherited mutations in the GRIN2A gene (encoding the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor ?2 subunit, GluN2A). The identification of GRIN2A as a major gene for these epileptic encephalopathies provides crucial insights into the underlying pathophysiology. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D013485
3182793	19881105	Mutant human adenosine deaminase alleles and their expression by transfection into fibroblasts.	Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency in humans is one cause of severe combined immunodeficiency disease. Single base mutations affecting the ADA protein have been identified for both alleles of the ADA-deficient cell line GM2606 and for one allele of the ADA-deficient cell line GM2825A. One allele of GM2606 has a mutation altering amino acid 101 from Arg to Trp, and the other allele has a mutation altering amino acid 211 from Arg to His. As previously reported, one ADA allele of GM2825A has a single base mutation changing Ala-329 to Val-329, and the other allele has a mutation which eliminates exon 4 from the mature mRNA. Sequence analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified GM2825A DNA showed a single base change of A to G within the invariant bases of the 3' splice site of intron 3 that can account for the mis-splicing of exon 4. To test the effect on ADA catalytic activity of these mutations and the mutations previously found in the ADA-deficient line GM2756, expression vectors containing normal and mutant ADA-coding sequences under transcriptional regulation of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat were constructed and transfected into human fibroblasts. All transfected cells had levels of ADA mRNA 15-25 times higher than the endogenous ADA message. Yet, cells transfected with the normal ADA-coding sequences had ADA enzymatic levels 40 times higher than cells transfected with any of the mutant ADA sequences. This analysis demonstrates that while the mutant ADA-coding sequences are transcribed, they do not encode a functional ADA protein. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013487

8508762	19930601	Protocadherins: a large family of cadherin-related molecules in central nervous system.	Using the polymerase chain reaction, we have isolated numerous rat and human cDNAs of which the deduced amino acid sequences are highly homologous to the sequences of the extracellular domain of cadherins. The entire putative coding sequences for two human proteins defined by two of these cDNAs have been determined. The overall structure of these molecules is very similar to that of classic cadherins, but they have some unique features. The extracellular domains are composed of six or seven subdomains that are very similar to those of cadherins, but have characteristic properties. The cytoplasmic domains, on the other hand, have no significant homology with those of classic cadherins. Since various cDNAs with almost identical features were obtained also from Xenopus, Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, it appears that similar molecules are expressed in a variety of organisms. We have tentatively named these proteins protocadherins. They are highly expressed in brain and their expression appears to be developmentally regulated. The proteins expressed from the two full-length cDNAs in L cells were approximately 170 or 150 kDa in size, and were localized mainly at cell-cell contact sites. Moreover, the transfectants showed cell adhesion activity. 	EMBO_J.	D016428 D013485 D013487

11313769	20010421	Molecular analysis of MVK mutations and enzymatic activity in hyper-IgD and periodic fever syndrome.	Hyperimmunoglobulinaemia D and periodic fever syndrome (HIDS) is an autosomal recessive inflammatory disorder characterised by recurrent episode of fever associated with lymphadenopathy, abdominal distress, joint involvement and skin lesions. We recently demonstrated that mutations in the mevalonate kinase gene (MVK) are associated with HIDS. Direct DNA sequencing was done to screen the entire coding region of MVK in 25 unrelated patients with HIDS. Mutations were detected in the coding region of the gene including 11 missense mutations, one deletion, the absence of expression of one allele, as well as three novel polymorphisms. Seven of these mutations are novel. The large majority of the patients were compound heterozygotes for two mutations. Of these, V377I (G--&gt;A) is the most common mutation occurring in 20 unrelated patients and was found to be associated with I268T in six patients. Mutations were associated with a decrease of mevalonate kinase (MK) (ATP:mevalonate 5-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.I.36) enzymatic activity but not as profound as in mevalonic aciduria, a syndrome also caused by a deficient activity of MK. In HIDS the mutations are located all along the protein which is different from mevalonic aciduria where MK mutations are mainly clustered to a same region of the protein. On the basis of this study, we propose that the diagnostic screen of MVK in HIDS should be first directed on V377I and I268T mutations. Three patients are also described to illustrate the genotypic and phenotypic overlap with mevalonic aciduria. 	Eur._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
8486776	19930501	Low expression allele alpha LELY of red cell spectrin is associated with mutations in exon 40 (alpha V/41 polymorphism) and intron 45 and with partial skipping of exon 46.	The alpha V/41 polymorphism of erythroid alpha-spectrin has been characterized initially by an increased susceptibility to proteolysis of the alpha IV-alpha V domain junction (Alloisio N., L. Morlé, J. Maréchal, A.-F. Roux, M.-T. Ducluzeau, D. Guetarni, B. Pothier, F. Baklouti, A. Ghanem, R. Kastally, et al. 1991. J. Clin. Invest. 87:2169-2177). Until now, it has been found associated invariably with a low expression level of the corresponding alpha chain. Among 61 chromosomes investigated in French and North African individuals or kindreds, we observed 19 chromosomes with the alpha V/41 polymorphism. With no single exception, the latter displayed a point mutation in exon 40 (Leu--&gt;Val; CTA--&gt;GTA) at position alpha 1857. According to the triple helical model of spectrin structure, this change accounts for the peptide maps' abnormalities. Sequencing the entire alpha V domain cDNA disclosed, in addition, a partial skipping of exon 46. At the gene level, a substitution (C--&gt;T) was evidenced at nucleotide -12 of intron 45. This mutation appeared linked to the exon 40 mutation in 17 chromosomes, again with no single exception, among 53 examined chromosomes. We hypothesized that the lack of exon 46 would hamper the nucleation process and eventually account for the low expression feature. The present doubly mutated allele was renamed allele alpha LELY (low expression, Lyon). 	J._Clin._Invest.	D016428 D013485
9780098	19981021	Two distinct kerato-epithelin mutations in Reis-Bücklers corneal dystrophy.	Two patients were diagnosed with Reis-Bücklers corneal dystrophy (RBCD), although the pattern and severity of corneal opacification differed. To see whether there was a genetic basis for these phenotypic variations, we analyzed beta ig-h3, the gene that codes for kerato-epithelin and that contains a mutation (Arg555Gln) that causes RBCD. A 30-year-old man with honeycomb-shaped subepithelial opacities in his central cornea and a 25-year-old man with progressive subepithelial geographic opacities were both considered to have RBCD. We isolated genomic DNA from leukocytes of the two patients and their family members and screened for an Arg555Gln kerato-epithelin mutation. Then we analyzed all exons of the gene using the single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique to search for any other kerato-epithelin mutations. The patient with honeycomb-shaped opacities had an Arg555Gln kerato-epithelin mutation that caused his RBCD, whereas the patient with geographic opacities did not; instead, he had a new kerato-epithelin mutation (Arg124Leu), which cosegregated with his family members. The variant of RBCD characterized by honeycomb-shaped opacities is caused by an Arg555Gln kerato-epithelin mutation. On the other hand, a new kerato-epithelin mutation, Arg124Leu, was found to cause the RBCD variant characterized by recurrent epithelial erosions and progressive geographic subepithelial opacification. Codon 124 is a hot spot for kerato-epithelin mutations, where the mutations responsible for three autosomal dominant corneal dystrophies--lattice type I (Arg124Cys), Avellino (Arg124His), and the variant of RBCD with geographic rather than honeycomb opacities (Arg124Leu)--are located.

1302608	19921201	Analysis of mutations at the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) locus.	A panel of 200 unrelated NF1 individuals has been screened for mutations using a panel of specific clones for the entire gene. DNA analysis on conventional Southern blots indicated that (20) 10% of NF1 patients showed aberrant bands. Small lesions involving nucleotide alterations were detected in a further 10 patients; 5 of these alterations have been fully characterised and are the novel mutations in the NF1 gene. A number of mutations were identified in exon 2. Identical mutations in this exon in two unrelated individuals involved an insertion of cytosine into codon 5662 and resulted in an inappropriate stop codon. This mutation also created a new MnlI site. Another novel mutation in exon 2 resulted from the insertion of thymidine at nucleotide 5678, which also created an inappropriate stop codon.

20354562	20100401	Early onset and slow progression of SCA28, a rare dominant ataxia in a large four-generation family with a novel AFG3L2 mutation.	Autosomal dominantly inherited spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders primarily affecting the cerebellum. Genetically, 26 different loci have been identified so far, although the corresponding gene has not yet been determined for 10 of them. Recently, mutations in the ATPase family gene 3-like 2 gene were presented to cause SCA type 28. To define the frequency of SCA28 mutations, we performed molecular genetic analyses in 140 unrelated familial cases with ataxia. Among other variations, we found a novel missense mutation at an evolutionarily conserved amino-acid position using a single-strand conformation polymorphism approach, followed by DNA sequencing. This amino-acid exchange p.E700K was detected in a four-generation German family and was not observed in a survey of 400 chromosomes from healthy control individuals. 	Eur._J._Hum._Genet.

10612508	19991228	A novel mutation in the ABCR gene in four patients with autosomal recessive Stargardt disease.	To identify additional mutations in the ABCR gene and describe the clinical features of four affected siblings with autosomal recessive Stargardt disease. A cohort of eight siblings was identified for study. Four of these individuals were diagnosed with Stargardt disease based on clinical evaluation and fluorescein angiography. Blood samples were obtained from seven of eight siblings, including all those affected. All 50 exons of the ABCR gene were analyzed by single-stranded confirmation polymorphism analysis, followed by direct sequencing of observed variants, to identify mutations in the ABCR gene. We identified a previously unreported kindred of eight siblings, four of whom had mutations in both of their ABCR alleles. A previously described G-to-C transversion of nucleotide 2588, predicting a Gly863Ala amino acid substitution, and a novel G-to-A transition of nucleotide 161, resulting in a Cys54Tyr substitution, were identified. These mutations co-segregated with the affected members of this family. Three of the siblings demonstrated clinical features characteristic of classic Stargardt disease, with bilateral regions of macular atrophy associated with yellow-white &quot;flavimaculatus&quot; flecks in the posterior pole at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium. The fourth affected sibling showed features of early Stargardt disease, with a beaten-bronze appearance to both maculas, as well as perimacular flecks. In all four affected patients, fluorescein angiography showed a characteristic peripheral dark choroid. We have identified both a previously described and a novel mutation in the ABCR gene in four patients with autosomal recessive Stargardt disease. In-depth knowledge of the ABCR mutation spectrum in patients with Stargardt disease will provide for more efficient screening and may provide potential therapies for Stargardt disease and other retinal diseases.

11138012	20010104	Lipodystrophy in the fld mouse results from mutation of a new gene encoding a nuclear protein, lipin.	Mice carrying mutations in the fatty liver dystrophy (fld) gene have features of human lipodystrophy, a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by loss of body fat, fatty liver, hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance. Through positional cloning, we have isolated the gene responsible and characterized two independent mutant alleles, fld and fld(2J). The gene (Lpin1) encodes a novel nuclear protein which we have named lipin. Consistent with the observed reduction of adipose tissue mass in fld and fld(2J)mice, wild-type Lpin1 mRNA is expressed at high levels in adipose tissue and is induced during differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. Our results indicate that lipin is required for normal adipose tissue development, and provide a candidate gene for human lipodystrophy. Lipin defines a novel family of nuclear proteins containing at least three members in mammalian species, and homologs in distantly related organisms from human to yeast. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D013487
12716986	20030430	Molecular population genetics of inducible antibacterial peptide genes in Drosophila melanogaster.	Insects respond to septic infection in part by producing a suite of antimicrobial peptides that may be subject to host-pathogen coevolutionary dynamics. In order to infer population genetic forces acting on Drosophila antibacterial peptide genes, we examine global properties of polymorphism and divergence in the Drosophila melanogaster defensin, drosocin, metchnikowin, attacin C, diptericin A, and cecropin A, B, and C genes. As a functional class, antibacterial peptides exhibit low levels of interspecific amino acid divergence. There are multiple amino acid polymorphisms segregating within D. melanogaster, however, a high proportion of which change the charge or polarity of the variable residue. These polymorphisms are particularly prevalent in processed signal and propeptide domains. We find that models of coevolutionary &quot;arms races&quot; and selectively maintained hypervariability do not adequately describe the population dynamics of mature antibacterial peptides in D. melanogaster, but that a highly significant excess of high-frequency derived polymorphisms coupled with substantial intralocus linkage disequilibrium suggests that positive selection may act on antibacterial peptide genes. Some attributes of the data may be consistent with a simple demographic model of population founding followed by expansion, but departures from the equilibrium null tend to be more pronounced in the peptide genes than at other loci around the genome.

9160185	19970401	Molecular analysis of androgen resistance syndromes in Egyptian patients.	Androgen resistance syndromes [i.e. 5 alpha-reductase deficiency (5 alpha RD) and androgen receptor (AR) defects] are frequently reported among Egyptian intersex patients. This study examined AR and 5 alpha-reductase 2 (5 alpha R2) gene mutations among a sample of such cases as a first step towards instituting a screening program. Five families with a typical hormonal profile of 5 alpha RD were screened for major deletions of exons 3-5 of the 5 alpha R2 gene, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and electrophoresis. Thereafter, screening for point mutations was carried out by single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, followed by nucleotide sequencing. Seven patients with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) were subjected to molecular analysis of AR exons B-H by a similar protocol, except for the use of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) for screening point mutations. No major deletions were found in either gene. One family had abnormal electrophoretic mobility on SSCP of exon 5 of the 5 alpha R2 gene, resulting from a point mutation (C to T substitution) at codon 246. Another family, showing retarded mobility on DGGE, had a point mutation (G to A substitution) at codon 889 of the AR gene. In conclusion, the study revealed two mutations previously reported in other geographically distinct populations, inferring the possibility of mutational hot spots in the genes.

10391210	19990703	Patterns of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in candidate genes for blood-pressure homeostasis.	Sequence variation in human genes is largely confined to single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and is valuable in tests of association with common diseases and pharmacogenetic traits. We performed a systematic and comprehensive survey of molecular variation to assess the nature, pattern and frequency of SNPs in 75 candidate human genes for blood-pressure homeostasis and hypertension. We assayed 28 Mb (190 kb in 148 alleles) of genomic sequence, comprising the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), introns and coding sequence of these genes, for sequence differences in individuals of African and Northern European descent using high-density variant detection arrays (VDAs). We identified 874 candidate human SNPs, of which 22% were confirmed by DNA sequencing to reveal a discordancy rate of 21% for VDA detection. The SNPs detected have an average minor allele frequency of 11%, and 387 are within the coding sequence (cSNPs). Of all cSNPs, 54% lead to a predicted change in the protein sequence, implying a high level of human protein diversity. These protein-altering SNPs are 38% of the total number of such SNPs expected, are more likely to be population-specific and are rarer in the human population, directly demonstrating the effects of natural selection on human genes. Overall, the degree of nucleotide polymorphism across these human genes, and orthologous great ape sequences, is highly variable and is correlated with the effects of functional conservation on gene sequences.

22842227	20120731	NMNAT1 mutations cause Leber congenital amaurosis.	Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is an infantile-onset form of inherited retinal degeneration characterized by severe vision loss(1,2). Two-thirds of LCA cases are caused by mutations in 17 known disease-associated genes(3) (Retinal Information Network (RetNet)). Using exome sequencing we identified a homozygous missense mutation (c.25G&gt;A, p.Val9Met) in NMNAT1 that is likely to be disease causing in two siblings of a consanguineous Pakistani kindred affected by LCA. This mutation segregated with disease in the kindred, including in three other children with LCA. NMNAT1 resides in the previously identified LCA9 locus and encodes the nuclear isoform of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase, a rate-limiting enzyme in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) biosynthesis(4,5). Functional studies showed that the p.Val9Met alteration decreased NMNAT1 enzyme activity. Sequencing NMNAT1 in 284 unrelated families with LCA identified 14 rare mutations in 13 additional affected individuals. These results are the first to link an NMNAT isoform to disease in humans and indicate that NMNAT1 mutations cause LCA. 	Nat._Genet.	D002363 D016428 D052061 D013485
12387869	20021022	Functional screening of five PYPAF family members identifies PYPAF5 as a novel regulator of NF-kappaB and caspase-1.	PYRIN-containing Apaf-1-like proteins (PYPAFs) are a recently identified family of proteins thought to function in apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways. PYPAF1 and PYPAF7 proteins have been found to assemble with the PYRIN-CARD protein ASC and coordinate the activation of NF-kappaB and pro-caspase-1. To determine if other PYPAF family members function in pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, we screened five other PYPAF proteins (PYPAF2, PYPAF3, PYPAF4, PYPAF5 and PYPAF6) for their ability to activate NF-kappaB and pro-caspase-1. Co-expression of PYPAF5 with ASC results in a synergistic activation of NF-kappaB and the recruitment of PYPAF5 to punctate structures in the cytoplasm. The expression of PYPAF5 is highly restricted to granulocytes and T-cells, indicating a role for this protein in inflammatory signaling. In contrast, PYPAF2, PYPAF3, PYPAF4 and PYPAF6 failed to colocalize with ASC and activate NF-kappaB. PYPAF5 also synergistically activated caspase-1-dependent cytokine processing when co-expressed with ASC. These findings suggest that PYPAF5 functions in immune cells to coordinate the transduction of pro-inflammatory signals to the activation of NF-kappaB and pro-caspase-1. 	FEBS_Lett.	D016428
22125116	20111130	Identification and functional characterization of two novel mutations in the ?-helical loop (residues 484-503) of CYBB/gp91(phox) resulting in the rare X91(+) variant of chronic granulomatous disease.	Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is mainly caused by mutations in X-linked CYBB that encodes gp91. We have identified two novel mutations in CYBB resulting in the rare X91(+)-CGD variant, c.1500T&gt;G (p.Asp500Glu) in two male siblings and c.1463C&gt;A (p.Ala488Asp) in an unrelated male. Zymosan and/or PMA (Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate)-induced recruitment of p47(phox) and p67(phox) to the membrane fraction was normal for both mutants. Cell-free assays using recombinant wild-type and the mutant proteins revealed that these mutants were not activated by NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). Interestingly, the Ala488Asp mutant was activated by NADPH in the presence of glutathione. These data suggest that the mutations prevented NADPH from binding to gp91(phox) and the requirement of a negative charge at residue 500 in gp91(phox) for NADPH oxidase assembly, in contrast to a previously described Asp500Gly change. These mutations and the effect of glutathione provide a unique insight into disease pathogenesis and potential therapy in variant X91(+)-CGD. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428 D013485
9463797	19980217	Identification of two novel mutations in the hydroxymethylbilane synthase gene in three patients from two unrelated families with acute intermittent porphyria.	We have screened the hydroxymethylbilane synthase cDNAs of 3 patients from 2 families suffering from acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) from Scotland and South Africa using heteroduplex and chemical cleavage of mismatch analyses. Direct sequencing was used to characterise the mutations. The two novel mutations identified were a missense mutation at nucleotide position 64 in exon 3 (R22C) and a single base-pair deletion in exon 15. These mutations are predicted to affect the normal function of the enzyme and, therefore, are expected to be the primary cause of disease in these patients. 	Hum._Hered.	D016428 D013485
2580302	19850401	Structure of a gene for the human epidermal 67-kDa keratin.	We present the structure and nucleotide sequence of a gene encoding the human epidermal 67-kDa keratin. Three genomic clones were isolated from a lambda Charon 4A human genomic library by hybridization to a specific cDNA probe. One clone of 12.3 kilobase pairs was shown by R-loop, DNA sequence, and primer-extension analyses to encode an entire gene of about 6.25 kilobase pairs. Of eight identified introns, seven are located within the region that encodes the central coiled-coil alpha-helical domain of the protein. Except for one intron located at the end of the region encoding this domain, these do not delineate apparent structural subdomains. The positions of five of the introns exactly coincide with the positions of introns previously reported in the hamster gene for the intermediate filament protein vimentin [Quax, W., Egberts, W.V., Hendricks, W., Quax-Jeuken, Y. &amp; Bloemandal, H. (1983) Cell 35, 215-233]. These findings suggest that the human 67-kDa keratin and vimentin genes arose from a common ancestral gene. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428
11271497	20010329	Human ERp29: isolation, primary structural characterisation and two-dimensional gel mapping.	Recently we characterised a novel 29 kDa endoplasmic reticulum protein that is widely expressed in rat tissues, and named it ERp29. Several ERp29-like gene products have been reported in human tissues but uncertainty surrounds their relationships with each other and rat ERp29. To clarify these issues, ERp29 was isolated from human liver and characterised by primary structural analysis and two-dimensional gel mapping. Comparisons with rat ERp29 revealed striking homologies both in sequence and physical properties. Characterisation of the isoelectric heterogeneity and anomalous mass on two-dimensional gels enabled two reported homologues (UL35 and ERp31) to be identified as ERp29. Resolution of a sequence discrepancy led to unequivocal correlation of human ERp29 with the cognate cDNA previously named ERp31 and ERp28. Consequent links established to human genome and proteome projects showed that ERp29 is encoded by a gene on chromosome 12 that is expressed universally in human tissues. Together, these findings unified various ERp29 homologues as products of a single gene orthologous to rat ERp29 and established ERp29 as the only known member of a new protein class. Investigations of ERp29 function in human health and disease should benefit from the integrated links between genome, proteome and murine model organisms established here.

10677297	20000321	Mutations in the AIRE gene: effects on subcellular location and transactivation function of the autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy protein.	Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) is a monogenic autosomal disease with recessive inheritance. It is characterized by multiple autoimmune endocrinopathies, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and ectodermal dystrophies. The defective gene responsible for this disease was recently isolated, and several different mutations in the novel gene, AIRE, have been identified, by us and by others, in patients with APECED. We have shown that the APECED protein is mainly localized, both in vitro and in vivo, to the cell nucleus, where it forms distinct speckles. This accords with the predicted structural features of the protein, which suggest involvement of AIRE in the regulation of gene transcription. Here, we report the results of mutational analyses of a series of 112 patients with APECED who were from various ethnic backgrounds. A total of 16 different mutations, covering 91% of disease alleles, were observed; of these, 8 were novel. The mutations are spread throughout the coding region of AIRE, yet four evident mutational hotspots were observed. In vitro expression of four different naturally occurring nonsense and missense mutations revealed a dramatically altered subcellular location of the protein in cultured cells. Interestingly, the wild-type APECED protein tethered to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain acted as a strong transcriptional activator of reporter genes in mammalian cells, whereas most of the analyzed mutant polypeptides had lost this capacity.

9143503	19970415	The human E6-AP gene (UBE3A) encodes three potential protein isoforms generated by differential splicing.	The E6-AP gene (UBE3A) encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that binds the human papillomavirus E6 oncoprotein and catalyzes the ubiquitination of p53. Recent studies have also established that mutations in E6-AP are the genetic basis of the Angelman syndrome in humans. In this study we present the genomic structure of the coding region of E6-AP and an analysis of a set of five E6-AP mRNAs with the potential to encode three protein isoforms of the E6-AP protein (isoforms I, II, and III) that differ at their extreme amino-termini. These transcripts were expressed in a variety of different cell lines examined. 	Genomics	D016428 D013487
9769326	19981014	Effects of mutations in the human uncoupling protein 3 gene on the respiratory quotient and fat oxidation in severe obesity and type 2 diabetes.	Human uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) is a mitochondrial transmembrane carrier that uncouples oxidative ATP phosphorylation. With the capacity to participate in thermogenesis and energy balance, UCP3 is an important obesity candidate gene. A missense polymorphism in exon 3 (V102I) was identified in an obese and diabetic proband. A mutation introducing a stop codon in exon 4 (R143X) and a terminal polymorphism in the splice donor junction of exon 6 were also identified in a compound heterozygote that was morbidly obese and diabetic. Allele frequencies of the exon 3 and exon 6 splice junction polymorphisms were determined and found to be similar in Gullah-speaking African Americans and the Mende tribe of Sierra Leone, but absent in Caucasians. Moreover, in exon 6-splice donor heterozygotes, basal fat oxidation rates were reduced by 50%, and the respiratory quotient was markedly increased compared with wild-type individuals, implicating a role for UCP3 in metabolic fuel partitioning.

9651357	19980704	Isolation and characterization of PAGE-1 and GAGE-7. New genes expressed in the LNCaP prostate cancer progression model that share homology with melanoma-associated antigens.	The LNCaP progression model of human prostate cancer consists of lineage-related sublines that differ in their androgen sensitivity and metastatic potential. A differential display polymerase chain reaction was employed to evaluate mRNA expression differences between the LNCaP sublines in order to define the differences in gene expression between the androgen-sensitive, nontumorigenic LNCaP cell line and the androgen-insensitive, metastatic LNCaP sublines, C4-2 and C4-2B. An amplicon, BG16.21, was isolated that showed increased expression in the androgen-independent and metastatic LNCaP sublines, C4-2 and C4-2B. Hybridization screening of a lambda gt11 expression library with BG16.21 revealed two transcripts, both homologous to BG16.21 at the 3' end. A GenBankTM data base search using the GCG Wisconsin software package revealed the shorter approximately 600-bp transcript (designated GAGE-7) to be a new member of the GAGE family. The second approximately 700-bp transcript was a novel gene (designated PAGE-1, &quot;prostate associated gene&quot;) with only 45% homology to GAGE gene family members. RNA blot analysis demonstrated that GAGE-7 mRNA was expressed at equal levels in all lineage related prostate cancer cell sublines, while PAGE-1 mRNA levels were elevated 5-fold in C4-2 and C4-2B as compared with LNCaP cells. Neither GAGE-7 nor PAGE-1 demonstrated any regulation by androgens in the prostate cancer cell lines used in this study. PAGE-1 and GAGE-7 expression was found to be restricted to testes (high) and placenta (low) on human multiple tissue Northern blots. As GAGE/MAGE antigens were reported previously to be targets for tumor-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes in melanoma, these results suggest that PAGE-1 and GAGE-7 may be related to prostate cancer progression and may serve as potential targets for novel therapies.

23110205	20121031	Molecular analysis of RNF213 gene for moyamoya disease in the Chinese Han population.	Moyamoya disease (MMD) is an uncommon cerebrovascular disorder characterized by progressive occlusion of the internal carotid artery causing cerebral ischemia and hemorrhage. Genetic factors in the etiology and pathogenesis of MMD are being increasingly recognized. Previous studies have shown that the RNF213 gene was related to MMD susceptibility in the Japanese population. However, there is no large scale study of the association between this gene and MMD in the Chinese Han population. Thus we designed this case-control study to validate the R4810K mutation and to define the further spectrum of RNF213 mutations in Han Chinese. Genotyping of the R4810K mutation in the RNF213 gene was performed in 170 MMD cases and 507 controls from a Chinese Han population. The R4810K mutation was identified in 22 of 170 MMD cases (13%), including 21 heterozygotes and a single familial homozygote. Two of the 507 controls (0.4%) were heterozygous R4810K carriers. The R4810K mutation greatly increased the risk for MMD (OR = 36.7, 95% CI: 8.6~156.6, P = 6.1 E-15). The allele frequency of R4810K was significantly different between patients with ischemia and hemorrhage (OR = 5.4, 95% CI: 1.8~16.1, P = 0.001). Genomic sequencing covering RNF213 exon 40 to exon 68 also identified eight other non-R4810K variants; P4007R, Q4367L, A4399T, T4586P, L4631V, E4950D, A5021V and M5136I. Among them A4399T polymorphism was found in 28/170 cases (16.5%) and 45/507 controls (8.9%) and was associated with MMD (OR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.2~3.3, P = 0.004), especially with hemorrhage (OR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.2~6.5, P = 0.014). RNF213 mutations are associated with MMD susceptibility in Han Chinese. The ischemic type MMD is particularly related to the R4810K mutation. However, A4399T is also a susceptible variant for MMD, primarily associated with hemorrhage. Identification of novel variants in the RNF213 gene further highlights the genetic heterogeneity of MMD.

22341972	20120221	Syndrome of hepatic cirrhosis, dystonia, polycythemia, and hypermanganesemia caused by mutations in SLC30A10, a manganese transporter in man.	Environmental manganese (Mn) toxicity causes an extrapyramidal, parkinsonian-type movement disorder with characteristic magnetic resonance images of Mn accumulation in the basal ganglia. We have recently reported a suspected autosomal recessively inherited syndrome of hepatic cirrhosis, dystonia, polycythemia, and hypermanganesemia in cases without environmental Mn exposure. Whole-genome mapping of two consanguineous families identified SLC30A10 as the affected gene in this inherited type of hypermanganesemia. This gene was subsequently sequenced in eight families, and homozygous sequence changes were identified in all affected individuals. The function of the wild-type protein and the effect of sequence changes were studied in the manganese-sensitive yeast strain ?pmr1. Expressing human wild-type SLC30A10 in the ?pmr1 yeast strain rescued growth in high Mn conditions, confirming its role in Mn transport. The presence of missense (c.266T&gt;C [p.Leu89Pro]) and nonsense (c.585del [p.Thr196Profs(?)17]) mutations in SLC30A10 failed to restore Mn resistance. Previously, SLC30A10 had been presumed to be a zinc transporter. However, this work has confirmed that SLC30A10 functions as a Mn transporter in humans that, when defective, causes Mn accumulation in liver and brain. This is an important step toward understanding Mn transport and its role in neurodegenerative processes. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
9933300	19990518	Mapping, genomic structure, and polymorphisms of the human GABABR1 receptor gene: evaluation of its involvement in idiopathic generalized epilepsy.	Neurophysiological and pharmacological studies suggest a major role of the GABAB receptor in the epileptogenesis of absence seizures. The gene encoding the human GABABR1 receptor (GABABR1) has recently been mapped to human chromosome 6p21.3 by in situ hybridization, a region that harbors a susceptibility locus (EJM1) for idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). We investigated the hypothesis that the GABABR1 gene (GABBR1) represents a candidate gene for EJM1 by: (1) defining the precise localization approximately 130 kilobases telomeric to the HLA-F locus, (2) by characterizing its genomic organization, and (3) by mutation screening of the entire coding region of GABBR1 in 18 German patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) who were derived from families with evidence for linkage to chromosome 6p21.3 (cumulative lod score Z=3.17 at HLA-DQ). The GABAB receptor gene consists of 22 translated exons. The two alternative transcripts, GABABR1a and GABABR1b, are derived from the same locus but they differ in their alternative 5'-exons. Mutation analyses in JME revealed several DNA sequence polymorphisms, two of which result in amino acid changes occurring in all IGE-affected members of two families. However, clinically unaffected relatives did carry the same variations, excluding these amino acid substitutions as the cause for IGE in these families. 	Neurogenetics	D016428 D013485
10884424	20000708	Dysfunction of human Rad18 results in defective postreplication repair and hypersensitivity to multiple mutagens.	Postreplication repair functions in gap-filling of a daughter strand on replication of damaged DNA. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad18 protein plays a pivotal role in the process together with the Rad6 protein. Here, we have cloned a human homologue of RAD18, hRAD18. It maps on chromosome 3p24-25, where deletions are often found in lung, breast, ovary, and testis cancers. In vivo, hRad18 protein binds to hHR6 protein through a conserved ring-finger motif. Stable transformants with hRad18 mutated in this motif become sensitive to UV, methyl methanesulfonate, and mitomycin C, and are defective in the replication of UV-damaged DNA. Thus, hRAD18 is a functional homologue of RAD18. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D003160 D016428 D013485
17211858	20070111	Three arginine to cysteine substitutions in the pro-alpha (I)-collagen chain cause Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with a propensity to arterial rupture in early adulthood.	Mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, encoding the proalpha1 and 2 chains of type I collagen, cause osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) arthrochalasis type. Although the majority of missense mutations in the collagen type I triple helix affect glycine residues in the Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeat, few nonglycine substitutions have been reported. Two arginine-to-cysteine substitutions in the alpha1(I)-collagen chain are associated with classic EDS [R134C (p.R312C)] or autosomal dominant Caffey disease with mild EDS features [R836C (p.R1014C)]. Here we show alpha1(I) R-to-C substitutions in three unrelated patients who developed iliac or femoral dissection in early adulthood. In addition, manifestations of classic EDS in Patient 1 [c.1053C&gt;T; R134C (p.R312C); X-position] or osteopenia in Patients 2 [c.1839C&gt;T; R396C (p.R574C); Y-position] and 3 [c.3396C&gt;T; R915C (p.R1093C); Y-position] are seen. Dermal fibroblasts from the patients produced disulfide-bonded alpha1(I)-dimers in approximately 20% of type I collagen, which were efficiently secreted into the medium in case of the R396C and R915C substitution. Theoretical stability calculations of the collagen type I heterotrimer and thermal denaturation curves of monomeric mutant alpha1(I)-collagen chains showed minor destabilization of the collagen helix. However, dimers were shown to be highly unstable. The R134C and R396C caused delayed procollagen processing by N-proteinase. Ultrastructural findings showed collagen fibrils with variable diameter and irregular interfibrillar spaces, suggesting disturbed collagen fibrillogenesis. Our findings demonstrate that R-to-C substitutions in the alpha1(I) chain may result in a phenotype with propensity to arterial rupture in early adulthood. This broadens the phenotypic range of nonglycine substitutions in collagen type I and has important implications for genetic counseling and follow-up of patients carrying this type of mutation.

At least four types are recognized (WS1, WS2, WS3 and WS4) on the basis of clinical and genetic criteria. Two previously described families seemed to delineate a new subtype characterized by WS2 in conjunction with ocular albinism (OA). Since mutations in the MITF gene are responsible for some instances of WS2, we screened for mutations in one of the WS2-OA families and discovered a 1 bp deletion in exon 8 of MITF. OA previously has been associated with compound heterozygosity for a mutant TYR allele and the TYR(R402Q) allele, a functionally significant polymorphism that is associated with moderately reduced tyrosinase catalytic activity. In this family, all of the individuals with the OA phenotype are either homozygous or heterozygous for TYR(R402Q), and heterozyous for the 1 bp deletion in MITF This suggests that the WS2-OA phenotype may result from digenic interaction between a gene for a transcription factor (MITF) and a gene that it regulates (TYR).

1306120	19921001	Guinea pig or rabbit lung flavin-containing monooxygenases with distinct mobilities in SDS-PAGE are allelic variants that differ at only two positions.	Both guinea pig and rabbit express two variants of the 'lung' flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO), observed as three distinct phenotypes based on mobility differences in SDS-PAGE. Samples of messenger RNA prepared from lungs of the two homozygous phenotypes of the guinea pig were used for the construction of two cDNA libraries. The libraries were screened with a cDNA encoding the rabbit lung FMO, and positive clones for each guinea pig lung FMO variant were isolated and sequenced. A full length clone from each library was found to encode a protein of 535 amino acids containing two pyrophosphate binding sites. Comparison of the sequences of the guinea pig and rabbit lung FMOs shows that their primary structures are 86% identical. The coding region sequences of the guinea pig variants differ at only two positions, and both differences result in amino acid substitutions. Sequence analysis has also been completed on a partially characterized variant of the rabbit lung FMO. As with the guinea pig, the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the rabbit variants differ at only two positions. The cDNAs encoding the guinea pig variants were expressed in yeast. The activities of the enzymes are characteristic of the lung FMO, and the mobilities of the expressed enzymes are the same as those observed for the variants present in guinea pig pulmonary microsomal preparations. Similar to findings for the rabbit, analysis of genomic DNA indicates that the guinea pig lung FMO is associated with a single gene. The results of cDNA sequence analysis, expression in yeast, and analysis of genomic DNA indicate that the multiple lung FMOs in guinea pig and rabbit are allelic variants whose mobilities in SDS-PAGE are markedly altered by minimal changes in primary structure.

8797891	19960801	E-cadherin gene mutations in signet ring cell carcinoma of the stomach.	To clarify the significance of E-cadherin gene alterations in the development of diffuse-type adenocarcinoma of the stomach, we analyzed mutations of the E-cadherin gene using the polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) method followed by direct sequencing. Twenty-two signet ring cell carcinomas of the stomach (10 intramucosal and 12 advanced cancers) were examined. Genomic DNA was extracted separately from cancerous and non-cancerous tissues and PCR-SSCP analysis was performed on exons 5 to 9 and the adjacent 30- to 40-base-pair intron sequences of the E-cadherin gene. Mobility shifts were found in 2 of the 10 intramucosal cancers. In 2 of the 12 advanced cancers, abnormalities of the E-cadherin gene were observed in intramucosal lesions as well as in deeply invaded areas. These results indicated that E-cadherin gene mutations are an early event in the development of signet ring cell carcinoma of the stomach. Direct sequencing revealed that the locations of mutations of the E-cadherin gene included the branch point sequence in the intron which is responsible for RNA splicing. Reverse transcriptase-PCR demonstrated aberrant RNA splicing in a case with a branch point mutation, suggesting that branch point mutations play an important role in functional modifications of E-cadherin in signet ring cell carcinoma of the stomach.

23122587	20121106	Mutations of the gene encoding otogelin are a cause of autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic moderate hearing impairment.	Already 40 genes have been identified for autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment (arNSHI); however, many more genes are still to be identified. In a Dutch family segregating arNSHI, homozygosity mapping revealed a 2.4 Mb homozygous region on chromosome 11 in p15.1-15.2, which partially overlapped with the previously described DFNB18 locus. However, no putative pathogenic variants were found in USH1C, the gene mutated in DFNB18 hearing impairment. The homozygous region contained 12 additional annotated genes including OTOG, the gene encoding otogelin, a component of the tectorial membrane. It is thought that otogelin contributes to the stability and strength of this membrane through interaction or stabilization of its constituent fibers. The murine orthologous gene was already known to cause hearing loss when defective. Analysis of OTOG in the Dutch family revealed a homozygous 1 bp deletion, c.5508delC, which leads to a shift in the reading frame and a premature stop codon, p.Ala1838ProfsX31. Further screening of 60 unrelated probands from Spanish arNSHI families detected compound heterozygous OTOG mutations in one family, c.6347C&gt;T (p.Pro2116Leu) and c. 6559C&gt;T (p.Arg2187X). The missense mutation p.Pro2116Leu affects a highly conserved residue in the fourth von Willebrand factor type D domain of otogelin. The subjects with OTOG mutations have a moderate hearing impairment, which can be associated with vestibular dysfunction. The flat to shallow &quot;U&quot; or slightly downsloping shaped audiograms closely resembled audiograms of individuals with recessive mutations in the gene encoding ?-tectorin, another component of the tectorial membrane. This distinctive phenotype may represent a clue to orientate the molecular diagnosis. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D002363 D016428 D013485
26486472	20151022	West syndrome caused by homozygous variant in the evolutionary conserved gene encoding the mitochondrial elongation factor GUF1.	West syndrome (WS), defined by the triad of infantile spasms, pathognomonic hypsarrhythmia and developmental regression, is a rare epileptic disease affecting about 1:3500 live births. To get better insights on the genetic of this pathology, we exome-sequenced the members of a consanguineous family affected with isolated WS. We identified a homozygous variant (c.1825G&gt;T/p.(Ala609Ser)) in the GUF1 gene in the three affected siblings. GUF1 encodes a protein essential in conditions that counteract faithful protein synthesis: it is able to remobilize stuck ribosomes and transiently inhibit the elongation process to optimize protein synthesis. The variant identified in the WS family changes an alanine residue conserved in all eukaryotic organisms and positioned within the tRNA-binding moiety of this nuclear genome-encoded mitochondrial translational elongation factor. Yeast complementation assays show that the activity of GUF1(A609S) is modified in suboptimal environments. We suggest a new link between improper assembly of respiratory chain complexes and WS.

20428114	20100430	Mutations of optineurin in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has its onset in middle age and is a progressive disorder characterized by degeneration of motor neurons of the primary motor cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. Most cases of ALS are sporadic, but about 10% are familial. Genes known to cause classic familial ALS (FALS) are superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), ANG encoding angiogenin, TARDP encoding transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein TDP-43 (ref. 4) and fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma (FUS, also known as TLS). However, these genetic defects occur in only about 20-30% of cases of FALS, and most genes causing FALS are unknown. Here we show that there are mutations in the gene encoding optineurin (OPTN), earlier reported to be a causative gene of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), in patients with ALS. We found three types of mutation of OPTN: a homozygous deletion of exon 5, a homozygous Q398X nonsense mutation and a heterozygous E478G missense mutation within its ubiquitin-binding domain. Analysis of cell transfection showed that the nonsense and missense mutations of OPTN abolished the inhibition of activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), and the E478G mutation revealed a cytoplasmic distribution different from that of the wild type or a POAG mutation. A case with the E478G mutation showed OPTN-immunoreactive cytoplasmic inclusions. Furthermore, TDP-43- or SOD1-positive inclusions of sporadic and SOD1 cases of ALS were also noticeably immunolabelled by anti-OPTN antibodies. Our findings strongly suggest that OPTN is involved in the pathogenesis of ALS. They also indicate that NF-kappaB inhibitors could be used to treat ALS and that transgenic mice bearing various mutations of OPTN will be relevant in developing new drugs for this disorder.

17822861	20070908	New mutations identified in the ocular albinism type 1 gene.	As the most common form of ocular albinism, ocular albinism type I (OA1) is an X-linked disorder that has an estimated prevalence of about 1:50,000. We searched for mutations through the human genome sequence draft by direct sequencing on eighteen patients with OA1, both within the coding region and in a thousand base pairs upstream of its start site. Here, we have identified eight new mutations located in the coding region of the gene. Two independent mutations, both located in the most carboxyterminal protein regions, were further characterized by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, thus showing an impairment in their subcellular distribution into the lysosomal compartment of Cos-7A cells. The mutations found can result in protein misfolding, thus underlining the importance of the structure-function relationships of the protein as a major pathogenic mechanism in ocular albinism. Seven individuals out of eighteen (38.9%) with a clinical diagnosis of ocular albinism showed mutations, thus underlining the discrepancies between the clinical phenotype features and their genotype correlations. We postulate that mutations that have not yet been identified are potentially located in non-coding conserved regions or regulatory sequences of the OA1 gene. 	Gene	D016428 D013485
9566969	19980613	Characterization of the human homologue of the yeast spc98p and its association with gamma-tubulin.	A trimeric complex formed by Tub4p, the budding yeast gamma-tubulin, and the two spindle pole body components, Spc98p and Spc97p, has recently been characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We reasoned that crucial functions, such as the control of microtubule nucleation, could be maintained among divergent species. SPC98-related sequences were searched in dbEST using the BLASTN program. Primers derived from the human expressed sequence tag matching SPC98 were used to clone the 5' and 3' cDNA ends by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR. The human Spc98 cDNA presents an alternative splicing at the 3' end. The deduced protein possesses 22% identity and 45% similarity with the yeast homologue. We further report that the human Spc98p, like gamma-tubulin, is concentrated at the centrosome, although a large fraction is found in cytosolic complexes. Sucrose gradient sedimentation of the cytosolic fraction and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that both gamma-tubulin and HsSpc98p are in the same complex. Interestingly, Xenopus sperm centrosomes, which are incompetent for microtubule nucleation before their activation in the egg cytoplasm, were found to contain similar amounts of both Spc98p and gamma-tubulin to human somatic centrosomes, which are competent for microtubule nucleation. Finally, affinity-purified antibodies against Spc98p inhibit microtubule nucleation on isolated centrosomes, as well as in microinjected cells, suggesting that this novel protein is indeed required for the nucleation reaction.

11735023	20011206	Evaluation of denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) for the mutational analysis of the neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1) gene.	The identification of mutations in the NF1 gene causing type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1) has presented a considerable challenge because of the large size of the gene, the lack of significant mutational clustering, the diversity of the underlying pathological lesions and the presence of NF1 pseudogenes. Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), a high throughput, non-hazardous and largely automated heteroduplex-based technique, is in many ways ideally suited to mutation detection in this condition. DHPLC was therefore optimised for the rapid screening of the 60 exons and splice junctions of the NF1 gene in patients with NF1. The sensitivity of DHPLC was evaluated in a retrospective study of a cohort of 111 unrelated NF1 patients with known germline mutations; 97% of mutations were detected. In a subsequent prospective analysis of 50 unrelated NF1 patients, germline mutations were identified in 34 individuals (68%), 22 of these alterations being novel. This represents the highest rate of mutation detection so far reported for the NF1 gene with a single screening technique and genomic DNA as a target. 	Hum._Genet.	D023362 D016428 D013485

8924211	19960501	Human phenol sulfotransferase gene contains two alternative promoters: Structure and expression of the gene.	Phenol sulfotransferases catalyze the transfer of a sulfonate moiety from 3'-phosphoadenosyl 5'-phosphosulfate to a phenolic group of lipophylic substrates to generate soluble sulfate esters. Using a phenol sulfotransferase cDNA as probe to screen a human leukocyte genomic DNA library constructed in lambda EMBL3, we obtained a clone containing a complete gene sequence. Comparison of the gene sequence with that of the corresponding cDNAs, namely phenol-sulfating phenol sulfotransferase (P-PST) or thermostable sulfotransferase (TS-PST), and human aryl sulfotransferase 1 and 2 (HAST1 and HAST2) indicates that the gene possesses eight short exons separated by seven introns included in approximately 5 kb. HAST2 has a different 5' untranslated sequence, and thus is encoded by a different mRNA species. While the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the 5' noncoding region of P-PST (TS-PST and HAST1) is included in the exon I, the 5' untranslated sequence of HAST2 is located in the beginning of exon IIa. The remaining sequence in exon II that is identical to both P-PST and HAST2 was termed exon IIb. Exons III to VIII, which cover the coding region and the 3' untranslated region, are almost identical in all types of PST or AST cDNAs. These results suggest that the phenol sulfotransferase gene possesses two alternate promoters that drive the expression of the two different mRNA species in a tissue-specific manner. Transfection of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene vectors containing the 5'-flanking sequence upstream from exon I and exon II, respectively, in transformed human embryonal kidney (293) cells indicate that both sequences possess promoter activity with higher activity for promoter 1. RNA blot analysis indicates that human phenol sulfotransferase gene is expressed in kidney, liver, lung, leukocyte, colon, small intestine, and spleen. 	DNA_Cell_Biol.	D016428 D013485
7525450	19941101	Detection of more than 50 different CFTR mutations in a large group of German cystic fibrosis patients.	We have conducted a comprehensive study of the molecular basis of cystic fibrosis (CF) in 350 German CF patients. A screening approach based on single-strand conformation analysis and direct sequencing of genomic polymerase chain reaction products has allowed us to detect the molecular defects on 95.4% of the CF chromosomes within the coding region and splice sites of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The spectrum of sequence changes comprises 54 different mutations, including 17 missense mutations, 14 nonsense mutations, 11 frameshift mutations, 10 splice site variants and two amino acid deletions. Eleven of these mutations have not previously been described. Our results reflect the marked mutational heterogeneity of CF in a large sample of patients from a non-isolated population. 	Hum._Genet.

9689598	19980805	Genomic organisation, alternative splicing and polymorphisms of the human cardiac troponin T gene.	Troponin T (TnT) is a component of the troponin complex which regulates muscle contraction in response to alterations in intracellular calcium ion concentration. In human heart, multiple isoforms of cardiac TnT have been described on the basis of antibody studies and molecular cloning of corresponding cDNAs. These isoforms are all derived from the transcription of a single gene, TNNT2, located on chromosome 1q32, and generated by alternative splicing. We show here that isoform diversity is achieved by the use of both alternative exons and alternative acceptor sites and present the organisation of the human TNNT2 gene, which is composed of 17 exons spread over 17 kb. A potential structure of the promoter region is also presented. Several polymorphisms in both the exonic and intronic regions were identified, some of which may act as modulators of the expression of this gene. 	J._Mol._Cell._Cardiol.	D016428 D013485
10936054	20000811	Cloning and chromosomal localization of a human class III myosin.	Two class III myosins have been identified to date: NINAC from Drosophila melanogaster and MyoIII(Lim) from Limulus polyphemus. Both have N-terminal kinase domains and are expressed exclusively in photoreceptors. Mutations in NINAC have been shown to alter the photoresponse and compromise photoreceptor survival. We report the cloning and chromosomal localization of a human class III myosin, MYO3A, from retina and a retinal pigment epithelial cell line. Human MYO3A (which we will refer to simply as MYO3A) possesses an N-terminal kinase domain and three consensus calmodulin-binding (IQ) motifs, two in the neck and one in the tail domain. We detected two MYO3A splice variants differing by 52 amino acids near the kinase/myosin junction. On Northern blots, MYO3A probes detected a 6. 5-kb transcript in human and monkey retina, in a cultured human RPE cell line (RPE-19), and at much lower levels in human pancreas. A somatic hybrid panel PCR screen localized MYO3A to human chromosome 10, and a radiation hybrid screen further localized it proximal to marker D10S197, which is located at 10p11.1 on the human cytogenetic map. Since mutations in NINAC have been shown to alter the photoresponse and compromise photoreceptor survival, the human homologue MYO3A may also play a role in photoreceptor function and/or maintenance.

8740918	19960201	Two novel missense mutations in the LDL receptor gene causing familial hypercholesterolemia.	We have employed analysis of single-strand conformation polymorphisms to identify mutations in the low density lipoprotein receptor gene causing familial hypercholesterolemia. Two familial hypercholesterolemia heterozygotes had abnormal single-strand conformation polymorphism patterns of exons 4 and 8. DNA sequencing revealed that the abnormal pattern of exon 4 was due to heterozygosity (G/T) at nucleotide 502. Nucleotide 502 is the first base of codon 147, and the G-&gt;T mutation (D147Y) changes this codon from AspGAC to TyrUAC. The abnormal pattern of exon 8 was due to heterozygosity (A/G) at nucleotide 1097. Nucleotide 1097 is the second base of codon 345, and the A-&gt;G mutation (Q345R) changes this codon from GlnCAG to ArgCGG. Based upon screening of 437 unrelated familial hypercholesterolemia heterozygotes, both D147Y and Q345R account for about 0.5% of the mutations causing familial hypercholesterolemia in Norway.

12473753	20021211	Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles is allelic to hereditary inclusion body myopathy.	Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV) is an autosomal-recessive disorder with preferential involvement of the tibialis anterior muscle that starts in young adulthood and spares quadriceps muscles. The disease locus has been mapped to chromosome 9p1-q1, the same region as the hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) locus. HIBM was originally described as rimmed vacuole myopathy sparing the quadriceps; therefore, the two diseases have been suspected to be allelic. Recently, HIBM was shown to be associated with the mutations in the gene encoding the bifunctional enzyme, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE). To determine whether DMRV and HIBM are allelic. The GNE gene was sequenced in 34 patients with DMRV. The epimerase activity in lymphocytes from eight DMRV patients was also measured. The authors identified 27 unrelated DMRV patients with homozygous or compound-heterozygous mutations in the GNE gene. DMRV patients had markedly decreased epimerase activity. DMRV is allelic to HIBM. Various mutations are associated with DMRV in Japan. The loss-of-function mutations in the GNE gene appear to cause DMRV/HIBM. 	Neurology	D016428
8874200	19961015	Identification of an unusual Fc gamma receptor IIIa (CD16) on natural killer cells in a patient with recurrent infections.	We found an unusual fc gamma receptor IIIa (CD16) phenotype on the natural killer (NK) cells of a 3-year-old boy, who suffered from recurrent viral respiratory tract infections since birth. He also had severe clinical problems after Bacille Calmette-Geérin (BCG) vaccination and following Epstein-Barr virus and Varicella Zoster virus infections. His peripheral blood lymphocytes contained a normal percentage and absolute number of CD3-CD7+ cells, which were positively stained with the CD16 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) 3G8 and CLBFcRgran1, but did marginally stain with the CD16 MoAb Lau11c/B73.1. Fc gamma RillIb expression on granulocytes appeared to be normal. NK cell function, analyzed in vitro by direct cytotoxicity on K562 target cells and ADCC-activity on P815 target cells, was normal compared with an age-matched healthy control. Sequence analysis of the Fc gamma RIIIA gene, encoding CD16 on NK cells and macrophages, showed a T to A nucleotide substitution at position 230 on both alleles, predicting a leucine (L) to histidine (H) amino acid change position 48 in the first extracellular lg-like domain of Fc gamma RIIIa, which contains the Leu11c/B73.1 epitope. The combined use of CD16 and CD56 MoAbs labeled with the same fluorescent dye, as often applied in routine immunophenotyping procedures, will leave these homozygotes undiagnosed. The pattern of infections in this patient is in agreement with the postulated function of NK cells in the immunological defense against viruses and other intracellular microorganisms. Further analysis of the NK cell function in vitro and follow-up of the clinical course of Fc gamma RIIIA-48H/H homozygotes is required to ascertain whether this genotype is causally related to an NK cell immunodeficiency.

17093393	20061110	Identification of novel FZD4 mutations in Indian patients with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy.	To identify novel mutations in FZD4 gene that cause familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) in Indian patients. The study was conducted on 75 subjects from 53 Indian families. These families were clinically diagnosed to have FEVR by fundus examination and fluorescein angiography. The candidate gene FZD4 was amplified from genomic DNA and PCR products were screened for mutations by single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), TA-cloning followed by bi-directional sequencing. For the FZD4 exonic region, three mutations were identified, including two novel sequence variations (C204R, F82fsX135) and one reported (P33S) mutation. These sequence changes were not observed in 100 normal controls and clinically unaffected family members analyzed. Mutations in FZD4 were observed in 5.6% of the clinically diagnosed FEVR, in the studied Indian population. The identified genetic variations of FZD4 could play a vital role in pathogenesis and provide greater insight in to the genotype/phenotypic functions of FZD4 gene. 	Mol._Vis.	D016428
16533793	20060315	Distinct epidermal growth factor receptor and KRAS mutation patterns in non-small cell lung cancer patients with different tobacco exposure and clinicopathologic features.	This study evaluated the mutational profile of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and KRAS in non-small cell lung cancers in Hong Kong and determined their relation with smoking history and other clinicopathologic features. Mutational profile of exons 18 to 21 of EGFR and codons 12, 13, and 61 of KRAS were determined in 215 adenocarcinomas, 15 squamous cell (SCC), and 11 EBV-associated lymphoepithelioma-like carcinomas (LELC). EGFR mutations were prevalent in adenocarcinomas (115 of 215), uncommon in LELC (1 of 11), and not found in SCC (P &lt; 0.001). Among adenocarcinomas, mutations were associated with nonsmokers (83 of 111; P &lt; 0.001), female gender (87 of 131; P &lt; 0.001), and well-differentiated (55 of 86) compared with poorly differentiated (11 of 41) tumors (P &lt; 0.001). Decreasing mutation rates with increasing direct tobacco exposure was observed, with 74.8% (83 of 111) in nonsmokers, 61.1% (11 of 18) in passive, 35.7% (10 of 28) in previous, and 19.0% (11 of 58) in current smokers. There were 53% amino acid substitutions, 43% in-frame deletions, and 4% insertions. Complex patterns with 13% double mutations, including five novel substitutions, were observed. For KRAS, mutations occurred in adenocarcinoma only (21 of 215) and were associated with smokers (11 of 58; P = 0.003), men (14 of 84; P = 0.009) and poorly differentiated (7 of 41) compared with well-differentiated (4 of 86) tumors (P = 0.037). EGFR and KRAS mutations occurred in mutually exclusive tumors. Regression analysis showed smoking history was the significant determinant for both mutations, whereas gender was a confounding factor. This study shows EGFR mutations are prevalent in lung adenocarcinoma and suggests that it plays an increasing oncogenic role with decreasing direct tobacco damage. 	Clin._Cancer_Res.

9872452	19990101	Prediction of the coding sequences of unidentified human genes. XI. The complete sequences of 100 new cDNA clones from brain which code for large proteins in vitro.	In our series of projects for accumulating sequence information on the coding sequences of unidentified human genes, we have newly determined the sequences of 100 cDNA clones from a set of size-fractionated human brain cDNA libraries, and predicted the coding sequences of the corresponding genes, named KIAA0711 to KIAA0810. These cDNA clones were selected according to their coding potentials of large proteins (50 kDa and more) in vitro. The average sizes of the inserts and corresponding open reading frames were 4.3 kb and 2.6 kb (869 amino acid residues), respectively. Sequence analyses against the public databases indicated that the predicted coding sequences of 78 genes were similar to those of known genes, 64% of which (50 genes) were categorized as proteins functionally related to cell signaling/communication, cell structure/motility and nucleic acid management. As additional information concerning genes characterized in this study, the chromosomal locations of the clones were determined by using human-rodent hybrid panels and the expression profiles among 10 human tissues were examined by reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction which was substantially improved by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

10608886	19991223	Novel selenoproteins identified in silico and in vivo by using a conserved RNA structural motif.	Selenocysteine is incorporated into selenoproteins by an in-frame UGA codon whose readthrough requires the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS), a conserved hairpin in the 3'-untranslated region of eukaryotic selenoprotein mRNAs. To identify new selenoproteins, we developed a strategy that obviates the need for prior amino acid sequence information. A computational screen was used to scan nucleotide sequence data bases for sequences presenting a potential SECIS secondary structure. The computer-selected hairpins were then assayed in vivo for their functional capacities, and the cDNAs corresponding to the SECIS winners were identified. Four of them encoded novel selenoproteins as confirmed by in vivo experiments. Among these, SelZf1 and SelZf2 share a common domain with mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase-2. The three proteins, however, possess distinct N-terminal domains. We found that another protein, SelX, displays sequence similarity to a protein involved in bacterial pilus formation. For the first time, four novel selenoproteins were discovered based on a computational screen for the RNA hairpin directing selenocysteine incorporation. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
9097956	19970401	Distribution of mutations in the PEX gene in families with X-linked hypophosphataemic rickets (HYP).	Mutations in the PEX gene at Xp22.1 (phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases, on the X-chromosome), are responsible for X-linked hypophosphataemic rickets (HYP). Homology of PEX to the M13 family of Zn2+ metallopeptidases which include neprilysin (NEP) as prototype, has raised important questions regarding PEX function at the molecular level. The aim of this study was to analyse 99 HYP families for PEX gene mutations, and to correlate predicted changes in the protein structure with Zn2+ metallopeptidase gene function. Primers flanking 22 characterised exons were used to amplify DNA by PCR, and SSCP was then used to screen for mutations. Deletions, insertions, nonsense mutations, stop codons and splice mutations occurred in 83% of families screened for in all 22 exons, and 51% of a separate set of families screened in 17 PEX gene exons. Missense mutations in four regions of the gene were informative regarding function, with one mutation in the Zn2+-binding site predicted to alter substrate enzyme interaction and catalysis. Computer analysis of the remaining mutations predicted changes in secondary structure, N-glycosylation, protein phosphorylation and catalytic site molecular structure. The wide range of mutations that align with regions required for protease activity in NEP suggests that PEX also functions as a protease, and may act by processing factor(s) involved in bone mineral metabolism.

1419804	19920901	Defects in type IIA von Willebrand disease: a cysteine 509 to arginine substitution in the mature von Willebrand factor disrupts a disulphide loop involved in the interaction with platelet glycoprotein Ib-IX.	Type IIA von Willebrand disease (vWD) is characterized by the loss of high and intermediate weight multimers of von Willebrand factor (vWF) from plasma. The 3' end of exon 28 in the vWF gene from four type IIA vWD patients was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, cloned and sequenced. Sequencing identified two potential missense mutations resulting in the amino acid substitutions Arg 834--&gt;Gln and Glu 875--&gt;Lys in the mature vWF subunit within an area of vWF where mutations in type IIA vWD have been reported. Neither of these amino acid substitutions was found in over 100 normal alleles tested by allele specific oligonucleotide hybridization. A polymorphism (Val 802--&gt;Leu) was identified in another patient. Other areas of exon 28 were analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and DNA from one patient demonstrated an irregular DGGE pattern on the 5' end of the exon. Sequencing demonstrated an amino acid substitution of an arginine for cysteine at position 509 adjacent to an area of vWF where defects associated with type IIB vWD have been found. This substitution was not found in 100 normal chromosomes tested by restriction enzyme digestion. The Cys 509--&gt;Arg substitution eliminates an intramolecular disulphide bridge formed by Cys 509 and Cys 695 which is important to maintain the configuration of vWF functional domains that interact with platelet glycoprotein Ib-IX.

10677561	20000226	Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus associated with a novel mutation in the vasopressin-neurophysin II gene.	Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI) is an autosomal dominant disorder of renal water conservation due to deficiency of arginine vasopressin as the result of mutations in the arginine vasopressin-neurophysin II (AVP-NPII) gene that encodes the hormone or its carrier protein. Thirty-one different mutations have been reported. In this study, we evaluated the AVP-NPII gene in a family with FNDI and identified a new mutation (1911Gright curved arrow A) in the coding sequence for NPII in affected family members. This mutation substitutes Tyr for 74 Cys in the NPII moiety. NPII is an intracellular carrier protein for AVP during the axonal transport from the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary and contains 14 conserved cysteine residues forming 7 disulfide bonds. Because the mutation cosegregates with the phenotype, it is possible that this mutation causes neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus in this family. 	Int._J._Mol._Med.	D016428
12213873	20020906	High prevalence of a novel mutation (2268 insT) of the thyroid peroxidase gene in Taiwanese patients with total iodide organification defect, and evidence for a founder effect.	The mutation of the thyroid peroxidase (TPO) gene that causes the total iodide organification defect (TIOD) is a common and severe condition leading to dyshormonogenesis of the thyroid gland in Caucasians. However, the role of TIOD in Chinese patients with thyroid dyshormonogenesis is unknown. In this study we followed 16 patients from 16 unrelated families in Taiwan and performed perchlorate discharge examination. Seven patients had TIOD and 2 had the partial iodine organification defect (PIOD) among the 16 families. These 9 patients underwent screening in search of TPO gene mutations. Three new mutations (2268 insT, 2243 delT, and G157C) were detected in the 7 patients with TIOD, whereas no mutation in the TPO gene was found in the 2 patients with PIOD. The 2268 insT mutation was noted to be the most common among these TIOD patients (12 of 14 studied alleles, 86%). With 3 intragenic polymorphic markers, we found that the alleles carrying the 2268 insT mutation in Taiwan Chinese TIOD patients were tightly linked to a specific haplotype. The allele frequencies of this haplotype in the 8 patients with homozygous 2268 insT (5 unrelated families, 10 studied alleles) and in 49 normal individuals (98 studied alleles) were 1.00 and 0.02, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001). This indicates that this common novel mutation among Taiwanese patients with TIOD is due to a founder effect. 	J._Clin._Endocrinol._Metab.	D016428 D013485
15618667	20041225	A major genotype in UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B15.	A novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was found in exon 6 of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B15 gene from healthy Japanese populations. The SNP was as follows: SNP, 020228Toide001; GENE NAME, UGT2B15; ACCESSION NUMBER, U08854, AF180322, and NM_001078; LENGTH, 25 base; 5'-AGCTTGCCAAAAC/AAGGAAAGAAGAA-3'. This SNP was expected to cause a change of an amino acid residue at the position 523 (Thr to Lys) located in a putative co-factor binding region. The allele frequency of this SNP was 79% in Japanese, suggesting this polymorphism to be a major genotype in Japanese people. 	Drug_Metab._Pharmacokinet.	D016428
7493990	19951208	Structural and functional consequences of mutations in 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase causing hyperphenylalaninemia in humans. Phosphorylation is a requirement for in vivo activity.	Four naturally occurring mutants with single amino acid alterations in human 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) were overexpressed and characterized in vitro. The corresponding DNA mutations were found in patients with hyperphenylalaninemia and monoamine neurotransmitter insufficiency due to lack of the tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthetic enzyme PTPS. To predict the structure of the mutant enzymes, computer modeling was performed based on the solved three-dimensional structure of the homohexameric rat enzyme. One mutant (delta V57) is incorrectly folded and thus unstable in vitro and in vivo, while a second mutant (P87L) has substantial activity but enhanced sensitivity to local unfolding. Two other mutants, R16C and R25Q, form stable homomultimers and exhibit significant activity in vitro but no activity in COS-1 cells. In vivo 32P labeling showed that wild-type PTPS, P87L, and R25Q are phosphorylated, while R16C is not modified. This strongly suggests that the serine 19 within the consensus sequence for various kinases, RXXS, is the site of modification. Our results demonstrate that PTPS undergoes protein phosphorylation and requires additional, not yet identified post-translational modification(s) for its in vivo function. 	J._Biol._Chem.

1681027	19911001	Different scrapie-associated fibril proteins (PrP) are encoded by lines of sheep selected for different alleles of the Sip gene.	The incubation period of scrapie in sheep is controlled by the Sip gene which has two alleles (sA and pA). Following experimental challenge with SSBP/1 scrapie, a short incubation period is conferred by the partially dominant sA allele. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the scrapie-associated fibril protein (PrP) gene are associated with the Sip alleles. By sequencing the protein coding region of the PrP gene in Cheviot sheep selected for differing Sip genotypes, we have found four PrP protein variants which differ at three positions: amino acid 112 (Ala/Val), amino acid 130 (Arg/His) and amino acid 147 (Arg/Gln). The Val 112 variant can be distinguished at the DNA level by an RspXI restriction site which is not present in the Ala 112 form. Val 112 appears to be linked to a short incubation period of experimentally induced scrapie in the Cheviot sheep and therefore with the Sip sA allele. These results provide new evidence that the PrP protein may be a product of the Sip locus. 	J._Gen._Virol.	D016428
15955091	20050616	A mutation in bovine keratin 5 causing epidermolysis bullosa simplex, transmitted by a mosaic sire.	A mechanobullous skin disorder was identified in the progeny of a 3-y-old Friesian-Jersey crossbred bull. The condition presented as loss of skin and mucosa from contact areas and inflammation. Examination of skin samples under light microscopy revealed separation of the epidermis from the dermis. Electron microscopic analysis refined the site of cleavage to above the basement membrane involving lysis of basal keratinocytes. These observations were consistent with the simplex form of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) in humans. Candidate genes based on human gene mutations were assessed, resulting in keratin 5 being identified as the most likely candidate gene. The sequence of bovine keratin 5 was established and sequencing led to identification of a G to A substitution in all affected animals. This mutation leads to an amino acid change of glutamic acid to lysine in the final E (478) of the KLLEGE motif of the protein. The sire carried a de novo mutation and was mosaic, explaining his asymptomatic status and the less than expected frequency of affected offspring. Remarkably, the same mutation has been previously described in EB simplex in humans. 	J._Invest._Dermatol.	D016428
19038374	20081129	Phenotypic variability and long-term follow-up of patients with known and novel PRPH2/RDS gene mutations.	To describe the phenotypic variability in 22 patients with PRPH2 gene mutations and to report six novel mutations. Retrospective study. Clinical examinations included color vision testing, perimetry, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and full-field and multifocal electroretinography (International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision standards). Blood samples were taken for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction and mutation screening was performed by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction amplicons. Eleven unrelated patients and four unrelated families each with two affected members as well as one family with three affected members were examined. Diagnoses included central areolar choroidal dystrophy (CACD; n = 9), autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP; n = 7), adult vitelliform macular dystrophy (n = 3), and cone-rod dystrophy (CRD; n = 3). FAF was abnormal in all patients and showed various retinal pigment epithelial alterations, in CACD with a speckled FAF pattern. OCT revealed reduced retinal thickness, mostly in CACD, subretinal lesions, macula edema, or was normal. Follow-up (n = 12; range, 1.3 to 26 years) showed a slow progression of the retinal dystrophies. DNA testing revealed previously reported PRPH2 mutations in two families and eight individuals of whom two carried the same mutation but had different phenotypes. Novel PRPH2 mutations were detected in two families with adRP, in identical twins with CACD, and in each of an individual with CACD, CRD, and adRP. This series describes the broad spectrum of phenotypes associated with PRPH2 mutations. FAF and OCT are helpful tools for diagnosis and evaluation of disease progression. We report novel PRPH2 mutations in patients with CACD, CRD, and adRP. 	Am._J._Ophthalmol.	D016428 D013485
3201231	19881209	Mitochondrial DNA mutation associated with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy.	Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is a maternally inherited disease resulting in optic nerve degeneration and cardiac dysrhythmia. A mitochondrial DNA replacement mutation was identified that correlated with this disease in multiple families. This mutation converted a highly conserved arginine to a histidine at codon 340 in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 gene and eliminated an Sfa NI site, thus providing a simple diagnostic test. This finding demonstrated that a nucleotide change in a mitochondrial DNA energy production gene can result in a neurological disease. 	Science	D016428 D013485 D013487
9671268	19980722	Succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT) deficiency: two pathogenic mutations, V133E and C456F, in Japanese siblings.	Succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT; EC 2.8.3.5; locus symbol OXCT) is the key enzyme of ketone body utilization. Hereditary SCOT deficiency (MIM 245050) causes episodes of severe ketoacidosis. We developed a transient expression system for mutant SCOT cDNAs, using immortalized SCOT-deficient fibroblasts. This paper describes and characterizes three missense mutations in two SCOT-deficient siblings from Japan. They are genetic compounds who inherited the mutation C456F (c1367 G--&gt;T) from their mother. Their paternal allele contains two mutations in cis, T58M (c173 C--&gt;T) and V133E (c398T--&gt;A). Expression of SCOT cDNAs containing either V133E or C456F produces no detectable SCOT activity, whereas T58M is functionally neutral. T58M is a rare sequence variant not detected in 100 control Japanese alleles. In fibroblasts from the proband (GS02), in whom immunoblot demonstrated no detectable SCOT peptide, we measured an apparent residual SCOT activity of 20-35%. We hypothesize that the high residual SCOT activity in homogenates may be an artifact caused by use of the substrate, acetoacetyl-CoA by other enzymes. Expression of mutant SCOT cDNAs more accurately reflects the residual activity of SCOT than do currently available assays in cell or tissue homogenates. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428 D013485
8741038	19960501	Three missense mutations in the galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase gene of three families with mild galactosaemia.	Classical galactosaemia caused by deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) is characterized by acute symptoms of hepatocellular dysfunction, sepsis, cataracts and failure to thrive. Galactose limitation reverses these complications immediately, however, most of these children have a long-term complication of verbal dyspraxia mental retardation and ovarian failure. The GALT gene was cloned and several mutations including the common Q188R have been reported. In this study the coding region of GALT was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA of classical galactosaemic individuals and characterized by direct sequencing of the products. Three missense mutations were identified in three patients with a mild galactosaemic variant: (1) replacement of threonine-138 by methionine (T138M); (2) replacement of arginine by tryptophan (R259W); and (3) replacement of threonine by alanine (T350A). All three galactosaemic individuals, one girl and two boys, have varying degrees of residual GALT activity in RBC and their galactose-1-phosphate levels decreased much faster than in other galactosaemic patients. These missense mutations occur in regions that are not highly conserved domains. The study of the molecular basis related to the phenotype variation may indeed help to prognosticate the outcome of patients with classical galactosaemia. 	Eur._J._Pediatr.	D002363 D016428 D013485
24750328	20140423	A novel INF2 mutation in a Korean family with autosomal dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.	Mutations in the inverted formin-2 (INF2) gene were recently identified in patients with autosomal dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth (DI-CMT) disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Here, we identified a novel p.L132P INF2 mutation in a Korean family with DI-CMT and FSGS by whole-exome sequencing. This mutation was cosegregated with affected individuals in the family and was not found in the 300 controls. The two affected members exhibited juvenile onset sensorimotor polyneuropathy and FSGS. Nerve conduction studies showed an intermediate range of motor nerve conduction velocities. We report a novel INF2 mutation in a family with DI-CMT and FSGS as the first case in Koreans. The INF2 mutation appears to be a major cause of CMT with FSGS. 	J._Peripher._Nerv._Syst.	D002363 D016428 D013485
9023109	19970301	The p53 status of Chinese hamster V79 cells frequently used for studies on DNA damage and DNA repair.	Chinese hamster lung fibroblast V79 cells have been widely used in studies of DNA damage and DNA repair. Since the p53 gene is involved in normal responses to DNA damage, we have analyzed the molecular genetics and functional status of p53 in V79 cells and primary Chinese hamster embryonic fibroblast (CHEF) cells. The coding product of the p53 gene in CHEF cells was 76 and 75% homologous to human and mouse p53 respectively, and was 95% homologous to the Syrian hamster cells. The V79 p53 sequence contained two point mutations located within a presumed DNA binding domain, as compared with the CHEF cells. Additional immunocytochemical and molecular studies confirmed that the p53 protein in V79 cells was mutated and nonfunctional. Our results indicate that caution should be used in interpreting studies of DNA damage, DNA repair and apoptosis in V79 cells. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D013485 D013486 D013487
10643692	20000122	Cloning and mRNA tissue distribution of human PPARgamma coactivator-1.	To determine human PPARgamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1) amino acid sequence and to study PGC-1 mRNA tissue distribution. PGC-1 is a novel transcriptional coactivator of nuclear receptors that may play a role in the control of thermogenesis. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained from six obese and five lean male subjects. Vastus lateralis skeletal muscle was obtained from seven lean and six obese subjects undergoing a 5-day severe calorie restriction. Other tissue biopsies were from nonobese nondiabetic subjects. Human PGC-1 was cloned from a skeletal muscle cDNA library. A reverse transcription-competitive polymerase chain reaction assay was developed to determine PGC-1 mRNA levels in human tissues. The human amino acid sequence showed 95% identity with mouse PGC-1. PGC-1 mRNA was expressed at very low levels in the small and large intestines and white adipose tissue. Heart, kidney, liver and skeletal muscle showed higher mRNA levels. The degree of obesity did not affect PGC-1 mRNA levels in adipose tissue while lean subjects expressed more PGC-1 mRNA than obese subjects in skeletal muscle. A 5-day severe calorie restriction induced PGC-1 mRNA expression in skeletal muscle of obese but not of lean subjects. PGC-1 shows a restricted tissue expression that suggests a tissue-specific role in the control of gene transcription and possible interaction with various members of the PPAR family. The lower expression of skeletal muscle PGC-1 in obesity could contribute to an alteration of mitochondrial gene expression. 	Int._J._Obes._Relat._Metab._Disord.	D016428 D013485
9529250	19980407	Neuropilin-1 is expressed by endothelial and tumor cells as an isoform-specific receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor.	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a major regulator of angiogenesis, binds to two receptor tyrosine kinases, KDR/Flk-1 and Flt-1. We now describe the purification and the expression cloning from tumor cells of a third VEGF receptor, one that binds VEGF165 but not VEGF121. This isoform-specific VEGF receptor (VEGF165R) is identical to human neuropilin-1, a receptor for the collapsin/semaphorin family that mediates neuronal cell guidance. When coexpressed in cells with KDR, neuropilin-1 enhances the binding of VEGF165 to KDR and VEGF165-mediated chemotaxis. Conversely, inhibition of VEGF165 binding to neuropilin-1 inhibits its binding to KDR and its mitogenic activity for endothelial cells. We propose that neuropilin-1 is a novel VEGF receptor that modulates VEGF binding to KDR and subsequent bioactivity and therefore may regulate VEGF-induced angiogenesis.

8640225	19960601	Mutations in the activin receptor-like kinase 1 gene in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2.	Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, or Osler-Rendu-Weber (ORW) syndrome, is an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia. So far, two loci have been demonstrated for ORW. Linkage studies established an ORW locus at chromosome 9q3; endoglin was subsequently identified as the ORW1 gene. A second locus, designated ORW2, was mapped to chromosome 12. Here we report a new 4 cM interval for ORW2 that does not overlap with any previously defined. A 1.38-Mb YAC contig spans the entire interval. It includes the activin receptor like kinase 1 gene (ACVRLK1 or ALK1), a member of the serine-threonine kinase receptor family expressed in endothelium. We report three mutations in the coding sequence of the ALK1 gene in those families which show linkage of the ORW phenotype to chromosome 12. Our data suggest a critical role for ALK1 in the control of blood vessel development or repair. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D013485 D013487

9215669	19970701	The molecular basis of the Kidd blood group polymorphism and its lack of association with type 1 diabetes susceptibility.	The Kidd blood group locus encodes a urea transporter which is expressed on human red cells and in the kidney. This gene is located on chromosome 18q12, and evidence for linkage and association with type 1 diabetes mellitus has been reported. To investigate this further, the genetic basis for the blood group Jk(a)/Jk(b) polymorphism was first determined by sequencing reverse-transcribed reticulocyte RNAs from Jk(a+b-) and Jk(a-b+) donors. The Jk(a)/Jk(b) polymorphism was caused by a transition (G838A), resulting in a Asp280Asn amino acid substitution and an MnlI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Using the MnlI RFLP, we found that the Jk(a)/Jk(b) polymorphism was not in linkage disequilibrium with type 1 diabetes in 228 multiplex UK and US families tested. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D013485

In this report we describe a Polish patient with Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1B disease. Sural nerve biopsy demonstrated focally folded myelin.

12189208	20020822	Identification of a transcriptionally active peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha -interacting cofactor complex in rat liver and characterization of PRIC285 as a coactivator.	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) plays a central role in the cell-specific pleiotropic responses induced by structurally diverse synthetic chemicals designated as peroxisome proliferators. Transcriptional regulation by liganded nuclear receptors involves the participation of cofactors that form multiprotein complexes to achieve cell- and gene-specific transcription. Here we report the identification of such a transcriptionally active PPAR alpha-interacting cofactor (PRIC) complex from rat liver nuclear extracts that interacts with full-length PPAR alpha in the presence of ciprofibrate, a synthetic ligand, and leukotriene B(4), a natural ligand. The liganded PPAR alpha-PRIC complex enhanced transcription from a peroxisomal enoyl-CoA hydratase/l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase bifunctional enzyme gene promoter template that contains peroxisome proliferator response elements. Rat liver PRIC complex comprises some 25 polypeptides, and their identities were established by mass spectrometry and limited sequence analysis. Eighteen of these peptides contain one or more LXXLL motifs necessary for interacting with nuclear receptors. PRIC complex includes known coactivators or coactivator-binding proteins (CBP, SRC-1, PBP, PRIP, PIMT, TRAP100, SUR-2, and PGC-1), other proteins that have not previously been described in association with transcription complexes (CHD5, TOG, and MORF), and a few novel polypeptides designated PRIC300, -285, -215, -177, and -145. We describe the cDNA for PRIC285, which contains five LXXLL motifs. It interacts with PPAR alpha and acts as a coactivator by moderately stimulating PPAR alpha-mediated transcription in transfected cells. We conclude that liganded PPAR alpha recruits a distinctive multiprotein complex from rat liver nuclear extracts. The composition of this complex may provide insight into the basis of tissue and species sensitivity to peroxisome proliferators. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 D013485 D013486 D013487
11586298	20011005	A gene encoding a putative GTPase regulator is mutated in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2.	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 (ALS2) is an autosomal recessive form of juvenile ALS and has been mapped to human chromosome 2q33. Here we report the identification of two independent deletion mutations linked to ALS2 in the coding exons of the new gene ALS2. These deletion mutations result in frameshifts that generate premature stop codons. ALS2 is expressed in various tissues and cells, including neurons throughout the brain and spinal cord, and encodes a protein containing multiple domains that have homology to RanGEF as well as RhoGEF. Deletion mutations are predicted to cause a loss of protein function, providing strong evidence that ALS2 is the causative gene underlying this form of ALS. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D013485 D013487
20574985	20100625	Molecular spectrum of SLC22A5 (OCTN2) gene mutations detected in 143 subjects evaluated for systemic carnitine deficiency.	Systemic primary carnitine deficiency (CDSP) is caused by recessive mutations in the SLC22A5 (OCTN2) gene encoding the plasmalemmal carnitine transporter and characterized by hypoketotic hypoglycemia, and skeletal and cardiac myopathy. The entire coding regions of the OCTN2 gene were sequenced in 143 unrelated subjects suspected of having CDSP. In 70 unrelated infants evaluated because of abnormal newborn screening (NBS) results, 48 were found to have at least 1 mutation/unclassified missense variant. Twenty-eight of 33 mothers whose infants had abnormal NBS results were found to carry at least 1 mutation/unclassified missense variant, including 11 asymptomatic mothers who had 2 mutations. Therefore, sequencing of the OCTN2 gene is recommended for infants with abnormal NBS results and for their mothers. Conversely, 52 unrelated subjects were tested due to clinical indications other than abnormal NBS and only 14 of them were found to have at least one mutation/unclassified variant. Custom designed oligonucleotide array CGH analysis revealed a heterozygous approximately 1.6 Mb deletion encompassing the entire OCTN2 gene in one subject who was apparently homozygous for the c.680G&gt;A (p.R227H) mutation. Thus, copy number abnormalities at the OCTN2 locus should be considered if by sequencing, an apparently homozygous mutation or only one mutant allele is identified. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428
11449391	20010713	Evidence supporting WNT2 as an autism susceptibility gene.	We examined WNT2 as a candidate disease gene for autism for the following reasons. First, the WNT family of genes influences the development of numerous organs and systems, including the central nervous system. Second, WNT2 is located in the region of chromosome 7q31-33 linked to autism and is adjacent to a chromosomal breakpoint in an individual with autism. Third, a mouse knockout of Dvl1, a member of a gene family essential for the function of the WNT pathway, exhibits a behavioral phenotype characterized primarily by diminished social interaction. We screened the WNT2 coding sequence for mutations in a large number of autistic probands and found two families containing nonconservative coding sequence variants that segregated with autism in those families. We also identified linkage disequilibrium (LD) between a WNT2 3'UTR SNP and our sample of autism-affected sibling pair (ASP) families and trios. The LD arose almost exclusively from a subgroup of our ASP families defined by the presence of severe language abnormalities and was also found to be associated with the evidence for linkage to 7q from our previously published genomewide linkage screen. Furthermore, expression analysis demonstrated WNT2 expression in the human thalamus. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that rare mutations occur in the WNT2 gene that significantly increase susceptibility to autism even when present in single copies, while a more common WNT2 allele (or alleles) not yet identified may exist that contributes to the disorder to a lesser degree.

7854347	19941001	Localization of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R) in neuroendocrine and autonomic control circuits in the brain.	POMC, the precursor of ACTH, MSH, and beta-endorphin peptides, is expressed in the pituitary and in two sites in the brain, in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the commissural nucleus of the solitary tract of the brain stem. Little is known regarding the functions of melanocortin (ACTH and MSH) peptides in the brain. We report here the detailed neuroanatomical distribution of the MC4-R mRNA in the adult rat brain. The melanocortin 3 receptor (MC3-R), characterized previously, was found to be expressed in arcuate nucleus neurons and in a subset of their presumptive terminal fields but in few regions of the brainstem. The highly conserved MC4-R is much more widely expressed than MC3-R and is pharmacologically distinct. MC4-R mRNA was found in multiple sites in virtually every brain region, including the cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, brainstem, and spinal cord. Unlike the MC3-R, MC4-R mRNA is found in both parvicellular and magnocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, suggesting a role in the central control of pituitary function. MC4-R is also unique in its expression in numerous cortical and brainstem nuclei. Together, MC3-R and/or MC-4R mRNA are found in every nucleus reported to bind MSH in the adult rat brain and define neuronal circuitry known to be involved in the control of diverse neuroendocrine and autonomic functions.

15111628	20040428	Amelogenin p.M1T and p.W4S mutations underlying hypoplastic X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta.	Mutations in the human amelogenin gene (AMELX, Xp22.3) cause a phenotypically diverse set of inherited enamel malformations. We hypothesize that the effects of specific mutations on amelogenin protein structure and expression will correlate with the enamel phenotype, clarify amelogenin structure/function relationships, and improve the clinical diagnosis of X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta (AI). We have identified two kindreds with X-linked AI and characterized the AMELX mutations underlying their AI phenotypes. The two missense mutations are both in exon 2 and affect the translation initiation codon and/or the secretion of amelogenin (p.M1T and p.W4S), resulting in hypoplastic enamel. Primary anterior teeth from affected females with the p.M1T mutation were characterized by light and scanning electron microscopy. The thin enamel had defective prism organization, and the surface was rough and pitted. Dentin was normal. The severity of the enamel phenotype correlated with the predicted effects of the mutations on amelogenin expression and secretion. 	J._Dent._Res.	D016428 D013485 D013487
1350326	19920521	Effect of polymorphism of an MHC-linked transporter on the peptides assembled in a class I molecule.	Short antigenic peptides bound in the groove of class I major histocompatibility complex molecules enable T cells to detect intracellular pathogens. It has been assumed that structural features of the class I molecule alone select which peptides are bound. It is now demonstrated that a complex polymorphism in one of the major histocompatibility complex-encoded putative peptide-transporter genes is associated with an altered spectrum of bound peptides.

11673523	20011024	Genomic characterization of LIGHT reveals linkage to an immune response locus on chromosome 19p13.3 and distinct isoforms generated by alternate splicing or proteolysis.	LIGHT is a member of the TNF cytokine superfamily that signals through the lymphotoxin (LT)beta receptor and the herpesvirus entry mediator. LIGHT may function as a costimulatory factor for the activation of lymphoid cells and as a deterrent to infection by herpesvirus, which may provide significant selective pressure shaping the evolution of LIGHT. Here, we define the molecular genetics of the human LIGHT locus, revealing its close linkage to the TNF superfamily members CD27 ligand and 4-1BB ligand, and the third complement protein (C3), which positions LIGHT within the MHC paralog on chromosome 19p13.3. An alternately spliced isoform of LIGHT mRNA that encodes a transmembrane-deleted form is detected in activated T cells and gives rise to a nonglycosylated protein that resides in the cytosol. Furthermore, membrane LIGHT is shed from the cell surface of human 293 T cells. These studies reveal new mechanisms involved in regulating the physical forms and cellular compartmentalization of LIGHT that may contribute to the regulation and biological function of this cytokine.

12529711	20030117	PTPN11 mutation in a large family with Noonan syndrome and dizygous twinning.	Noonan syndrome (NS, MIM 163950) is an autosomal dominant condition characterised by facial dysmorphy, congenital cardiac defects and short stature. Recently missense mutations in PTPN11, the gene encoding the nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 on 12q24, were identified in 50% of analysed Noonan cases. A large four-generation Belgian family with NS and some features suggestive of cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFC) was previously used to fine map the Noonan syndrome candidate region to a 5 cM region in 12q24. We now report the identification of a mutation (Gln79Arg) in the PTPN11 gene in this large family. In D. melanogaster and C. elegans the PTPN11 gene has been implicated in oogenesis. In this family two affected females had dizygous twins. This suggests that PTPN11 might also be involved in oogenesis and twinning in humans. 	Eur._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
12093795	20020703	The catalytic center of glucose-6-phosphatase. HIS176 is the nucleophile forming the phosphohistidine-enzyme intermediate during catalysis.	Glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), a key enzyme in glucose homeostasis, is anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum by nine transmembrane helices. The amino acids comprising the catalytic center of G6Pase include Lys(76), Arg(83), His(119), Arg(170), and His(176). During catalysis, a His residue in G6Pase becomes phosphorylated generating an enzyme-phosphate intermediate. It was predicted that His(176) would be the amino acid that acts as a nucleophile forming a phosphohistidine-enzyme intermediate, and His(119) would be the amino acid that provides the proton needed to liberate the glucose moiety. However, the phosphate acceptor in G6Pase has eluded molecular characterization. To identify the His residue that covalently bound the phosphate moiety, we generated recombinant adenoviruses carrying G6Pase wild type and active site mutants. A 40-kDa [(32)P]phosphate-G6Pase intermediate was identified after incubating [(32)P]glucose 6-phosphate with microsomes expressing wild type but not with microsomes expressing either H119A or H176A mutant G6Pase. Human G6Pase contains five methionine residues at positions 1, 5, 121, 130, and 279. After cyanogen bromide cleavage, His(119) is predicted to be within a 116-amino acid peptide of 13.5 kDa with an isoelectric point of 5.3 (residues 6-121), and His(176) is predicted to be within a 149-amino acid peptide of 16.8 kDa with an isoelectric point of 9.3 (residues 131-279). We show that after digestion of a non-glycosylated [(32)P]phosphate-G6Pase intermediate by cyanogen bromide, the [(32)P]phosphate remains bound to a peptide of 17 kDa with an isoelectric point above 9, demonstrating that His(176) is the phosphate acceptor in G6Pase.

21457908	20110405	A mutation in C2orf64 causes impaired cytochrome c oxidase assembly and mitochondrial cardiomyopathy.	The assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) involves the coordinated action of several assembly chaperones. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, at least 30 different assembly chaperones have been identified. To date, pathogenic mutations leading to a mitochondrial disorder have been identified in only seven of the corresponding human genes. One of the genes for which the relevance to human pathology is unknown is C2orf64, an ortholog of the S. cerevisiae gene PET191. This gene has previously been shown to be a complex IV assembly factor in yeast, although its exact role is still unknown. Previous research in a large cohort of complex IV deficient patients did not support an etiological role of C2orf64 in complex IV deficiency. In this report, a homozygous mutation in C2orf64 is described in two siblings affected by fatal neonatal cardiomyopathy. Pathogenicity of the mutation is supported by the results of a complementation experiment, showing that complex IV activity can be fully restored by retroviral transduction of wild-type C2orf64 in patient-derived fibroblasts. Detailed analysis of complex IV assembly intermediates in patient fibroblasts by 2D-BN PAGE revealed the accumulation of a small assembly intermediate containing subunit COX1 but not the COX2, COX4, or COX5b subunits, indicating that C2orf64 is involved in an early step of the complex IV assembly process. The results of this study demonstrate that C2orf64 is essential for human complex IV assembly and that C2orf64 mutational analysis should be considered for complex IV deficient patients, in particular those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

7565688	19951001	Expression and regulation by interferon of a double-stranded-RNA-specific adenosine deaminase from human cells: evidence for two forms of the deaminase.	A 6,474-nucleotide human cDNA clone designated K88, which encodes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-specific adenosine deaminase, was isolated in a screen for interferon (IFN)-regulated cDNAs. Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed that the K88 cDNA hybridized to a single major transcript of approximately 6.7 kb in human cells which was increased about fivefold by IFN treatment. Polyclonal antisera prepared against K88 cDNA products expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins recognized two proteins by Western (immunoblot) analysis. An IFN-induced 150-kDa protein and a constitutively expressed 110-kDa protein whose level was not altered by IFN treatment were detected in human amnion U and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell lines. Only the 150-kDa protein was detected in mouse fibroblasts with antiserum raised against the recombinant human protein; the mouse 150-kDa protein was IFN inducible. Immunofluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation analyses showed that the 110-kDa protein was exclusively nuclear, whereas the 150-kDa protein was present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of human cells. The amino acid sequence deduced from the K88 cDNA includes three copies of the highly conserved R motif commonly found in dsRNA-binding proteins. Both the 150-kDa and the 110-kDa proteins prepared from human nuclear extracts bound to double-stranded but not to single-stranded RNA affinity columns. Furthermore, E. coli-expressed GST-K88 fusion proteins that included the R motif possessed dsRNA-binding activity. Extracts prepared either from K88 cDNA-transfected cells or from IFN-treated cells contained increased dsRNA-specific adenosine deaminase enzyme activity. These results establish that K88 encodes an IFN-inducible dsRNA-specific adenosine deaminase and suggest that at least two forms of dsRNA-specific adenosine deaminase occur in human cells.

12081718	20020626	New mutations in the CBFA1 gene in two Mexican patients with cleidocranial dysplasia.	Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is an autosomal dominant skeletal disorder exhibiting a wide clinical spectrum ranging from minimal anomalies to classic CCD. Mutations scattered throughout the entire CBFA1 gene have been related to this disorder. However, it seems that most of them affect the highly conserved Runt domain, abolishing the DNA-binding ability of this transcription factor. Moreover, no systematic effect has been found to relate the type of mutation to the severity of the clinical features. In this paper, we studied two unrelated patients with classic CCD. DNA analysis revealed two novel mutations and three undescribed polymorphisms. One of the substitutions was a missense mutation in the Q/A domain leading to the replacement of a polar residue by a nonpolar one (158 A --&gt; T [Q53L]). The second was an uncommon heterozygous stop codon mutation (1565 G --&gt; C [X522S]) which theoretically results in a longer protein with 23 additional amino acids. This is the first report of this type of mutation in CBFA1. We discuss the possible consequences of these mutant sequences, although no phenotype-genotype correlation could be established. Our findings expand the existing number of allelic variants in this pathology. 	Clin._Genet.	D002363 D016428
15861032	20050430	Genetic analysis and functional characterization of polymorphisms in the human concentrative nucleoside transporter, CNT2.	The concentrative nucleoside transporter CNT2 (SPNT1; SLC28A2) plays a role in the absorption and disposition of naturally occurring nucleosides, as well as nucleoside analog drugs. The aim of the present study was to characterize genetic variation in SLC28A2, the gene encoding CNT2, and to functionally analyse non-synonymous variants of CNT2, as a first step towards understanding whether genetic variation in this nucleoside transporter contributes to variation in response to nucleoside analogs. As part of a larger study, DNA samples from an ethnically diverse population (100 African-Americans, 100 European-Americans, 30 Asians, 10 Mexicans and seven Pacific Islanders) were screened and 10 coding region variants of CNT2 were identified. The non-synonymous variants were then constructed and characterized in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Six non-synonymous variants were identified, and all were able to transport guanosine. The four common variants (&gt;1% in the sample population) were further characterized with the anti-viral nucleoside analog drug ribavirin. No differences were observed among the four common variants in the uptake kinetics of 3H-ribavirin (Km in microM: 35.6+/-9.27 for CNT2-reference, 40.7+/-6.47 for CNT2-P22L, 31.2+/-15.8 for CNT2-S75R, 26.7+/-6.13 for CNT2-S245T and 49.9+/-14.6 for CNT2-F355S). The variant CNT2-F355S exhibited a change in specificity for the naturally occurring nucleosides, inosine and uridine. All non-synonymous variants of CNT2 took up guanosine, and the four variants examined showed no significant difference in ribavirin kinetics. However, CNT2-F355S (3% allele frequency in the African-American sample) was found to alter specificity for naturally occurring nucleosides, which may have implications for nucleoside homeostasis.

18945781	20081024	Polymorphisms and splice variants influence the antiretroviral activity of human APOBEC3H.	Human APOBEC3H belongs to the APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases that potently inhibit exogenous and endogenous retroviruses. The impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and alternative splicing on the antiretroviral activity of human APOBEC3H is currently unknown. In this study, we show that APOBEC3H transcripts derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells are polymorphic in sequence and subject to alternative splicing. We found that APOBEC3H variants encoding a SNP cluster (G105R, K121D and E178D, hapII-RDD) restricted human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) more efficiently than wild-type APOBEC3H (hapI-GKE). All APOBEC3H variants tested were resistant to HIV-1 Vif, the viral protein that efficiently counteracts APOBEC3G/3F activity. Alternative splicing of APOBEC3H was common and resulted in variants with distinct C-terminal regions and variable antiretroviral activities. Splice variants of hapI-GKE displayed a wide range of antiviral activities, whereas similar splicing events in hapII-RDD resulted in proteins that uniformly and efficiently restricted viral infectivity (&gt;20-fold). Site-directed mutagenesis identified G105R in hapI-GKE and D121K in hapII-RDD as critical substitutions leading to an average additional 10-fold increase in antiviral activity. APOBEC3H variants were catalytically active and, similarly to APOBEC3F, favored a GA dinucleotide context. HIV-1 mutagenesis as a mode of action for APOBEC3H is suggested by the decrease of restriction observed with a cytidine deaminase domain mutant and the inverse correlation between G-to-A mutations and infectivity. Thus, the anti-HIV activity of APOBEC3H seems to be regulated by a combination of genomic variation and alternative splicing. Since prevalence of hapII-RDD is high in populations of African descent, these findings raise the possibility that some individuals may harbor effective as well as HIV-1 Vif-resistant intracellular antiviral defense mechanisms.

11466257	20010724	Evaluation of the G protein coupled receptor-75 (GPR75) in age related macular degeneration.	A long term project was initiated to identify and to characterise genes that are expressed exclusively or preferentially in the retina as candidates for a genetic susceptibility to age related macular degeneration (AMD). A transcript represented by a cluster of five human expressed sequence tags (ESTs) derived exclusively from retinal cDNA libraries was identified. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses confirmed preferential retinal expression of the gene, which encodes a G protein coupled receptor, GPR75. Following isolation of the full length cDNA and determination of the genomic organisation, the coding sequence of GPR75 was screened for mutations in 535 AMD patients and 252 controls from Germany, the United States, and Italy. Employed methods included single stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), and direct sequencing. Nine different sequence variations were identified in patients and control individuals. Three of these (-30A&gt;C, 150G&gt;A, and 346G&gt;A) likely represent polymorphic variants. Each of six alterations (-4G&gt;A, N78K, P99L, S108T, T135P, and Q234X) were found once in single AMD patients and were considered variants that could affect the protein function and potentially cause retinal pathology. The presence of six potential pathogenic variants in a cohort of 535 AMD patients alone does not provide statistically significant evidence for the association of sequence variation in GPR75 with genetic predisposition to AMD. However, a possible connection between the variants and age related retinal pathology cannot be discarded. Functional studies are needed to clarify the role of GPR75 in retinal physiology.

17400793	20070403	Mutations in the ND5 subunit of complex I of the mitochondrial DNA are a frequent cause of oxidative phosphorylation disease.	Detection of mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is usually limited to common mutations and the transfer RNA genes. However, mutations in other mtDNA regions can be an important cause of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) disease as well. To investigate whether regions in the mtDNA are preferentially mutated in patients with OXPHOS disease. Screening of the mtDNA for heteroplasmic mutations was performed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of 116 patients with OXPHOS disease but without the common mtDNA mutations. An mtDNA sequence variant was detected in 15 patients, 5 of which were present in the ND5 gene. One sequence variant was new and three were known, one of which was found twice. The novel sequence variant m.13511A--&gt;T occurred in a patient with a Leigh-like syndrome. The known mutation m.13513G--&gt;A, associated with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy lactic acidosis and stroke-like syndrome (MELAS) and MELAS/Leigh/Leber hereditary optic neuropathy overlap syndrome, was found in a relatively low percentage in two patients from two different families, one with a MELAS/Leigh phenotype and one with a MELAS/chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia phenotype. The known mutation m.13042G--&gt;A, detected previously in a patient with a MELAS/myoclonic epilepsy, ragged red fibres phenotype and in a family with a prevalent ocular phenotype, was now found in a patient with a Leigh-like phenotype. The sequence variant m.12622G--&gt;A was reported once in a control database as a polymorphism, but is reported in this paper as heteroplasmic in three brothers, all with infantile encephalopathy (Leigh syndrome) fatal within the first 15 days of life. Therefore, a causal relationship between the presence of this sequence variant and the onset of mitochondrial disease cannot be entirely excluded at this moment. Mutation screening of the ND5 gene is advised for routine diagnostics of patients with OXPHOS disease, especially for those with MELAS- and Leigh-like syndrome with a complex I deficiency.

11919285	20020329	Diversifying selection of the tumor-growth promoter angiogenin in primate evolution.	Diversifying selection drives the rapid differentiation of gene sequences and is one of the main forces behind adaptive evolution. Most genes known to be shaped by diversifying selection are those involved in host-pathogen or male-female interactions characterized as molecular &quot;arms races.&quot; Here we report the unexpected detection of diversifying selection in the evolution of a tumor-growth promoter, angiogenin (ANG). A comparison among 11 primate species demonstrates that ANG has a significantly higher rate of nucleotide substitution at nonsynonymous sites than at synonymous sites, a hallmark of positive selection acting at the molecular level. Furthermore, we observed significant charge diversity at the molecular surface, suggesting the presence of selective pressures in the microenvironment of ANG, including its binding molecules. A population survey of ANG in chimpanzees, however, reveals no polymorphism, which may have resulted from a recent selective sweep of a charge-altering substitution in chimpanzee evolution. Functional assays of recombinant ANGs from the human and owl monkey indicate that primate ANGs retain angiogenic activity despite rapid evolution. Our study, together with findings of similar selection in the primate breast cancer suppressor gene, BRCA1, reveals an intriguing phenomenon of unusual selective pressures on, and adaptive evolution of, cancer-related genes in primate evolution.

11707072	20011115	From PREDs and open reading frames to cDNA isolation: revisiting the human chromosome 21 transcription map.	A supernumerary copy of human chromosome 21 (HC21) causes Down syndrome. To understand the molecular pathogenesis of Down syndrome, it is necessary to identify all HC21 genes. The first annotation of the sequence of 21q confirmed 127 genes, and predicted an additional 98 previously unknown &quot;anonymous&quot; genes (predictions (PREDs) and open reading frames (C21orfs)), which were foreseen by exon prediction programs and/or spliced expressed sequence tags. These putative gene models still need to be confirmed as bona fide transcripts. Here we report the characterization and expression pattern of the putative transcripts C21orf7, C21orf11, C21orf15, C21orf18, C21orf19, C21orf22, C21orf42, C21orf50, C21orf51, C21orf57, and C21orf58, the GC-rich sequence DNA-binding factor candidate GCFC (also known as C21orf66), PRED12, PRED31, PRED34, PRED44, PRED54, and PRED56. Our analysis showed that most of the C21orfs originally defined by matching spliced expressed sequence tags were correctly predicted, whereas many of the PREDs, defined solely by computer prediction, do not correspond to genuine genes. Four of the six PREDs were incorrectly predicted: PRED44 and C21orf11 are portions of the same transcript, PRED31 is a pseudogene, and PRED54 and PRED56 were wrongly predicted. In contrast, PRED12 (now called C21orf68) and PRED34 (C21orf63) are now confirmed transcripts. We identified three new genes, C21orf67, C21orf69, and C21orf70, not previously predicted by any programs. This revision of the HC21 transcriptome has consequences for the entire genome regarding the quality of previous annotations and the total number of transcripts. It also provides new candidates for genes involved in Down syndrome and other genetic disorders that map to HC21. 	Genomics	D016428 D013485
10526337	19991020	Furin mediates enhanced production of fibrillogenic ABri peptides in familial British dementia.	The genetic lesion underlying familial British dementia (FBD), an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder, is a T-A transversion at the termination codon of the BRI gene. The mutant gene encodes BRI-L, the precursor of ABri peptides that accumulate in amyloid deposits in FBD brain. We now report that both BRI-L and its wild-type counterpart, BRI, were constitutively processed by the proprotein convertase, furin, resulting in the secretion of carboxyl-terminal peptides that encompass all or part of ABri. Elevated levels of peptides were generated from the mutant BRI precursor. Electron microscopic studies revealed that synthetic ABri peptides assembled into irregular, short fibrils. Collectively, our results support the view that enhanced furin-mediated processing of mutant BRI generates fibrillogenic peptides that initiate the pathogenesis of FBD. 	Nat._Neurosci.

12359138	20021003	A missense mutation encoding Cys73Phe in neurophysin II is associated with autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus.	Autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (ADNDI) is an inherited disease caused by progressive deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) that typically becomes clinically apparent in the first decade of life. The genetic locus of ADNDI is the arginine vasopressin-neurophysin II (AVP-NPII) gene and mutations that cause ADNDI have been found in the nucleotides encoding the signal peptide, vasopressin, and neurophysin II peptides. In this study we have analyzed the AVP-NPII gene in a 20-year-old female who was diagnosed with ADNDI at 2 years of age. A heterozygous missense mutation (1684G&gt;T) was found in exon 2 that predicts replacement of cysteine with phenylalanine at position 73 of neurophysin II. The mutation was confirmed by subcloning exon 2 PCR products to sequence each allele independently. Two out of four clones were found to have the missense mutation and two have the normal sequence, confirming the presence of the mutation and heterozygosity. Neurophysin II is an intracellular carrier protein for AVP during axonal transport from the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary and contains 14 cysteine residues forming 7 disulfide bonds. This mutation is predicted to disrupt the disulfide bridge between Cys73 and Cys61 within the neurophysin II moiety. This finding of a novel mutation substituting cysteine with phenylalanine in one AVP-NPII gene allele supports the hypothesis that inability to form normal disulfide bonds in neurophysin II leads to ADNDI.

10745044	20000404	Report of five novel and one recurrent COL2A1 mutations with analysis of genotype-phenotype correlation in patients with a lethal type II collagen disorder.	Achondrogenesis II-hypochondrogenesis and severe spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC) are lethal forms of dwarfism caused by dominant mutations in the type II collagen gene (COL2A1). To identify the underlying defect in seven cases with this group of conditions, we used the combined strategy of cartilage protein analysis and COL2A1 mutation analysis. Overmodified type II collagen and the presence of type I collagen was found in the cartilage matrix of all seven cases. Five patients were heterozygous for a nucleotide change that predicted a glycine substitution in the triple helical domain (G313S, G517V, G571A, G910C, G943S). In all five cases, analysis of cartilage type II collagen suggested incorporation of the abnormal alpha1(II) chain in the extracellular collagen trimers. The G943S mutation has been reported previously in another unrelated patient with a strikingly similar phenotype, illustrating the possible specific effect of the mutation. The radiographically less severely affected patient was heterozygous for a 4 bp deletion in the splice donor site of intron 35, likely to result in aberrant splicing. One case was shown to be heterozygous for a single nucleotide change predicted to result in a T1191N substitution in the carboxy-propeptide of the proalpha1(II) collagen chain. Study of the clinical, radiographic, and morphological features of the seven cases supports evidence for a phenotypic continuum between achondrogenesis II-hypochondrogenesis and lethal SEDC and suggests a relationship between the amount of type I collagen in the cartilage and the severity of the phenotype.

7718557	19950411	cDNA sequence and chromosomal localization of human enterokinase, the proteolytic activator of trypsinogen.	Enterokinase is a serine protease of the duodenal brush border membrane that cleaves trypsinogen and produces active trypsin, thereby leading to the activation of many pancreatic digestive enzymes. Overlapping cDNA clones that encode the complete human enterokinase amino acid sequence were isolated from a human intestine cDNA library. Starting from the first ATG codon, the composite 3696 nt cDNA sequence contains an open reading frame of 3057 nt that encodes a 784 amino acid heavy chain followed by a 235 amino acid light chain; the two chains are linked by at least one disulfide bond. The heavy chain contains a potential N-terminal myristoylation site, a potential signal anchor sequence near the amino terminus, and six structural motifs that are found in otherwise unrelated proteins. These domains resemble motifs of the LDL receptor (two copies), complement component Clr (two copies), the metalloprotease meprin (one copy), and the macrophage scavenger receptor (one copy). The enterokinase light chain is homologous to the trypsin-like serine proteinases. These structural features are conserved among human, bovine, and porcine enterokinase. By Northern blotting, a 4.4 kb enterokinase mRNA was detected only in small intestine. The enterokinase gene was localized to human chromosome 21q21 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

11086079	20001122	Cloning of a novel scavenger receptor cysteine-rich type I transmembrane molecule (M160) expressed by human macrophages.	We report the cloning of a novel human type I cell surface Ag mainly expressed by macrophages. The primary structure was established by molecular cloning, which yielded a 4579-bp cDNA sequence encoding a polypeptide chain of 1453 amino acid residues with 16 potential N:-glycosylation sites. We designated this molecule M160. The domain organization features 12 scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains followed by a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic domain that occurs in two forms, a predominant form (M160-alpha) of 71 residues and an alternatively spliced form (M160-ss) of 39 residues. M160-alpha contains three possible phosphorylation sites, which are lost in the alternatively spliced form. RT-PCR analyses showed M160 to be expressed by alveolar macrophages and by the monocyte cell lines HL60, U937, and THP1, but not by Jurkat or Raji cells. Stimulation of U937 cells with phorbol ester resulted in an increased expression of M160 from day 5 onward. RT-PCR analysis of 19 different human tissues showed signals for M160-alpha of varying intensity in all tissues, whereas M160-ss was confined to the spleen. We conclude that M160 is a new member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich superfamily expressed by the monocyte/macrophage cell lineage. 	J._Immunol.	D016428 D013485
6282825	19820625	Gene conversion of two functional goat alpha-globin genes preserves only minimal flanking sequences.	We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the nonallelic adult goat I alpha- and II alpha-globin genes and, as is the case with the duplicated human alpha-to each other. Such high homology (99%) has most likely been preserved via a gene conversion mechanism. The conversion unit in goats is only about 9000 base pairs in length, and contained within this short region are all the known signals required for accurate and efficient transcription, with the CCAAT box adjacent to the 5'-boundary of the conversion unit and the poly(A) addition site adjacent to the 3' end. This conversion unit is also flanked by a 23-base-pair direct repeat &quot;boundary sequence,&quot; vestiges of which are also observable in the human and mouse alpha-globin genes and pseudogenes. These direct repeats imply that a transposition-like event may have been responsible for the insertion of an ancestral alpha-like sequence into a new chromosomal locus, and that this insertion event and subsequent gene duplication may have predated the mammalian radiation.

The gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 7. Expression of this gene is limited to cells of hemopoietic origin, in keeping with the previously defined tissue expression of the HA-2 Ag. RT-PCR amplification of MYO1G from different individuals led to the identification of two genetic variants, designated MYO1G(V) and MYO1G(M). The former encodes the peptide sequence previously shown to be the HA-2 epitope (YIGEVLVSV), whereas the latter shows a single amino acid change in this peptide (YIGEVLVSM). This change has only a modest effect on peptide binding to the class I MHC-restricted element HLA-A*0201, and a minimal impact on recognition by T cells when added exogenously to target cells. Nonetheless, as detected using either T cells or mass spectrometry, this amino acid change results in a failure of the latter peptide to be presented at the surface of cells that express MYO1G(M) endogenously. These studies have thus identified a new mHag-encoding gene, and thereby provide additional information about both the genetic origins of human mHag as well as the underlying basis of an Ag-positive vs Ag-negative state.

19932619	20091126	Adult course in dynamin 2 dominant centronuclear myopathy with neonatal onset.	We report a family with autosomal dominant centronuclear (myotubular) myopathy caused by a novel mutation, p.A618D, in dynamin 2 (DNM2). The 64-year-old mother and 26-year-old daughter had neonatal onset with hypotonia and weak suckling, followed by improvement, then slowly progressive muscle weakness and respiratory restriction. Muscle biopsy showed radial sarcoplasmic strands around the frequent central nuclei. Electrophysiology revealed predominantly myopathic patterns without peripheral nerve involvement. Centronuclear myopathy with neonatal onset caused by a DNM2 mutation in the C-terminal part of the pleckstrin homology domain may have a favorable prognosis and follow a course similar to adult-onset centronuclear myopathy. We advise respiratory follow-up in these patients. 	Neuromuscul._Disord.	D016428 D013485
24706940	20140408	Mutations in the enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 cause Sedaghatian-type spondylometaphyseal dysplasia.	Sedaghatian-type spondylometaphyseal dysplasia (SSMD) is a neonatal lethal form of spondylometaphyseal dysplasia characterised by severe metaphyseal chondrodysplasia with mild limb shortening, platyspondyly, cardiac conduction defects, and central nervous system abnormalities. As part of the FORGE Canada Consortium we studied two unrelated families to identify the genetic aetiology of this rare disease. Whole exome sequencing of a child affected with SSMD and her unaffected parents identified two rare variants in GPX4. The first (c.587+5G&gt;A) was inherited from the mother, and the second (c.588-8_588-4del) was de novo (NM_001039848.1); both were predicted to impact splicing of GPX4. In vitro studies confirmed the mutations spliced out part of exon 4 and skipped exon 5, respectively, with both resulting in a frameshift and premature truncation of GPX4. Subsequently, a second child with SSMD was identified; although DNA from the child was not available, the two unaffected parents were found by Sanger sequencing to each carry the same heterozygous stop mutation in exon 3 of GPX4, c.381C&gt;A, p.Tyr127* (NM_001039848.1). Our identification of truncating mutations in GPX4 in two families affected with SSMD supports the pathogenic role of mutated GPX4 in this very rare disease. GPX4 is a member of the glutathione peroxidase family of antioxidant defence enzymes and protects cells against membrane lipid peroxidation. GPX4 is essential for early embryo development, regulating anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic activities. Our findings highlight the importance of this enzyme in development of the cardiac, nervous, and skeletal systems. 	J._Med._Genet.	D002363 D016428 D013485
10799485	20000509	A new SUMO-1-specific protease, SUSP1, that is highly expressed in reproductive organs.	A full-length cDNA encoding a SUMO-1-specific protease, named SUSP1, was identified and cloned for the first time from the human brain. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cDNA containing an open reading frame of 3336 base pairs revealed that the protease consists of 1112 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 126,116 Da. Like yeast Ulp1, SUSP1 is a cysteine protease containing the well conserved His/Asp/Cys catalytic triad. SUSP1 expressed in Escherichia coli cells efficiently released SUMO-1 from SUMO-1. beta-galactosidase fusion but not from other ubiquitin-like protein fusions, including Smt3.beta-galactosidase, suggesting its role in the generation of matured SUMO-1 specifically from its precursors. Interestingly, reproductive organs, such as testis, ovary, and prostate, contained much higher amounts of SUSP1 mRNA than colon and peripheral blood leukocyte, whereas other tissues, such as heart and spleen, had little or none. In addition, confocal microscopy using green fluorescent protein.SUSP1 fusion showed that SUSP1 is exclusively localized to the cytoplasm of NIH3T3 and HeLa cells. These results suggest that SUSP1 may play a role in the regulation of SUMO-1-mediated cellular processes particularly related to reproduction. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
24680727	20140401	A new missense mutation in FGF23 gene in a male with hyperostosis-hyperphosphatemia syndrome (HHS).	Hyperostosis-hyperphosphataemia syndrome (HHS) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder, characterized by recurrent painful swelling of long bones, periosteal new bone formation and cortical hyperostosis or intramedullary sclerosis, hyperphosphatemia and low intact fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) protein levels. It is caused by mutations in 2 genes, N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 (GalNAc-transferase; GALNT3) and FGF23. We have performed mutation analysis of the GALNT3 and FGF23 genes in a patient with HHS and detected a homozygous mutation in exon 3 of FGF23 gene (NM_020638.2: c.471C&gt;A) which results in amino acid change from phenylalanine 157 to leucin (p.F157L) in receptor interaction site.

11691639	20011103	Mutational analysis within the 3' region of the PKD1 gene in Japanese families.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a widespread genetic disease that causes renal failure. One of the genes that is responsible for this disease, PKD1, has been identified and characterized. Many mutations of the PKD1 gene have been identified in the Caucasian population. We investigated the occurrence of mutations in this gene in the Japanese population. We analyzed each exon in the 3' single copy region of the gene between exons 35 and 46 in genomic DNA obtained from 69 patients, using a PCR-based direct sequencing method. Four missense mutations (T3509M, G3559R, R3718Q, R3752W), one deletion mutation (11307del61bp) and one polymorphism (L3753L) were identified, and their presence confirmed by allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization. These were novel mutations, except for R3752W, and three of them were identified in more than two families. Mutation analysis of the PKD1 gene in the Japanese population is being reported for the first time. 	Mutat._Res.	D016428 D013485
16371502	20051224	OTOF mutations revealed by genetic analysis of hearing loss families including a potential temperature sensitive auditory neuropathy allele.	The majority of hearing loss in children can be accounted for by genetic causes. Non-syndromic hearing loss accounts for 80% of genetic hearing loss in children, with mutations in DFNB1/GJB2 being by far the most common cause. Among the second tier genetic causes of hearing loss in children are mutations in the DFNB9/OTOF gene. In total, 65 recessive non-syndromic hearing loss families were screened by genotyping for association with the DFNB9/OTOF gene. Families with genotypes consistent with linkage or uninformative for linkage to this gene region were further screened for mutations in the 48 known coding exons of otoferlin. Eight OTOF pathological variants were discovered in six families. Of these, Q829X was found in two families. We also noted 23 other coding variant, believed to have no pathology. A previously published missense allele I515T was found in the heterozygous state in an individual who was observed to be temperature sensitive for the auditory neuropathy phenotype. Mutations in OTOF cause both profound hearing loss and a type of hearing loss where otoacoustic emissions are spared called auditory neuropathy. 	J._Med._Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013485
18596924	20080704	Clinical characteristics and biochemical mechanisms of congenital hyperinsulinism associated with dominant KATP channel mutations.	Congenital hyperinsulinism is a condition of dysregulated insulin secretion often caused by inactivating mutations of the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel in the pancreatic beta cell. Though most disease-causing mutations of the 2 genes encoding KATP subunits, ABCC8 (SUR1) and KCNJ11 (Kir6.2), are recessively inherited, some cases of dominantly inherited inactivating mutations have been reported. To better understand the differences between dominantly and recessively inherited inactivating KATP mutations, we have identified and characterized 16 families with 14 different dominantly inherited KATP mutations, including a total of 33 affected individuals. The 16 probands presented with hypoglycemia at ages from birth to 3.3 years, and 15 of 16 were well controlled on diazoxide, a KATP channel agonist. Of 29 adults with mutations, 14 were asymptomatic. In contrast to a previous report of increased diabetes risk in dominant KATP hyperinsulinism, only 4 of 29 adults had diabetes. Unlike recessive mutations, dominantly inherited KATP mutant subunits trafficked normally to the plasma membrane when expressed in COSm6 cells. Dominant mutations also resulted in different channel-gating defects, as dominant ABCC8 mutations diminished channel responses to magnesium adenosine diphosphate or diazoxide, while dominant KCNJ11 mutations impaired channel opening, even in the absence of nucleotides. These data highlight distinctive features of dominant KATP hyperinsulinism relative to the more common and more severe recessive form, including retention of normal subunit trafficking, impaired channel activity, and a milder hypoglycemia phenotype that may escape detection in infancy and is often responsive to diazoxide medical therapy, without the need for surgical pancreatectomy.

10371548	19990617	Diagnostic Notch3 sequence analysis in CADASIL: three new mutations in Dutch patients. Dutch CADASIL Research Group.	To confirm the clinical diagnosis in individual Dutch patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), we performed direct sequence analysis of the abnormal gene, Notch3, in patients from 11 families without prior linkage analysis to chromosome 19. Eleven missense mutations involving the loss or gain of a cysteine residue were found, of which 3 are new. Exon 4 is a mutation hotspot (9 of 11 families). Notch3 sequence analysis of CADASIL patients in a diagnostic laboratory is a feasible procedure to confirm the clinical diagnosis in individual patients. 	Neurology	D016428 D013485
8205619	19940603	Alpha-tropomyosin and cardiac troponin T mutations cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a disease of the sarcomere.	We demonstrate that missense mutations (Asp175Asn; Glu180Gly) in the alpha-tropomyosin gene cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) linked to chromosome 15q2. These findings implicated components of the troponin complex as candidate genes at other FHC loci, particularly cardiac troponin T, which was mapped in this study to chromosome 1q. Missense mutations (Ile79Asn; Arg92Gln) and a mutation in the splice donor sequence of intron 15 of the cardiac troponin T gene are also shown to cause FHC. Because alpha-tropomyosin and cardiac troponin T as well as beta myosin heavy chain mutations cause the same phenotype, we conclude that FHC is a disease of the sarcomere. Further, because the splice site mutation is predicted to function as a null allele, we suggest that abnormal stoichiometry of sarcomeric proteins can cause cardiac hypertrophy.

7926797	19940930	Occurrence of a LINE sequence in the 3' UTR of the goat alpha s1-casein E-encoding allele associated with reduced protein synthesis level.	The E allele of the alpha s1-casein (alpha s1-Cas)-encoding gene is associated with a reduced casein content in milk. Structural analysis of mRNA and sequencing of amplified genomic DNA fragments, have revealed that this allele contains a 457-bp insertion within exon 19 (last untranslated exon). This insert is a truncated long interspersed repeated element (LINE) containing part of the ORF-2, the 3' UTR and the poly(A) tail of the original retroposon. This LINE sequence was found to be highly repeated in the goat genome. The threefold reduction in the amount of alpha s1-CasE mRNA in the total, as well as in the polysomal fractions, as compared with its A counterpart, leads one to suppose either a reduced transcriptional rate of allele E or/and a decreased stability of the relevant mRNA. Northern blot and PCR experiments suggested the setting up of highly stable secondary structures involving the 3' UTR of the alpha s1-CasE transcript. The mRNA folding calculations support such an hypothesis, by base-pairing interactions between the E allele messenger poly(A) tail and a long poly(U)-stretch occurring at the 5' end of the insertion. In addition, since A+U-rich motifs are also present in the truncated LINE insertion, we propose that this extra sequence might be responsible for the lower milk alpha s1-Cas content by reducing the allele E mRNA stability.

12923864	20030819	Novel deletion in the pre-mRNA splicing gene PRPF31 causes autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa in a large Chinese family.	We report the identification of a novel 12 bp deletion of the pre-mRNA splicing gene PRPF31 in a large Chinese family with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP). This mutation results in the deletion of four amino acids (DeltaH(111)K(112)F(113)I(114)) including H(111), an amino acid residue that is highly conserved throughout evolution. The 12 bp deletion co-segregates with the disease phenotype in 19 RP patients in the family, but is not present in unaffected relatives or 100 normal individuals. Our data indicate that the novel 12 bp deletion in PRPF31 causes retinitis pigementosa in this Chinese adRP family. In contrast to the incomplete penetrance observed in most adRP families linked to chromosome band 19q13.4 (RP11), the 12 bp PRPF31 deletion identified in this study appears to show high penetrance. These data expand the spectrum of PRPF31 mutations causing adRP, and confirm the role of PRPF31 in the pathogenesis of RP. 	Am._J._Med._Genet._A	D003160 D016428 D013485 D013487
11328279	20010501	Molecular characterization of the PK-LR gene in sixteen pyruvate kinase-deficient patients.	We studied the PK-LR gene in 16 unrelated patients with congenital haemolytic anaemia associated with erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency. Fifteen different mutations were detected among the 28 mutated alleles identified: two deletions (del 1010G, del 1042--1044); one four nucleotide duplication (nt 1515--1518, GGTC); one splice site [IVS6(-2)t]; nine missense (991A, 1003A, 1151T, 1160G, 1181T, 1181A, 1456T, 1483A, 1529A); and two nonsense (721T, 1675T) mutations. Eight of them [del 1010G, del 1042--1044, dupl 1515--1518, IVS6(-2)t, 1003A, 1160G, 1181T, 1181A] were novel. The deletion 1042-1044 causes the loss of Lys 348. Deletion 1010G and duplication 1515-1518 determine a frameshift and the creation of a stop codon at nucleotides 1019 and 1554 respectively. Mutation IVS6(-2)t leads to an alteration of the 5' and 3' splice site consensus sequence; the cDNA analysis shows a 67-bp deletion in the first part of exon 11 (del 1437--1503). All the four new missense mutations involve highly conserved amino acids. The most frequent mutation in Italy would appear to be 1456T. Correlation was made between mutations, biochemical characteristics of the enzyme and clinical course of the disease. 	Br._J._Haematol.	D016428 D013485
18465152	20080510	ARSACS in the Dutch population: a frequent cause of early-onset cerebellar ataxia.	Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS: MIM 270550) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by early-onset cerebellar ataxia with spasticity and peripheral neuropathy. This disorder, considered to be rare, was first described in the late seventies among French Canadians in the isolated Charlevoix-Saguenay region of Quebec. Nowadays, it is known that the disorder is not only limited to this region but occurs worldwide. Our objective was to identify cases of autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) in Dutch patients with recessive early-onset cerebellar ataxia by sequencing the complete SACS gene. In a Dutch cohort of 43 index patients with ataxia onset before age 25, we identified 16 index patients (total 23 patients) with mutations in the SACS gene. Nine of them had homozygous mutations, and seven of them had compound heterozygous mutations. Retrospectively, the phenotype of patients carrying mutations was remarkably uniform: cerebellar ataxia with onset before age 13 years, lower limb spasticity and sensorimotor axonal neuropathy, and cerebellar (vermis) atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging, consistent with the core ARSACS phenotype previously described. The high rate of mutations (37%) identified in this cohort of Dutch patients suggests that ARSACS is substantially more frequent than previously estimated. We predict that the availability of SACS mutation analysis as well as an increasing awareness of the characteristic ARSACS phenotype will lead to the diagnosis of many additional patients, possibly even at a younger age.

20981447	20101029	Molecular cloning of two novel mucin-like genes in the disease-susceptibility locus for diffuse panbronchiolitis.	Diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) is a rare complex genetic disease affecting East Asians and is strongly associated with the class I human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-B54 in Japanese and HLA-A11 in Koreans. We recently showed that an HLA-associated major susceptibility gene for DPB is probably located within the 200 kb in the class I region 300 kb telomeric of the HLA-B locus on the chromosome 6p21.3. We cloned two novel mucin-like genes designated panbronchiolitis related mucin-like 1 and 2 (PBMUCL1 and PBMUCL2) in the candidate region, which form a mucin-like gene cluster together with two adjacent genes, MUC21 and DPCR1. PBMUCL1 gene expression was remarkably upregulated by polyinosine-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] stimulation in normal human bronchial epithelial cells redifferentiated at the air-liquid interface. We found genetic polymorphisms in PBMUCL1 gene which were associated with DPB: the A-allele of the PBMUCL1 intron 2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was positively associated and variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism in exon 3 (1,890-base pair deletion) was negatively associated. Despite a strong association with HLA-B in the Japanese, the mucin-like gene PBMUCL1 is also one of the candidate genes of DPB susceptibility. 	Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485

7607577	19950614	Analysis of the complete sequence of the novel metastasis-associated candidate gene, mta1, differentially expressed in mammary adenocarcinoma and breast cancer cell lines.	To understand the genes and gene products involved in breast cancer invasion and metastasis, we previously isolated ten differentially expressed genes by differential cDNA library screening techniques, using the 13762NF rat mammary adenocarcinoma metastatic system. In this study, we further analysed a novel candidate metastasis-associated gene, mta1, previously designated clone 10.14. Northern blotting analyses showed that the steady-state mRNA expression level of mta1 was fourfold higher in a highly metastatic line (MTLn3) than in a nonmetastatic line (MTC.4). The mta1 gene was expressed at low levels in various normal rat organs, except testis, where it was expressed in high amounts. The mRNA expression levels of the human homologue of this gene were also examined in two human breast cancer metastatic systems; the ratios of mRNA were estimated to be MCF-7 (nonmetastatic):MCF7/LCC1 (invasive):MCF7/LCC2 (metastatic) = 1:2:4 and MDA-MB-468 (nonmetastatic):MDA231 (metastatic) = 1:4. Thus, the expression of this gene directly correlated with metastatic potential in two human systems, as well as in the rat metastatic system. Clone 10.14 was used to isolate a full-length cDNA clone for mta1, yielding the clone p10.14-C4.5, which was sequenced and analysed. Clone p10.14-C4.5 was 2756-bp long and contained a single open reading frame that could encode a protein of 703 amino acid (aa) residues. The aa sequence of mta1 was found to be novel by database homology search and contained possible phosphorylation sites for tyrosine kinase, protein kinase C and casein kinase II. A Pro-rich stretch was found at the C-terminal end that completely matched the consensus sequence for the SH3-binding motif.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) 	Gene	D016428 D013487
9267996	19970801	Studies of the genetic variability of the coding region of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha in Caucasians with maturity onset NIDDM.	Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha (HNF-4alpha) gene cause the type 1 form of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY1). To address the question of whether genetic variability of HNF-4alpha is associated with late onset non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) we have sequenced the coding region and intron/exon boundaries of the gene in 36 randomly recruited Danish NIDDM patients. Two nucleotide substitutions that changed the sequence of HNF-4alpha were identified: Thr/Ile130, which has been reported previously and a novel Val/Met255. The Val/Met 255 mutation was found in 4 of 477 Danish NIDDM patients and in none of 217 glucose tolerant control subjects; thus it cannot be excluded that this mutation may have an impact on NIDDM susceptibility. Among 509 NIDDM patients the allelic frequency of the Thr/Ile130 variant was 4.7% (95% confidence interval: 3.4-6.0%) compared to 1.9% (0.7-3.1%) among 239 control subjects (p = 0.008). However, in a population sample of 942 Swedish men with an average age of 70 years the allelic frequency of the variant was similar in 246 men with either impaired glucose tolerance (5.6% [2.6-8.6%]) or NIDDM (5.4% [2.7-8.1%]) as compared to 666 glucose tolerant men (5.1% [3.9-6.3%]). Also in a population sample of 369 young healthy Danes the prevalence of the codon 130 variant (4.7% [3.2-6.2%]) was similar to what was found in Swedish Caucasians. Thus, the allelic frequency of the Thr/Ile130 variant among the control subjects in the Danish case-control study deviates from the prevalence in the two other studies which is why we consider the significant association between the codon 130 variant and NIDDM an incidental finding. In glucose tolerant subjects the codon 130 variant in its heterozygous form had no major effect on glucose-induced insulin and C-peptide release although a tendency to a lower insulin secretion during an oral glucose tolerance test was seen in middle-aged subjects. In conclusion, variability in the coding region of the HNF-4alpha gene is not a common cause of NIDDM among whites of Danish ancestry. However, a Val/Met255 mutation was found exclusively in NIDDM patients (0.8% of cases) and functional as well as family segregation studies are needed to determine whether this HNF-4alpha variant is a NIDDM causing mutation.

3170557	19881015	Substitution of cysteine for glycine within the carboxyl-terminal telopeptide of the alpha 1 chain of type I collagen produces mild osteogenesis imperfecta.	We have characterized a mutation that produces mild, dominantly inherited osteogenesis imperfecta. Half of the alpha 1 (I) chains of type I collagen synthesized by cells from an affected individual contain a cysteine residue in the 196-residue carboxyl-terminal cyanogen bromide peptide of the triple-helical domain (Steinmann, B., Nicholls, A., and Pope, F. M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 8958-8964). Unexpectedly, sequence determined from a proteolytic fragment of the alpha 1 (I) chain derived from procollagen molecules synthesized in the presence of both [3H]proline and [35S]cysteine indicated that the cysteine is located at the third residue carboxyl-terminal to the triple-helical domain, normally a glycine. The nucleotide sequence of a fragment amplified from genomic DNA confirmed the location of the cysteine residue and showed that the mutation was a single nucleotide change in one COL1A1 allele. This represents a new class of mutations, point mutations outside the triple-helical domain of the chains of type I collagen, that produce the osteogenesis imperfecta phenotype. 	J._Biol._Chem.

12778315	20030605	Expression of a novel bHLH-Zip gene in human testis.	To identify specifically expressed genes in the adult and fetal testes. A human testis cDNA microarray was established. Then the mRNA of adult and fetal testis was purified and probes were prepared by a reverse transcription reaction with the testis mRNA as template. The microarray was hybridized with probes of adult and fetal testes. The nucleic sequences of differentially expressed genes were determined and homologies were searched in the databases of the GenBank. When hybridized with adult or fetal testis probes, the positive clones were 96.8 % and 95.4 %, respectively. Among these genes, one was a new testis-specific gene, which was named TSP1. TSP1 was highly expressed in human adult testis. The cDNA of TSP1 was 1,484 bp in length. The cDNA sequence of this clone was deposited in the Genbank (AF333098). TSP1 was also determined as Interim Gen Symbol (Unigene, No. Hs.98266). Protein analysis showed that TSP1 contained two functional domains: an N-terminal basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and a C-terminal leucine zipper (Zip). Homologous analysis showed that the 430 amino acid sequences deduced from the 1293 bp open reading frame (ORF) had a homology with the human gene FLJ2509 (AK098575). TSP1 had also a sequence homology with Spz 1 protein of mouse. Expression profiles showed that TSP1 was specifically and strongly expressed in the testis. TSP1 is a gene highly expressed in adult testis. It may play an important role in spermatogenesis in the humans. 	Asian_J._Androl.	D016428 D013485

16239304	20051022	Isolation and characterization of a transcriptional cofactor and its novel isoform that bind the deoxyribonucleic acid-binding domain of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma.	Using the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and hinge region of human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma as bait in yeast two-hybrid screen, we isolated partial cDNA identical with that of the C terminal of KIAA1769. KIAA1769 encodes a 2080-amino acid protein (molecular mass, 231 kDa) that was recently identified to interact with PPARalpha and termed PPARalpha-interacting cofactor 285 (here referred to as PPARgamma-DBD-interacting protein 1 (PDIP1)-alpha). PDIP1 mRNA was expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and THP-1 macrophages. We also identified the expression of the N terminal extended form of PDIP1alpha (referred to as PDIP1beta) consisting of 2649 amino acids (295 kDa) in human cultured cell lines by RT-PCR, and 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Ribonuclease protection assay revealed that PDIP1beta mRNA was expressed more abundantly than PDIP1alpha mRNA. The C-terminal region of PDIP1 directly binds DBD of PPARgamma, and multiple LXXLL motifs in PDIP1 were not required for the interaction. PDIP1alpha and -beta similarly enhanced PPARgamma-mediated transactivation in transfection assays and short interfering RNA targeting PDIP1 mRNA significantly reduced transactivation by PPARgamma. No potent intrinsic activation domain was identified in either PDIP1 isoforms in mammalian one-hybrid assays, and mutation of all LXXLL motifs did not affect enhancement of PPARgamma-mediated transactivation. PDIP1alpha and -beta similarly augmented transactivation by PPARalpha, PPARdelta, thyroid hormone receptor (TR)-alpha1, TRbeta1, and retinoid X receptor-alpha. PDIP1alpha also enhanced estrogen receptoralpha- and androgen receptor-mediated transactivation, whereas PDIP1beta did not. PDIP1alpha showed receptor-specific synergism with activation function-2-interacting coactivators in PPARgamma- and TRbeta1-mediated transactivation. Together, PDIP1 might function as a transcriptional cofactor for a broad range of nuclear receptors, possibly in collaboration with specific activation function-2 interacting coactivators.

8643460	19960514	Cloning and functional expression of cDNAs encoding human and rat pancreatic polypeptide receptors.	PCR was used to isolate nucleotide sequences that may encode novel members of the neuropeptide Y receptor family. By use of a PCR product as a hybridization probe, a full-length human cDNA was isolated that encodes a 375-aa protein with a predicted membrane topology identifying it as a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. After stable transfection of the cDNA into human embryonic kidney 293 cells, the receptor exhibited high affinity (Kd = 2.8 nM) for 125I-labeled human pancreatic polypeptide (PP). Competition binding studies in whole cells indicated the following rank order of potency: human PP = bovine PP &gt; or = human [Pro34]peptide YY &gt; rat PP &gt; human peptide YY = human neuropeptide Y. Northern blot analysis revealed that human PP receptor mRNA is most abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle and, to a lesser extent, in lung and brain tissue. A rat cDNA clone encoding a high-affinity PP receptor that is 74% identical to the human PP receptor at the amino acid level was also isolated. These receptor clones will be useful in elucidating the functional role of PP and designing selective PP receptor agonists and antagonists. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428
17237349	20070124	S locus genes and the evolution of self-fertility in Arabidopsis thaliana.	Loss of self-incompatibility (SI) in Arabidopsis thaliana was accompanied by inactivation of genes required for SI, including S-LOCUS RECEPTOR KINASE (SRK) and S-LOCUS CYSTEINE-RICH PROTEIN (SCR), coadapted genes that constitute the SI specificity-determining S haplotype. Arabidopsis accessions are polymorphic for PsiSRK and PsiSCR, but it is unknown if the species harbors structurally different S haplotypes, either representing relics of ancestral functional and structurally heteromorphic S haplotypes or resulting from decay concomitant with or subsequent to the switch to self-fertility. We cloned and sequenced the S haplotype from C24, in which self-fertility is due solely to S locus inactivation, and show that this haplotype was produced by interhaplotypic recombination. The highly divergent organization and sequence of the C24 and Columbia-0 (Col-0) S haplotypes demonstrate that the A. thaliana S locus underwent extensive structural remodeling in conjunction with a relaxation of selective pressures that once preserved the integrity and linkage of coadapted SRK and SCR alleles. Additional evidence for this process was obtained by assaying 70 accessions for the presence of C24- or Col-0-specific sequences. Furthermore, analysis of SRK and SCR polymorphisms in these accessions argues against the occurrence of a selective sweep of a particular allele of SCR, as previously proposed.

The complete amino acid sequence of the A chain of mistletoe lectin I was determined via Edman degradation sequencing of the N-terminus and tryptic and endoproteinase Asp-N overlapping fragments, amino acid analysis and MALDI-MS. The data obtained show a great homology with the chains of ribosome-inactivating proteins such as ricin and abrin with 111 (abrin-a) and 103 (ricin-D) amino acid residues conserved, respectively.

15790869	20050326	A novel GCAP1 missense mutation (L151F) in a large family with autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy (adCORD).	To elucidate the phenotypic and biochemical characteristics of a novel mutation associated with autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy (adCORD). Twenty-three family members of a CORD pedigree underwent clinical examinations, including visual acuity tests, standardized full-field ERG, and fundus photography. Genomic DNA was screened for mutations in GCAP1 exons using DNA sequencing and single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Function and stability of recombinant GCAP1-L151F were tested as a function of [Ca(2+)], and its structure was probed by molecular dynamics. Affected family members experienced dyschromatopsia, hemeralopia, and reduced visual acuity by the second to third decade of life. Electrophysiology revealed a nonrecordable photopic response with later attenuation of the scotopic response. Affected family members harbored a C--&gt;T transition in exon 4 of the GCAP1 gene, resulting in an L151F missense mutation affecting the EF hand motif 4 (EF4). This change was absent in 11 unaffected family members and in 100 unrelated normal subjects. GCAP1-L151F stimulation of photoreceptor guanylate cyclase was not completely inhibited at high physiological [Ca(2+)], consistent with a lowered affinity for Ca(2+)-binding to EF4. A novel L151F mutation in the EF4 hand domain of GCAP1 is associated with adCORD. The clinical phenotype is characterized by early cone dysfunction and a progressive loss of rod function. The biochemical phenotype is best described as persistent stimulation of photoreceptor guanylate cyclase, representing a gain of function of mutant GCAP1. Although a conservative substitution, molecular dynamics suggests a significant change in Ca(2+)-binding to EF4 and EF2 and changes in the shape of L151F-GCAP1. 	Invest._Ophthalmol._Vis._Sci.

16924388	20060823	Wide clinical spectrum in a family with hereditary lymphedema type I due to a novel missense mutation in VEGFR3.	Hereditary lymphedema type I (HL-I), also known as Milroy disease, is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by typical phenotype of infantile onset lower-limb lymphedema accompanied by variable expression of recurrent episodes of cellulites, toenail changes, and papillomatosis. Mutations in the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3), also known as FLT4 gene, which encodes a lymphatic endothelial-specific tyrosine kinase receptor, have been identified as a genetic cause of HL-I. We report a large Muslim Arab family residing in northern Israel with 14 individuals presenting clinical features of HL-I. Genetic analysis revealed novel missense mutation E1106K in the tyrosine kinase domain II of VEGFR3 that cosegregates with the disorder in the family. Most affected individuals presented with bilateral congenital lower-limb lymphedema. Wide intrafamilial phenotypic variability included two asymptomatic individuals, a case of prenatal hydrothorax evolving to hydrops fetalis, and a late-onset complication, yet unreported, of chronic degenerative joint disease of the knees. This report broadens the known &quot;classic&quot; phenotype of HL-I. 	J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
11297504	20010412	Histologic phenotype-genotype correlation of corneal dystrophies associated with eight distinct mutations in the TGFBI gene.	To establish a phenotype-genotype correlation of various autosomal-dominant corneal dystrophies among French subjects. Retrospective molecular genetic study and clinicopathologic correlation. Forty-four subjects from 26 unrelated French families were included in this study, and 60 corneal buttons could be examined at the histologic and ultrastructural levels. Light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were performed on corneal specimens obtained during keratoplasty. Blood samples were collected for DNA analysis. After genomic DNA extraction from peripheral blood leukocytes of each family member, exons of the TGFBI gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the PCR products were directly sequenced on both strands. Four different mutations were found to be responsible for dystrophy of granular type (R555W, R124L, R124H, and R124L+delT125-delE126), three other different mutations produced a lattice type (R124C, H626R, and A546T), and the last mutation identified was associated with the honeycomb-shaped dystrophy (R555Q). Each subtype of dystrophy showed, histologically and ultrastructurally, specific characteristics that are easily recognizable. However, besides these stereotyped forms, differential histologic diagnosis of atypical forms remains difficult, and these forms could be misdiagnosed. The characteristic biomicroscopic appearance and histopathologic features of each &quot;classic&quot; dystrophy present a significant degree of specificity and generally provide an accurate diagnosis. However, atypical forms in which clinical and histologic data alone could be misleading, are unequivocally diagnosed after DNA analysis. 	Ophthalmology	D016428
7842016	19941001	Structure and expression of the gene responsible for the triplet repeat disorder, dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA).	Dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy is associated with expansion of an unstable CAG repeat on chromosome 12p. We have determined the nucleotide sequences of overlapping cDNA clones and deduced the gene structure. The gene is ubiquitously expressed to form a single 4.5 kb transcript and encoded by an open reading frame of 1184 amino acids (aa), in which a polyglutamine track with variable length starts at aa 484. Although the predicted amino acid sequence does not reveal any function, it does contain several interesting motifs consisting of a simple repeated amino acid sequence, a homo-proline track, two stretches of arginine-glutamic acid dipeptides and a stretch of alternative histidine residues. These results provide clues toward understanding neurodegenerative diseases associated with triplet repeat expansion. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D013485
10735273	19970501	The genomic organization of human dystrobrevin.	Dystrophin-related and dystrophin-associated proteins (DAPs) are thought to play an important role in the stability and maintenance of the plasma membrane during muscle contraction and relaxation. Studies conducted on the electric organ of Torpedo californica have shown that some of the DAPs are also involved in the formation and maintenance of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). In addition, dystrophin and several DAPs have been shown to be the primary genetic defect in a number of phenotypically similar muscular dystrophies. We previously reported the identification and characterization of human dystrobrevin, a protein which is unique in being both homologous to dystrophin and a dystrophin-associated protein. Here we describe the genomic organization of the human dystrobrevin gene. It is encoded by 23 exons spanning at least 180 kb of chromosome 18q12. Three different C-termini of dystrobrevin are generated by the mutually exclusive mRNA splicing of three exons. Two alternatively spliced exons (exons 11A and 12) are utilized exclusively in striated muscles. A comparison between the genomic organization of dystrophin and human dystrobrevin shows that the two genes have significant similarities in their genomic structure, implying an ancestral or evolutionary relationship. Based on intronic sequence, a primer set was designed to specifically amplify each exon of dystrobrevin to screen for mutations by SSCP in patients with neuromuscular diseases for which dystrobrevin could be a candidate.

10053007	19990303	Cyclic ichthyosis with epidermolytic hyperkeratosis: A phenotype conferred by mutations in the 2B domain of keratin K1.	Bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (BCIE) is characterized by blistering and erythroderma in infancy and by erythroderma and ichthyosis thereafter. Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis is a hallmark feature of light and electron microscopy. Here we report on four individuals from two families with a unique clinical disorder with histological findings of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. Manifesting erythema and superficial erosions at birth, which improved during the first few months of life, affected individuals later developed palmoplantar hyperkeratosis with patchy erythema and scale elsewhere on the body. Three affected individuals exhibit dramatic episodic flares of annular, polycyclic erythematous plaques with scale, which coalesce to involve most of the body surface. The flares last weeks to months. In the interim periods the skin may be normal, except for palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. Abnormal keratin-filament aggregates were observed in suprabasal keratinocytes from both probands, suggesting that the causative mutation might reside in keratin K1 or keratin K10. In one proband, sequencing of K1 revealed a heterozygous mutation, 1436T--&gt;C, predicting a change of isoleucine to threonine in the highly conserved helix-termination motif. In the second family, a heterozygous mutation, 1435A--&gt;T, was found in K1, predicting an isoleucine-to-phenylalanine substitution in the same codon. Both mutations were excluded in both a control population and all unaffected family members tested. These findings reveal that a clinical phenotype distinct from classic BCIE but with similar histology can result from K1 mutations and that mutations at this codon give rise to a clinically unique condition.

2402637	19900921	Structure and function of lipopolysaccharide binding protein.	The primary structure of lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), a trace plasma protein that binds to the lipid A moiety of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), was deduced by sequencing cloned complementary DNA. LBP shares sequence identity with another LPS binding protein found in granulocytes, bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein, and with cholesterol ester transport protein of the plasma. LBP may control the response to LPS under physiologic conditions by forming high-affinity complexes with LPS that bind to monocytes and macrophages, which then secrete tumor necrosis factor. The identification of this pathway for LPS-induced monocyte stimulation may aid in the development of treatments for diseases in which Gram-negative sepsis or endotoxemia are involved.

11735029	20011206	Novel mutations of MYO15A associated with profound deafness in consanguineous families and moderately severe hearing loss in a patient with Smith-Magenis syndrome.	Mutations in myosin XVA are responsible for the shaker 2 ( sh2) phenotype in mice and nonsyndromic autosomal recessive profound hearing loss DFNB3 on chromosome 17p11.2. We have ascertained seven families with profound congenital hearing loss from Pakistan and India with evidence of linkage to DFNB3 at 17p11.2. We report three novel homozygous mutations in MYO15A segregating in three of these families.

21705420	20110628	Distinctive genetic and clinical features of CMT4J: a severe neuropathy caused by mutations in the PI(3,5)P? phosphatase FIG4.	Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a genetically heterogeneous group of motor and sensory neuropathies associated with mutations in more than 30 genes. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J (OMIM 611228) is a recessive, potentially severe form of the disease caused by mutations of the lipid phosphatase FIG4. We provide a more complete view of the features of this disorder by describing 11 previously unreported patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J. Three patients were identified from a small cohort selected for screening because of their early onset disease and progressive proximal as well as distal weakness. Eight patients were identified by large-scale exon sequencing of an unselected group of 4000 patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. In addition, 34 new FIG4 variants were detected. Ten of the new CMT4J cases have the compound heterozygous genotype FIG4(I41T/null) described in the original four families, while one has the novel genotype FIG4(L17P/nul)(l). The population frequency of the I41T allele was found to be 0.001 by genotyping 5769 Northern European controls. Thirty four new variants of FIG4 were identified. The severity of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J ranges from mild clinical signs to severe disability requiring the use of a wheelchair. Both mild and severe forms have been seen in patients with the same genotype. The results demonstrate that Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J is characterized by highly variable onset and severity, proximal as well as distal and asymmetric muscle weakness, electromyography demonstrating denervation in proximal and distal muscles, and frequent progression to severe amyotrophy. FIG4 mutations should be considered in Charcot-Marie-Tooth patients with these characteristics, especially if found in combination with sporadic or recessive inheritance, childhood onset and a phase of rapid progression.

23559863	20130406	Novel compound heterozygous mutations in MYO7A in a Chinese family with Usher syndrome type 1.	To identify the disease-causing mutation(s) in a Chinese family with autosomal recessive Usher syndrome type 1 (USH1). An ophthalmic examination and an audiometric test were conducted to ascertain the phenotype of two affected siblings. The microsatellite marker D11S937, which is close to the candidate gene MYO7A (USH1B locus), was selected for genotyping. From the DNA of the proband, all coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of MYO7A were sequenced to identify the disease-causing mutation(s). Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was performed to exclude the alternative conclusion that the mutations are non-pathogenic rare polymorphisms. Based on severe hearing impairment, unintelligible speech, and retinitis pigmentosa, a clinical diagnosis of Usher syndrome type 1 was made. The genotyping results did not exclude the USH1B locus, which suggested that the MYO7A gene was likely the gene associated with the disease-causing mutation(s) in the family. With direct DNA sequencing of MYO7A, two novel compound heterozygous mutations (c.3742G&gt;A and c.6051+1G&gt;A) of MYO7A were identified in the proband. DNA sequence analysis and RFLP analysis of other family members showed that the mutations cosegregated with the disease. Unaffected members, including the parents, uncle, and sister of the proband, carry only one of the two mutations. The mutations were not present in the controls (100 normal Chinese subjects=200 chromosomes) according to the RFLP analysis. In this study, we identified two novel mutations, c.3742G&gt;A (p.E1248K) and c.6051+1G&gt;A (donor splice site mutation in intron 44), of MYO7A in a Chinese non-consanguineous family with USH1. The mutations cosegregated with the disease and most likely cause the phenotype in the two affected siblings who carry these mutations compound heterozygously. Our finding expands the mutational spectrum of MYO7A. 	Mol._Vis.	D016428 D013485
10571954	19991126	Glycogen storage disease type IIIa: first report of a causative missense mutation (G1448R) of the glycogen debranching enzyme gene found in a homozygous patient.	Several different mutations in the glycogen-debranching enzyme gene AGL have been found in patients with glycogen storage disease type III (GSD III) to date, but no missense mutations have been reported for GSD III, only nonsense, splicing, and deletion/insertion lesions. Here we describe a novel G1448R missense mutation in a Japanese GSD IIIa patient from a consanguineous family. Sequence analysis of cDNA from the patient' liver specimen revealed two separate nucleotide changes: a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 3737 in exon 26 (3737G&gt;A) and a G-to-C transversion at nucleotide 4742 in exon 33 (4742G&gt;C), both of which result in substitution of glycine by arginine (G1115R and G1448R). Because homo-zygotes for G1115R were found in healthy controls, G1115R seems to be a polymorphism. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis with Bsa JI showed that the patient was homozygous for G1448R and that none of the normal controls had the mutation. This missense mutation is located at a putative glycogen-binding site that is indispensable for enzyme activity. Thus, G1448R is likely to be the causative mutation in this patient. This is the first report of a missense mutation associated with GSD III. 	Hum._Mutat.	D002363 D016428 D013485
21212097	20110108	Exome sequencing reveals a novel mutation for autosomal recessive non-syndromic mental retardation in the TECR gene on chromosome 19p13.	Exome sequencing is a powerful tool for discovery of the Mendelian disease genes. Previously, we reported a novel locus for autosomal recessive non-syndromic mental retardation (NSMR) in a consanguineous family [Nolan, D.K., Chen, P., Das, S., Ober, C. and Waggoner, D. (2008) Fine mapping of a locus for nonsyndromic mental retardation on chromosome 19p13. Am. J. Med. Genet. A, 146A, 1414-1422]. Using linkage and homozygosity mapping, we previously localized the gene to chromosome 19p13. The parents of this sibship were recently included in an exome sequencing project. Using a series of filters, we narrowed the putative causal mutation to a single variant site that segregated with NSMR: the mutation was homozygous in five affected siblings but in none of eight unaffected siblings. This mutation causes a substitution of a leucine for a highly conserved proline at amino acid 182 in TECR (trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA reductase), a synaptic glycoprotein. Our results reveal the value of massively parallel sequencing for identification of novel disease genes that could not be found using traditional approaches and identifies only the seventh causal mutation for autosomal recessive NSMR.

1840485	19910515	Cloning and expression of a new pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein member.	Human pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoproteins (PSGs) are a group of closely related placental glycoproteins and members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. To study possible functional roles of PSG, three type 1 cDNA clones which encode PSG in a N-A1-A2-B2-C domain arrangement have been characterized in this laboratory. Now, we report the cloning of a type II cDNA (PSG9) which is 1512 bp and encodes a PSG of 332 amino acids in a N-A1-B2-C domain arrangement. In vitro expression experiments demonstrate that PSG9 encodes a 36 kDa nonglycosylated protein which is processed to a glycosylated protein of 46 kDa. Ribonuclease protection analyses show that PSG mRNAs that share sequence similarity with the PSG9 transcript are expressed in both human placenta and placental fibroblasts.

We have cloned full-length DDC cDNAs from a human hepatoma cDNA library [DDC; dopa decarboxylase; aromatic-L-amino acid decarboxylase, EC 4.1.1.28]. The protein encoded by hepatoma cells is the same as that encoded by adrenal chromaffin derived pheochromocytoma cells, despite reported differences in biochemical properties. We have confirmed the location of the DDC gene to chromosome 7 using a new panel of somatic cell hybrids, and we have localized the gene to band p11 on chromosome 7 by fluorescent in situ hybridization. The human gene retains 65% amino acid identity with Drosophila DDC (Accession No. X04426) and considerable structural similarity with other enzymes (F.R. Jackson, 1990, J. Mol.

11030413	20001013	Porphobilinogen deaminase gene in African and Afro-Caribbean ethnic groups: mutations causing acute intermittent porphyria and specific intragenic polymorphisms.	Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), the most common acute hepatic porphyria, is a low-penetrant autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) or hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) gene. Although AIP has been identified in all the main ethnic groups, little is known about PBGD gene defects in Africans, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Americans. We have carried out PBGD gene screening among seven unrelated AIP families and 98 controls belonging to the Afro-Caribbean (French West Indies) and the sub-Saharan African (Morocco, Algeria, Cameroon, Mali, and Burkina Faso) populations. Using denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and direct sequencing we characterized six different mutations, including four novel, from the seven AIP families: three splicing defects (IVS 5+2 Ins G; IVS 7+1 G to A in two families; IVS 10-1 G to T); a small deletion (1004 Del G); and two missense mutations (R116 W; A270G). The allele frequencies of the 14 polymorphic sites, previously known in the normal Caucasian population, were similar in Africans and Afro-Caribbean control populations. Interestingly, two common new intragenic polymorphic sites, close to intron/junction boundaries, were identified only in blacks: 1) in intron 2, a single base-pair G deletion at position 3167 (G:0.88; delG:0.12); 2) in intron 10, a A/G dimorphism at position 7052 (A:0.56; G:0.44). These two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were never encountered in 750 unrelated Caucasian subjects. The allele frequency distributions of populations within black ethnic groups (Africans and Afro-Caribbean) are similar. This study highlights differences both in PBGD gene mutations causing AIP and in SNPs between white and black peoples; the allele frequencies provided contribute to a better knowledge of the variability of these markers among the major population groups, especially in sub-Saharan West African and Afro-Caribbean populations.

24183479	20131105	Salbutamol-responsive limb-girdle congenital myasthenic syndrome due to a novel missense mutation and heteroallelic deletion in MUSK.	Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders characterized by a neuromuscular transmission defect. In recent years, causative mutations have been identified in atleast 15 genes encoding proteins of the neuromuscular junction. Mutations in MUSK are known as a very rare genetic cause of CMS and have been described in only three families, world-wide. Consequently, the knowledge about efficient drug therapy is very limited. We identified a novel missense mutation (p.Asp38Glu) heteroallelic to a genomic deletion affecting exons 2-3 of MUSK as cause of a limb-girdle CMS in two brothers of Turkish origin. Clinical symptoms included fatigable limb weakness from early childhood on. Upon diagnosis of a MUSK-related CMS at the age of 16 and 13years, respectively, treatment with salbutamol was initiated leading to an impressive improvement of clinical symptoms, while treatment with esterase inhibitors did not show any benefit. Our findings highlight the importance of a molecular diagnosis in CMS and demonstrate considerable similarities between patients with MUSK and DOK7-related CMS in terms of clinical phenotype and treatment options.

We have studied two IBS families and have identified heterozygous point mutations in codon 493 of the K2e gene in both families. Whereas a non-conservative amino acid substitution at position 117 of the 2B region of K2e (E117K) was associated with a severe phenotype in family 1, family 2 showed mild clinical features as a result of a conservative substitution (E117D).

9175790	19970529	Identification of two novel insulin receptor mutations, Asp59Gly and Leu62Pro, in type A syndrome of extreme insulin resistance.	To elucidate genetic determinants of insulin resistance, we investigated insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) genes, in vitro IR function and in vivo insulin sensitivity in a family with Type A syndrome. Two missense IR mutations (Asp59Gly and Leu62Pro) found in the proband, resulted in reduction by 90% of insulin binding to erythrocytes, decreased receptor autophosphorylation and a dramatic reduction of insulin sensitivity. The proband and mother were heterozygote for Gly972Arg IRS-1 variant. Asp59Gly mutation, also carried by proband's brother with no consequence on insulin sensitivity, was inherited from the mother who is diabetic and insulin resistant and Leu62Pro was from the father. We conclude that severity of insulin resistance in the proband may be explained by the genetic condition of compound heterozygote for IR mutations while severe insulin resistance in the mother raises the possibility that other genetic factors, like IRS-1 polymorphisms, may contribute to the phenotypic expression of IR mutations.

22120146	20111129	Identification of PRRT2 as the causative gene of paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesias.	Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesias is a paroxysmal movement disorder characterized by recurrent, brief attacks of abnormal involuntary movements induced by sudden voluntary movements. Although several loci, including the pericentromeric region of chromosome 16, have been linked to paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesias, the causative gene has not yet been identified. Here, we identified proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) as a causative gene of paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesias by using a combination of exome sequencing and linkage analysis. Genetic linkage mapping with 11 markers that encompassed the pericentromeric of chromosome 16 was performed in 27 members of two families with autosomal dominant paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesias. Then, the whole-exome sequencing was performed in three patients from these two families. By combining the defined linkage region (16p12.1-q12.1) and the results of exome sequencing, we identified an insertion mutation c.649_650InsC (p.P217fsX7) in one family and a nonsense mutation c.487C&gt;T (p.Q163X) in another family. To confirm our findings, we sequenced the exons and flanking introns of PRRT2 in another three families with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesias. The c.649_650InsC (p.P217fsX7) mutation was identified in two of these families, whereas a missense mutation, c.796C&gt;T (R266W), was identified in another family with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesias. All of these mutations completely co-segregated with the phenotype in each family. None of these mutations was identified in 500 normal unaffected individuals of matched geographical ancestry. Thus, we have identified PRRT2 as the first causative gene of paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesias, warranting further investigations to understand the pathogenesis of this disorder.

1303260	19921001	Human homologs of a Drosophila Enhancer of split gene product define a novel family of nuclear proteins.	Notch and the m9/10 gene (groucho) of the Enhancer of split (E(spI)) complex are members of the &quot;Notch group&quot; of genes, which is required for a variety of cell fate choices in Drosophila. We have characterized human cDNA clones encoding a family of proteins, designated TLE, that are homologous to the E(spI) m9/10 gene product, as well as a novel Notch-related protein. The TLE genes are differentially expressed and encode nuclear proteins, consistent with the presence of sequence motifs associated with nuclear functions. The structural redundancy implied by the existence of more than one TLE and Notch-homologous gene may be a feature of the human counterparts of the developmentally important Drosophila Notch group genes.

11850849	20020219	Identification of RB1CC1, a novel human gene that can induce RB1 in various human cells.	Multidrug resistance to anti-cancer agents (MDR) is a major barrier to successful cancer treatment. Current knowledge about genes that contribute to MDR is limited, however, and its mechanisms remain unclear. To identify genes involved in MDR, we performed differential display analysis and isolated a novel human gene, RB1CC1 (RBI-inducible Coiled-Coil 1). The 6.6-kb RB1CC1 cDNA encodes a putative 1594-amino-acid protein that contains a nuclear localization signal, a leucine zipper motif and a coiled-coil structure. Western blot analysis and immunocytochemical staining with anti-RB1CC1 antibody showed that endogenously expressed RB1CC1 protein localized to the nucleus. In MDR variants of human osteosarcoma cells, RB1CC1 expression increased in response to doxorubicin-induced cytotoxic stress and remained elevated for the duration of drug treatment. RB1CC1 expression levels correlated closely with those of RB1 (retinoblastoma 1) in cancer cell lines as well as in various normal human tissues. Moreover, introduction of wild-type RB1CC1 significantly induced RB1 expression in human leukemic cells. These data suggest that RB1CC1 may be a key regulator of RB1 gene expression.

9501883	19980321	Evaluation of the human arrestin gene in patients with retinitis pigmentosa and stationary night blindness.	To establish the DNA sequence of the coding regions of the human arrestin locus and to determine whether defects in this sequence are present among patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) or types of stationary night blindness in addition to Oguchi disease. The human genomic locus encoding arrestin was cloned in bacteriophage and P1 vectors. The sequence of the intron DNA flanking each exon was determined from these clones. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct genomic sequencing techniques were used to screen 272 unrelated patients, comprising 177 patients with autosomal dominant RP, 85 with recessive RP, and 10 with stationary night blindness. The arrestin gene is divided into 16 exons ranging in size from 10 bp to 194 bp, with the open reading frame spanning exons 2 through 16. The authors identified several discrepancies between the genomic sequence the authors obtained and the previously published cDNA and genomic sequences. In the set of patients with dominant RP, the authors found one of three heterozygous missense changes (Arg84Cys, Thr125Met, and Val378Ile) in each of four unrelated patients; none of these changes cosegregated with disease in the respective families. In the set of patients with recessive RP, the authors found one of two heterozygous missense changes in each of two unrelated patients with recessive RP (Pro364Leu and Arg384Cys). One of the patients was the offspring of a consanguineous marriage; because the Arg384Cys change in him was heterozygous, it is unlikely to have been the cause of his RP. Cosegregation studies could not be performed on the patient with the Pro364Leu change. The authors confirmed the existence of two previously described polymorphisms (Ile76Val and a multiallelic polymorphism at codon 403), and the authors identified several silent polymorphisms and rare sequence variants. No sequence changes, other than polymorphic changes also found in some patients with RP, were identified in the patients with stationary night blindness. We found no evidence that mutations in arrestin are a cause of RP or stationary night blindness other than Oguchi disease. According to the genomic sequence obtained, a region in exon 8 that has been postulated to represent the site of interaction between arrestin and rhodopsin is 100% conserved between humans and all other mammals studied to date.

22226083	20120110	Transient infantile hypertriglyceridemia, fatty liver, and hepatic fibrosis caused by mutated GPD1, encoding glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1.	The molecular basis for primary hereditary hypertriglyceridemia has been identified in fewer than 5% of cases. Investigation of monogenic dyslipidemias has the potential to expose key metabolic pathways. We describe a hitherto unreported disease in ten individuals manifesting as moderate to severe transient childhood hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver followed by hepatic fibrosis and the identification of the mutated gene responsible for this condition. We performed SNP array-based homozygosity mapping and found a single large continuous segment of homozygosity on chromosomal region 12q13.12. The candidate region contained 35 genes that are listed in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and 27 other genes. We performed candidate gene sequencing and screened both clinically affected individuals (children and adults with hypertriglyceridemia) and also a healthy cohort for mutations in GPD1, which encodes glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1. Mutation analysis revealed a homozygous splicing mutation, c.361-1G&gt;C, which resulted in an aberrantly spliced mRNA in the ten affected individuals. This mutation is predicted to result in a truncated protein lacking essential conserved residues, including a functional site responsible for initial substrate recognition. Functional consequences of the mutation were evaluated by measuring intracellular concentrations of cholesterol and triglyceride as well as triglyceride secretion in HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma) human cells lines overexpressing normal and mutant GPD1 cDNA. Overexpression of mutant GPD1 in HepG2 cells, in comparison to overexpression of wild-type GPD1, resulted in increased secretion of triglycerides (p = 0.01). This finding supports the pathogenicity of the identified mutation. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013485
10206679	19990417	Novel allele of the insulin receptor substrate-1 bearing two non-conservative amino acid substitutions in a patient with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Mutations in brief no. 130. Online.	We analyzed by SSCP the complete IRS-1 coding sequence in NIDDM patient #25 D. Unique conformers corresponding to a Ser to Tyr substitution at codon 1043 (S1043Y), and to a Cys to Tyr substitution at codon 1095 (C1095Y) were detected in this patient. The results of sequential digestion with restriction enzymes indicated that the novel sequence variants segregate on the same allele. Relatives of patient #25 D were not available for study, to confirm segregation of the novel allele with NIDDM in the family. Several lines of evidence suggest that the non-conservative amino acid substitutions detected in NIDDM patient #25 D have the potential to affect IRS-1 functions and could play a pathogenic role in this patient. Both S1043Y and C1095Y occur in a highly conserved sequence from human skeletal muscle, human hepatoma, mouse, and rat IRS-1. Protein subsequence analysis revealed that the S1043Y substitution abolishes a consensus sequence for glycogen synthase kinase 3 phosphorylation. Furthermore, S1043Y and C1095Y are not common IRS-1 polymorphisms as they were detected only in 1/136 choromosomes from NIDDM patients (allele frequency in NIDDM patients = 0.0007) and in 0/120 chromosomes from control subjects.

7565946	19951026	Mutations of the growth hormone receptor in children with idiopathic short stature. The Growth Hormone Insensitivity Study Group.	Short stature in children who are not deficient in growth hormone (GH) is probably caused by a variety of defects. Some children with idiopathic short stature have low serum concentrations of GH-binding protein, which is derived from the GH receptor. The possibility that low serum concentrations of GH-binding protein might indicate partial insensitivity to GH led us to investigate possible defects in the gene for the GH receptor in children with idiopathic short stature and low serum concentrations of GH-binding protein. We studied 14 children with idiopathic short stature who were selected on the basis of normal GH secretion and low serum concentrations of GH-binding protein. Analysis of single-strand conformation polymorphisms and DNA sequencing were both used to identify mutations in the GH-receptor gene. Mutations in the region of the GH-receptor gene that codes for the extracellular domain of the receptor were found in 4 of the 14 children, but in none of 24 normal subjects. One of the four children with mutations was a compound heterozygote, with one mutation that reduced the affinity of the receptor for GH and a second mutation that may affect a function other than ligand binding. The remaining three children had single mutations in one allele of the gene. One mutation introduced a premature termination codon, and two caused substitutions of single amino acids in a structurally conserved domain of the receptor. Some children with idiopathic short stature may have partial insensitivity to GH due to mutations in the GH-receptor gene. 	N._Engl._J._Med.	D016428 D013485
23418007	20130219	Autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (SCAR7) is caused by variants in TPP1, the gene involved in classic late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 2 disease (CLN2 disease).	Spinocerebellar ataxias are phenotypically, neuropathologically, and genetically heterogeneous. The locus of autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCAR7) was previously linked to chromosome band 11p15. We have identified TPP1 as the causative gene for SCAR7 by exome sequencing. A missense and a splice site variant in TPP1, cosegregating with the disease, were found in a previously described SCAR7 family and also in another patient with a SCAR7 phenotype. TPP1, encoding the tripeptidyl-peptidase 1 enzyme, is known as the causative gene for late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis disease 2 (CLN2 disease). CLN2 disease is characterized by epilepsy, loss of vision, ataxia, and a rapidly progressive course, leading to early death. SCAR7 patients showed ataxia and low activity of tripeptidyl-peptidase 1, but no ophthalmologic abnormalities or epilepsy. Also, the slowly progressive evolution of the disease until old age and absence of ultra structural curvilinear profiles is different from the known CLN2 phenotypes. Our findings now expand the phenotypes related to TPP1-variants to SCAR7. In spite of the limited sample size and measurements, a putative genotype-phenotype correlation may be drawn: we hypothesize that loss of function variants abolishing TPP1 enzyme activity lead to CLN2 disease, whereas variants that diminish TPP1 enzyme activity lead to SCAR7.

9790751	19981029	Characterization and screening for mutations of the growth arrest-specific 11 (GAS11) and C16orf3 genes at 16q24.3 in breast cancer.	Loss of heterozygosity involving the long arm of chromosome 16 is a frequent event seen in a number of human carcinomas, including breast, prostate, hepatocellular, and ovarian cancers. A region found to be commonly deleted in breast and prostate carcinomas is located at 16q24.3, which suggests the presence of a tumor suppressor gene that may be altered in these two malignancies. A detailed physical and transcription map of this region that includes the loci defining the smallest region of deletion has been constructed. This report describes the characterization of a transcript located in this region, the growth arrest-specific 11 (GAS11) gene, which was viewed as a potential tumor suppressor gene due to the expression of its mouse homolog specifically during growth arrest. The gene consists of 11 exons spanning approximately 25 kb. Northern blot analysis identified two ubiquitously expressed mRNAs of 3.4 and 1.8 kb produced by the use of alternative polyadenylation sites. Another gene, C16orf3 (chromosome 16 open reading frame 3), was found to lie within intron 2 of GAS11. This gene appears intronless, is transcribed in the orientation opposite to that of GAS11, and is expressed at low levels. These genes were examined for mutations in breast tumor DNA, and both were excluded as tumor suppressor genes involved in breast cancer. 	Genomics	D016428 D013485 D013487
10878661	20000706	Familial hypomagnesaemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis maps to chromosome 3q27 and is associated with mutations in the PCLN-1 gene.	Familial hypomagnesaemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC, MIM 248250) is a complex renal tubular disorder characterised by hypomagnesaemia, hypercalciuria, advanced nephrocalcinosis, hyposthenuria and progressive renal failure. The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive. A primary defect in the reabsorption of magnesium in the medullary thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (mTAL) has been proposed to be essential in FHHNC pathophysiology. To identify the underlying genetic defect we performed linkage analysis in eight families, including three with consanguineous marriages. We found linkage to microsatellite markers on chromosome 3q27 with a maximum two-point lod score (Zmax) of 5.208 for D3S3530 without evidence for genetic heterogeneity. Haplotype analysis revealed crucial recombination events reducing the critical interval to 6.6cM. Recently, mutations in the gene PCLN-1, mapping to 3q27 and coding for paracellin-1, were identified by Simon et al (1999) as the underlying genetic defect in FHHNC. Paracellin-1 represents a renal tight junction protein predominantly expressed in the TAL. Mutational analysis in our patient cohort revealed eight different mutations in the PCLN-1 gene, within six novel mutations. In seven of 13 mutant alleles we detected a Leu151 substitution without evidence for a founder effect. Leu151 is a residue of the first extracellular loop of paracellin-1, the part of the protein expected to bridge the intercellular space and to be important for paracellular conductance. This study confirms the implication of paracellin-1 defects in FHHNC and points to a predominant role of this protein in the paracellular reabsorption of divalent cations in the TAL.

1354271	19920801	Tetranectin, a plasminogen kringle 4-binding protein. Cloning and gene expression pattern in human colon cancer.	Tetranectin is a recently discovered protein that binds to kringle 4 region of plasminogen (Clemmensen I, Petersen LC, Kluft C. Eur J Biochem 1986; 156:327. The mRNA encoding human tetranectin was cloned by using degenerate primers in a reverse transcriptase reaction followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification. The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was examined by DNA sequencing and subsequently used as probe for screening a human placental cDNA library. A full length cDNA clone (TET-1) was isolated, characterized, and used for Northern blot and in situ hybridization. DNA sequencing analysis revealed a 874-base pair cDNA containing an open reading frame of 606 base pairs encoding 202 amino acids. A classical signal peptide was present starting with the initiation methionine. The mature tetranectin chain consisted of 181 amino acids (M(r) = 20,169). The 3' noncoding region contained a single polyadenylation signal and a 26-residue poly A tail. The predicted amino acid sequence of the mature tetranectin chain showed, except for one amino acid, complete identity to that obtained by sequencing of the native protein (Fuhlendorff J, Clemmensen I, Magnusson S, Biochemistry 1987;26:6757). Northern blot of poly A+ revealed a single band of approximately 1 kb. Northern blot analysis of poly A+ isolated from a series of normal human tissues (lung, liver, spleen, kidney, and pancreas) revealed a distinct hybridization band that was especially prominent in the lungs and spleen. No hybridization signal was detected in three carcinoma cell lines examined in parallel. Northern blot analysis of poly A+ RNA isolated from solid tumors revealed a tetranectin specific mRNA band. In situ hybridizations on tissue sections of colon carcinomas and normal colon tissues revealed a strong and distinct hybridization signal of stromal cells in colon carcinomas but not in tumor cells. Only a few stromal cells were labeled in the normal colon. Immunohistochemically, tetranectin was found in a fibrillar-like pattern in the extracellular matrix around the tumor islands and was not detectable in the normal colon stromal tissue. Plasminogen exhibited a similar immunohistochemical staining pattern as tetranectin. Human tetranectin cDNA comprises 874 base pairs including a 606-base pair open reading frame encoding 202 amino acids including a classical signal peptide. This protein is produced locally by cells of the stromal compartment of tumors and is deposited into the extracellular matrix. Since tetranectin binds to plasminogen we hypothesize that it could function as an anchor and/or reservoir for plasminogen and similar substances that regulate tumor invasion and metastasis as well as tumor angiogenesis.

In addition to its activity in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) synthesis, the nuclear nicotinamide mononucleotide adenyltransferase NMNAT1 acts as a chaperone that protects against neuronal activity-induced degeneration. Here we report that compound heterozygous and homozygous NMNAT1 mutations cause severe neonatal neurodegeneration of the central retina and early-onset optic atrophy in 22 unrelated individuals. Their clinical presentation is consistent with Leber congenital amaurosis and suggests that the mutations affect neuroprotection of photoreceptor cells. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D013485
16213696	20051011	A family based study of the genetic association between the PLA2G4D gene and schizophrenia.	The present study detected two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the PLA2G4D locus, rs2459692 and rs4924618, to investigate a genetic association between the PLA2G4D gene and schizophrenia. A total of 236 Chinese parent-offspring trios of Han descent were recruited for the genetic analysis. The transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) did not show allelic association either for rs2459692 (chi(2) = 0.217, P = 0.641) or for rs4924618 (chi(2) = 0.663, P = 0.416). To see the combined effect of the PLA2G4D locus with the other three PLA2G4 genes, we applied the above two SNPs as a conditional marker to test the pair-wise combination for a disease association. The conditioning on allele (COA) test revealed a weak association for the rs2459692-PLA2G4A combination (chi(2) = 6.03, df = 2, P = 0.049), the rs2459692-PLA2G4B combination (chi(2) = 7.16, df = 3, P = 0.028) and the rs4924618-PLA2G4C combination (chi(2) = 7.01, df = 2, P = 0.03), whereas the conditioning on genotype (COG) test showed a weak association only for the rs4924618-PLA2G4C combination (chi(2) = 8.52, df = 3, P = 0.036). Because we performed a multi-locus analysis in this study, the weak association shown by the conditional tests could make little biological sense. In conclusion, the PLA2G4D gene may not be involved in a susceptibility to schizophrenia. 	Prostaglandins_Leukot._Essent._Fatty_Acids	D016428 D013485
9618173	19980609	A mutation in human keratin K6b produces a phenocopy of the K17 disorder pachyonychia congenita type 2.	Type I and type II keratins form the heteropolymeric intermediate filament cytoskeleton, which is the main stress-bearing structure within epithelial cells. Pachyonychia congenita (PC) is a group of autosomal dominant disorders whose most prominent phenotype is hypertrophic nail dystrophy accompanied by other features of ectodermal dysplasia. It has been shown previously that mutations in either K16 or K6a, which form a keratin expression pair, produce the PC-1 variant (MIM 184510). Mutations in K17 alone, an unpaired accessory keratin, result in the PC-2 phenotype (MIM 184500). Here, we describe a family with PC-2 in which the K17 locus on 17q was excluded and linkage to the type II keratin locus on 12q was obtained (Z max 3.31 at straight theta = 0). Mutation analysis of candidate keratins revealed the first reported missense mutation in K6b, implying that this keratin is the previously unknown expression partner of K17, analogous to the K6a/K16 pair. Co-expression of these genes was confirmed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining. These results reveal the hitherto unknown role of the K6b isoform in epithelial biology, as well as genetic heterogeneity in PC-2. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D013485 D013487
10439444	19990810	A presenilin-1 Thr116Asn substitution in a family with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.	Mutation in the presenilin-1 (PS-1) gene at chromosome 14q24.3 is the most common cause of autosomal dominant early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Here, we report a novel missense mutation in the presenilin-1 gene found in a three-generation Danish family with autopsy-verified early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Two affected first-degree relatives in two generations were found to be heterozygous for a cytosine to adenine transversion at the second position of codon 116, which changes the amino acid at that position from threonine to asparagine. This conservative amino acid substitution occurs in an evolutionary highly conserved region of the PS-1 protein and is associated with onset of the disease between age 35 and 41 years and 4-8 years' duration of the disease. Analysis of amyloid beta-protein (A beta) deposition in brain specimens from one affected family member showed predominance of A beta 42(43). Onset and progression of the disease were very similar in two sibs homozygous for the epsilon 3 allele and the epsilon 4 allele, respectively, of the polymorphic apolipoprotein E locus. The lack of effect of the high risk epsilon 4/epsilon 4 genotype on the disease in this family corroborates and extends previous observations that the presence of one copy of the epsilon 4 allele does not modulate PS-1 associated Alzheimer's disease.

11161801	20010213	Structure of the human zinc finger protein HIVEP3: molecular cloning, expression, exon-intron structure, and comparison with paralogous genes HIVEP1 and HIVEP2.	Here we report the cloning and characterization of HIVEP3, the newest member in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer-binding protein family that encodes large zinc finger proteins and regulates transcription via the kappaB enhancer motif. The largest open reading frame of HIVEP3 contains 2406 aa. and is approximately 80% identical to the mouse counterpart. The HIVEP3 gene is located in the chromosomal region 1p34 and is at least 300 kb with 10 exons. RNA studies show that multiple HIVEP3 transcripts are differentially expressed and regulated. Additionally, transcription termination occurs in the ultimate exon, exon 10, or in exon 6. Therefore, HIVEP3 may produce protein isoforms that contain or exclude the carboxyl DNA binding domain and the leucine zipper by alternative RNA splicing and differential polyadenylation. Sequence homologous to HIVEP3 exon 6 is not found in mouse nor are the paralogous genes HIVEP1 and HIVEP2. Zoo-blot analysis suggests that sequences homologous to the human exon 6 are present only in primates and cow. Therefore, a foreign DNA harboring a termination exon likely was inserted into the HIVEP3 locus relatively recently in evolution, resulting in the acquisition of novel gene regulatory mechanisms as well as the generation of structural and functional diversity.

17653047	20070727	High prevalence of mutations in peripherin/RDS in autosomal dominant macular dystrophies in a Spanish population.	Mutations in the peripherin/retinal degeneration slow (RDS) gene are a known cause of various types of central retinal dystrophies. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of mutations in the peripherin/RDS gene in Spanish patients with different types of autosomal dominant macular dystrophy. Ophthalmic and electrophysiological examination was performed in patients from 61 unrelated autosomal dominant macular dystrophy (adMD) Spanish families. Screening for mutations in the peripherin/RDS gene by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and direct genomic sequencing was performed in index patients and extended to the family when positive. We report four novel mutations in peripherin/RDS and a relatively high frequency (23%) of mutations in this gene in families with adMD. Thirteen different mutations were found in fifteen adMD families. Three novel missense, four nonsense and a cis-acting splicing mutation IVS2+2T&gt;C, were found in a Spanish population while five more missense mutations were also reported in other populations. The Arg142Trp and Arg172Trp mutations, present in several populations, were both detected in two independent Spanish families. All the missense mutations produce an amino acid substitution in the second intradiscal loop of the peripherin, while the nonsense mutations presumably generate a truncated protein. A high frequency (23%) of mutations in the peripherin/RDS gene was found in a cohort of 61 unrelated patients with various types of autosomal dominant central retinal dystrophies as compared with a low prevalence (1.3%) of mutations in this gene causing retinitis pigmentosa in a Spanish population. Different macular dystrophy phenotypes according to the mutations in peripherin/RDS are shown. However, a limited phenotype variation was observed for these mutations within the family. 	Mol._Vis.

19416251	20090507	Novel mutation p.Gly59Arg in GJB6 encoding connexin 30 underlies palmoplantar keratoderma with pseudoainhum, knuckle pads and hearing loss.	Connexins, components of the gap junction, are expressed in several organs including the skin and the cochlea. Mutations in connexin genes including GJB2 (Cx26), GJB3 (Cx31), GJB4 (Cx30.3), GJB6 (Cx30) and GJA1 (Cx43) are responsible for various dermatological syndromes and/or inherited hearing loss, frequently showing overlapping phenotypes. To clarify the spectrum of clinical phenotypes caused by connexin mutations. We report a 32-year-old Japanese woman with mild palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK) with severe sensorineural hearing loss, knuckle pads and pseudoainhum of her toes. Direct sequencing revealed no mutation in GJB2, but a novel heterozygous missense mutation p.Gly59Arg in GJB6. Electron microscopy revealed no apparent morphological abnormality of gap junctions in the patient's lesional epidermis. The patient harboured the novel GJB6 missense mutation p.Gly59Arg in the first extracellular loop of Cx30. Mutations in glycine 59 of Cx26 are associated with PPK-deafness syndrome, and the similar phenotype here supports the observed heteromeric channel formation; the dominant nature of the mutation suggests an effect on gap junctions similar to that of the comparable mutation in Cx26.

18362163	20080326	Hice1, a novel microtubule-associated protein required for maintenance of spindle integrity and chromosomal stability in human cells.	Spindle integrity is critical for efficient mitotic progression and accurate chromosome segregation. Deregulation of spindles often leads to structural and functional aberrations, ultimately promoting segregation errors and aneuploidy, a hallmark of most human cancers. Here we report the characterization of a previously identified human sarcoma antigen (gene located at 19p13.11), Hice1, an evolutionarily nonconserved 46-kDa coiled-coil protein. Hice1 shows distinct cytoplasmic localization and associates with interphase centrosomes and mitotic spindles, preferentially at the spindle pole vicinity. Depletion of Hice1 by RNA interference resulted in abnormal and unstable spindle configurations, mitotic delay at prometaphase and metaphase, and elevated aneuploidy. Conversely, loss of Hice1 had minimal effects on interphase centrosome duplication. We also found that both full-length Hice1 and Hice1-N1, which is composed of 149 amino acids of the N-terminal region, but not the mutant lacking the N-terminal region, exhibited activities of microtubule bundling and stabilization at a near-physiological concentration. Consistently, overexpression of Hice1 rendered microtubule bundles in cells resistant to nocodazole- or cold-treatment-induced depolymerization. These results demonstrate that Hice1 is a novel microtubule-associated protein important for maintaining spindle integrity and chromosomal stability, in part by virtue of its ability to bind, bundle, and stabilize microtubules.

16513212	20060304	Molecular dissection of venom from Chinese scorpion Mesobuthus martensii: identification and characterization of four novel disulfide-bridged venom peptides.	Scorpion venom is composed of a large repertoire of biologically active polypeptides. However, most of these peptides remain to be identified and characterized. In this paper, we report the identification and characterization of four novel disulfide-bridged venom peptides (named BmKBTx, BmKITx, BmKKx1 and BmKKx2, respectively) from the Chinese scorpion, Mesobuthus martensii (also named Buthus martensii Karsch). BmKBTx is composed of 58 amino acid residues and cross-linked by three disulfide bridges. The sequence of BmKBTx shows some similarities to that of the toxin, birtoxin, and its analogs. It is likely that BmKBTx is a beta-toxin active on Na+ channels, which is toxic to either insects or mammals. BmKITx is composed of 71 amino acid residues with four disulfide bridges. It is the longest venom peptide identified from M. martensii so far. BmKITx shows little sequence identity with scorpion alpha-toxins toxic to insects. It is likely that BmKITx is a new type of Na+ -channel specific toxin active on both insects and mammals. BmKKx1 contains 38 amino acid residues cross-linked by three disulfide bridges and shows 84% sequence identity with BmTx3, an inhibitor of A-type K+ channel and HERG currents. BmKKx1 has been classified as alpha-KTx-15.8. BmKKx2 is composed of 36 residues and stabilized by three disulfide bridges. BmKKx2 is a new member of the gamma-K+ -channel toxin subfamily (classified as gamma-KTx 2.2). The venoms of scorpions thus continue to provide novel toxins with potential novel actions on targets.

11350955	20010515	Cloning and characterization of MDDX28, a putative dead-box helicase with mitochondrial and nuclear localization.	A cDNA encoding a novel member of the helicase family, MDDX28, has been cloned from a human testis library. This apparently intronless gene was transcribed in all tissues studied. MDDX28 encodes a protein of 540 amino acids, with approximately 30% homology to other helicases over the core region, containing all the conserved DEAD-box helicase motifs. No homologue is known. MDDX28 has RNA and Mg(2+)-dependent ATPase activity. Subcellular localization studies of MDDX28 using oligoclonal antibodies raised against the protein as well as its enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) demonstrated that the protein is localized in the mitochondria and the nucleus. To our knowledge, MDDX28 is the first member of the RNA helicase described with this dual location. The nuclear localization of MDDX28 depended on active RNA polymerase II transcription, suggesting that the protein could be transported to and from the nucleus. This was confirmed further in an interspecies heterokaryon assay, in which MDDX28 was seen to translocate to the nucleus and mitochondria. The mitochondrial uptake of the MDDX28-EGFP-N1 fusion protein was inhibited by carbonyl cyanide p-(trichloromethoxy)phenylhydrazone. Our results indicate that MDDX28 can be transported between the mitochondria and the nucleus. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
10409699	19990720	Identification, expression, and characterization of a cDNA encoding human endoplasmic reticulum mannosidase I, the enzyme that catalyzes the first mannose trimming step in mammalian Asn-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis.	We have isolated a full-length cDNA clone encoding a human alpha1, 2-mannosidase that catalyzes the first mannose trimming step in the processing of mammalian Asn-linked oligosaccharides. This enzyme has been proposed to regulate the timing of quality control glycoprotein degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells. Human expressed sequence tag clones were identified by sequence similarity to mammalian and yeast oligosaccharide-processing mannosidases, and the full-length coding region of the putative mannosidase homolog was isolated by a combination of 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and direct polymerase chain reaction from human placental cDNA. The open reading frame predicted a 663-amino acid type II transmembrane polypeptide with a short cytoplasmic tail (47 amino acids), a single transmembrane domain (22 amino acids), and a large COOH-terminal catalytic domain (594 amino acids). Northern blots detected a transcript of approximately 2.8 kilobase pairs that was ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. Expression of an epitope-tagged full-length form of the human mannosidase homolog in normal rat kidney cells resulted in an ER pattern of localization. When a recombinant protein, consisting of protein A fused to the COOH-terminal luminal domain of the human mannosidase homolog, was expressed in COS cells, the fusion protein was found to cleave only a single alpha1,2-mannose residue from Man(9)GlcNAc(2) to produce a unique Man(8)GlcNAc(2) isomer (Man8B). The mannose cleavage reaction required divalent cations as indicated by inhibition with EDTA or EGTA and reversal of the inhibition by the addition of Ca(2+). The enzyme was also sensitive to inhibition by deoxymannojirimycin and kifunensine, but not swainsonine. The results on the localization, substrate specificity, and inhibitor profiles indicate that the cDNA reported here encodes an enzyme previously designated ER mannosidase I. Enzyme reactions using a combination of human ER mannosidase I and recombinant Golgi mannosidase IA indicated that that these two enzymes are complementary in their cleavage of Man(9)GlcNAc(2) oligosaccharides to Man(5)GlcNAc(2).

1569206	19920511	Marfan phenotype variability in a family segregating a missense mutation in the epidermal growth factor-like motif of the fibrillin gene.	To examine the associations among fibrillin gene mutations, protein function, and Marfan syndrome phenotype, we screened for alterations in the fibrillin coding sequence in patients with a range of manifestations and clinical severity. A cysteine to serine substitution at codon 1409 (C1409S) was identified in an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like motif from one fibrillin allele which segregates with the disease phenotype through three generations of a family affected with the Marfan syndrome. This alteration was not observed in 60 probands from other families or in 88 unrelated normal individuals. The altered cysteine is completely conserved in all EGF-like motifs identified in fibrillin, and in all proteins that contain this motif. These observations strongly indicate that C1409S is the disease-producing mutation in this family. The phenotype of individuals carrying C1409S varied widely with respect to onset of disease, organ-system involvement, and clinical severity; certain affected adults were unaware of their status before being diagnosed through this investigation. We conclude that fibrillin gene defects cause familial Marfan syndrome, that mutations in the EGF-like motif of the fibrillin gene are not uniformly associated with severe disease, and that fibrillin genotype is not the sole determinant of Marfan phenotype.

16710414	20060520	The DNA sequence and biological annotation of human chromosome 1.	The reference sequence for each human chromosome provides the framework for understanding genome function, variation and evolution. Here we report the finished sequence and biological annotation of human chromosome 1. Chromosome 1 is gene-dense, with 3,141 genes and 991 pseudogenes, and many coding sequences overlap. Rearrangements and mutations of chromosome 1 are prevalent in cancer and many other diseases. Patterns of sequence variation reveal signals of recent selection in specific genes that may contribute to human fitness, and also in regions where no function is evident. Fine-scale recombination occurs in hotspots of varying intensity along the sequence, and is enriched near genes. These and other studies of human biology and disease encoded within chromosome 1 are made possible with the highly accurate annotated sequence, as part of the completed set of chromosome sequences that comprise the reference human genome.

3021337	19861024	Alternative splicing of RNAs transcribed from the human abl gene and from the bcr-abl fused gene.	The primary structure of normal abl protein was determined by sequencing the coding region of its cDNA. abl contains two alternative 5' exons spliced to a common set of 3' exons to yield the two major abl RNA transcripts. These transcripts initiate in different promoter regions and give rise to proteins that vary in their N-termini. In the human cell line K562, abl is translocated from chromosome 9 to within the bcr gene on chromosome 22. Within the fused bcr-abl gene, abl exon II alternatively splices to two adjacent bcr exons. This phenomenon is seen in many patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. 	Cell	D016428 D013485 D013487
9087614	19970301	Properties of three COOH-terminal splice variants of a human cardiac L-type Ca2+-channel alpha1-subunit.	There is growing evidence for diversity of cardiac-type (class C) voltage-dependent calcium-channel alpha1-subunits arising from the alternative splicing of a primary transcript. In this study, we show the existence of carboxy-terminal variability in the human cardiac alpha1-gene by genomic cloning. We found that the genomic DNA segment encoding the COOH-terminal tail of the protein is composed of nine invariable and two alternative exons. The alternative utilization of these latter two exons gives rise to the formation of three message variants for this region. Reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction and radioanalytic quantitation of the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products showed significant variations in the distribution of these isoforms (hHt alpha1, rHt alpha1, fHt alpha1) in distinct parts of the heart, the aorta, and fibroblasts. Expression of the three alpha1-isoforms in Xenopus oocytes or in HEK-293 cells and analysis of the kinetics and voltage dependence of the induced calcium-channel currents revealed only insignificant differences in the behavior of these isoforms. When the alpha1-isoforms were coexpressed with a human beta-subunit, no alpha1-specific divergences were observed, but the effects of beta-subunit coexpression on alpha1-isoform biophysical properties were confirmed. The differential abundance of the three isoforms and the influence of an accessory subunit are of potential physiological significance. 	Am._J._Physiol.	D016428 D013485 D013487
10819331	20000520	Prediction of the coding sequences of unidentified human genes. XVII. The complete sequences of 100 new cDNA clones from brain which code for large proteins in vitro.	To provide information regarding the coding sequences of unidentified human genes, we have conducted a sequencing project of human cDNAs which encode large proteins. We herein present the entire sequences of 100 cDNA clones of unknown human genes, named KIAA1444 to KIAA1543, from two sets of size-fractionated human adult and fetal brain cDNA libraries. The average sizes of the inserts and corresponding open reading frames of cDNA clones analyzed here were 4.4 kb and 2.6 kb (856 amino acid residues), respectively. Database searches of the predicted amino acid sequences classified 53 predicted gene products into the following five functional categories: cell signaling/communication, nucleic acid management, cell structure/motility, protein management and metabolism. It was also revealed that homologues for 32 KIAA gene products were detected in the databases, which were similar in sequence through almost their entire regions. Additionally, the chromosomal loci of the genes were determined by using human-rodent hybrid panels unless their chromosomal loci were already assigned in the public databases. The expression levels of the genes were monitored in spinal cord, fetal brain and fetal liver, as well as in 10 human tissues and 8 brain regions, by reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction, products of which were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

9829911	19981126	Improved detection of germline mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau disease tumor suppressor gene.	von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is an inherited neoplastic disorder characterized by the development of tumors in the eyes, brain, spinal cord, inner ear, adrenal gland, pancreas, kidney, and epididymis. The VHL tumor suppressor gene was identified in 1993. Initial studies reported the detection of germline mutations in the VHL gene in 39-75% of VHL families. We used tests that detect different types of mutations to improve the frequency of detection of germline mutations in VHL families. The methods included quantitative Southern blotting to detect deletions of the entire VHL gene, Southern blotting to detect gene rearrangements, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to confirm deletions, and complete sequencing of the gene. Here we report that we have detected germline mutations in the VHL gene in 100% (93/93) of VHL families tested. In addition, we describe 13 novel intragenic VHL germline mutations. With the methodology described in this article, it is now possible to identify germline mutations in virtually all families with VHL. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428
7691719	19930801	Fibrillin binds calcium and is coded by cDNAs that reveal a multidomain structure and alternatively spliced exons at the 5' end.	Fibrillin is an important structural protein of the extracellular matrix. It is a large cysteine-rich glycoprotein with extensive intrachain disulfide bonds, likely contributed by multiple EGF-like repeats. We have previously published 6.9 kb of FBN1 cDNA sequence. FBN1 cDNA clones that extend the sequence 3089 bp in the 5' direction are described in this report. The deduced primary structure suggests that fibrillin is composed of multiple domains. The most predominant feature is the presence of 43 calcium binding EGF-like repeats. We demonstrate here that fibrillin molecules bind calcium. In addition, three alternatively spliced exons at the 5' end are described. Analysis of 5.8 kb of surrounding genomic sequence revealed a 1.8-kb CpG island spanning the alternatively spliced exons and the next downstream exon. Since FBN1 is the gene responsible for Marfan syndrome, the information presented here will be useful in identifying new mutations and in understanding the function of fibrillin in the pathogenesis of the disease.

11085516	20001121	Effects of estrogen on global gene expression: identification of novel targets of estrogen action.	The important role played by the sex hormone estrogen in disease and physiological processes has been well documented. However, the mechanisms by which this hormone elicits many of its normal as well as pathological effects are unclear. To identify both known and unknown genes that are regulated by or associated with estrogen action, we performed serial analysis of gene expression on estrogen-responsive breast cancer cells after exposure to this hormone. We examined approximately 190,000 mRNA transcripts and monitored the expression behavior of 12,550 genes. Expression levels for the vast majority of those transcripts were observed to remain constant upon 17beta estradiol (E2) treatment. Only approximately 0.4% of the genes showed an increase in expression of &gt; or =3-fold by 3 h post-E2 treatment. We cloned five novel genes (E2IG1-5), which were observed up-regulated by the hormonal treatment. Of these the most highly induced transcript, E2IG1, appears to be a novel member of the family of small heat shock proteins. The E2IG4 gene is a new member of the large family of leucine-rich repeat-containing proteins. On the basis of architectural and domain homology, this gene appears to be a good candidate for secretion in the extracellular environment and, therefore, may play a role in breast tissue remodeling and/or epithelium-stroma interactions. Several interesting genes with a potential role in the regulation of cell cycle progression were also identified to increase in expression, including Pescadillo and chaperonin CCT2. Two putative paracrine/autocrine factors of potential importance in the regulation of the growth of breast cancer cells were identified to be highly up-regulated by E2: stanniocalcin 2, a calcium/phosphate homeostatic hormone; and inhibin-beta B, a TGF-beta-like factor. Interestingly, we also determined that E2IG1 and stanniocalcin 2 were exclusively overexpressed in estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer lines, and thus they have the potential to serve as breast cancer biomarkers. This data provides a comprehensive view of the changes induced by E2 on the transcriptional program of human E2-responsive cells, and it also identifies novel and previously unsuspected gene targets whose expression is affected by this hormone.

11389678	20010608	Characterization of matrix metalloproteinase-26, a novel metalloproteinase widely expressed in cancer cells of epithelial origin.	Identification of expanding roles for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in complex regulatory processes of tissue remodelling has stimulated the search for genes encoding proteinases with unique functions, regulation and expression patterns. By using a novel cloning strategy, we identified three previously unknown human MMPs, i.e. MMP-21, MMP-26 and MMP-28, in comprehensive gene libraries. The present study is focused on the gene and the protein of a novel MMP, MMP-26. Our findings show that MMP-26 is specifically expressed in cancer cells of epithelial origin, including carcinomas of lung, prostate and breast. Several unique structural and regulatory features, including an unusual 'cysteine-switch' motif, discriminate broad-spectrum MMP-26 from most other MMPs. MMP-26 efficiently cleaves fibrinogen and extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin, vitronectin and denatured collagen. Protein sequence, minimal modular domain structure, exon-intron mapping and computer modelling demonstrate similarity between MMP-26 and MMP-7 (matrilysin). However, substrate specificity and transcriptional regulation, as well as the functional role of MMP-26 and MMP-7 in cancer, are likely to be distinct. Despite these differences, matrilysin-2 may be a suitable trivial name for MMP-26. Our observations suggest an important specific function for MMP-26 in tumour progression and angiogenesis, and confirm and extend the recent findings of other authors [Park, Ni, Gerkema, Liu, Belozerov and Sang (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 20540--20544; Uría and López-Otín (2000) Cancer Res. 60, 4745--4751; de Coignac, Elson, Delneste, Magistrelli, Jeannin, Aubry, Berthier, Schmitt, Bonnefoy and Gauchat (2000) Eur. J.

10611283	19991228	Identification of a cytochrome b-type NAD(P)H oxidoreductase ubiquitously expressed in human cells.	Cytochrome b-type NAD(P)H oxidoreductases are involved in many physiological processes, including iron uptake in yeast, the respiratory burst, and perhaps oxygen sensing in mammals. We have identified a cytosolic cytochrome b-type NAD(P)H oxidoreductase in mammals, a flavohemoprotein (b5+b5R) containing cytochrome b5 (b5) and b5 reductase (b5R) domains. A genetic approach, using BLAST searches against DBEST for FAD-, NAD(P)H-binding sequences followed by reverse transcription-PCR, was used to clone the complete cDNA sequence of human b5+b5R from the hepatoma cell line Hep 3B. Compared with the classical single-domain b5 and b5R proteins localized on endoplasmic reticulum membrane, b5+b5R also has binding motifs for heme, FAD, and NAD(P)H prosthetic groups but no membrane anchor. The human b5+b5R transcript was expressed at similar levels in all tissues and cell lines that were tested. The two functional domains b5* and b5R* are linked by an approximately 100-aa-long hinge bearing no sequence homology to any known proteins. When human b5+b5R was expressed as c-myc adduct in COS-7 cells, confocal microscopy revealed a cytosolic localization at the perinuclear space. The recombinant b5+b5R protein can be reduced by NAD(P)H, generating spectrum typical of reduced cytochrome b with alpha, beta, and Soret peaks at 557, 527, and 425 nm, respectively. Human b5+b5R flavohemoprotein is a NAD(P)H oxidoreductase, demonstrated by superoxide production in the presence of air and excess NAD(P)H and by cytochrome c reduction in vitro. The properties of this protein make it a plausible candidate oxygen sensor. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D003160 D016428 D013487
12358675	20021003	SCN5A is expressed in human jejunal circular smooth muscle cells.	Tetrodotoxin-resistant Na+currents are expressed in a variety of muscle cells including human jejunal circular smooth muscle (HJCSM) cells. The aim of this study was to determine the molecular identity of the pore-forming alpha-subunit of the HJCSM Na+ channel. Degenerate primers identified a cDNA fragment of 1.5 kb with 99% nucleotide homology with human cardiac SCN5A. The identified clone was also amplified from single smooth muscle cells by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Northern blot analysis showed expression of full-length SCN5A. Laser capture microdissection was used to obtain highly purified populations of HJCSM cells. RT-PCR on the harvested cells showed that SCN5A was present in circular but not in longitudinal muscle. A similar result was obtained using a pan-Na+ channel antibody. The full-length sequence for SCN5A was obtained by combining standard polymerase chain reaction with 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA end techniques. The intestinal SCN5A was nearly identical to the cardiac SCN5A. The data indicate that SCN5A is more widely distributed than previously thought and encodes the pore-forming alpha-subunit of the tetrodotoxin-resistant Na+ current in HJCSM cells.

15731336	20050226	Evolutionarily conserved human targets of adenosine to inosine RNA editing.	A-to-I RNA editing by ADARs is a post-transcriptional mechanism for expanding the proteomic repertoire. Genetic recoding by editing was so far observed for only a few mammalian RNAs that are predominantly expressed in nervous tissues. However, as these editing targets fail to explain the broad and severe phenotypes of ADAR1 knockout mice, additional targets for editing by ADARs were always expected. Using comparative genomics and expressed sequence analysis, we identified and experimentally verified four additional candidate human substrates for ADAR-mediated editing: FLNA, BLCAP, CYFIP2 and IGFBP7. Additionally, editing of three of these substrates was verified in the mouse while two of them were validated in chicken. Interestingly, none of these substrates encodes a receptor protein but two of them are strongly expressed in the CNS and seem important for proper nervous system function. The editing pattern observed suggests that some of the affected proteins might have altered physiological properties leaving the possibility that they can be related to the phenotypes of ADAR1 knockout mice.

11353392	20010516	Mutations in the agouti (ASIP), the extension (MC1R), and the brown (TYRP1) loci and their association to coat color phenotypes in horses (Equus caballus).	Coat color genetics, when successfully adapted and applied to different mammalian species, provides a good demonstration of the powerful concept of comparative genetics. Using cross-species techniques, we have cloned, sequenced, and characterized equine melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R) and agouti-signaling-protein (ASIP), and completed a partial sequence of tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1). The coding sequences and parts of the flanking regions of those genes were systematically analyzed in 40 horses and mutations typed in a total of 120 horses. Our panel represented 22 different horse breeds, including 11 different coat colors of Equus caballus. The comparison of a 1721-bp genomic fragment of MC1R among the 11 coat color phenotypes revealed no sequence difference apart from the known chestnut allele (C901T). In particular, no dominant black (ED) mutation was found. In a 4994-bp genomic fragment covering the three putative exons, two introns and parts of the 5'- and 3'-UTRs of ASIP, two intronic base substitutions (SNP-A845G and C2374A), a point mutation in the 3'-UTRs (A4734G), and an 11-bp deletion in exon 2 (ADEx2) were detected. The deletion was found to be homozygous and completely associated with horse recessive black coat color (Aa/Aa) in 24 black horses out of 9 different breeds from our panel. The frameshift initiated by ADEx2 is believed to alter the regular coding sequence, acting as a loss-of-function ASIP mutation. In TYRP1 a base substitution was detected in exon 2 (C189T), causing a threonine to methionine change of yet unknown function, and an SNP (A1188G) was found in intron 2.

15328326	20040826	Distinct clinical features of paraganglioma syndromes associated with SDHB and SDHD gene mutations.	Germline mutations of the genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase subunits B (SDHB) and D (SDHD) predispose to paraganglioma syndromes type 4 (PGL-4) and type 1 (PGL-1), respectively. In both syndromes, pheochromocytomas as well as head and neck paragangliomas occur; however, details for individual risks and other clinical characteristics are unknown. To determine the differences in clinical features in carriers of SDHB mutations and SDHD mutations. Population-based genetic screening for SDHB and SDHD germline mutations in 417 unrelated patients with adrenal or extra-adrenal abdominal or thoracic pheochromocytomas (n = 334) or head and neck paragangliomas (n = 83), but without syndromic features, from 2 registries based in Germany and central Poland, conducted from April 1, 2000, until May 15, 2004. Demographic and clinical findings with respect to gene mutation in SDHB vs SDHD compared with nonmutation carriers. A total of 49 (12%) of 417 registrants carried SDHB or SDHD mutations. In addition, 28 SDHB and 23 SDHD mutation carriers were newly detected among relatives of these carriers. Comparison of 53 SDHB and 47 SDHD total mutation carriers showed similar ages at diagnosis but differences in penetrance and of tumor manifestations. Head and neck paragangliomas (10/32 vs 27/34, respectively, P&lt;.001) and multifocal (9/32 vs 25/34, respectively, P&lt;.001) tumors were more frequent in carriers of SDHD mutations. In contrast, SDHB mutation carriers have an increased frequency of malignant disease (11/32 vs 0/34, P&lt;.001). Renal cell cancer was observed in 2 SDHB mutation carriers and papillary thyroid cancer in 1 SDHB mutation carrier and 1 SDHD mutation carrier. In contrast with SDHD mutation carriers (PGL-1) who have more frequent multifocal paragangliomas, SDHB mutation carriers (PGL-4) are more likely to develop malignant disease and possibly extraparaganglial neoplasias, including renal cell and thyroid carcinomas. Appropriate and timely clinical screening is recommended in all patients with PGL-1 and PGL-4. 	JAMA	D016428 D013485 D013487

25666439	20150211	Mutations in the intellectual disability gene KDM5C reduce protein stability and demethylase activity.	Mutations in KDM5C are an important cause of X-linked intellectual disability in males. KDM5C encodes a histone demethylase, suggesting that alterations in chromatin landscape may contribute to disease. We used primary patient cells and biochemical approaches to investigate the effects of patient mutations on KDM5C expression, stability and catalytic activity. We report and characterize a novel nonsense mutation, c.3223delG (p.V1075Yfs*2), which leads to loss of KDM5C protein. We also characterize two KDM5C missense mutations, c.1439C&gt;T (p.P480L) and c.1204G&gt;T (p.D402Y) that are compatible with protein production, but compromise stability and enzymatic activity. Finally, we demonstrate that a c.2T&gt;C mutation in the translation initiation codon of KDM5C results in translation re-start and production of a N-terminally truncated protein (p.M1_E165del) that is unstable and lacks detectable demethylase activity. Patient fibroblasts do not show global changes in histone methylation but we identify several up-regulated genes, suggesting local changes in chromatin conformation and gene expression. This thorough examination of KDM5C patient mutations demonstrates the utility of examining the molecular consequences of patient mutations on several levels, ranging from enzyme production to catalytic activity, when assessing the functional outcomes of intellectual disability mutations.

SnoN2 is missing a 138 nt coding segment present in mouse SnoN and human SNON . We have cloned and sequenced the human ortholog of mouse SnoN2 , the existence of which was predicted from conservation of the alternative splice donor site that produces the SnoN2 isoform. Mouse SnoN2 and SnoN are expressed throughout embryonic development, in neonatal muscle and in many adult tissues. SnoN2 is the major species in most tissues, but SnoN and SnoN2 are expressed at approximately equal levels in brain. In human tissues, SNON2 is the less abundantly expressed isoform. Expression of mouse SnoN and SnoN2 mRNAs is induced with immediate early kinetics upon serum stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts, even in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, while Ski is not. Interestingly, although both isoforms of Sno are induced, SnoN2 induction is much higher than SnoN . These data are consistent with a role for Sno in the response to proliferation stimuli.

26522270	20151103	NAA10 mutation causing a novel intellectual disability syndrome with Long QT due to N-terminal acetyltransferase impairment.	We report two brothers from a non-consanguineous Irish family presenting with a novel syndrome characterised by intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, scoliosis and long QT. Their mother has a milder phenotype including long QT. X-linked inheritance was suspected. Whole exome sequencing identified a novel missense variant (c.128?A?&gt;?C; p.Tyr43Ser) in NAA10 (X chromosome) as the cause of the family's disorder. Sanger sequencing confirmed that the mutation arose de novo in the carrier mother. NAA10 encodes the catalytic subunit of the major human N-terminal acetylation complex NatA. In vitro assays for the p.Tyr43Ser mutant enzyme showed a significant decrease in catalytic activity and reduced stability compared to wild-type Naa10 protein. NAA10 has previously been associated with Ogden syndrome, Lenz microphthalmia syndrome and non-syndromic developmental delay. Our findings expand the clinical spectrum of NAA10 and suggest that the proposed correlation between mutant Naa10 enzyme activity and phenotype severity is more complex than anticipated; the p.Tyr43Ser mutant enzyme has less catalytic activity than the p.Ser37Pro mutant associated with lethal Ogden syndrome but results in a milder phenotype. Importantly, we highlight the need for cardiac assessment in males and females with NAA10 variants as both patients and carriers can have long QT. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D013485
14610673	20031112	Tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome with a novel mutation in the TNFRSF1A gene in a Japanese family.	Tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) is a dominantly inherited disorder characterised by recurrent episodes of sustained fever. Here we report a case of TRAPS with a novel TNFRSF1A mutation, C70S, in a Japanese family. The mutation disrupts one of the three disulphide bonds in cysteine-rich domain 2 of TNF receptor 1, similar to the reported mutations of the same cysteine residue (C70R, C70Y). This is the first confirmed case of TRAPS in an eastern Asian population. The patient's asymptomatic sister as well as their mother with mild symptoms had the same mutation. Although tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome has been reported mainly in families of northern European ancestry, our case suggests the need to include it in the differential diagnosis of patients with recurrent fever even in ethnic groups in which no case has been documented.

17033959	20061013	Molecular population genetics of the gene encoding the human fertilization protein zonadhesin reveals rapid adaptive evolution.	A hallmark of positive selection (adaptive evolution) in protein-coding regions is a d(N)/d(S) ratio &gt;1, where d(N) is the number of nonsynonymous substitutions/nonsynonymous sites and d(S) is the number of synonymous substitutions/synonymous sites. Zonadhesin is a male reproductive protein localized on the sperm head, comprising many domains known to be involved in cell-cell interaction or cell adhesion. Previous studies have shown that VWD domains (homologous to the D domains of the von Willebrand factor) are involved directly in binding to the female zona pellucida (ZP) in a species-specific manner. In this study, we sequenced 47 coding exons in 12 primate species and, by using maximum-likelihood methods to determine sites under positive selection, we show that VWD2, membrane/A5 antigen mu receptor, and mucin-like domains in zonadhesin are rapidly evolving and, thus, may be involved in binding to the ZP in a species-specific manner in primates. In addition, polymorphism data from 48 human individuals revealed significant polymorphism-to-divergence heterogeneity and a significant departure from equilibrium-neutral expectations in the frequency spectrum, suggesting balancing selection and positive selection occurring in zonadhesin (ZAN) within human populations. Finally, we observe adaptive evolution in haplotypes segregating for a frameshift mutation that was previously thought to indicate that ZAN was a potential pseudogene. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.

8365477	19930830	Complete amino acid sequence of puroindoline, a new basic and cystine-rich protein with a unique tryptophan-rich domain, isolated from wheat endosperm by Triton X-114 phase partitioning.	A new basic protein has been isolated from wheat endosperm by Triton X-114 phase partitioning. It contains five disulfide bridges and is composed of equal amounts of a polypeptide chain of 115 amino acid residues and of the same chain with a C-terminus dipeptide extension. The most striking sequence feature is the presence of a unique tryptophan-rich domain so that this protein isolated from wheat seeds has been named puroindoline. The similar phase partitioning behavior in Triton X-114 of this basic cystine-rich protein and of purothionins suggests that puroindoline may also be a membranotoxin that might play a role in the defense mechanism of plants against microbial pathogens.

11284034	20010403	Refinement within single yeast artificial chromosome clones of a minimal region commonly deleted on the short arm of chromosome 7 in Wilms tumours.	Cytogenetic and molecular data indicate an involvement of genes mapped to the proximal portion of the short arm of chromosome 7 (7p) in Wilms tumours (WTs). We have analysed 38 WTs using a panel of eight microsatellite markers mapped to proximal 7p. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumour, compared with matched constitutional DNA, was identified in eight cases. To define better the minimal region commonly deleted in these tumours, they were analysed with nine additional markers, mapped within the region of interest. One tumour (case 30) showed LOH for only one marker (D7S510), while maintaining heterozygosity for the two immediately flanking loci (D7S555 and D7S668). This result was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation analysis, which showed that in the majority (65%) of nuclei from tumour 30 hybridising with a bacterial artificial chromosome clone containing the D7S510 locus, only one signal was visible. Noticeably, both markers defining the limits of the observed deleted region are simultaneously present within two distinct overlapping yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones mapped to chromosome bands 7p13-p14. This suggests that the maximum length of the missing DNA fragment was approximately 1.3 Mb, corresponding to the length of the smaller of the two YAC clones. In all other cases that showed LOH, the deletion encompassed the 7p13-p14 region. For this reason, we speculate that the identified interval contains a gene whose inactivation is important for the development of at least a fraction of WTs.

10873569	20000630	Characterization of five novel human genes in the 11q13-q22 region.	The redundancy of sequences in dbEST has approached a level where contiguous cDNA sequences of genes can be assembled, without the need to physically handle the clones from which the ESTs are derived. This is termed EST based in silico gene cloning. With the availability of sequence chromatogram files for a subset of ESTs, the quality of EST sequences can be ascertained accurately and used in contig assembly. In this report, we performed a study using this approach and isolated five novel human genes, C11orf1-C11orf5, in the 11q13-q22 region. The full open reading frames of these genes were determined by comparison with their orthologs, of which four mouse orthologs were isolated (c11orf1, c11orf2, c11orf3 and c11orf5). These genes were then analyzed using several proteomics tools. Both C11orf1 and C11orf2 are nuclear proteins with no other distinguishing features. C11orf3 is a cytoplasmic protein containing an ATP/GTP binding site, a signal peptide located in the N-terminus and a similarity to the C. elegans protein &quot;Probable ARP 2/3 complex 20kD subunit.&quot; C11orf4 is a peptide which displays four putative transmembrane domains and is predicted to have a cytoplasmic localization. It contains signal peptides at the N- and C-termini. C11orf5 is a putative nuclear protein displaying a central coiled coil domain. Here, we propose that this purely EST-based cloning approach can be used by modestly sized laboratories to rapidly and accurately characterize and map a significant number of human genes without the need of further sequencing.

9535864	19980516	Involvement of flap endonuclease 1 in base excision DNA repair.	Base excision repair can proceed in either one of two alternative pathways: a DNA polymerase beta-dependent pathway and a proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-dependent pathway. Excision of an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site by cutting the phosphate backbone on its 3' side following incision at its 5' side by AP endonuclease is a prerequisite to completion of these repair pathways. Using a reconstituted system with the proteins derived from Xenopus laevis, we found that flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) was a factor responsible for the excision of a 5'-incised AP site in the PCNA-dependent pathway. In this pathway, DNA synthesis was not required for the action of FEN1 in the presence of PCNA and a replication factor C-containing fraction. The polymerase beta-dependent pathway could also use FEN1 for excision of the synthetic AP sites, which were not susceptible to beta-elimination. In this pathway, FEN1 was functional without PCNA and replication factor C but required the DNA synthesis, which led to a flap structure formation. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D003160 D016428 D013485 D013487
7507150	19940101	Prenatal diagnosis of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis by direct gene sequencing.	Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma) is an autosomal dominant skin disorder caused by defects in the suprabasal keratins. Recently, mutations in the keratins 1 and 10 have been identified in patients with this disease. In this study, direct gene sequencing was used to establish the prenatal diagnosis in 15-week gestation twins at risk for epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. Direct sequence analysis of genomic DNA from the affected father and from both chorionic villus samples revealed a tyrosine to asparagine mutation at position 14 within the highly conserved 1A alpha-helical segment of keratin 10. None of the unaffected family members that were analyzed exhibit this mutation nor have polymorphic variations been observed in the normal population at this position. This residue is invariant in all type I keratins sequenced to date and is also conserved in related intermediate filament proteins such as vimentin and lamin. Given this high degree of conservation it is probable that any mutation at this position is deleterious and will result in disease. 	J._Invest._Dermatol.	D016428 D013487
3608978	19870501	The primary structure of human secretogranin I (chromogranin B): comparison with chromogranin A reveals homologous terminal domains and a large intervening variable region.	We have determined and analyzed the primary structure of human secretogranin I (chromogranin B), a tyrosine-sulfated secretory protein found in a wide variety of peptidergic endocrine cells. A 2.5-kb cDNA clone, hybridizing to an mRNA of similar length, was isolated from a cDNA library of human pheochromocytoma. The identity of the clone was established by comparison of its deduced amino acid sequence with N-terminal and several internal secretogranin I sequences as well as by immunoprecipitation of the protein produced by in vitro transcription-translation of the cloned cDNA. Secretogranin I is a 657 amino acid long polypeptide of 76 kd and is preceded by a cleaved N-terminal signal peptide of 20 residues. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of human secretogranin I with that of bovine chromogranin A reveals significant homologies near the N termini and at the C termini. The N-terminal homologous domains contain the only two cysteine residues of both proteins and form disulfide-stabilized loop structures. The sequences between the homologous terminal domains in both proteins differ but are characterized by a remarkable hydrophilicity, an abundance of acidic amino acids and potential dibasic cleavage sites for the generation of smaller, perhaps hormone-like, peptides.

10482958	19990914	Mutation analysis of the RPGR gene reveals novel mutations in south European patients with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa.	The RPGR (retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator) gene has been shown to be mutated in 10-20% of patients with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP), a severe form of inherited progressive retinal degeneration. A total of 29 different RPGR mutations have been identified in northern European and United States patients. We have performed mutation analysis of the RPGR gene in a cohort of 49 southern European males affected with XLRP. By multiplex SSCA and automatic direct sequencing of all 19 RPGR exons, seven different and novel mutations were identified in eight of the 49 families; these include three splice site mutations, two microdeletions, and two missense mutations. RNA analysis showed that the three splice site defects resulted in the generation of aberrant RPGR transcripts. Six of these mutations were detected in the conserved amino-terminal region of RPGR protein, containing tandem repeats homologous to the RCC1 protein, a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor for Ran-GTPase. Several exonic and intronic sequence variations were also detected. None of the RPGR mutations reported in other populations were identified in our series. Our results are consistent with the notions of heterogeneity and minority causation of XLRP by mutations in RPGR in Caucasian populations. 	Eur._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
1733971	19920205	Characterization of an abnormal fibrinogen Osaka V with the replacement of gamma-arginine 375 by glycine. The lack of high affinity calcium binding to D-domains and the lack of protective effect of calcium on fibrinolysis.	Prolonged thrombin time was completely corrected by the addition of millimolar concentrations of calcium in a new abnormal fibrinogen, Osaka V. Analysis of lysyl endopeptidase digests of A alpha-, B beta-, or gamma-chains by high performance liquid chromatography, and the following amino acid sequence analysis of relevant peptides revealed that about 50% of the gamma-chain has a replacement of gamma-arginine 375 by glycine. When fibrinogen was digested with plasmin in the presence of millimolar concentration of calcium, the amount of fragment D1 was about 50% of the normal control, and the rest was further cleaved to fragment D2, D3, or D62 with an apparent Mr of 62,000. Plasmic digestion of cross-linked fibrin in the presence of calcium resulted in the appearance of an abnormal fragment with an apparent Mr of 123,000 as well as fragments D2, D3, and D62, concomitant with the decrease of D dimer. The gamma-remnant of the abnormal fragment proved to be a cross-linked complex of the normal D1 gamma-remnant and residues 374-406/411 of the abnormal gamma-chain. The number of high affinity Ca(2+)-binding sites for the normal fibrinogen and fibrinogen Osaka V obtained by equilibrium dialysis was 2.88 (about 3) and 1.85, respectively, and that for the abnormal molecules was calculated as 0.9 (about 1) from their relative amounts in the samples, suggesting the lack of two Ca(2+)-binding sites in the D-domains. These data suggest that the normal structure of the COOH-terminal portion of the gamma-chain including residue 375 is required for the full expression of high affinity calcium binding to D-domains, the ability to be protected by calcium against plasmic digestion, and fibrin polymerization. During these studies, we found that the NH2-terminal amino acid of the gamma-remnant in fragments D or D dimer which were obtained after prolonged digestion with plasmin is gamma-Met89.

9497919	19980314	Human cysteine dioxygenase type I (CDO-I; EC 1.13.11.20): 5' flanking region and intron-exon structure of the gene.	The elucidation of the structure of the 5' flanking region and the exonic organisation of the human cysteine dioxygenase type I gene. Material for sequence studies was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods using human genomic DNA, a cosmid clone containing the entire gene, and a commercial gene walking kit. The gene was found to be--12 kb in length and made up of five exons (418, 78, 155, 170, and 731 base pairs, respectively). The immediate 5' flanking region did not contain the canonical TATAA box. One DNA source (Clontech promoter finder kit) contained a liver specific nuclear factor response element approximately 550 base pairs from the transcription start site, whereas a second source did not. This and other cis acting factors in the 5' flanking region were identified by computer analysis. The physiological significance of such elements requires detailed experimental evaluation.

23235333	20121214	Phenotypic variability of CLDN14 mutations causing DFNB29 hearing loss in the Pakistani population.	Human hereditary deafness at the DFNB29 locus on chromosome 21q22.1 is caused by recessive mutations of CLDN14, encoding claudin 14. This tight junction protein is tetramembrane spanning that localizes to the apical tight junctions of organ of Corti hair cells and in many other tissues. Typically, the DFNB29 phenotype is characterized by prelingual, bilateral, sensorineural hearing loss. The goal of this study was to define the identity and frequency of CLDN14 mutations and associated inner ear phenotypes in a cohort of 800 Pakistani families segregating deafness. Hearing loss in 15 multi-generational families was found to co-segregate with CLDN14-linked STR markers. The sequence of the six exons and regions flanking the introns of CLDN14 in these 15 families revealed five likely pathogenic alleles. Two are novel missense substitutions (p.Ser87Ile and p.Ala94Val), whereas p.Arg81His, p.Val85Asp and p.Met133ArgfsX23 have been reported previously. Haplotype analyses indicate that p.Val85Asp and p.Met133ArgfsX23 are founder mutations. The p.Val85Asp accounts for ~67% of the mutant alleles of CLDN14 in our cohort. Combined with the previously reported data, CLDN14 mutations were identified in 18 of 800 Pakistani families (2.25; 95% CI, 1.4-3.5). Hearing loss in the affected individuals homozygous for CLDN14 mutations varied from moderate to profound. This phenotypic variability may be due to environmental factors (for example drug and noise exposure) and/or genetic modifiers. 	J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013485
8033105	19940715	E-cadherin gene mutations provide clues to diffuse type gastric carcinomas.	The calcium-dependent homophilic cell adhesion molecule and candidate suppressor gene, E (epithelial)-cadherin, plays a major role in the organization and integrity of most epithelial tissues. Diffusely growing gastric carcinomas show markedly reduced homophilic cell-to-cell interactions. We speculated that mutations in the E-cadherin gene may be responsible for the scattered phenotype of this type of carcinoma. For that reason we have examined E-cadherin in 26 diffuse type, 20 intestinal type and 7 mixed gastric carcinomas (Laurén's classification) at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing of amplified E-cadherin complementary DNA fragments revealed inframe skipping of either exon 8 or exon 9 in 10 patients with diffuse tumors and an exon 9 deletion in one patient with a mixed carcinoma; both exons encode putative calcium binding domains. These alterations were not seen in nontumorous gastric tissues. Splice site mutations responsible for the exon deletions were identified in six of these patients, eliminating the possibility of alternative splicing mechanisms. Five of these splice site alterations were confirmed as somatic mutations. Non-splice site mutations were observed in three diffuse type tumors, namely a 69-base pair deletion of exon 10 and two point mutations, one of which destroys a putative calcium binding region. Immunohistochemical evaluation showed E-cadherin immunoreactivity in tumors and lymph node metastases of patients expressing abnormal mRNA. The allelic status of the E-cadherin gene was analyzed in one patient, revealing loss of heterozygosity with retention of a mutated E-cadherin allele. Overall, E-cadherin mutations were identified in 50% (13 of 26) of the diffuse type and in 14% (1 of 7) of the mixed carcinomas. In contrast, two silent E-cadherin mutations (not changing the amino acid sequence) were detected in two tumors of the intestinal type. Our study provides strong in vivo evidence that E-cadherin gene mutations may contribute to the development of diffusely growing gastric carcinomas and support a tumor/metastasis suppressor gene hypothesis.

15744053	20050304	Lineage-specific loss of function of bitter taste receptor genes in humans and nonhuman primates.	Since the process of becoming dead genes or pseudogenes (pseudogenization) is irreversible and can occur rather rapidly under certain environmental circumstances, it is one plausible determinant for characterizing species specificity. To test this evolutionary hypothesis, we analyzed the tempo and mode of duplication and pseudogenization of bitter taste receptor (T2R) genes in humans as well as in 12 nonhuman primates. The results show that primates have accumulated more pseudogenes than mice after their separation from the common ancestor and that lineage-specific pseudogenization becomes more conspicuous in humans than in nonhuman primates. Although positive selection has operated on some amino acids in extracellular domains, functional constraints against T2R genes are more relaxed in primates than in mice and this trend has culminated in the rapid deterioration of the bitter-tasting capability in humans. Since T2R molecules play an important role in avoiding generally bitter toxic and harmful substances, substantial modification of the T2R gene repertoire is likely to reflect different responses to changes in the environment and to result from species-specific food preference during primate evolution.

15339651	20040902	Or83b encodes a broadly expressed odorant receptor essential for Drosophila olfaction.	Fruit flies are attracted by a diversity of odors that signal the presence of food, potential mates, or attractive egg-laying sites. Most Drosophila olfactory neurons express two types of odorant receptor genes: Or83b, a broadly expressed receptor of unknown function, and one or more members of a family of 61 selectively expressed receptors. While the conventional odorant receptors are highly divergent, Or83b is remarkably conserved between insect species. Two models could account for Or83b function: it could interact with specific odor stimuli independent of conventional odorant receptors, or it could act in concert with these receptors to mediate responses to all odors. Our results support the second model. Dendritic localization of conventional odorant receptors is abolished in Or83b mutants. Consistent with this cellular defect, the Or83b mutation disrupts behavioral and electrophysiological responses to many odorants. Or83b therefore encodes an atypical odorant receptor that plays an essential general role in olfaction. 	Neuron	D016428 D013485 D013486 D013487
22415356	20120315	De novo MGC4607 gene heterozygous missense variants in a child with multiple cerebral cavernous malformations.	Cavernous malformations are angiographically occult, low-pressure neurovascular lesions with distinct imaging and clinical characteristics; main clinical manifestations are seizure, focal neurological deficits and epileptic attacks. Here we describe the molecular characterization of an Italian child, a symptomatic patient, affected by multiple cerebral cavernous malformations, without a family history of the disease and harbouring a new MGC4607 gene mutation. We identified two de novo missense variants in exon 6 of the gene both present on the same allele (cis configuration). DNA analysis for KRIT1, and PDCD10 gene variation through direct sequencing and MLPA analysis excluded further mutations. STR multiplex assay, allele-specific analysis and DHPLC analysis were performed for a better genetic characterization. Our findings emphasize the importance of the genetic test in subjects presenting multiple cerebral cavernomas for an adequate counselling, as well as for disease management since early identification of genetic abnormalities enable patients to have their lesions removed before they haemorrhage and cause deficit and/or epilepsy.

2556453	19891201	A missense mutation in the neutrophil cytochrome b heavy chain in cytochrome-positive X-linked chronic granulomatous disease.	A membrane-bound cytochrome b, a heterodimer formed by a 91-kD glycoprotein and a 22-kD polypeptide, is a critical component of the phagocyte NADPH-oxidase responsible for the generation of superoxide anion. Mutations in the gene for the 91-kD chain of this cytochrome result in the X-linked form of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), in which phagocytes are unable to produce superoxide. Typically, there is a marked deficiency of the 91-kD subunit and the cytochrome spectrum is absent (X- CGD). In a variant form of CGD with X-linked inheritance, affected males have a normal visible absorbance spectrum of cytochrome b, yet fail to generate superoxide (X+ CGD). The size and abundance of the mRNA for the 91-kD subunit and its encoded protein were examined and appeared normal. To search for a putative mutation in the coding sequence of the 91-kD subunit gene, the corresponding RNA from an affected X+ male was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. A single nucleotide change, a C----A transversion, was identified that predicts a nonconservative Pro----His substitution at residue 415 of the encoded protein. Hybridization of amplified genomic DNA with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes demonstrated the mutation to be specific to affected X+ males and the carrier state. These results strengthen the concept that all X-linked CGD relates to mutations affecting the expression or structure of the 91-kD cytochrome b subunit. The mechanism by which the Pro 415----His mutation renders the oxidase nonfunctional is unknown, but may involve an impaired interaction with other components of the oxidase. 	J._Clin._Invest.

20309401	20100324	Novel USH2A compound heterozygous mutations cause RP/USH2 in a Chinese family.	To identify the disease-causing gene in a four-generation Chinese family affected with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Linkage analysis was performed with a panel of microsatellite markers flanking the candidate genetic loci of RP. These loci included 38 known RP genes. The complete coding region and exon-intron boundaries of Usher syndrome 2A (USH2A) were sequenced with the proband DNA to screen the disease-causing gene mutation. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and direct DNA sequence analysis were done to demonstrate co-segregation of the USH2A mutations with the family disease. One hundred normal controls were used without the mutations. The disease-causing gene in this Chinese family was linked to the USH2A locus on chromosome 1q41. Direct DNA sequence analysis of USH2A identified two novel mutations in the patients: one missense mutation p.G1734R in exon 26 and a splice site mutation, IVS32+1G&gt;A, which was found in the donor site of intron 32 of USH2A. Neither the p.G1734R nor the IVS32+1G&gt;A mutation was found in the unaffected family members or the 100 normal controls. One patient with a homozygous mutation displayed only RP symptoms until now, while three patients with compound heterozygous mutations in the family of study showed both RP and hearing impairment. This study identified two novel mutations: p.G1734R and IVS32+1G&gt;A of USH2A in a four-generation Chinese RP family. In this study, the heterozygous mutation and the homozygous mutation in USH2A may cause Usher syndrome Type II or RP, respectively. These two mutations expand the mutant spectrum of USH2A. 	Mol._Vis.

24498484	20140206	Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia due to 17-alpha-hydoxylase/17,20-lyase Deficiency Presenting with Hypertension and Pseudohermaphroditism: First Case Report from Oman.	This is the first report of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to combined 17?-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase deficiency in an Omani patient who was initially treated for many years as a case of hypertension. CAH is an uncommon disorder that results from a defect in steroid hormones biosynthesis in the adrenal cortex. The clinical presentation depends on the site of enzymatic mutations and the types of accumulated steroid precursors. A 22-year-old woman who was diagnosed to have hypertension since the age of 10 years who was treated with anti-hypertensive therapy was referred to the National Diabetes and Endocrine Centre, Royal Hospital, Oman. The patient also had primary amenorrhea and features of sexual infantilism. Full laboratory and radio-imaging investigations were done. Adrenal steroids, pituitary function and karyotyping study were performed and the diagnosis was confirmed by molecular mutation study. Laboratory investigations revealed adrenal steroids and pituitary hormones profile in addition to 46XY karyotype that are consistent with the diagnosis of CAH due to 17?-hydroxylase deficiency. Extensive laboratory workup revealed low levels of serum cortisol (and its precursors 17?-hydroxyprogesterone and 11-deoxycortisol), adrenal androgens (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and androstenedione), and estrogen (estradiol); and high levels of mineralocorticoids precursors (11-deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone) with high levels of ACTH, FSH and LH. Mutation analysis revealed CYP17A1-homozygous mutation (c.287G&gt;A p.Arg96Gln) resulting in the complete absence of 17?-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase activity. The patient was treated with dexamethasone and ethinyl estradiol with cessation of anti-hypertensive therapy. A review of the literature was conducted to identify previous studies related to this subtype of CAH.

We have characterized the cellular proteins which are rapidly phosphorylated by interleukin 2 (IL 2) in a human IL 2 dependent cell line. When treated with IL 2, the phosphorylation of five proteins, 65, 50, 37, 24, and 21 kDa, was found in IL 2 dependent cell lines by two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis. After cell conversion from an IL 2 dependent state to an IL 2 independent state, one of the five phosphoproteins, the 65-kDa protein, became constitutively phosphorylated even without addition of IL 2. Also, in other IL 2 independent cell lines, such as KUT-2 and HUT-102, constitutive phosphorylation of the 65-kDa protein occurred without IL 2-stimulation. So our researchers were focused on biochemical characterization of the 65-kDa protein. It was found that the 65-kDa protein was one of the major cellular proteins by comparing the results of two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis of [32P]Pi-labeled and [3H]leucine-labeled cellular proteins and peptide mapping analysis. Subcellular fractionation studies indicated that the 65-kDa protein is a cytosol protein. The 65-kDa protein was purified from cytosol of a human T cell line, and its amino acid composition and amino acid sequences of its three oligopeptides were determined. It was found that the 65-kDa protein is identical with 1-plastin. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485
9152628	19970201	Detection of growth hormone gene defects by dideoxy fingerprinting (ddF).	We carried out screening for mutations in the GH-1 gene in 29 sporadic Japanese subjects with severe Isolated Growth Hormone Deficiency (IGHD) by dideoxy fingerprinting (ddF). Three of 29 (approximately 10%) were heterozygous for each of the following GH-1 gene mutations including: 1) an G--&gt;A transition in the third codon of the GH-1 signal peptide of exon 1 resulting in a Threonine to Alanine substitution, 2) a G--&gt;A transition in the first base of the donor splice site of IVS 3 (+1G--&gt;A) and 3) a G--&gt;A transition in the 183rd codon of the GH-1 mature peptide of exon 5 resulting in an Arginine to Histidine substitution. One of three was heterozygous for both mutations of 1) and 2). The IVS 3 (+1G--&gt;A) mutation has been previously reported in affected individuals from three unrelated families with IGHD type II (autosomal dominant form). This mutation destroys the GH IVS 3 donor splice site, causing skipping of exon 3 and loss of the codons for amino acids 32-71 of the mature GH peptide. Our findings indicate that 1) ddF screening of genomic DNAs provides a practical tool to detect GH gene mutations and 2) some sporadic cases of IGHD may be caused by GH gene alternations. 	Endocr._J.

9837962	19981205	Identification of the cis-acting endoplasmic reticulum stress response element responsible for transcriptional induction of mammalian glucose-regulated proteins. Involvement of basic leucine zipper transcription factors.	When unfolded proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), transcription of glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs) representing ER-resident molecular chaperones is markedly induced via the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. In contrast to recent progress in the analysis of yeast UPR, both cis-acting elements and transactivators responsible for mammalian UPR have remained obscure. Here, we analyzed the promoter regions of human GRP78, GRP94, and calreticulin genes and identified a novel element designated the ER stress response element (ERSE). ERSE, with a consensus of CCAATN9CCACG, was shown to be necessary and sufficient for induction of these GRPs. Using yeast one-hybrid screening, we isolated a human cDNA encoding a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein, ATF6, as a putative ERSE-binding protein. When overexpressed in HeLa cells, ATF6 enhanced transcription of GRP genes in an ERSE-dependent manner, whereas CREB-RP, another bZIP protein closely related to ATF6, specifically inhibited GRP induction. Endogenous ATF6 constitutively expressed as a 90-kDa protein was converted to a 50-kDa protein in ER-stressed cells, which appeared to be important for the cellular response to ER stress. These results suggest that, as in yeast, bZIP proteins are involved in mammalian UPR, acting through newly defined ERSE. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428
11672541	20011024	Interferon-alpha-induced endogenous superantigen. a model linking environment and autoimmunity.	We earlier proposed that a human endogenous retroviral (HERV) superantigen (SAg) IDDMK(1,2)22 may cause type I diabetes by activating autoreactive T cells. Viral infections and induction of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) are tightly associated with the onset of autoimmunity. Here we establish a link between viral infections and IFN-alpha-regulated SAg expression of the polymorphic and defective HERV-K18 provirus. HERV-K18 has three alleles, IDDMK(1,2)22 and two full-length envelope genes, that all encode SAgs. Expression of HERV-K18 SAgs is inducible by IFN-alpha and this is sufficient to stimulate V beta 7 T cells to levels comparable to transfectants constitutively expressing HERV-K18 SAgs. Endogenous SAgs induced via IFN-alpha by viral infections is a novel mechanism through which environmental factors may cause disease in genetically susceptible individuals. 	Immunity	D016428 D013485
8706697	19960701	Cloning and sequencing of human gp330, a Ca(2+)-binding receptor with potential intracellular signaling properties.	We present here the complete primary structure of human gp330, the human variant of the principal kidney autoantigen causing Heymann membranous glomerulonephritis in rats. The deduced 4655 amino acid residues give a calculated molecular mass of 519636 Da for the mature protein and consists of a probable 25-amino-acid N-terminal signal peptide sequence, an extracellular region of 4398 amino acids, a single transmembrane-spanning domain of 23 amino acids, and an intracellular C-terminal region of 209 amino acid residues. Three types of cysteine-rich repeats characteristic of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) superfamily are present in human gp330. In the extracellular region, there are a total of 36 LDLR ligand-binding repeats, comprising four distinct domains, 16 growth factor repeats separated by eight YWTD spacer regions, and one epidermal growth factor-like repeat. No consensus cleavage sequence for the processing endoprotease furin is detected in human gp330. The intracellular tail contains not only two copies of the F(X)NPXY coated-pit mediated internalization signal characteristic of LDLR superfamily members, but also intriguing and potentially functional motifs including several Src-homology 3 recognition motifs, one Src-homology 2 recognition motif for the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and additional sites for protein kinase C, casein kinase II and cAMP-/cGMP-dependent protein kinase. There is approximately 77% amino acid identity between human and rat gp330 with minor differences between the extracellular and intracellular regions. Recently gp330 has been implicated in Ca2+ regulation in the parathyroid, the placenta, and the renal tubule, but its overall physiological and pathological role still remains uncertain.

11897817	20020319	Prevalence of SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD germline mutations in clinic patients with head and neck paragangliomas.	Paragangliomas are rare and highly heritable tumours of neuroectodermal origin that often develop in the head and neck region. Germline mutations in the mitochondrial complex II genes, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD, cause hereditary paraganglioma (PGL). We assessed the frequency of SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD gene mutations by PCR amplification and sequencing in a set of head and neck paraganglioma patients who were previously managed in two otolaryngology clinics in the USA. Fifty-five subjects were grouped into 10 families and 37 non-familial cases. Five of the non-familial cases had multiple tumours. Germline SDHD mutations were identified in five of 10 (50%) familial and two of 37 ( approximately 5%) non-familial cases. R38X, P81L, H102L, Q109X, and L128fsX134 mutations were identified in the familial cases and P81L was identified in the non-familial cases. Both non-familial cases had multiple tumours. P81L and R38X mutations have previously been reported in other PGL families and P81L was suggested as a founder mutation. Allelic analyses of different chromosomes carrying these mutations did not show common disease haplotypes, strongly suggesting that R38X and P81L are potentially recurrent mutations. Germline SDHB mutations were identified in two of 10 (20%) familial and one of 33 ( approximately 3%) non-familial cases. P131R and M71fsX80 were identified in the familial cases and Q59X was identified in the one non-familial case. The non-familial case had a solitary tumour. No mutations could be identified in the SDHC gene in the remaining four families and 20 sporadic cases. Mutations in SDHD are the leading cause of head and neck paragangliomas in this clinic patient series. SDHD and SDHB mutations account for 70% of familial cases and approximately 8% of non-familial cases. These results also suggest that the commonness of the SDHD P81L mutation in North America is the result of both a founder effect and recurrent mutations. 	J._Med._Genet.	D016428 D013487
10494093	19990924	Identification and characterization of hydroxymethylbilane synthase mutations causing acute intermittent porphyria: evidence for an ancestral founder of the common G111R mutation.	Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), the most common hepatic porphyria, results from the half-normal activity of hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMB-synthase; EC 4.3.1.8), the third enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Because life-threatening acute neurologic attacks of this autosomal dominant disease are triggered by various ecogenic factors (e.g., certain drugs, hormones, alcohol, and starvation), efforts have been directed to identify and counsel presymptomatic heterozygotes in affected families to avoid the precipitating factors. Thus, to determine the nature of the mutations causing AIP in 26 unrelated enzyme-confirmed patients from Argentina, a long-range polymerase chain reaction method was developed to amplify the entire 10-kb gene in two fragments for efficient cycle sequencing and mutation detection. Eight new mutations were identified including two missense mutations (Q34P and G335S), four small deletions (728delCT, 815delAGGA, 948delA, and 985del12), a single base insertion (666insA), and a splice site mutation (IVS12(+1)). In addition, five previously reported mutations (G111R, R173W, Q204X, R201W, and 913insC) were detected. Notably, G111R was identified in 12 of the 26 (46%) presumably unrelated propositi; however, haplotype analysis with intragenic and flanking markers indicated an ancestral founder. Expression of the two new missense mutations (Q34P and G335S) in f1 E. coli resulted in 2.5% or less of the normal expressed enzyme, confirming their defective function. Thus, eight new and five previously reported HMB-synthase mutations, including a common lesion, were detected, permitting accurate identification and counseling of presymptomatic carriers in these 26 unrelated Argentinean AIP families with this dominant porphyria.

1944558	19911031	Early-onset Alzheimer's disease caused by mutations at codon 717 of the beta-amyloid precursor protein gene.	A mutation at codon 717 of the beta-amyloid precursor protein gene has been found to cosegregate with familial Alzheimer's disease in a single family. This mutation has been reported in a further five out of approximately 100 families multiply affected by Alzheimer's disease. We have identified another family, F19, in which we have detected linkage between the beta-amyloid precursor protein gene and Alzheimer's disease. Direct sequencing of exon 17 in affected individuals from this family has revealed a base change producing a Val----Gly substitution, also at codon 717. The occurrence of a second allelic variant at codon 717 linked to the Alzheimer's phenotype supports the hypothesis that they are pathogenic mutations. 	Nature	D002363 D016428 D013485

14506289	20030925	Evolutionary dynamics of an Arabidopsis insect resistance quantitative trait locus.	Glucosinolate profiles differ among Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes, caused by the composition of alleles at several glucosinolate biosynthetic loci. One of these, GS-Elong, harbors a family of methylthioalkylmalate synthase (MAM) genes that determine the side chain length of aliphatic glucosinolate structures. Fine mapping reveals that GS-Elong constitutes an insect resistance quantitative trait locus, caused by variation in glucosinolate profiles conferred by polymorphism of MAM alleles in this region. A sequence survey of randomly chosen ecotypes indicates that GS-Elong is highly variable among A. thaliana ecotypes: indel polymorphisms are frequent, as well as gene conversion events between gene copies arranged in tandem. Furthermore, statistical methods of molecular population genetics suggest that one of the genes, MAM2, is subject to balancing selection. This may be caused by ecological tradeoffs, i.e., by contrasting physiological effects of glucosinolates on generalist vs. specialist insects. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 D013485 D013486
23297359	20130109	Cathepsin F mutations cause Type B Kufs disease, an adult-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.	Kufs disease, an adult-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, is challenging to diagnose and genetically heterogeneous. Mutations in CLN6 were recently identified in recessive Kufs disease presenting as progressive myoclonus epilepsy (Type A), whereas the molecular basis of cases presenting with dementia and motor features (Type B) is unknown. We performed genome-wide linkage mapping of two families with recessive Type B Kufs disease and identified a single region on chromosome 11 to which both families showed linkage. Exome sequencing of five samples from the two families identified homozygous and compound heterozygous missense mutations in CTSF within this linkage region. We subsequently sequenced CTSF in 22 unrelated individuals with suspected recessive Kufs disease, and identified an additional patient with compound heterozygous mutations. CTSF encodes cathepsin F, a lysosomal cysteine protease, dysfunction of which is a highly plausible candidate mechanism for a storage disorder like ceroid lipofuscinosis. In silico modeling suggested the missense mutations would alter protein structure and function. Moreover, re-examination of a previously published mouse knockout of Ctsf shows that it recapitulates the light and electron-microscopic pathological features of Kufs disease. Although CTSF mutations account for a minority of cases of type B Kufs, CTSF screening should be considered in cases with early-onset dementia and may avoid the need for invasive biopsies.

22605915	20120519	A new mutation in the RP1L1 gene in a patient with occult macular dystrophy associated with a depolarizing pattern of focal macular electroretinograms.	To determine whether a mutation in the RP1-like protein 1 (RP1L1) gene is present in a Japanese patient with sporadic occult macular dystrophy (OMD) and to examine the characteristics of focal macular electroretinograms (ERGs) of the patient with genetically identified OMD. An individual with OMD underwent detailed ophthalmic clinical evaluations including focal macular ERGs. Mutation screening of all coding regions and flanking intron sequences of the RP1L1 gene were performed with DNA sequencing analysis in this case with OMD. A new RP1L1 mutation (c.3596 C&gt;G in exon 4) was identified. The variant c.3596 C&gt;G in exon 4 resulted in the substitution of cysteine for serine at amino acid position 1199. The serine at position 1199 is well conserved among the RP1L1 family in other species. Four out of five computational assessment tools predicted that this mutation is damaging to the protein function. This mutation was not present in 294 control alleles. The waveform of focal macular ERGs recorded from the patient with OMD had a depolarizing pattern, simulating the ERG waveforms observed after the hyperpolarizing bipolar cell activity is blocked. We have demonstrated in a Japanese patient the possibility that sporadic OMD may also be caused by an RP1L1 mutation. The waveform of focal macular ERGs elicited from the OMD patient with the RP1L1 mutation showed a depolarizing pattern. This characteristic is the same as reported for the focal macular ERGs of OMD.

23434763	20130226	Mutations in WNT1 are a cause of osteogenesis imperfecta.	Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heritable bone fragility disorder that is usually due to dominant mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2. Rare recessive forms of OI, caused by mutations in genes involved in various aspects of bone formation, have been described as well. To identify the cause of OI in eight children with severe bone fragility and a clinical diagnosis of OI type IV who had had negative results on COL1A1/COL1A2 Sanger sequencing. Whole exome sequencing was performed in genomic DNA samples from all eight individuals. WNT1 mutations were found in four children from three families. WNT1 was the only gene where mutations were found in all of these four patients. Two siblings from a consanguineous family had a homozygous missense mutation affecting a highly conserved cysteine residue in WNT1 (c.428G&gt;T (p.Cys143Phe)). One girl had a homozygous frameshift deletion (c.287_300del(p.Gln96Profs)). A girl from a third family was compound heterozygous for a frameshift insertion and a missense mutation affecting a conserved amino acid (c.946_949insAACA (p.Ser317Lysfs); c.1063G&gt;T (p.Val355Phe)). All of these children had short stature, low bone density, and severe vertebral compression fractures in addition to multiple long bone fractures in the first years of life. The Wnt signalling pathway is one of the key regulators of osteoblast activity. Recessive inactivating mutations in WNT1 are a new cause of OI type IV. 	J._Med._Genet.	D016428 D013485
11326277	20010428	Tas1r3, encoding a new candidate taste receptor, is allelic to the sweet responsiveness locus Sac.	The ability to taste the sweetness of carbohydrate-rich foodstuffs has a critical role in the nutritional status of humans. Although several components of bitter transduction pathways have been identified, the receptors and other sweet transduction elements remain unknown. The Sac locus in mouse, mapped to the distal end of chromosome 4 (refs. 7-9), is the major determinant of differences between sweet-sensitive and -insensitive strains of mice in their responsiveness to saccharin, sucrose and other sweeteners. To identify the human Sac locus, we searched for candidate genes within a region of approximately one million base pairs of the sequenced human genome syntenous to the region of Sac in mouse. From this search, we identified a likely candidate: T1R3, a previously unknown G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and the only GPCR in this region. Mouse Tas1r3 (encoding T1r3) maps to within 20,000 bp of the marker closest to Sac (ref. 9) and, like human TAS1R3, is expressed selectively in taste receptor cells. By comparing the sequence of Tas1r3 from several independently derived strains of mice, we identified a specific polymorphism that assorts between taster and non-taster strains. According to models of its structure, T1r3 from non-tasters is predicted to have an extra amino-terminal glycosylation site that, if used, would interfere with dimerization. 	Nat._Genet.

12951062	20030903	Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: two homozygous cases with &quot;typical&quot; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and three new mutations in cases with progression to dilated cardiomyopathy.	About 10% of cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) evolve into dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with unknown causes. We studied 11 unrelated patients (pts) with HCM who progressed to DCM (group A) and 11 who showed &quot;typical&quot; HCM (group B). Mutational analysis of the beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7), myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3), and cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) genes demonstrated eight mutations affecting MYH7 or MYBPC3 gene, five of which were new mutations. In group A-pts, the first new mutation occurred in the myosin head-rod junction and the second occurred in the light chain-binding site. The third new mutation leads to a MYBPC3 lacking titin and myosin binding sites. In group B, two pts with severe HCM carried two homozygous MYBPC3 mutations and one with moderate hypertrophy was a compound heterozygous for MYBPC3 gene. We identified five unreported mutations, potentially &quot;malignant&quot; defects as for the associated phenotypes, but no specific mutations of HCM/DCM. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.

10597320	19991222	Search for in vivo somatic mutations in the mitotic checkpoint gene, hMAD1, in human lung cancers.	We previously reported the presence of mitotic check-point impairment in about 40% of lung cancer cell lines. To gain an insight into the molecular basis of this impairment, we examined 49 lung cancer specimens for alterations in the hMAD1 mitotic checkpoint gene and identified a somatic, non-conservative missense mutation, which substitutes alanine (GCG) for threonine (ACG) at codon 299, together with a number of amino acid substituting, single nucleotide polymorphisms. This is the first demonstration of hMAD1 mutation in any type of human cancers. The present finding marks hMAD1 as a potential target, although with low frequency, for genetic alterations in lung cancer. Thus, further studies of hMAD1 dysfunction caused by other mechanisms appear to be warranted, as well as potential involvement of other components of the mitotic checkpoint.

16010683	20050713	3-Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency: mutation analysis in 28 probands, 9 symptomatic and 19 detected by newborn screening.	Isolated 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that appears to be the most frequent organic aciduria detected in tandem mass spectrometry (TMS)-based neonatal screening programs. The phenotype is variable, ranging from neonatal onset with severe neurological involvement to asymptomatic adults. MCC is a heteromeric mitochondrial enzyme composed of biotin containing alpha subunits and smaller beta subunits, encoded by MCCA and MCCB, respectively. We report mutation analysis in 28 MCC-deficient probands, 19 of whom were asymptomatic newborns detected by TMS newborn screening, and nine presented with clinical symptoms. Ten have mutations in MCCA, and 18 in MCCB. We identified 10 novel MCCA and 14 novel MCCB mutant alleles including missense, nonsense, frameshift and splice site mutations, and show that three of the missense mutations result in severely decreased MCC activity when expressed in MCC-deficient cell lines. Our data demonstrate no clear correlation between genotype and phenotype suggesting that factors other than the genotype at the MCC loci have a major influence on the phenotype of MCC deficiency.

9813230	19981114	IkappaB kinase-alpha and -beta genes are coexpressed in adult and embryonic tissues but localized to different human chromosomes.	Activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is regulated by phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of its inhibitory factor IkappaB. Very recently, two closely related serine/threonine kinases have been identified as IkappaB kinases which are essential for IkappaB phosphorylation and NF-kappaB activation. Here, we isolated the full-length human cDNA clones encoding these two IkappaB kinases, IKK-alpha and IKK-beta. Both polypeptides contain a conserved amino-terminal kinase domain, a leucine zipper motif and a helix-loop-helix domain at their carboxyl terminus. We showed that IKK-alpha and IKK-beta were coexpressed in most human adult tissues as well as in different developmental stages of mouse embryos, suggesting that they may cooperate in the cells. The IKK-alpha and IKK-beta genes are distinct but evolutionarily conserved. Moreover, the IKK-alpha gene locus was mapped to human chromosome 10q24, whereas the IKK-beta gene locus was localized to human chromosome 8p11.2. These results indicated that both genes are not clustered on the same chromosome; nevertheless, both genes may be still regulated similarly during development and in adult tissues.

10599696	19991222	New insight into the molecular basis of 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency: identification of eight mutations in the HSD3B2 gene eleven patients from seven new families and comparison of the functional properties of twenty-five mutant enzymes.	Classical 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta5-delta4 isomerase (3betaHSD) deficiency is a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia that impairs steroidogenesis in both the adrenals and gonads resulting from mutations in the HSD3B2 gene and causing various degrees of salt-wasting in both sexes and incomplete masculinization of the external genitalia in genetic males. To identify the molecular lesion(s) in the HSD3B2 gene in the 11 patients from the seven new families suffering from classical 3betaHSD deficiency, the complete nucleotide sequence of the whole coding region and exon-intron splicing boundaries of this gene was determined by direct sequencing. Five of these families were referred to Morel's molecular diagnostics laboratory in France, whereas the two other families were investigated by Peter's group in Germany. Functional characterization studies were performed by Simard's group in Canada. Following transient expression in 293 cells of each of the mutant recombinant proteins generated by site-directed mutagenesis, the effect of the 25 mutations on enzyme activity was assessed by incubating intact cells in culture with 10 nM [14C]-DHEA as substrate. The stability of the mutant proteins has been investigated using a combination of Northern and Western blot analyses, as well as an in vitro transcription/translation assay using rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The present report describes the identification of 8 mutations, in seven new families with individuals suffering from classical 3betaHSD deficiency, thus increasing the number of known HSD3B2 mutations involved in this autosomal recessive disorder to 31 (1 splicing, 1 in-frame deletion, 3 nonsense, 4 frameshift and 22 missense mutations). In addition to the mutations reported here in these new families, we have also investigated for the first time the functional significance of previously reported missense mutations and or sequence variants namely, A82T, A167V, L173R, L205P, S213G and K216E, P222H, T259M, and T259R, which have not previously been functionally characterized. Furthermore, their effects have been compared with those of the 10 previously reported mutant enzymes to provide a more consistent and comprehensive study. The present results are in accordance with the prediction that no functional 3betaHSD type 2 isoenzyme is expressed in the adrenals and gonads of the patients suffering from a severe salt-wasting form of CAH due to classical 3betaHSD deficiency. Whereas the nonsalt-losing form also results from missense mutation(s) in the HSD3B2 gene, which cause an incomplete loss in enzyme activity, thus leaving sufficient enzymatic activity to prevent salt wasting. The functional data described in the present study concerning the sequence variants A167V, S213G, K216E and L236S, which were detected with premature pubarche or hyperandrogenic adolescent girls suspected to be affected from nonclassical 3betaHSD deficiency, coupled with the previous studies reporting that no mutations were found in both HSD3B1 and/or HSD3B2 genes in such patients strongly support the conclusion that this disorder does not result from a mutant 3betaHSD isoenzyme. The present study provides biochemical evidence supporting the involvement of a new molecular mechanism in classical 3betaHSD deficiency involving protein instability and further illustrates the complexity of the genotype-phenotype relationships of this disease, in addition to providing further valuable information concerning the structure-function relationships of the 3betaHSD superfamily.

8018926	19940701	Identification of three novel spectrin alpha I/74 mutations in hereditary elliptocytosis: further support for a triple-stranded folding unit model of the spectrin heterodimer contact site.	Six individuals with hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) or hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP) from three unrelated families were evaluated. Defects in the ability of spectrin (Sp) to undergo self-association were present, and associated with increased recovery of the Sp alpha I 74-kD fragment after limited tryptic digestion (Sp alpha I/74 variant). Because mutations associated with the Sp alpha I/74 variant described to date have been localized to the 5' coding region of the alpha-Sp gene (exon 2) or at the 3' coding end of the beta-Sp gene (exon 30), the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method was used to detect mutations in these two regions. In one family with HE, an abnormal pattern of migration of PCR-amplified fragments containing exon 2 was observed, and led to the detection of a new mutation (Ile24Ser) in helix 3 of repeating segment alpha 1. In the two other families, an abnormal pattern of migration of PCR-amplified fragments containing exon 30 was observed in affected individuals, and sequencing led to the identification of two new mutations (Ala2023Val and Trp2024Arg) in helix 1 of repeating segment beta 17. The elliptogenic potential of these mutations emphasizes the importance of the conformational integrity of each of the three helices involved in the formation of the Sp heterodimer contact site, and will help identify critical amino acids involved in this interaction.

23596069	20130419	Targeted exome sequencing of suspected mitochondrial disorders.	To evaluate the utility of targeted exome sequencing for the molecular diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders, which exhibit marked phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. We considered a diverse set of 102 patients with suspected mitochondrial disorders based on clinical, biochemical, and/or molecular findings, and whose disease ranged from mild to severe, with varying age at onset. We sequenced the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) and the exons of 1,598 nuclear-encoded genes implicated in mitochondrial biology, mitochondrial disease, or monogenic disorders with phenotypic overlap. We prioritized variants likely to underlie disease and established molecular diagnoses in accordance with current clinical genetic guidelines. Targeted exome sequencing yielded molecular diagnoses in established disease loci in 22% of cases, including 17 of 18 (94%) with prior molecular diagnoses and 5 of 84 (6%) without. The 5 new diagnoses implicated 2 genes associated with canonical mitochondrial disorders (NDUFV1, POLG2), and 3 genes known to underlie other neurologic disorders (DPYD, KARS, WFS1), underscoring the phenotypic and biochemical overlap with other inborn errors. We prioritized variants in an additional 26 patients, including recessive, X-linked, and mtDNA variants that were enriched 2-fold over background and await further support of pathogenicity. In one case, we modeled patient mutations in yeast to provide evidence that recessive mutations in ATP5A1 can underlie combined respiratory chain deficiency. The results demonstrate that targeted exome sequencing is an effective alternative to the sequential testing of mtDNA and individual nuclear genes as part of the investigation of mitochondrial disease. Our study underscores the ongoing challenge of variant interpretation in the clinical setting. 	Neurology	D002363 D016428 D057666 D052061 D013486
2460758	19880801	Human macrophage-colony stimulating factor: alternative RNA and protein processing from a single gene.	Macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF, CSF-1) has been reported to be required for the proliferation and differentiation of macrophages from hematopoietic progenitor cells. Recently, two human M-CSF cDNA clones were isolated encoding proteins of 256 and 554 amino acids. We report here the isolation of a third M-CSF cDNA that encodes a protein of 438 amino acids. The coding regions for the three cDNA clones share a common amino-terminus of 149 amino acids and a common carboxyl-terminus of 75 amino acids including a membrane spanning region. In addition, we isolated a genomic clone of human M-CSF. When each of the cDNA clones or the genomic clone were transfected into COS-7 monkey kidney cells, biologically active M-CSF was expressed as judged by the ability of transfected cell supernatants to stimulate proliferation and colony formation of murine bone marrow cells, as well as formation of monocytic colonies from human bone marrow cells. Surprisingly, proliferation of human bone marrow cells was not induced by recombinant human M-CSF. Analysis of the M-CSF proteins released by COS-7 cells revealed that monomer subunit proteins of 44 or 28 kDa were produced. In addition, we found that the membrane spanning region, present in all three forms of M-CSF cDNA, was not required for the synthesis of a biologically active protein. However, when the membrane spanning region was present in the three M-CSF cDNAs, cell surface associated forms of M-CSF could be readily detected. 	Mol._Immunol.	D016428
15534471	20041110	Novel MYOC gene mutation, Phe369Leu, in Japanese patients with primary open-angle glaucoma detected by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.	To screen for mutations in the MYOC gene in Japanese patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). Blood samples were collected from 171 patients with POAG and 100 controls from seven institutions in Japan. For high-throughput analysis, seven exonic regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using DNA pooled from three patients; each DNA pool was then analyzed chromatographically. For analysis of a small number of samples, 7 exonic regions were amplified separately but simultaneously with annealing at 58 degrees C in each patient and then chromatographed, using 7 wells of the same 96-well plate per sample. When chromatographic patterns were abnormal by either method, the PCR products of the individual samples were sequenced. Four glaucoma-causing mutations were identified in five POAG patients (2.9%). One missense mutation, Phe369Leu, is new; and three others, Ile360Asn, Ala363Thr, and Thr448Pro, have been reported in Japanese patients. Phe369Leu was associated with adult onset POAG. Mutations in the MYOC gene were demonstrated chromatographically in 2.9% of our Japanese POAG patients. The use of pooled DNAs with DHPLC analysis is a time- and labor-saving technique. All mutations detected appear to be specific to Japanese patients. 	J._Glaucoma	D016428
1370859	19920130	Expression of members of the putative olfactory receptor gene family in mammalian germ cells.	A series of genomic and complementary DNA clones encoding new putative members of G protein-coupled receptors were isolated using homology cloning and low-stringency polymerase chain reaction. Among the unidentified receptors ('orphan receptors'), a human genomic clone (HGMP07) was characterized by the presence of its transcripts in the testis and by its belonging to a large subfamily of genes sharing extensive sequence similarities. Sequence comparison demonstrated that this gene subfamily is the human counterpart of the putative rat olfactory receptors cloned recently. Another 48 members of the family were cloned. Northern blotting further demonstrated the presence of olfactory receptor transcripts in germ cells. Our finding suggests that a common receptor gene family encodes olfactory receptors and sperm cell receptors that could be involved in chemotaxis during fertilization.

11231901	20010307	Axonemal dynein intermediate-chain gene (DNAI1) mutations result in situs inversus and primary ciliary dyskinesia (Kartagener syndrome).	Kartagener syndrome (KS) is a trilogy of symptoms (nasal polyps, bronchiectasis, and situs inversus totalis) that is associated with ultrastructural anomalies of cilia of epithelial cells covering the upper and lower respiratory tracts and spermatozoa flagellae. The axonemal dynein intermediate-chain gene 1 (DNAI1), which has been demonstrated to be responsible for a case of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) without situs inversus, was screened for mutation in a series of 34 patients with KS. We identified compound heterozygous DNAI1 gene defects in three independent patients and in two of their siblings who presented with PCD and situs solitus (i.e., normal position of inner organs). Strikingly, these five patients share one mutant allele (splice defect), which is identical to one of the mutant DNAI1 alleles found in the patient with PCD, reported elsewhere. Finally, this study demonstrates a link between ciliary function and situs determination, since compound mutation heterozygosity in DNAI1 results in PCD with situs solitus or situs inversus (KS).

23801938	20130627	Alagille Syndrome: A New Missense Mutation Detected by Whole-Exome Sequencing in a Case Previously Found to Be Negative by DHPLC and MLPA.	Alagille syndrome (ALGS, MIM 118450) is an autosomal dominant, multisystem disorder with high variability. Two genes have been described: JAG1 and NOTCH2. The population prevalence is 1:70,000 based on the presence of neonatal liver disease. The majority of cases (?97%) are caused by haploinsufficiency of the JAG1 gene on 20p11.2p12, either due to mutations or deletions at the locus. Less than 1% of cases are caused by mutations in NOTCH2. The most widely used methods for mutational screening include denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Very recently, whole-exome sequencing (WES) has become technically feasible due to the recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies, therefore offering new opportunities for mutations/genes identification. A proband and its family, negative for the presence of mutations in JAG1 and NOTCH2 genes by neither DHPLC nor MLPA, were analyzed by WES. A missense mutation, not previously described, in JAG1 gene was identified. This result shows an improvement in the mutation detection rate due to novel sequencing technology suggesting the strong need to reanalyze all negative cases. 	Mol_Syndromol	D016428
1339448	19920215	A novel complex locus UGT1 encodes human bilirubin, phenol, and other UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isozymes with identical carboxyl termini.	Two human liver UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (transferase) cDNAs, HUG-Br1 and HUG-Br2, were previously isolated (Ritter, J. K., Crawford, J. M., and Owens, I. S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 1043-1047), and each was shown to encode a bilirubin transferase isozyme which catalyzes the formation of all physiological conjugates of bilirubin IX alpha following expression in COS-1 cells. Sequence data showed that the cDNAs contained identical 3' ends (1469 base pairs in length) to each other and to that of the human phenol transferase cDNA, HLUG P1 (Harding, D., Fournel-Gigleux, S., Jackson, M. R., and Burchell, B. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 8381-8385). Here we report that the two corresponding bilirubin transferases and the phenol transferase are encoded by a novel locus, UGT1, which is also predicted to encode three other bilirubin transferase-like isozymes all having identical carboxyl termini. The transcriptional arrangement utilizes six nested promoter elements, each of which is positioned upstream of a unique exon 1. Each exon 1 encodes the NH2-terminal domain (286 amino acids) and confers the substrate specificity of the isoform. The 3' end of the locus contains 4 common exons which encode the identical carboxyl termini (246 amino acids). It is predicted that six nested primary transcripts are synthesized and that each exon 1 is differentially spliced to the 4 common exons to produce six unique, mature mRNAs. Although the gene organization is present as a single copy, it provides the flexibility of independent regulation of each isoform which is known to occur in the case of bilirubin and phenol transferase activities. With an understanding of the gene structure, lethal, as well as the nonlethal defects, associated with bilirubin transferase activity can now be determined. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428
2605236	19891114	Structure of the human hepatic triglyceride lipase gene.	The structure of the human hepatic triglyceride lipase gene was determined from multiple cosmid clones. All the exons, exon-intron junctions, and 845 bp of the 5' and 254 bp of the 3' flanking DNA were sequenced. Comparison of the exon sequences to three previously published cDNA sequences revealed differences in the sequence of the codons for residues 133, 193, 202, and 234 that may represent sequence polymorphisms. By primer extension, hepatic lipase mRNA initiates at an adenine 77 bases upstream of the translation initiation site. The hepatic lipase gene spans over 60 kb containing 9 exons and 8 introns, the latter being all located within the region encoding the mature protein. The exons are all of average size (118-234 bp). Exon 1 encodes the signal peptide, exon 4, a region that binds to the lipoprotein substrate, and exon 5, an evolutionarily highly conserved region of potential catalytic function, and exons 6 and 9 encode sequences rich in basic amino acids thought to be important in anchoring the enzyme to the endothelial surface by interacting with acidic domains of the surface glycosaminoglycans. The human lipoprotein lipase gene has been recently reported to have an identical exon-intron organization containing the analogous structural domains [Deeb &amp; Peng (1989) Biochemistry 28, 4131-4135]. Our observations strongly support the common evolutionary origin of these two lipolytic enzymes. 	Biochemistry	D003160 D016428 D013485 D013487
18278550	20080219	Molecular cloning, mapping, and polymorphism of the porcine SCG2 gene.	The secretogranin II (SCG2) gene is associated with the synthesis and secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. In the present study, we have determined the complete cDNA sequence of pig SCG2, which was submitted to GenBank with accession no. AY870646. Its complete open reading frame of 1,851 nucleotides encodes 616 amino acids. The predicted protein shares 80-87% identity with mouse, human, and bovine SCG2 proteins, and all four species share almost complete identity in the secretoneurin and EM66 domains. Pig SCG2 is a protein of 589 amino acids and 68,132 Da, preceded by a signal peptide of 27 residues. It contains nine pairs of dibasic residues, which are used as potential cleavage sites for generation of physiologically active peptides. Analysis of the SCG2 gene across the INRA-Minnesota porcine radiation hybrid panel indicates close linkage with microsatellite marker SW2608, located on Sus scrofa chromosome 15 (SSC15) q25, which harbors several QTL for ovulation rate and meat quality. Comparative sequencing and EST analysis revealed nine SNPs in porcine SCG2 cDNA, including seven SNPs in the coding region and two SNPs in the 3' UTR. Four nonsynonymous SNPs (G622A, G1671T, C1718T, and A1790C) resulted in amino acid substitutions of Ala--&gt;Thr, Glu--&gt;Asp, Pro--&gt;Leu, and Asn--&gt;Thr, respectively. 	Biochem._Genet.

11941539	20020410	Germline alterations of the RNASEL gene, a candidate HPC1 gene at 1q25, in patients and families with prostate cancer.	The RNASEL gene (2',5'-oligoisoadenylate-synthetase dependent) encodes a ribonuclease that mediates the antiviral and apoptotic activities of interferons. The RNASEL gene maps to the hereditary-prostate-cancer (HPC)-predisposition locus at 1q24-q25 (HPC1) and was recently shown to harbor truncating mutations in two families with linkage to HPC1. Here, we screened for RNASEL germline mutations in 66 Finnish patients with HPC, and we determined the frequency of the changes in the index patients from 116 families with HPC, in 492 patients with unselected prostate cancer (PRCA), in 223 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and in 566 controls. A truncating mutation, E265X, was found in 5 (4.3%) of the 116 patients from families with HPC. This was significantly higher (odds ratio [OR] =4.56; P=.04) than the frequency of E265X in controls (1.8%). The highest mutation frequency (9.5%) was found in patients from families with four or more affected members. Possible segregation was detected only in a single family. However, the median age at disease onset for E265X carriers was 11 years less than that for noncarriers in the same families. In addition, of the four missense variants found, R462Q showed an association with HPC (OR=1.96; P=.07). None of the variants showed any differences between controls and either patients with BPH or patients with PRCA. We conclude that, although RNASEL mutations do not explain disease segregation in Finnish families with HPC, the variants are enriched in families with HPC that include more than two affected members and may also be associated with the age at disease onset. This suggests a possible modifying role in cancer predisposition. The impact that the RNASEL sequence variants have on PRCA burden at the population level seems small but deserves further study.

16713920	20060523	De-novo mutations of the sodium channel gene SCN1A in alleged vaccine encephalopathy: a retrospective study.	Vaccination, particularly for pertussis, has been implicated as a direct cause of an encephalopathy with refractory seizures and intellectual impairment. We postulated that cases of so-called vaccine encephalopathy could have mutations in the neuronal sodium channel alpha1 subunit gene (SCN1A) because of a clinical resemblance to severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI) for which such mutations have been identified. We retrospectively studied 14 patients with alleged vaccine encephalopathy in whom the first seizure occurred within 72 h of vaccination. We reviewed the relation to vaccination from source records and assessed the specific epilepsy phenotype. Mutations in SCN1A were identified by PCR amplification and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography analysis, with subsequent sequencing. Parental DNA was examined to ascertain the origin of the mutation. SCN1A mutations were identified in 11 of 14 patients with alleged vaccine encephalopathy; a diagnosis of a specific epilepsy syndrome was made in all 14 cases. Five mutations predicted truncation of the protein and six were missense in conserved regions of the molecule. In all nine cases where parental DNA was available the mutations arose de novo. Clinical-molecular correlation showed mutations in eight of eight cases with phenotypes of SMEI, in three of four cases with borderline SMEI, but not in two cases with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Cases of alleged vaccine encephalopathy could in fact be a genetically determined epileptic encephalopathy that arose de novo. These findings have important clinical implications for diagnosis and management of encephalopathy and, if confirmed in other cohorts, major societal implications for the general acceptance of vaccination.

20186687	20100227	Loss-of-function of MYO5B is the main cause of microvillus inclusion disease: 15 novel mutations and a CaCo-2 RNAi cell model.	Autosomal recessive microvillus inclusion disease (MVID) is characterized by an intractable diarrhea starting within the first few weeks of life. The hallmarks of MVID are a lack of microvilli on the surface of villous enterocytes, occurrence of intracellular vacuoles lined by microvilli (microvillus inclusions), and the cytoplasmic accumulation of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive vesicles in enterocytes. Recently, we identified mutations in MYO5B, encoding the unconventional type Vb myosin motor protein, in a first cohort of nine MVID patients. In this study, we identified 15 novel nonsense and missense mutations in MYO5B in 11 unrelated MVID patients. Fluorescence microscopy, Western blotting, and electron microscopy were applied to analyze the effects of MYO5B siRNA knock-down in polarized, brush border possessing CaCo-2 cells. Loss of surface microvilli, increased formation of microvillus inclusions, and subapical enrichment of PAS-positive endomembrane compartments were induced in polarized, filter-grown CaCo-2 cells, following MYO5B knock-down. Our data indicate that MYO5B mutations are a major cause of microvillus inclusion disease and that MYO5B knock-down recapitulates most of the cellular phenotype in vitro, thus independently showing loss of MYO5B function as the cause of microvillus inclusion disease.

9548457	19980421	Molecular cloning of leukotactin-1: a novel human beta-chemokine, a chemoattractant for neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes, and a potent agonist at CC chemokine receptors 1 and 3.	A new member of human beta-chemokine cDNA was isolated and named leukotactin-1 (Lkn-1). Lkn-1, along with murine macrophage inflammatory protein-related protein-1 and -2, defines a subgroup of beta-chemokines based on two conserved cysteines in addition to the four others conserved in all beta-chemokines. The putative mature Lkn-1 is composed of 92 amino acids with a calculated m.w. of 10,162. The Lkn-1 gene was mapped to human chromosome 17, region q12. Recombinant Lkn-1 was a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes and induced calcium flux in these cells. Lkn-1 specifically induced calcium flux in CCR1- and CCR3-expressing HOS cell lines. Lkn-1 suppressed colony formation by human granulocyte-macrophage, erythroid, and multipotential progenitor cells stimulated by combinations of growth factors. Hence, we have isolated and characterized a human C6 beta-chemokine that is a potent agonist at CCR1 and CCR3 and shows broad biologic activities, including leukocyte chemoattraction. 	J._Immunol.

1718985	19911115	A model for microtubule-associated protein 4 structure. Domains defined by comparisons of human, mouse, and bovine sequences.	cDNAs encoding human and mouse microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP 4) were isolated. MAP 4 is encoded by a single gene. Multiple MAP 4 mRNAs are transcribed that are differentially expressed among mouse tissues. Open reading frames for the human and mouse MAP 4 clones indicate three distinct regions consisting of related sequences with different motifs. Approximately 30% of the protein is tandem related repeats of approximately 14 amino acids. Another region contains clusters of serine and proline. Four 18-mer repeats characteristic of the microtubule-binding domains of MAP 2 and tau are located at the carboxyl-terminal portion of MAP 4. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that human and mouse MAP 4 are homologs of the bovine 190-kDa MAP/MAP U (Aizawa, H., Emori, Y., Murofushi, H., Kawasakai, H., Sakai, H., and Suzuki, K. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 13849-13855). Mouse and human MAP 4 and the bovine 190-kDa MAP are approximately 75% similar, indicating that these proteins are all members of the same class. Domains with extremely high conservation (greater than or equal to 88%) are: 1) the extreme amino terminus; 2) a proline-rich region between the KDM and S,P domains; 3) the microtubule-binding domain; and 4) the extreme carboxyl terminus.

12459187	20021203	PAR3beta, a novel homologue of the cell polarity protein PAR3, localizes to tight junctions.	The cell polarity protein PAR3, conserved from the nematode to the vertebrate, forms a complex with PAR6 and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), and the protein complex occurs at the tight junctions in mammalian epithelial cells. Here we have cloned human cDNA for a novel PAR3 homologue, designated PAR3beta, whose messages are present in a variety of tissues and most abundantly expressed in the adult and fetal kidneys. The encoded protein of 1,205 amino acids contains a region homologous to the aPKC-binding domain of PAR3alpha, another human homologue previously identified, and three PDZ domains; the first PDZ domain of PAR3alpha is considered to interact with PAR6. Unexpectedly, in contrast to other PAR3s found in various species, PAR3beta is incapable of binding to any isotypes of PAR6 or aPKC. Nevertheless PAR3beta, expressed intrinsically or extrinsically, localizes to the tight junctions, indicating that the localization does not require the ternary complex formation.

10938021	20000811	Common and rare ABCA1 variants affecting plasma HDL cholesterol.	Mutations in ABCA1, a member of the ATP-binding cassette family, have been shown to underlie Tangier disease (TD) and familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia (FHA), which are genetic disorders that are characterized by depressed concentrations of plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. An important question is whether common variants within the coding sequence of ABCA1 can affect plasma HDL cholesterol in the general population. To address this issue, we developed a screening strategy to find common ABCA1 variants. This strategy involved long-range amplification of genomic DNA by using coding sequences only, followed by deep sequencing into the introns. This method helped us to characterize a new set of amplification primers, which permitted amplification of virtually all of the coding sequence of ABCA1 and its intron-exon boundaries with a single DNA amplification program. With these new sequencing primers, we found 3 novel ABCA1 mutations: a frameshift mutation (4570insA, A1484S--&gt;X1492), a missense mutation (A986D) in a TD family, and a missense mutation (R170C) in aboriginal subjects with FHA. We also used these sequencing primers to characterize 4 novel common amino acid variants in ABCA1, in addition to 5 novel common silent variants. We tested for association of the ABCA1 I/M823 variant with plasma HDL cholesterol in Canadian Inuit and found that M823/M823 homozygotes had significantly higher plasma HDL cholesterol compared with subjects with the other genotypes. The results provide proof of principle of the effectiveness of this approach to identify both rare and common ABCA1 genomic variants and also suggest that common amino acid variation in ABCA1 is a determinant of plasma HDL cholesterol in the general population.

11788824	20020115	Mutations of TTN, encoding the giant muscle filament titin, cause familial dilated cardiomyopathy.	Congestive heart failure (CHF) can result from various disease states with inadequate cardiac output. CHF due to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a familial disease in 20-30% of cases and is associated with mutations in genes encoding cytoskeletal, contractile or inner-nuclear membrane proteins. We show that mutations in the gene encoding giant-muscle filament titin (TTN) cause autosomal dominant DCM linked to chromosome 2q31 (CMD1G; MIM 604145). Titin molecules extend from sarcomeric Z-discs to M-lines, provide an extensible scaffold for the contractile machinery and are crucial for myofibrillar elasticity and integrity. In a large DCM kindred, a segregating 2-bp insertion mutation in TTN exon 326 causes a frameshift, truncating A-band titin. The truncated protein of approximately 2 mD is expressed in skeletal muscle, but western blot studies with epitope-specific anti-titin antibodies suggest that the mutant protein is truncated to a 1.14-mD subfragment by site-specific cleavage. In another large family with DCM linked to CMD1G, a TTN missense mutation (Trp930Arg) is predicted to disrupt a highly conserved hydrophobic core sequence of an immunoglobulin fold located in the Z-disc-I-band transition zone. The identification of TTN mutations in individuals with CMD1G should provide further insights into the pathogenesis of familial forms of CHF and myofibrillar titin turnover. 	Nat._Genet.

9063743	19970201	A multicopy transcription-repair gene, BTF2p44, maps to the SMA region and demonstrates SMA associated deletions.	The childhood-onset spinal muscular atrophies are a clinically heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by selective degeneration of the anterior horn cells with subsequent weakness and atrophy of limb muscles. The disease locus has been mapped to a region of chromosome 5q13 characterized by genetic instability and DNA duplication. Among the duplicated genes in this region, SMNT (telomeric copy; survival motor neuron) is thought to be the major disease determining gene since it is missing in the majority of SMA patients and since small, intragenic mutations in the gene have been associated with the disorder. Approximately half of the severely affected SMA I patients are also missing both homologues of a neighboring gene, the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP). These data indicate that loss of NAIP may affect disease severity and further, that the molecular events underlying the childhood-onset SMAs are complex, possibly involving multiple genes. We report a third multicopy gene in the SMA region, encoding the p44 subunit of basal transcription factor II (BTF2p44). One copy of this transcription-repair gene is deleted in at least 15% of all SMA cases. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D013485 D013487

10227618	19990505	Quantitative MRI in CADASIL: correlation with disability and cognitive performance.	To study correlations between total lesion load on brain MRI and clinical features, and to evaluate the influence of demographic variables on quantitative MRI variables in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). CADASIL is a hereditary form of small-vessel disease caused by mutations within the Notch3 gene. MRI abnormalities have been found both in asymptomatic and symptomatic CADASIL individuals. Quantitative measurements on cerebral MRI were performed in 64 CADASIL individuals. MRI lesions were quantified using a semi-automated segmentation technique based on local thresholds. MRI total lesion volume correlated significantly with disability (Rankin Scale) on both T1- and proton density (PD)-weighted images. There was a significant inverse correlation between total lesion volume and overall cognitive performance as determined by the Mini-Mental State Examination. Age but not sex was correlated with lesion load both on T1- and PD-weighted images. There was no detectable influence of the Notch3 genotype on quantitative MRI variables. This study demonstrates correlations between MRI lesion volume and clinical characteristics in CADASIL. Longitudinal studies are now warranted to investigate whether quantitative MRI could be used as an adjunct outcome measure in future therapeutic trials in CADASIL. 	Neurology	D016428 D013485
8834003	19950101	Functional characterization and localization of a cardiac-type inwardly rectifying K+ channel.	We cloned inwardly rectifying K+ channel cDNAs from porcine, rat and human, which were structurally almost identical with recently reported CIR(cKATP-1). The expression of CIR alone was low and unstable in Xenopus oocytes. The CIR/GIRK1 co-expression showed an increased current amplitude. Both the CIR and CIR/GIRK1 currents increased by coexpressing G beta gamma. The CIR and CIR/GIRK1 currents displayed two qualitative differences. (1) The conductance of the CIR channel did not saturate, but that of the CIR/GIRK1 channel showed saturation at hyperpolarized potential. (2) The CIR current showed instantaneous activation upon hyperpolarization, whereas the CIR/GIRK1 current exhibited slow activation, which was fitted by the sum of two exponentials. The CIR/GIRK1 current was also different from the GIRK1 current. The activation of the CIR/GIRK1 current was approximately ten times faster than that of the GIRK1 current. The increase in current amplitude and the qualitative differences imply the formation of functional heteromultimer. The CIR/GIRK1 channel showed differences from the native muscarinic K+ channel in that the basal level before m2 receptor activation is significantly large, and that the activation kinetics are much faster. Using anti-CIR antiserum, the CIR was detected in myocardial cells of the atrium and the ventricular subendocardial layer, and in the cardiac ganglion. 	Recept._Channels	D016428 D013485

Forty-four Finnish volunteers who were previously studied with regard to the repair rate of UV-specific cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in the skin were genotyped for XPD polymorphisms at codons 312 (exon 10 G--&gt;A, Asp--&gt;Asn) and 751 (exon 23 A--&gt;C, Lys--&gt;Gln). The repair rate was measured at 24 h for two different cyclobutane dimers. The data did not show consistent XPD genotype-specific differences in DNA repair rates among all subjects. The combined exon 10 AA and exon 23 CC genotype was associated with an approximately 50% depression of repair rate but this was of borderline statistical significance. However, the exon 23 C allele was associated with depressed repair among subjects aged 50 years or older and the result was consistent with both dimers. 	Carcinogenesis	D016428

We have identified a new mutant Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) deduced from the nucleotide sequences of peripheral blood lymphocyte mRNA from Japanese patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS). Sequence analysis of reverse transcriptase-initiated PCR amplified mRNA revealed a heterozygosity indicative of one normal allele and one variant allele with a T--&gt;A transversion. This base change led to replacement of valine by glutamic acid at position 7 of 153-residue SOD1 molecule, and produced a new restriction site for Alu I in the exon 1. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis confirmed the linkage of this mutation with this type of FALS. Both enzymatic activity and protein of the SOD1 were reduced in red blood cells from the patient. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.	D016428 D013485
9428641	19980115	Sequence of a putative glucose 6-phosphate translocase, mutated in glycogen storage disease type Ib.	We report the sequence of a human cDNA that encodes a 46 kDa transmembrane protein homologous to bacterial transporters for phosphate esters. This protein presents at its carboxy terminus the consensus motif for retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. Northern blots of rat tissues indicate that the corresponding mRNA is mostly expressed in liver and kidney. In two patients with glycogen storage disease type Ib, mutations were observed that either replaced a conserved Gly to Cys or introduced a premature stop codon. The encoded protein is therefore most likely the glucose 6-phosphate translocase that is functionally associated with glucose-6-phosphatase. 	FEBS_Lett.	D016428 D013485
16730661	20060530	Mutational analysis of the PRYSPRY domain of pyrin and implications for familial mediterranean fever (FMF).	Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal, recessively inherited disease, characterized by recurrent fever and serositis that affects mainly patients of the Mediterranean basin. The gene responsible for FMF, named MEFV, was cloned and several missense mutations were found to be responsible for the disease. Based on a recent molecular analysis of MEFV gene mutations in 43 patients from Crete aiming to correlate specific genotypes and clinical manifestations of FMF, we were prompted to construct a three-dimensional model (3-D model) of the PRYSPRY domain of pyrin. The majority of the known MEFV mutations located on this domain have been classified, according to disease severity, and localized on this 3-D model. The functional consequences of these mutations and their implications on disease severity are discussed. Moreover, we report a putative novel missense mutation, S702C, which we identified in exon 10 of the MEFV gene and localized on the constructed 3-D model. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.	D016428
22325362	20120214	GPR179 is required for depolarizing bipolar cell function and is mutated in autosomal-recessive complete congenital stationary night blindness.	Complete congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of retinal disorders characterized by nonprogressive impairment of night vision, absence of the electroretinogram (ERG) b-wave, and variable degrees of involvement of other visual functions. We report here that mutations in GPR179, encoding an orphan G protein receptor, underlie a form of autosomal-recessive cCSNB. The Gpr179(nob5/nob5) mouse model was initially discovered by the absence of the ERG b-wave, a component that reflects depolarizing bipolar cell (DBC) function. We performed genetic mapping, followed by next-generation sequencing of the critical region and detected a large transposon-like DNA insertion in Gpr179. The involvement of GPR179 in DBC function was confirmed in zebrafish and humans. Functional knockdown of gpr179 in zebrafish led to a marked reduction in the amplitude of the ERG b-wave. Candidate gene analysis of GPR179 in DNA extracted from patients with cCSNB identified GPR179-inactivating mutations in two patients. We developed an antibody against mouse GPR179, which robustly labeled DBC dendritic terminals in wild-type mice. This labeling colocalized with the expression of GRM6 and was absent in Gpr179(nob5/nob5) mutant mice. Our results demonstrate that GPR179 plays a critical role in DBC signal transduction and expands our understanding of the mechanisms that mediate normal rod vision. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.

10323403	19990514	A novel 9-base pair duplication in RET exon 8 in familial medullary thyroid carcinoma.	Familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A syndromes are dominantly inherited diseases caused by activating germline mutations of the RET protooncogene. The majority of these patients carry a germline point mutation affecting one of five cysteine residues encoded by exon 10 (codon 609, 611, 618, or 620) or 11 (codon 634). In a few FMTC families, point mutations involving noncysteine codons in exon 13 (codons 768, 790, and 791), 14 (codon 804), or 15 (codon 891) have been reported. Hirschsprung's disease is a nonneoplastic disorder associated with RET mutations leading to a loss of function effect. Mutations are identified in 50% of the familial cases and are scattered along the gene. We now report the study of a FMTC family with four affected members and a history of fatal neonatal intestinal obstruction in the sister of the proband. Genetic analysis demonstrated the absence of an usual FMTC mutation and the presence of a germline 9-bp duplication in RET exon 8 in the heterozygous state in all patients with MTC. This new mutation creates an additional cysteine residue in the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of RET. Further studies are warranted to confirm whether this new mutation is causing MTC only or could be associated with Hirschsprung's disease. 	J._Clin._Endocrinol._Metab.	D016428 D013485
6585826	19840501	Human transferrin: cDNA characterization and chromosomal localization.	Transferrin (Tf) is the major iron binding protein in vertebrate serum. It shares homologous amino acid sequences with four other proteins: lactotransferrin, ovotransferrin, melanoma antigen p97, and HuBlym-1. Antigen p97 and the Tf receptor genes have been mapped on human chromosome 3. The goal of the study described here was to initiate the characterization of the Tf gene by identifying and characterizing its cDNA and mapping its chromosomal location. Recombinant plasmids containing human cDNA encoding Tf have been isolated by screening an adult human liver library with a mixed oligonucleotide probe. Within the 2.3 kilobase pairs of Tf cDNA analyzed, there is a probable leader sequence encoded by 57 nucleotides followed by 2037 nucleotides that encode the homologous amino and carboxyl domains. During evolution, three areas of the homologous amino and carboxyl domains have been strongly conserved, possibly reflecting functional constraints associated with iron binding. Chromosomal mapping by in situ hybridization and somatic cell hybrid analysis indicate that the Tf gene is located at q21-25 on human chromosome 3, consistent with linkage of the Tf, Tf receptor, and melanoma p97 loci.

8644708	19960301	FGFR2 exon IIIa and IIIc mutations in Crouzon, Jackson-Weiss, and Pfeiffer syndromes: evidence for missense changes, insertions, and a deletion due to alternative RNA splicing.	Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) mutations have been associated with the craniosynostotic conditions Crouzon, Jackson-Weiss, and Pfeiffer syndromes. Previously, mutations were described in the exons IIIa and IIIc, which form the extracellular, third immunoglobulin-like domain (IgIII) and adjacent linker regions, both of which are normally involved in ligand binding. For all three conditions, mutations were found in exon IIIc. Only in Crouzon syndrome were mutations identified in exon IIIa. In this study, 39 cases with one of these three conditions were screened for exon IIIa or IIIc mutations. Eleven mutations are reported in 17 unrelated cases. Mutations in exon IIIa are identified for not only Crouzon but also Jackson-Weiss and Pfeiffer syndromes. Four mutations in either exon IIIa or exon IIIc reported only in Crouzon syndrome are present also in one of the other two syndromes. Two insertions, one in exon IIIa in a Crouzon syndrome patient and the other in exon IIIc in a Pfeiffer syndrome patient, were observed. The latter mutation has the same alternative RNA splicing effect as a reported synonymous mutation for Crouzon syndrome. A missense mutation was detected in one Pfeiffer syndrome family in which two members had craniosynostosis without limb anomalies. The inter- and intrafamilial variability in expression of FGFR2 mutations suggests that these three syndromes, presumed to be clinically distinct, are instead representative of a spectrum of related craniosynostotic and digital disorders.

11572989	20010927	WWOX: a candidate tumor suppressor gene involved in multiple tumor types.	We previously reported the construction of a P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) contig encompassing a set of homozygous deletions of chromosome 16q23-24.1 found in primary ovarian tumor material and several tumor cell lines. Using these PAC clones in a cDNA selection experiment, we have isolated a Sau3A fragment homologous to the WWOX transcript (GenBank accession no. ) from normal human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cells. We demonstrate the homozygous deletion of WWOX exons from ovarian cancer cells and three different tumor cell lines. We also identify an internally deleted WWOX transcript from a further primary ovarian tumor. In three of these samples the deletions result in frameshifts, and in each case the resulting WWOX transcripts lack part, or all, of the short chain dehydrogenase domain and the putative mitochondrial localization signal. Sequencing revealed several missense polymorphisms in tumor cell lines and identified a high level of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the WWOX gene. This evidence strengthens the case for WWOX as a tumor suppressor gene in ovarian cancer and other tumor types. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 D013485
10395326	19990708	Cloning of mammalian heparanase, an important enzyme in tumor invasion and metastasis.	The endoglycosidase heparanase is an important in the degradation of the extracellular matrix by invading cells, notably metastatic tumor cells and migrating leukocytes. Here we report the cDNA sequence of the human platelet enzyme, which encodes a unique protein of 543 amino acids, and the identification of highly homologous sequences in activated mouse T cells and in a highly metastatic rat adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, the expression of heparanase mRNA in rat tumor cells correlates with their metastatic potential. Exhaustive studies have shown only one heparanase sequence, consistent with the idea that this enzyme is the dominant endoglucuronidase in mammalian tissues. 	Nat._Med.	D016428 D013485
10820259	20000523	GRID: a novel Grb-2-related adapter protein that interacts with the activated T cell costimulatory receptor CD28.	Adapter proteins such as Grb2 play a central role in the formation of signaling complexes through their association with multiple protein binding partners. These interactions are mediated by specialized domains such as the well-characterized Src homology SH2 and SH3 motifs. Using yeast three-hybrid technology, we have identified a novel adapter protein, expressed predominantly in T lymphocytes, that associates with the activated form of the costimulatory receptor, CD28. The protein is a member of the Grb2 family of adapter proteins and contains an SH3-SH2-SH3 domain structure. A unique glutamine/proline-rich domain (insert domain) of unknown function is situated between the SH2 and N-terminal SH3 domains. We term this protein GRID for Grb2-related protein with insert domain. GRID coimmunoprecipitates with CD28 from Jurkat cell lysates following activation of CD28. Using mutants of CD28 and GRID, we demonstrate that interaction between the proteins is dependent on phosphorylation of CD28 at tyrosine 173 and integrity of the GRID SH2 domain, although there are also subsidiary stabilizing contacts between the PXXP motifs of CD28 and the GRID C-terminal SH3 domain. In addition to CD28, GRID interacts with a number of other T cell signaling proteins, including SLP-76 (SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa), p62dok, and RACK-1 (receptor for activated protein kinase C-1). These findings suggest that GRID functions as an adapter protein in the CD28-mediated costimulatory pathway in T cells. 	J._Immunol.	D016428
11493702	20010809	Identification of a family of Fc receptor homologs with preferential B cell expression.	Investigation of human genome sequences with a consensus sequence derived from receptors for the Fc region of Igs (FcR) led to the identification of a subfamily of five Ig superfamily members that we term the Fc receptor homologs (FcRHs). The closely linked FcRH genes are located in a chromosome 1q21 region in the midst of previously recognized FcR genes. This report focuses on the FcRH1, FcRH2, and FcRH3 members of this gene family. Their cDNAs encode type I transmembrane glycoproteins with 3-6 Ig-like extracellular domains and cytoplasmic domains containing consensus immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating and/or inhibitory signaling motifs. The five FcRH genes are structurally related, and their protein products share 28-60% extracellular identity with each other. They also share 15-31% identity with their closest FcR relatives. The FcRH genes are expressed primarily, although not exclusively, by mature B lineage cells. Their conserved structural features, patterns of cellular expression, and the inhibitory and activating signaling potential of their transmembrane protein products suggest that the members of this FcRH multigene family may serve important regulatory roles in normal and neoplastic B cell development.

9856496	19981218	Genomic structure of the human glucose 6-phosphate translocase gene and novel mutations in the gene of a Japanese patient with glycogen storage disease type Ib.	Glycogen storage disease (GSD) type Ib is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in microsomal glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) translocase. A gene mutated in GSD type Ib patients has recently been isolated. We have determined the entire sequence of the human G6P translocase gene by PCR-directed sequencing. The gene spans approximately 5 kb of genomic DNA and contains eight exons. Analysis of DNA from a Japanese patient with GSD type Ib revealed new compound heterozygous mutations; a T to C transition at cDNA position 521 resulting in W118R, and an A to C transversion at the -2 splicing acceptor site of intron 1. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR from leukocyte RNA of the patient revealed the abnormally spliced transcript. These results further support the suggestion that the gene is causative for GSD Ib and should be useful in the molecular diagnosis of such patients. 	Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
8878534	19961014	Molecular cloning and characterization of the human transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase homologue, phogrin, an autoantigen of type 1 diabetes.	A 4.7 kb cDNA of tyrosine phosphatase-like protein, phogrin, was isolated from a human islet cDNA library. Sequencing of the resulting clone identified a 3,045 residue open-reading frame encoding a 1,015 amino acid polypeptide with predicted molecular mass of 111,303 daltons. Phogrin's amino acid sequence has a single transmembrane region and one putative tyrosine phosphatase catalytic domain. Phogrin is 74% identical to the ICA512/IA-2 autoantigen of type 1 diabetes in the cytoplasmic domain, but only 29% in the luminal domain. It showed &gt; 90% identity to rat phogrin and mouse IA-2 beta. Autoantibody radioassays utilizing full-length and the cytoplasmic domain of phogrin were compared. With positivity defined above the 99th percentile of 105 normal control subjects, 37 (48%) and 47 (61%) of sera from 77 new-onset patients with type 1 diabetes were positive for autoantibodies to full-length and the cytoplasmic domain of phogrin, respectively. The assay utilizing cytoplasmic human phogrin gave higher sensitivity with identical specificity to the assay utilizing the full-length molecule primarily due to lower &quot;background&quot; binding. Phogrin is an additional major autoantigen for type 1 diabetes and the isolation of the cDNA of this molecule from human islets will aid in studies of the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes.

21115670	20101201	Novel PKD1 and PKD2 mutations in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common genetic renal disorder with an incidence of 1:1000. Mutations in two genes (PKD1 and PKD2) have been identified as causative. Eighty-five percent of patients with ADPKD carry their mutation in the PKD1 gene. So far, &gt;?500 mutations for PKD1 and &gt; 120 mutations for PKD2, respectively, are known. In this study, we performed mutation analysis of PKD1 and PKD2 by exon sequencing in patients during routine molecular diagnostics for ADPKD. In total, 60 mutations were identified in 93 patients representing a mutation detection efficiency of 64.5%. Fifty-two mutations were identified in PKD1 (86.7%) and 8 in PKD2 (13.3%). These include 41 novel mutations detected in PKD1 and 5 novel mutations in PKD2. Accordingly, our data expand the spectrum of known PKD mutations by 8% for PKD1 (41/513) and 4.2% for PKD2 (5/120). These results are in agreement with the detection ranges of 42%, 63% and 64% for definitive disease-causing mutations, and 78%, 86% and 89% for all identified variants reported in several comprehensive mutation screening reports. The increased number of known mutations will facilitate future studies into genotype-phenotype correlations. 	Nephrol._Dial._Transplant.	D016428 D013485
15735344	20050301	X-ray crystallographic studies of two transthyretin variants: further insights into amyloidogenesis.	Transthyretin (TTR) is a homotetrameric plasma protein that, as a result of a set of not yet fully characterized conformational changes, forms fibrillar aggregates that are the major protein component of amyloid deposits. More than 80 mutations associated with TTR amyloid deposition have been described in the literature. X-ray crystallography was used to elucidate the three-dimensional structure of two important TTR variants: TTR Y78F, an amyloidogenic protein, and TTR R104H, which is associated with a protective effect over the amyloidogenic V30M mutation. The structures of those two TTR variants have been determined in space group P2(1)2(1)2 to 1.55 and 1.60 angstroms resolution, respectively, using molecular-replacement techniques. Detailed analysis of the protein model for TTR Y78F indicates a destabilization of the contacts between the alpha-helix and AB loop and the body of the molecule, intimately related to the amyloidogenic nature; contrastingly, in the TTR R104H variant new contacts involving the N-terminal region and His104 are clearly antagonists of amyloid formation.

16959974	20060909	The consensus coding sequences of human breast and colorectal cancers.	The elucidation of the human genome sequence has made it possible to identify genetic alterations in cancers in unprecedented detail. To begin a systematic analysis of such alterations, we determined the sequence of well-annotated human protein-coding genes in two common tumor types. Analysis of 13,023 genes in 11 breast and 11 colorectal cancers revealed that individual tumors accumulate an average of approximately 90 mutant genes but that only a subset of these contribute to the neoplastic process. Using stringent criteria to delineate this subset, we identified 189 genes (average of 11 per tumor) that were mutated at significant frequency. The vast majority of these genes were not known to be genetically altered in tumors and are predicted to affect a wide range of cellular functions, including transcription, adhesion, and invasion. These data define the genetic landscape of two human cancer types, provide new targets for diagnostic and therapeutic intervention, and open fertile avenues for basic research in tumor biology.

9187667	19970601	Mutational analysis of the MPZ, PMP22 and Cx32 genes in patients of Spanish ancestry with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.	Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are two inherited peripheral neuropathies. The most prevalent mutations are a reciprocal 1.5-Mb duplication and 1.5-Mb deletion, respectively, at the CMT1A/HNPP locus on chromosome 17p11.2. Point mutations in the coding region of the myelin genes, peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22), myelin protein zero (MPZ) or connexin 32 (Cx32) have been reported in CMT patients, including CMT type 1 (CMT1), CMT type 2 (CMT2) and Déjérine-Sottas neuropathy (DS) patients, and only in the coding region of PMP22 in HNPP families lacking a deletion. We have investigated point and small mutations in the MPZ, PMP22 and Cx32 genes in a series of patients of Spanish ancestry: 47 CMT patients without duplications, and 5 HNPP patients without deletions. We found 15 different mutations in 16 CMT patients (34%). Nine different mutations in ten patients were detected in the Cx32 gene, this being the most frequently involved gene in this series, whereas five mutations involved the MPZ gene and only one the PMP22 gene. Six out of nine nucleotide substitutions in the Cx32 gene involved two codons encoding arginine at positions 164 and 183, suggesting that these two codons may constitute two Cx32 regions prone to mutate in the Spanish population. Analysis of HNPP patients revealed a 5' splicing mutation in intron 1 of the PMP22 gene in a family with autosomal dominance, which confirms allelic heterogeneity in HNPP. Ectopic mRNA analysis on leukocytes suggests that this mutation might behave as a null allele. 	Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485

7688405	19930801	A keratin 14 mutational hot spot for epidermolysis bullosa simplex, Dowling-Meara: implications for diagnosis.	Recently, two patients with the Dowling-Meara subtype of epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS-DM) were reported with different mutations in codon 125 of the keratin 14 gene. To determine whether these are common mutations, we screened ten EBS-DM patients and their families using single nucleotide primer extension. Four of ten unrelated EBS-DM patients had a G--&gt;A substitution at base pair 434 of codon 125, whereas one case out of ten had a C--&gt;T substitution at position 433 of the same codon. The G434A alteration cosegregated with the disorder in two multigenerational families; no recombination events were detected. In these two families, linkage analysis provided significant evidence in favor of linkage between G434A and the EBS-DM phenotype, with a LOD score of 3.29 at a recombination rate of 0%. Codon 125 substitutions identified in three unrelated sporadic EBS-DM patients were not found in their clinically unaffected parents. Together, these data provide compelling genetic evidence that the codon 125 substitutions are causal for EBS-DM. The high frequency of mutation at this site in individuals with EBS-DM now makes DNA-based diagnosis of this disorder feasible. 	J._Invest._Dermatol.	D016428 D013485 D013487
14990586	20040303	A novel transcription regulatory complex containing death domain-associated protein and the ATR-X syndrome protein.	Death domain-associated protein (Daxx) is a multi-functional protein that modulates both apoptosis and transcription. Within the nucleus, Daxx is a component of the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) and interacts with a number of transcription factors, yet its precise role in transcription remains elusive. To further define the function of Daxx, we have isolated its interacting proteins in the nucleus using epitope-tagged affinity purification and identified X-linked mental retardation and alpha-thalassaemia syndrome protein (ATRX), a putative member of the SNF2 family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling proteins that is mutated in several X-linked mental retardation disorders. We show that substantial amounts of endogenous Daxx and ATRX exist in a nuclear complex. Daxx binds to ATRX through its paired amphipathic alpha helices domains. ATRX has ATPase activity that is stimulated by mononucleosomes, and patient mutations in the ATPase domain attenuate this activity. ATRX strongly represses transcription when tethered to a promoter. Daxx does not affect the ATPase activity of ATRX, however, it alleviates its transcription repression activity. In addition, ATRX is found in the PML-NBs, and this localization is mediated by Daxx. These results show that the ATRX.Daxx complex is a novel ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex, with ATRX being the core ATPase subunit and Daxx being the targeting subunit. Moreover, the localization of ATRX to the PML-NBs supports the notion that these structures may play an important role in transcription regulation. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485 D013487
23026888	20121003	High resolution melting analysis of the MMAA gene in patients with cblA and in those with undiagnosed methylmalonic aciduria.	The gene product of MMAA is required for the intracellular metabolism of cobalamin (Cbl). Mutations in this gene lead to the cblA class of disorders, characterized by isolated methylmalonic aciduria. We have been concerned that somatic cell methods of diagnosis may miss patients with mild cellular phenotypes. A high resolution melting analysis (HRMA) assay was developed to rapidly scan the coding exons and flanking intronic regions of the MMAA gene for variants. DNA was scanned by HRMA from 96 unaffected reference individuals, 72 cblA patients confirmed by complementation, and 181 patients with isolated elevated methylmalonic acid, who could not be diagnosed using complementation analysis. Suspected variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. In the cblA cohort, HRMA correctly identified all previously known mutations as well as an additional 22 variants, 10 of which had not been previously reported. Novel variants included one duplication (c.551dupG, p.C187LfsX3), one deletion (c.387delC, p.Y129YfsX13), one splice site mutation (c.440-2A&gt;G, splice site), 4 missense mutations (c.748G&gt;A, p.E520K; c.820G&gt;A, p.G274S; c.627G&gt;T, p.R209S; c.826A&gt;G, p.K276E), and 3 nonsense mutations (c.960G&gt;A, p.W320X; c.1075C&gt;T, p.E359X; c.1084C&gt;T, p.Q362X). All novel missense variants affect highly conserved residues and are predicted to be damaging. Scanning of MMAA in the 181 undiagnosed samples revealed a single novel heterozygous missense change (c.821G&gt;A, p.G274D). 	Mol._Genet._Metab.	D016428
12417513	20021106	Germline SMAD4 or BMPR1A mutations and phenotype of juvenile polyposis.	Juvenile polyposis (JP) is an inherited condition predisposing to upper gastrointestinal (UGI) polyps and colorectal cancer. Two genes are known to predispose to JP, SMAD4 and bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1A (BMPR1A). The object of this study was to determine the differences in phenotype of patients with SMAD4 or BMPR1A mutations (MUT+) compared with those without (MUT-). DNA was extracted from 54 JP probands and used for polymerase chain reaction of all exons of SMAD4 and BMPR1A. Products were then sequenced and analyzed for mutations. Medical record data were used to create a JP database, and statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact and unpaired t-tests. Nine of 54 patients had germline SMAD4 mutations, 13 had BMPR1A mutations, and 32 had neither. There were no significant differences between SMAD4+ and BMPR1A+ cases in terms of clinical factors examined, except for a family history of UGI involvement (P &lt;.01). There was a higher prevalence of familial cases in MUT+ patients (P =.09), &gt;10 lower gastrointestinal polyps (P =.06), and frequency of family history of gastrointestinal cancer compared with MUT- patients (P =.01). Patients with germline SMAD4 or BMPR1A mutations have a more prominent JP phenotype than those without, and SMAD4 mutations predispose to UGI polyposis. 	Ann._Surg._Oncol.	D016428 D013485
25326669	20141020	De novo mutations in beta-catenin (CTNNB1) appear to be a frequent cause of intellectual disability: expanding the mutational and clinical spectrum.	Recently, de novo heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in beta-catenin (CTNNB1) were described for the first time in four individuals with intellectual disability (ID), microcephaly, limited speech and (progressive) spasticity, and functional consequences of CTNNB1 deficiency were characterized in a mouse model. Beta-catenin is a key downstream component of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Somatic gain-of-function mutations have already been found in various tumor types, whereas germline loss-of-function mutations in animal models have been shown to influence neuronal development and maturation. We report on 16 additional individuals from 15 families in whom we newly identified de novo loss-of-function CTNNB1 mutations (six nonsense, five frameshift, one missense, two splice mutation, and one whole gene deletion). All patients have ID, motor delay and speech impairment (both mostly severe) and abnormal muscle tone (truncal hypotonia and distal hypertonia/spasticity). The craniofacial phenotype comprised microcephaly (typically -2 to -4 SD) in 12 of 16 and some overlapping facial features in all individuals (broad nasal tip, small alae nasi, long and/or flat philtrum, thin upper lip vermillion).

9326641	19971023	MIC-1, a novel macrophage inhibitory cytokine, is a divergent member of the TGF-beta superfamily.	Macrophages play a key role in both normal and pathological processes involving immune and inflammatory responses, to a large extent through their capacity to secrete a wide range of biologically active molecules. To identify some of these as yet not characterized molecules, we have used a subtraction cloning approach designed to identify genes expressed in association with macrophage activation. One of these genes, designated macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 (MIC-1), encodes a protein that bears the structural characteristics of a transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily cytokine. Although it belongs to this superfamily, it has no strong homology to existing families, indicating that it is a divergent member that may represent the first of a new family within this grouping. Expression of MIC-1 mRNA in monocytoid cells is up-regulated by a variety of stimuli associated with activation, including interleukin 1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 2, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor but not interferon gamma, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Its expression is also increased by TGF-beta. Expression of MIC-1 in CHO cells results in the proteolytic cleavage of the propeptide and secretion of a cysteine-rich dimeric protein of Mr 25 kDa. Purified recombinant MIC-1 is able to inhibit lipopolysaccharide -induced macrophage TNF-alpha production, suggesting that MIC-1 acts in macrophages as an autocrine regulatory molecule. Its production in response to secreted proinflammatory cytokines and TGF-beta may serve to limit the later phases of macrophage activation. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 D013485
18161618	20071229	A new GJA1 (connexin 43) mutation causing oculodentodigital dysplasia associated to uncommon features.	Oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD) is an autosomal dominant disorder that includes a clinical spectrum of craniofacial, neurologic, limb, and ocular malformations. The disease is caused by heterozygous mutations in the 6q22-q23 located GJA1 gene, that encodes connexin 43 (Cx43). In this paper we describe a novel Cx43 mutation (G2V) found in a Mexican eight-year-old boy. This de novo mutation predicts a missense substitution at the second amino acid of Cx43, in the first intracellular domain, and is the most amino-terminal located mutation reported so far. Umbilical hernia and congenital optociliary veins, two uncommon ODDD-associated features, were recognized in our patient. The phenotype of three previously described patients with Cx43 first intracellular domain mutation is discussed and compared with that observed in our patient. This case expands the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of ODDD. 	Ophthalmic_Genet.	D002363 D016428 D013485

We describe a 42-year-old man who presented with a progressive history of epilepsy, stroke-like episodes, bilateral optic atrophy, and cognitive decline. Investigation of his muscle biopsy revealed a specific defect in complex I activity. Subsequent analysis of the mitochondrial genome identified a novel heteroplasmic T10191C mutation in the ND3 gene. The mutation was present at lower levels in blood from the patient and unaffected maternal relatives and is the first pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutation in the ND3 gene to be described.

9541113	19980416	Septo-optic dysplasia and WS1 in the proband of a WS1 family segregating for a novel mutation in PAX3 exon 7.	A four generation family (UoM1) was ascertained with Waardenburg syndrome type 1 (WS1). The proband exhibited both WS1 and septo-optic dysplasia. A G to C transversion was identified in PAX3 exon 7 in four subjects affected with WS1 in this family including the proband. This glutamine to histidine missense mutation at position 391 may also affect splicing. There are over 50 mutations characterised in PAX3 in WS1 patients; however, this is the first example of a WS1 mutation in exon 7 of PAX3. 	J._Med._Genet.	D016428 D013487
12811365	20030618	Polymorphisms of OATP-C (SLC21A6) and OAT3 (SLC22A8) genes: consequences for pravastatin pharmacokinetics.	Our objective was to quantitate the contribution of the genetic polymorphisms of the genes for 2 human organic anion transporters-organic anion transporting polypeptide C (OATP-C) and organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3)-to the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin. Genetic polymorphisms were screened by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, after sequencing with deoxyribonucleic acid obtained from 120 healthy volunteers. To examine whether polymorphisms in these 2 genes of interest alter transport activity, we conducted a clinical study (n = 23) with pravastatin as a selective probe drug. Among 120 healthy individuals, 5 nonsynonymous variants and 1 nonsynonymous variant were observed in the OATP-C and OAT3 genes, respectively. The polymorphisms in the OAT3 gene did not appear to be associated with changes in renal and tubular secretory clearance. In contrast, the OATP-C variants were associated with differences in the disposition kinetics of pravastatin. Subjects with the OATP-C*15 allele (Asp130Ala174) had a reduced total and nonrenal clearance, as compared with those with the OATP-C*1b allele (Asp130Val174); nonrenal clearance values in *1b/*1b (n = 4), *1b/*15 (n = 9), and *15/*15 (n = 1) subjects were 2.01 +/- 0.42 L. kg(-1). h(-1), 1.11 +/- 0.34 L. kg(-1). h(-1), and 0.29 L. kg(-1). h(-1), respectively, and the difference between *1b/*1b and *1b/*15 subjects was significant (P &lt;.05). Certain commonly occurring single-nucleotide polymorphisms in OATP-C, such as T521C (Val174Ala), are likely to be associated with altered pharmacokinetics of pravastatin. Large clinical studies are needed to confirm these observations. 	Clin._Pharmacol._Ther.	D016428 D013485
9108485	19970418	Osteoprotegerin: a novel secreted protein involved in the regulation of bone density.	A novel secreted glycoprotein that regulates bone resorption has been identified. The protein, termed Osteoprotegerin (OPG), is a novel member of the TNF receptor superfamily. In vivo, hepatic expression of OPG in transgenic mice results in a profound yet nonlethal osteopetrosis, coincident with a decrease in later stages of osteoclast differentiation. These same effects are observed upon administration of recombinant OPG into normal mice. In vitro, osteoclast differentiation from precursor cells is blocked in a dose-dependent manner by recombinant OPG. Furthermore, OPG blocks ovariectomy-associated bone loss in rats. These data show that OPG can act as a soluble factor in the regulation of bone mass and imply a utility for OPG in the treatment of osteoporosis associated with increased osteoclast activity.

14715245	20040113	Cloning and enzymatic analysis of 22 novel human ubiquitin-specific proteases.	We have identified and cloned 22 human cDNAs encoding novel members of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family. Eighteen of the identified proteins contain all structural features characteristic of these cysteine proteinases, whereas four of them have been classified as non-peptidase homologues. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the identified USPs are broadly and differentially distributed in human tissues, some of them being especially abundant in skeletal muscle or testis. Enzymatic studies performed with the identified USPs revealed that at least twelve of them are deubiquitylating enzymes based on their ability to cleave ubiquitin from a ubiquitin-beta-galactosidase fusion protein. These results provide additional evidence of the extreme complexity and diversity of the USP proteolytic system in human tissues and open the possibility to explore the relevance of their multiple components in the regulation of ubiquitin-mediated pathways in normal and pathological functions.

16632198	20060425	Myofibrillogenesis regulator 1 gene (MR-1) mutation in an Omani family with paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia.	Two recurrent missense mutations (c.20C&gt;T: A7V; c.26C&gt;T: A9V) in the gene encoding the myofibrillogenesis regulator 1 (MR-1) have been shown to cause autosomal dominant paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) in 13 families of primarily European ancestry. Here we report an Omani PNKD family with seven affected family members and autosomal dominant inheritance. Our linkage analysis provided consistent positional evidence that the MR-1 gene could be the responsible disease gene. Sequence analysis identified a MR-1 missense mutation (c.20C&gt;T; A7V) in the affected family members, whereas it was not present in five unaffected family members and 129 population controls. Taking into account that previous haplotype analyses did not reveal evidence for common founders among several PNKD families, our present findings strengthen three implications: (1) autosomal dominant PNKD seems to be a homogenous disorder, for which the MR-1 gene is the major disease gene; (2) mainly two recurrent MR-1 missense mutations (57% V7, 43% V9) account for the genetic variance of familial PNKD; (3) it supports current evidence that some of the recurrent MR-1 mutations may have arisen independently by de novo mutation at functionally convergent key sites of the brain-specific MR-1L isoform.

9158144	19970501	The molecular basis of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency in compound heterozygous patients: is there correlation between genotype and phenotype?	Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is the most commonly recognized defect of mitochondrial beta-oxidation. It is potentially fatal, but shows a wide clinical spectrum. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether any correlation exists between MCAD genotype and disease phenotype. We determined the prevalence of the 14 known and seven previously unknown non-G985 mutations in 52 families with MCAD deficiency not caused by homozygosity for the prevalent G985 mutation. This showed that none of the non-G985 mutations are prevalent, and led to the identification of both disease-causing mutations in 14 families in whom both mutations had not previously been reported. We then evaluated the severity of the mutations identified in these 14 families. Using expression of mutant MCAD in Escherichia coli with or without co-overexpression of the molecular chaperonins GroESL we showed that five of the missense mutations affect the folding and/or stability of the protein, and that the residual enzyme activity of some of them could be modulated to a different extent depending on the amounts of available chaperonins. Thus, some of the missense mutations may result in relatively high levels of residual enzyme activity, whereas the mutations leading to premature stop codons will result in no residual enzyme activity. By correlating the observed types of mutations identified to the clinical/biochemical data in the 14 patients in whom we identified both disease-causing mutations, we show that a genotype/phenotype correlation in MCAD deficiency is not straightforward. Different mutations may contribute with different susceptibilities for disease precipitation, when the patient is subjected to metabolic stress, but other genetic and environmental factors may play an equally important role.

15897968	20050518	Identification of a novel testis-specific gene and its potential roles in testis development/spermatogenesis.	To identify and characterize a novel gene with potential roles in testis development and spermatogenesis. A cDNA microarray was constructed from a human testis large insert cDNA library and hybridized with probes of human or mouse adult and fetal testes. Differentially expressed genes were isolated and sequenced. RT-PCR was used to test the tissue distribution of the genes of interest and in situ hybridization was performed to localize the gene expression in the mouse testis. A range of bioinformatical programs including Gene Runner, SMART, NCBI Blast and Emboss CpGPlot were used to characterize the new gene's feature. A novel testis-specific gene, NYD-SP5, was differentially expressed in fetal and adult testes. The deduced protein structure of NYD-SP5 was found to contain an IQ motif (a short calmodulin-binding motif containing conserved Ile and Gln residues), a Carbamate kinase-like domain, a Zn-dependent exopeptidase domain and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) C-terminal-like domain. RT-PCR analysis revealed that NYD-SP5 was predominantly expressed in the testis but not in other 15 tissues examined. In situ hybridization and RT-PCR examinations revealed that the expression of NYD-SP5 was confined in the male germ cell but not present in the somatic cell in the testes. NYD-SP5 is a newly found testis-specific gene with potential roles in testis development and spermatogenesis through a calmodulin-activated enzyme. 	Asian_J._Androl.	D016428 D013485
17081983	20061104	Global, in vivo, and site-specific phosphorylation dynamics in signaling networks.	Cell signaling mechanisms often transmit information via posttranslational protein modifications, most importantly reversible protein phosphorylation. Here we develop and apply a general mass spectrometric technology for identification and quantitation of phosphorylation sites as a function of stimulus, time, and subcellular location. We have detected 6,600 phosphorylation sites on 2,244 proteins and have determined their temporal dynamics after stimulating HeLa cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and recorded them in the Phosida database. Fourteen percent of phosphorylation sites are modulated at least 2-fold by EGF, and these were classified by their temporal profiles. Surprisingly, a majority of proteins contain multiple phosphorylation sites showing different kinetics, suggesting that they serve as platforms for integrating signals. In addition to protein kinase cascades, the targets of reversible phosphorylation include ubiquitin ligases, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and at least 46 different transcriptional regulators. The dynamic phosphoproteome provides a missing link in a global, integrative view of cellular regulation. 	Cell	D016428 D013485
10666468	20000210	Protein sequences conserved in prokaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are important for the activity of the processivity factor of human mitochondrial DNA polymerase.	Previous studies have shown that the small subunit of Xenopus DNA polymerase gamma (pol gammaB) acts as a processivity factor to stimulate the 140 kDa catalytic subunit of human DNA polymerase gamma. A putative human pol gammaB initially identified by analysis of DNA sequence had not been shown to be functional, and appeared to be an incomplete clone. In this paper, we report the cloning of full-length human and mouse pol gammaB. Both human and mouse pol gammaB proteins were expressed in their mature forms, without their apparent mitochondrial localization signals, and shown to stimulate processivity of the recombinant catalytic subunit of human pol gammaA. Deletion analysis of human pol gammaB indicated that blocks of sequence conserved with prokaryotic class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are necessary for activity and inter-action with human pol gammaA. Purification of DNA pol gamma from HeLa cells indicated that both proteins are associated in vivo. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D013487
7684926	19930601	cDNA cloning, chromosomal mapping, and functional characterization of the human peroxisome proliferator activated receptor.	The human peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (hPPAR) was cloned from a human liver cDNA library. The cDNA exhibited 85% and 91% DNA and deduced amino acid sequence identity with mouse PPAR (mPPAR), respectively. The hPPAR gene was mapped on human chromosome 22 slightly telomeric to a linkage group of six genes and genetic markers that are located in the general region 22q12-q13.1. Cotransfection assays of mouse Hepa 1 cells were used to roughly compare the ability of hPPAR- and mPPAR-expressed cDNAs to trans-activate the acyl CoA oxidase (ACO) PPAR response element located 5' upstream to the minimal thymidine kinase promoter driving the expression of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene. Both receptors elicited a response with the prototypical peroxisome proliferators nafenopin, clofibrate, and WY-14,643. Moreover, using cotransfection assays in which the CAT reporter plasmid contained the CYP4 A6 gene response element rather than the ACO element, it was shown that hPPAR is capable of very efficiently trans-activating a second PPAR response element. These results indicate that the PPAR is present in humans in a form that is functional and can trans-activate response elements derived from two different genes, the rat ACO and the rabbit CYP4A6.

20803142	20100831	Severe congenital neutropenia in a multigenerational family with a novel neutrophil elastase (ELANE) mutation.	We have analysed a family with nine congenital neutropenia patients in four generations, several of which we have studied in a long-term follow-up of over 25 years. The patients were mild to severe neutropenic and suffered from various recurrent bacterial infections. Mutations in the genes ELANE, CSF3R and GFI1 have been reported in patients with autosomal dominant congenital neutropenias. Using a small-scale linkage analysis with markers around the ELANE, CSF3R, CSF3 and GFI1 genes, we were able to determine that the disease segregated with markers around the ELANE gene. We identified a novel mutation in the ELANE gene in all of the affected family members that was not present in any of the healthy family members. The mutation leads to an A28S missense mutation in the mature protein. None of these patients developed leukaemia. This is the first truly multigenerational family with mutations in ELANE as unambiguous cause of severe congenital neutropenia SCN. 	Ann._Hematol.	D016428
15688318	20050203	A novel human G protein-coupled receptor is over-expressed in prostate cancer.	G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are involved in a large variety of physiological functions. The number of known members that belong to this large family of receptors has been rapidly increasing. Now, with the availability of the human genome sequence databases, further family members are being identified. We describe the identification of a novel GPCR that shows no significant amino acid identity to any one of the known members of the GPCR superfamily. The gene expression pattern of this receptor is restricted: in normal tissues it is confined to the nervous system and testis, but we also detected gene expression in several tumor types, most notably prostate cancer, suggesting a potential role for this gene as a marker for this disease.

2216775	19901011	The mechanism of production of multiple mRNAs for human glycophorin A.	The major sialoglycoprotein in the human red cell surface membrane, glycophorin A is encoded by a single gene. However, this gene gives rise to three species of glycophorin A mRNA of sizes about 1.0, 1.7 and 2.8 kilobases in reticulocytes, foetal liver cells and erythroleukaemic K562 cells. In an investigation of how the three mRNAs originated, we showed by primer extension analysis that all three mRNAs in K562 cells had identical 5' termini and, by nucleotide sequencing of correlated cDNAs, that they had identical coding regions, except for the well-known glycophorin AM-AN polymorphism. However, we found also by sequencing the cDNAs that the mRNAs apparently differed from each other in the lengths of their 3' untranslated regions. This was confirmed by Northern blot analysis which also provided evidence that the three mRNAs originated by use of different polyadenylation signals of which seven were found in the longest cDNA we analyzed.

19763142	20090919	Mutational screening of VSX1 in keratoconus patients from the European population.	To perform mutational screening of the visual system homeobox gene 1 (VSX1; MIM#605020) in patients with sporadic and familial keratoconus (MIM#148300) in a European population and, for the first time, report the mutational analysis of the two newly identified VSX1exons. VSX1sequence variants in patients with keratoconus were evaluated by direct sequencing of the entire coding region, including two novel exons. In familial keratoconus cases, segregation of potentially pathogenic VSX1variants was assessed to determine pathogenicity. Transcript analysis was carried out on splice site and synonymous sequence variants not detected in controls. A total of 66 unrelated patients with keratoconus from the European population (27 with familial keratoconus; 39 with sporadic keratoconus) were analysed for VSX1 mutations. Four sequence variants were not observed in 100 healthy control individuals: c.432C&gt;G (p.D144E), c.479G&gt;A (p.G160D), c.789C&gt;T (p.S263S), and an intronic change c.844-13T&gt;A (numbered with respect to NM_014588). Segregation was not detected for p.D144E and c.844-13T&gt;A. The change in p.G160D was observed in two patients with sporadic keratoconus. Although predicted to alter VSX1 splicing, p.S263S had no effect on transcript processing. Four known SNPs were detected and the following polymorphic variants were observed in keratoconus patients and controls: c.711T&gt;A (NM_199425; p.P237P), c.844-5_-6insT (NM_014588), c.*28G&gt;T (DQ854811/DQ854812), and c.*50G&gt;A (DQ854809/DQ854810). VSX1has a minor role in keratoconus pathogenesis. The pathogenicity of p.G160D remains controversial and this change may represent a rare polymorphism or genetic modifier. Further evidence is provided that the previously reported variant, p.D144E, is a polymorphism. 	Eye_(Lond)	D016428 D013485
10369266	19990616	Mutations in the homeodomain of the human SIX3 gene cause holoprosencephaly.	Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a common, severe malformation of the brain that involves separation of the central nervous system into left and right halves. Mild HPE can consist of signs such as a single central incisor, hypotelorism, microcephaly, or other craniofacial findings that can be present with or without associated brain malformations. The aetiology of HPE is extremely heterogeneous, with the proposed participation of a minimum of 12 HPE-associated genetic loci as well as the causal involvement of specific teratogens acting at the earliest stages of neurulation. The HPE2 locus was recently characterized as a 1-Mb interval on human chromosome 2p21 that contained a gene associated with HPE. A minimal critical region was defined by a set of six overlapping deletions and three clustered translocations in HPE patients. We describe here the isolation and characterization of the human homeobox-containing SIX3 gene from the HPE2 minimal critical region (MCR). We show that at least 2 of the HPE-associated translocation breakpoints in 2p21 are less than 200 kb from the 5' end of SIX3. Mutational analysis has identified four different mutations in the homeodomain of SIX3 that are predicted to interfere with transcriptional activation and are associated with HPE. We propose that SIX3 is the HPE2 gene, essential for the development of the anterior neural plate and eye in humans. 	Nat._Genet.	D002363 D016428 D013487
22587682	20120517	A mutation in KIF7 is responsible for the autosomal recessive syndrome of macrocephaly, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia and distinctive facial appearance.	We previously reported the existence of a unique autosomal recessive syndrome consisting of macrocephaly, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia and distinctive facial appearance mapping to chromosome 15q26. In this manuscript, we have used whole exome sequencing on two affected members of a consanguineous family with this condition and carried out detailed bioinformatics analysis to elucidate the causative mutation. Our analysis resulted in the identification of a homozygous p.N1060S missense mutation in a highly conserved residue in KIF7, a regulator of Hedgehog signaling that has been recently found to be causing Joubert syndrome, fetal hydrolethalus and acrocallosal syndromes. The phenotype in our patients partially overlaps with the phenotypes associated with those syndromes but they also exhibit some distinctive features including multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. We report the first missense homozygous disease-causing mutation in KIF7 and expand the clinical spectrum associated with mutations in this gene to include multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. The missense nature of the mutation might account for the unique presentation in our patients. 	Orphanet_J_Rare_Dis	D016428 D052061 D013485
9589637	19980520	Familial dysalbuminemic hypertriiodothyroninemia: a new, dominantly inherited albumin defect.	We report the abnormal albumin in members of a Thai family that presented with high serum total T3 but not T4 when measured by radioimmunoassay. In contrast, total T3 values were very low when measured by ELISA and chemiluminescence. The subjects have no goiter, and clinically euthyroid. Their serum free T4, free T3, and TSH were normal. Spiking of T3 to affected serum showed good recovery by radioimmunoassay, but very poor recovery by ELISA and by chemiluminescence. The immunoprecipitation with labeled T3 bound to albumin showed high percent precipitation in affected serum. T3-binding studies showed that the association constant of serum albumin in affected subjects was 1.5 x 10(6) M-1 or 40-fold that of unaffected relatives of 3.9 x 10(4) M-1. In contrast, the Ka of HSA for T4 in an affected subject was only 1.5-fold that of a normal. Albumin complementary DNA from leukocytes of affected member was amplified and sequenced. We found the second nucleotide of normal codon 66 (CTT), a thymine, was substituted by a cytosine (CCT), resulting in the replacement of the normal leucine by proline. This is the first report of variant albumin causing familial dysalbuminemic hypertriiodothyroninemia. 	J._Clin._Endocrinol._Metab.	D002363 D016428 D013485 D013487
14550283	20031011	Identification of urotensin II-related peptide as the urotensin II-immunoreactive molecule in the rat brain.	Urotensin II (UII) has been reported as the most potent known vasoconstrictor. While rat and mouse orthologs of UII precursor protein have been reported, only the tentative structures of UII peptides of these animals have been demonstrated, since prepro-UII proteins lack typical processing sites for their mature peptides. In the present study, we isolated a novel peptide, UII-related peptide (URP), from the extract of the rat brain as the sole immunoreactive substance to anti-UII antibody; the amino acid sequence of the peptide was determined as ACFWKYCV. cDNAs encoding rat, mouse, and human precursor proteins for URP were cloned and revealed that the sequences of mouse and human URP peptides are the same as that for rat URP. Prepro-URP gene is expressed in several rat tissues such as those of the thymus, spleen, testis, and spinal cord, although with lower levels than the prepro-UII gene. In the human, the prepro-URP gene is expressed comparably to prepro-UII in several tissues except the spinal cord. URP was found to bind and activate the human or rat UII receptors (GPR14) and showed a hypotensive effect when administered to anesthetized rats. These results suggest that URP is the endogenous and functional ligand for UII receptor in the rat and mouse, and possibly in the human. We also describe the preparation of specific monoclonal antibodies raised against UII peptide and the establishment of a highly sensitive enzyme immunoassay system for UII peptides.

2007624	19910401	Human keratinocytes express a new CD44 core protein (CD44E) as a heparan-sulfate intrinsic membrane proteoglycan with additional exons.	We previously identified a 90-kD (GP90), collagen-binding, membrane glycoprotein, termed extracellular matrix receptor III (ECMR III), that is homologous to the lymphocyte homing receptor and CD44 antigen (Gallatin, W. M., E. A. Wayner, P. A. Hoffman, T. St. John, E. C. Butcher, and W. G. Carter. 1989. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 86:4654-4658). CD44 is abundantly expressed in many epithelial tissues, and is localized predominantly to filopodia in cultured keratinocytes. Here we establish CD44 as a polymorphic family of related membrane proteoglycans and glycoproteins possessing extensive diversity in both glycosylation and core protein sequence. Human neonatal foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) and QG56 lung squamous carcinoma cells express an alternatively spliced form of the CD44 core protein (termed CD44E) that contains an additional 132 amino acids in the carbohydrate attachment region of the extracellular domain. HFKs, HT1080 fibrosarcoma and QG56 cells, as well as many other human cells, contain varying ratios of GP90 and structurally related, higher molecular mass forms of CD44 that express the following characteristics: (a) each form reacted with anti-CD44 (mAbs) P1G12, P3H9, and P3H5. Each of these mAbs recognized a distinct, nonoverlapping epitope present on each CD44 form. (b) Differences in mass were due primarily to variation in carbohydrate moieties, including sulfated aspargine-linked glycopeptides (GP), chondroitin sulfate (CS), and heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycans, as well as O-linked mucin and polylactosamine structure(s). The major polymorphic forms were designated HT1080 GP90 and CS180, QG56 GP230, and HFK HS/CS250, based on dominant carbohydrate moieties and relative mass. (c) The polymorphic forms use CD44 and CD44E core proteins, each containing a unique set of potential attachment sites for O- and N-glycosides and glycosaminoglycans. (d) Immunofluorescence microscopy, differential extraction with Triton-X-114 detergent, and incorporation into liposomes indicated that all the forms were membrane bound glycoconjugates. These results define CD44 as a structurally diverse, but immunologically related, set of intrinsic membrane macromolecules, and suggests that these structurally varied forms might be expected to manifest multiple functions.

12672827	20030404	Expression and characterization of human transient receptor potential melastatin 3 (hTRPM3).	Transient receptor potential (TRP) cation-selective channels are an emerging class of proteins that are involved in a variety of important biological functions including pain transduction, thermosensation, mechanoregulation, and vasorelaxation. Utilizing a bioinformatics approach, we have identified the full-length human TRPM3 (hTRPM3) as a member of the TRP family. The hTRPM3 gene is comprised of 24 exons and maps to human chromosome 9q-21.12. hTRPM3 is composed of 1555 amino acids and possesses the characteristic six-transmembrane domain of the TRP family. hTRPM3 is expressed primarily in kidney and, at lesser levels, in brain, testis, and spinal cord as demonstrated by quantitative RT-PCR and Northern blotting. In situ hybridization in human kidney demonstrated that hTRPM3 mRNA expression is predominantly found in the collecting tubular epithelium. Heterologous expression of hTRPM3 in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) showed that hTRPM3 is localized to the cell membrane. hTRPM3-expressing cells exhibited Ca2+ concentration-dependent Ca2+ entry. Depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by lowering extracellular Ca2+ concentration and treatment with the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin or the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol further augmented hTRPM3-mediated Ca2+ entry. The nonselective Ca2+ channel blocker, lanthanide gadolinium (Gd3+), partially inhibited hTRPM3-mediated Ca2+ entry. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that hTRPM3 mediates a Ca2+ entry pathway that apparently is distinct from the endogenous Ca2+ entry pathways present in HEK 293 cells.

21145000	20101215	Exome sequencing reveals VCP mutations as a cause of familial ALS.	Using exome sequencing, we identified a p.R191Q amino acid change in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene in an Italian family with autosomal dominantly inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mutations in VCP have previously been identified in families with Inclusion Body Myopathy, Paget disease, and Frontotemporal Dementia (IBMPFD). Screening of VCP in a cohort of 210 familial ALS cases and 78 autopsy-proven ALS cases identified four additional mutations including a p.R155H mutation in a pathologically proven case of ALS. VCP protein is essential for maturation of ubiquitin-containing autophagosomes, and mutant VCP toxicity is partially mediated through its effect on TDP-43 protein, a major constituent of ubiquitin inclusions that neuropathologically characterize ALS. Our data broaden the phenotype of IBMPFD to include motor neuron degeneration, suggest that VCP mutations may account for ?1%-2% of familial ALS, and provide evidence directly implicating defects in the ubiquitination/protein degradation pathway in motor neuron degeneration.

21156949	20101216	Spectrum and prevalence of FP/TMEM127 gene mutations in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas.	Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are genetically heterogeneous neural crest-derived neoplasms. We recently identified germline mutations of the novel transmembrane-encoding gene FP/TMEM127 in familial and sporadic pheochromocytomas consistent with a tumor suppressor effect. To examine the prevalence and spectrum of FP/TMEM127 mutations in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas and to test the effect of mutations in vitro. We sequenced the FP/TMEM127 gene in 990 individuals with pheochromocytomas and/or paragangliomas, including 898 previously unreported cases without mutations in other susceptibility genes from 8 independent worldwide referral centers between January 2009 and June 2010. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based method was developed to screen for large gene deletions in 545 of these samples. Confocal microscopy of 5 transfected mutant proteins was used to determine their subcellular localization. The frequency and type of FP/TMEM127 mutation or deletion was assessed and correlated with clinical variables; the subcellular localization of 5 overexpressed mutants was compared with wild-type FP/TMEM127 protein. We identified 19 potentially pathogenic FP/TMEM127 germline mutations in 20 independent families, but no large deletions were detected. All mutation carriers had adrenal tumors, including 7 bilateral (P = 2.7 × 10(-4)) and/or with familial disease (5 of 20 samples; P = .005). The median age at disease onset in the FP/TMEM127 mutation group was similar to that of patients without a mutation (41.5 vs 45 years, respectively; P = .54). The most common presentation was that of a single benign adrenal tumor in patients older than 40 years. Malignancy was seen in 1 mutation carrier (5%). Expression of 5 novel FP/TMEM127 mutations in cell lines revealed diffuse localization of the mutant proteins in contrast with the discrete multiorganelle distribution of wild-type TMEM127. Germline mutations of FP/TMEM127 were associated with pheochromocytoma but not paraganglioma and occurred in an age group frequently excluded from genetic screening algorithms. Disease-associated mutations disrupt intracellular distribution of the FP/TMEM127 protein. 	JAMA	D016428 D052061 D013485
7496173	19950901	A new mutation associated with MELAS is located in a mitochondrial DNA polypeptide-coding gene.	We report a patient with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) who harbored a novel missense mutation at mtDNA position 9957 in the gene specifying subunit III of cytochrome c oxidase (COX III). This T--&gt;C transition converted Phe-251, a highly conserved amino acid in the C-terminus of the polypeptide, to Leu. The mutation, which was not present in 107 normal controls or in 57 patients with various mitochondrial diseases, was heteroplasmic in both muscle and blood of the proband and in blood from his asymptomatic mother. These results provide evidence that the MELAS clinical phenotype can be due not only to mutations in mtDNA-encoded tRNA genes, but in polypeptide-coding genes as well. 	Neuromuscul._Disord.

16127461	20050830	Dido gene expression alterations are implicated in the induction of hematological myeloid neoplasms.	The myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPDs) are a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms that share characteristics with chronic myeloproliferative diseases and myelodysplastic syndromes. The broad spectrum of clinical manifestations makes MDS/MPDs extremely difficult to diagnose and treat, with a median survival time of 1-5 years. No single gene defect has been firmly associated with MDS/MPDs, and no animal models have been developed for these diseases. The association of deletions on chromosome 20q with myeloid malignancies suggests the presence of unidentified tumor suppressor genes in this region. Here we show that the recently identified death inducer-obliterator (Dido) gene gives rise to at least 3 polypeptides (Dido1, Dido2, and Dido3) through alternative splicing, and we map the human gene to the long arm of chromosome 20. We found that targeting of murine Dido caused a transplantable disease whose symptoms and signs suggested MDS/MPDs. Furthermore, 100% of human MDS/MPD patients analyzed showed Dido expression abnormalities, which we also found in other myeloid but not lymphoid neoplasms or in healthy donors. Our findings suggest that Dido might be one of the tumor suppressor genes at chromosome 20q and that the Dido-targeted mouse may be a suitable model for studying MDS/MPD diseases and testing new approaches to their diagnosis and treatment.

12906857	20030809	Identification of eight members of the Argonaute family in the human genome.	A number of genes have been identified as members of the Argonaute family in various nonhuman organisms and these genes are considered to play important roles in the development and maintenance of germ-line stem cells. In this study, we identified the human Argonaute family, consisting of eight members. Proteins to be produced from these family members retain a common architecture with the PAZ motif in the middle and Piwi motif in the C-terminal region. Based on the sequence comparison, eight members of the Argonaute family were classified into two subfamilies: the PIWI subfamily (PIWIL1/HIWI, PIWIL2/HILI, PIWIL3, and PIWIL4/HIWI2) and the eIF2C/AGO subfamily (EIF2C1/hAGO1, EIF2C2/hAGO2, EIF2C3/hAGO3, and EIF2C4/hAGO4). PCR analysis using human multitissue cDNA panels indicated that all four members of the PIWI subfamily are expressed mainly in the testis, whereas all four members of the eIF2C/AGO subfamily are expressed in a variety of adult tissues. Immunoprecipitation and affinity binding experiments using human HEK293 cells cotransfected with cDNAs for FLAG-tagged DICER, a member of the ribonuclease III family, and the His-tagged members of the Argonaute family suggested that the proteins from members of both subfamilies are associated with DICER. We postulate that at least some members of the human Argonaute family may be involved in the development and maintenance of stem cells through the RNA-mediated gene-quelling mechanisms associated with DICER.

15384984	20040924	RNA and protein evidence for haplo-insufficiency in Diamond-Blackfan anaemia patients with RPS19 mutations.	The genetic basis of Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (DBA), a congenital erythroid hypoplasia that shows marked clinical heterogeneity, remains obscure. However, the fact that nearly one-quarter of patients harbour a variety of mutations in RPS19, a ribosomal protein gene, provides an opportunity to examine whether haplo-insufficiency of RPS19 protein can be demonstrated in certain cases. To that end, we identified 19 of 81 DBA index cases, both familial and sporadic, with RPS19 mutations. We found 14 distinct insertions, deletions, missense, nonsense and splice site mutations in the 19 probands, and studied mutations in 10 patients at the RNA level and in three patients at the protein level. Characterization of the mutations in 10 probands, including six with novel insertions, nonsense and splice site mutations, showed that the abnormal transcript was detectable in nine cases. The RPS19 mRNA and protein in CD34+ bone marrow cells identified haplo-insufficiency in three cases predicted to have one functional allele. Our data support the notion that, in addition to rare DBA patients with the deletion of one allele, the disease in certain other RPS19 mutant patients is because of RPS19 protein haplo-insufficiency.

8665505	19960615	Mutations of the BRCA2 gene in ovarian carcinomas.	Inherited mutations in the recently discovered BRCA2 gene are believed to be responsible for a significant fraction of early-onset hereditary breast cancers. Unlike BRCA1, however, which confers a high risk to both breast and ovarian cancer, the incidence of ovarian cancer appears to be much lower In BRCA2-linked families, causing uncertainty as to the relevance of BRCA2 to hereditary ovarian cancer. Numerous allelotype studies indicate that allelic deletions Including the BRCA2 locus on chromosome 13q are common in ovarian cancers in general, suggesting that somatic mutations of this gene may be involved in sporadic ovarian tumorigenesis. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that germline or somatic mutations of BRCA2 are associated with hereditary and/or sporadic ovarian cancers, respectively. The entire 10.2-kb coding region of BRCA2 was screened for mutations in 130 consecutive ovarian tumors, the only selection criterion being a pathological diagnosis of epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Loss of heterozygosity at markers flanking BRCA2 was observed in 56% of the tumors. Four germline mutations and two somatic mutations were identified; two of the germline mutations are recurrent, having been previously described. Remarkably, the patients with germline mutations were late-onset cases with no medical or family histories suggestive of hereditary cancer. These data suggest that mutations of BRCA2 are rare in sporadic ovarian cancers, and that the proportion of ovarian cancers resulting from hereditary predisposition may be higher than previously suspected based on estimates derived from studies of highly penetrant genetic loci.

10468986	19990901	A novel mutation in the TPO gene in goitrous hypothyroid patients with iodide organification defect.	To screen and subsequently sequence the TPO gene for mutations in patients with congenital goitre, hypothyroidism and evidence for an organification defect (positive perchlorate discharge test). We have studied seven hypothyroid and congenitally goitrous patients from three unrelated families. We have measured serum thyroid hormone levels, 131I uptake, serum TSH and serum Tg concentrations. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR amplified genomic DNA was used to screen for mutations in the TPO gene. DGGE identified the presence of two frameshift mutations: a GGCC duplication in exon 8 (homozygous in one family and heterozygous in the other family) and a heterozygous insertion of a single nucleotide (C) at position 2505-2511 in exon 14. In addition, we have detected an alteration in exon 11, not yet described in the literature, derived from a single nucleotide substitution of a C to G at position 2008, altering the well-conserved amino acid domain among the peroxidases superfamily. This mutation in exon 11 was present in two families that showed heterozygous mutation for exon 8 or for exon 14. These results could support the hypothesis for a putative compound heterozygosity pattern in the affected patients. The altered phenotype (goitre and hypothyroidism since birth) seems justifiable in view of the possible inactivating character of this novel mutation in exon 11.

20157829	20100217	Heterozygous mutations in SIX3 and SHH are associated with schizencephaly and further expand the clinical spectrum of holoprosencephaly.	Schizencephaly (SCH) is a clinically and etiologically heterogeneous cerebral malformation presenting as unilateral or bilateral hemispheric cleft with direct connection between the inner and outer liquor spaces. The SCH cleft is usually lined by gray matter, which appears polymicrogyric implying an associated impairment of neuronal migration. The majority of SCH patients are sporadic, but familial SCH has been described. An initial report of heterozygous mutations in the homeobox gene EMX2 could not be confirmed in 52 patients investigated in this study in agreement with two independent SCH patient cohorts published previously. SCH frequently occurs with additional cerebral malformations like hypoplasia or aplasia of the septum pellucidum or optic nerve, suggesting the involvement of genes important for the establishment of midline forebrain structures. We therefore considered holoprosencephaly (HPE)-associated genes as potential SCH candidates and report for the first time heterozygous mutations in SIX3 and SHH in a total of three unrelated patients and one fetus with SCH; one of them without obvious associated malformations of midline forebrain structures. Three of these mutations have previously been reported in independent patients with HPE. SIX3 acts directly upstream of SHH, and the SHH pathway is a key regulator of ventral forebrain patterning. Our data indicate that in a subset of patients SCH may develop as one aspect of a more complex malformation of the ventral forebrain, directly result from mutations in the SHH pathway and hence be considered as yet another feature of the broad phenotypic spectrum of holoprosencephaly.

8890755	19961003	Sequencing and expression of the human ALDH8 encoding a new member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family.	The human aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (ALDH) family is characterized by two major conserved DNA sequences encoding residues which are possibly involved in the catalytic function and the maintenance of the functional conformation of the ALDH enzyme. This property is the basis for synthesizing the degenerate primers to clone several cDNAs of the ALDH isozymes. In this report, we describe the cDNA sequence and the expression of a new member of this family, ALDH8. The human ALDH8 gene was identified during the process of the screening for the human ALDH7 genomic clones. Overlapping ALDH8 cDNA clones were isolated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of human salivary gland total RNA or lambda gt11 cDNA library. When the ALDH8 cDNA sequence was aligned with that of the ALDH7 which encodes a polypeptide chain of 468 amino acid (aa) residues, it was found that a termination codon (TGA) is placed in frame at the ALDH8 sequence corresponding to the codon GCG for the seventeenth aa position of the ALDH7. Therefore, the human ALDH8 gene is a potential nonprocessed pseudogene in the ALDH multigene family which has no other pseudogenes reported so far. Alternatively, the ALDH8 gene is a functional gene if the premature stop codon is suppressed, or if the first downstream in-frame ATG serves as the initiator codon. This longest putative open reading frame (ORF) encodes a polypeptide chain of 385 aa residues, includes the two ALDH conserved regions, and demonstrates 86% identity with the corresponding ORF region of the human ALDH7. The expression of the ALDH8 transcripts is restricted to the salivary gland among the human tissues examined. 	Gene	D016428 D013487
9399908	19971218	Isolation and chromosomal localization of a cornea-specific human keratin 12 gene and detection of four mutations in Meesmann corneal epithelial dystrophy.	Keratin 12 (K12) is an intermediate-filament protein expressed specifically in corneal epithelium. Recently, we isolated K12 cDNA from a human corneal epithelial cDNA library and determined its full sequence. Herein, we present the exon-intron boundary structure and chromosomal localization of human K12. In addition, we report four K12 mutations in Meesmann corneal epithelial dystrophy (MCD), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by intraepithelial microcysts and corneal epithelial fragility in which mutations in keratin 3 (K3) and K12 have recently been implicated. In the human K12 gene, we identified seven introns, defining eight individual exons that cover the coding sequence. Together the exons and introns span approximately 6 kb of genomic DNA. Using FISH, we found that the K12 gene mapped to 17q12, where a type I keratin cluster exists. In this study, four new K12 mutations (Arg135Gly, Arg135Ile, Tyr429Asp, and Leu140Arg) were identified in three unrelated MCD pedigrees and in one individual with MCD. All mutations were either in the highly conserved alpha-helix-initiation motif of rod domain 1A or in the alpha-helix-termination motif of rod domain 2B. These sites are essential for keratin filament assembly, suggesting that the mutations described above may be causative for MCD. Of particular interest, one of these mutations (Tyr429Asp), detected in both affected individuals in one of our pedigrees, is the first mutation to be identified within the alpha-helix-termination motif in type I keratin.

11875025	20020305	The human ribosomal protein genes: sequencing and comparative analysis of 73 genes.	The ribosome, as a catalyst for protein synthesis, is universal and essential for all organisms. Here we describe the structure of the genes encoding human ribosomal proteins (RPs) and compare this class of genes among several eukaryotes. Using genomic and full-length cDNA sequences, we characterized 73 RP genes and found that (1) transcription starts at a C residue within a characteristic oligopyrimidine tract; (2) the promoter region is GC rich, but often has a TATA box or similar sequence element; (3) the genes are small (4.4 kb), but have as many as 5.6 exons on average; (4) the initiator ATG is in the first or second exon and is within plus minus 5 bp of the first intron boundaries in about half of cases; and (5) 5'- and 3'-UTRs are significantly smaller (42 bp and 56 bp, respectively) than the genome average. Comparison of RP genes from humans, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed the coding sequences to be highly conserved (63% homology on average), although gene size and the number of exons vary. The positions of the introns are also conserved among these species as follows: 44% of human introns are present at the same position in either D. melanogaster or C. elegans, suggesting RP genes are highly suitable for studying the evolution of introns.

10790215	20000502	Identification of seven novel SNPS (five nucleotide and two amino acid substitutions) in the connexin31 (GJB3) gene.	Connexin31 (GJB3) has been associated with hearing impairment and erythrokeratodermia variabilis. We have analyzed this gene in samples from patients with peripheral neuropathies, deafness and controls and have found several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In the noncoding exon 1 of GJB3 two small deletions, 581del2 and 632del4 (GenBank accession number AF052692), were found at frequencies of 30% and 14%, respectively. In exon 2 we found two amino acid changes, R32W (1227C-T) and V200I (1731G-A), and three nucleotide variants not affecting the amino acid sequence, 1610G-A, 1700C-T and 1931C-T. Most of these changes were found at similar frequencies in patients with deafness, patients with peripheral neuropathies and control subjects. V200I, 1700C-T and 1610G-A were found associated in three unrelated patients with deafness and in a fourth patient with peripheral neuropathy, but were not detected in control subjects. 	Hum._Mutat.

12702275	20030419	A novel mitochondrial DEAD box protein (Mrh4) required for maintenance of mtDNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	In a screen of nuclear genes that assist splicing of mitochondrial localized group II introns in yeast we isolated low-copy number suppressors of splicing and respiratory-deficient point mutants of intron aI5gamma, the last intron of the gene encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunit I. One of the genes found contains the open reading frame (ORF) YGL064c that has previously been proposed to encode a putative RNA helicase of the DEAD box family. Deletion of the ORF gives rise to 100% cytoplasmic petites, indicating that the protein plays an essential role in the mitochondrial RNA metabolism. Overexpression of YGL064c-GFP fusions clearly revealed a mitochondrial localization of the protein. The gene encodes the fourth putative RNA helicase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae implicated in a mitochondrial function and was therefore termed MRH4 (for mitochondrial RNA helicase). 	FEMS_Yeast_Res.

18507830	20080530	Could a defective epithelial sodium channel lead to bronchiectasis.	Bronchiectasis is defined as a permanent dilation of the airways arising from chronic bronchial inflammation/infection. In 50% of cases, no etiology can be identified. Recently, the role of the epithelial sodium channel ENaC has been pointed out in the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis, a disease due to mutations in the CFTR gene and causing bronchiectasis in the airways. Moreover, it was found that transgenic mice overexpressing ENaCbeta present cystic fibrosis-like lung disease symptoms. Our aim was to evaluate if a defective ENaC protein could be involved in the development of bronchiectasis. We extensively analysed ENaCbeta and gamma genes in 55 patients with idiopathic bronchiectasis and without two mutations in the coding regions of CFTR. Thirty-eight patients presented functional abnormalities suggesting impaired sodium transport (abnormal sweat chloride concentration or nasal potential difference measurement), and 17 had no such evidence. Sequencing of the exons and flanking introns of the ENaCbeta and gamma gene identified five different amino-acid changes (p.Ser82Cys, p.Pro369Thr, p.Asn288Ser in ENaCbeta ; and p.Gly183Ser, p.Glu197Lys in ENaCgamma) in heterozygous state in 8 patients. The p.Ser82Cys amino-acid change was found in 3 unrelated patients who were also heterozygous for a CFTR mutation or variant (1 p.F508del, 1 IVS8-5T, and 1 IVS8-5T:1716G&gt;A (p.E528E)). The other mutations were found in patients without CFTR mutation, the p.Glu197Lys mutation in 2 patients and the other variants in single patients. Among the 8 patients bearing an ENaC mutation, 5 had functional abnormalities suggesting impaired sodium transport. Our results suggest that several variants in ENaCbeta and gamma genes might be deleterious for ENaC function and lead to bronchiectasis, especially in patients who are trans-heterozygotes for ENaCbeta/CFTR mutations or variants.

21897748	20110908	A recurrent missense mutation in GJA3 associated with autosomal dominant cataract linked to chromosome 13q.	To map and identify the genetic defect underlying autosomal dominant cataract segregating in a 5-generation Caucasian American family. Genomic DNA was prepared from blood leukocytes, genotyping was performed using microsatellite markers, and logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores were calculated using the LINKAGE programs. Mutation profiling was performed using direct exon cycle-sequencing and restriction fragment analysis. Protein function effects were evaluated using in silico prediction algorithms. Significant evidence of linkage was obtained at marker D13S175 (maximum LOD score [Z(max)]=3.67; maximum recombination fraction [?(max)]=0.04) and D13S1316 (Z(max)=2.80, ?(max)=0.0). Haplotyping indicated that the disease lay in the ~170 Kb physical interval between D13S1316 and D13S175, which contained the gene for gap-junction protein alpha-3 (GJA3) or connexin-46. Sequencing of GJA3 detected a heterozygous transition (c.130G&gt;A) in exon-2 that resulted in gain of an Hsp92 II restriction site. Allele-specific PCR amplification and restriction analysis confirmed that the novel Hsp92 II site co-segregated with cataract in the family but was not detected in 192 normal unrelated individuals. The c.130G&gt;A transition was predicted to result in a non-conservative substitution of valine-to-methionine at codon 44 (p.V44M) with damaging effects on protein function. These data confirm GJA3 as one of the most frequently mutated genes that underlie autosomal dominant cataract in humans, and further emphasize the importance of connexin function in maintaining lens transparency.

9367673	19980212	The human extracellular matrix gene 1 (ECM1): genomic structure, cDNA cloning, expression pattern, and chromosomal localization.	The Ecm1 gene encodes an 85-kDa protein of unknown function that was originally identified as a secretory protein of the murine osteogenic stromal cell line MN7. This paper describes the isolation of a genomic clone containing the human ECM1 gene from a chromosome 1 cosmid library and the characterization of its exon-intron structure. The protein coding region comprises 10 exons. The ECM1 gene maps at chromosome 1q21 outside the epidermal differentiation complex region. The ECM1 gene appears to be expressed as a 1.8-kb transcript predominantly in placenta and heart, while an additional 1.4-kb alternatively spliced message was detected in tonsils. The full-length human ECM1 transcript contains 1838 bp and has an overall homology of 79.6% with the mouse Ecm1 cDNA. This transcript codes for a protein of 540 amino acids that is 69.4% identical and 81.3% similar to the corresponding mouse protein. The alternatively spliced variant, 1450 bp long, encodes a protein of 415 amino acids. 	Genomics	D016428 D013485
19429578	20090512	Surgical management and genetic analysis of a Chinese family with the S171P mutation in the UBIAD1 gene, the gene for Schnyder corneal dystrophy.	To describe the underlying molecular genetic basis, surgical management and phenotypic variation of Schnyder corneal dystrophy (SCD) identified in a four-generation Chinese family. This is an interventional case series of 13 members from a non-consanguineous Chinese family. All patients underwent complete ophthalmological examination and slit-lamp photography. Subsequent corneal transplantations were performed (n = 3). Blood samples were taken for DNA extraction and subsequent genetic analysis. Genotyping indicated linkage to the locus at chromosome 1p36. Screening of the UBIAD1 gene identified a highly conserved mutation, Ser171Pro. Phenotypic variation in this large pedigree is similar to that seen in Caucasian patients. Surgical management of patients with anterior lamellar keratoplasty and deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty showed good visual outcomes. The S171P mutation is described for the first time in a Chinese family. This is the largest non-Caucasian pedigree described with SCD. Visual rehabilitation may be performed successfully with lamellar surgical procedures as opposed to full-thickness corneal grafts. 	Br_J_Ophthalmol	D016428
2154602	19900301	Cloning and sequence analyses of cDNAs for interferon- and virus-induced human Mx proteins reveal that they contain putative guanine nucleotide-binding sites: functional study of the corresponding gene promoter.	The human protein p78 is induced and accumulated in cells treated with type I interferon or with some viruses. It is the human homolog of the mouse Mx protein involved in resistance to influenza virus. A full-length cDNA clone encoding the human p78 protein was cloned and sequenced. It contained an open reading frame of 662 amino acids, corresponding to a polypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of 75,500, in good agreement with the Mr of 78,000 determined on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels for the purified natural p78 protein. The cloned gene was expressed in vitro and corresponded in size, pI, antigenic determinant(s), and NH2 terminus sequence to the natural p78 protein. A second cDNA was cloned which encoded a 633-amino-acid protein sharing 63% homology with human p78. This p78-related protein was translated in reticulocyte lysates where it shared an antigenic determinant(s) with p78. A putative 5' regulatory region of 83 base pairs contained within the gene promoter region upstream of the presumed p78 mRNA cap site conferred human alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) inducibility to the cat reporter gene. The p78 protein accumulated to high levels in cells treated with IFN-alpha. In contrast, the p78-related protein was not expressed at detectable levels. The rate of decay of p78 levels in diploid cells after a 24-h treatment with IFN-alpha was much slower than the rate of decay of the antiviral state against influenza A virus and vesicular stomatitis virus, suggesting that the p78 protein is probably not involved in an antiviral mechanism. Furthermore, we showed that these proteins, as well as the homologous mouse Mx protein, possess three consensus elements in proper spacing, characteristic of GTP-binding proteins. 	J._Virol.

17041588	20061017	CUL4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase interacts with multiple WD40-repeat proteins and regulates histone methylation.	The CUL4-DDB1-ROC1 ubiquitin E3 ligase regulates cell-cycle progression, replication and DNA damage response. However, the substrate-specific adaptors of this ligase remain uncharacterized. Here, we show that CUL4-DDB1 complexes interact with multiple WD40-repeat proteins (WDRs) including TLE1-3, WDR5, L2DTL (also known as CDT2) and the Polycomb-group protein EED (also known as ESC). WDR5 and EED are core components of histone methylation complexes that are essential for histone H3 methylation and epigenetic control at K4 or K9 and K27, respectively, whereas L2DTL regulates CDT1 proteolysis after DNA damage through CUL4-DDB1 (ref. 8). We found that CUL4A-DDB1 interacts with H3 methylated mononucleosomes and peptides. Inactivation of either CUL4 or DDB1 impairs these histone modifications. However, loss of WDR5 specifically affects histone H3 methylation at K4 but not CDT1 degradation, whereas inactivation of L2DTL prevents CDT1 degradation but not histone methylation. Our studies suggest that CUL4-DDB1 ligases use WDR proteins as molecular adaptors for substrate recognition, and modulate multiple biological processes through ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis.

15045028	20040327	Accelerated evolution of the ASPM gene controlling brain size begins prior to human brain expansion.	Primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by global reduction in cerebral cortical volume. The microcephalic brain has a volume comparable to that of early hominids, raising the possibility that some MCPH genes may have been evolutionary targets in the expansion of the cerebral cortex in mammals and especially primates. Mutations in ASPM, which encodes the human homologue of a fly protein essential for spindle function, are the most common known cause of MCPH. Here we have isolated large genomic clones containing the complete ASPM gene, including promoter regions and introns, from chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and rhesus macaque by transformation-associated recombination cloning in yeast. We have sequenced these clones and show that whereas much of the sequence of ASPM is substantially conserved among primates, specific segments are subject to high Ka/Ks ratios (nonsynonymous/synonymous DNA changes) consistent with strong positive selection for evolutionary change. The ASPM gene sequence shows accelerated evolution in the African hominoid clade, and this precedes hominid brain expansion by several million years. Gorilla and human lineages show particularly accelerated evolution in the IQ domain of ASPM. Moreover, ASPM regions under positive selection in primates are also the most highly diverged regions between primates and nonprimate mammals. We report the first direct application of TAR cloning technology to the study of human evolution. Our data suggest that evolutionary selection of specific segments of the ASPM sequence strongly relates to differences in cerebral cortical size. 	PLoS_Biol.	D016428
19745106	20090912	Analysis of TSHZ2 and TSHZ3 genes in congenital pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction.	Congenital pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction (PUJO) affects 0.3% of human births. It may result from aberrant smooth muscle development in the renal pelvis, resulting in hydronephrosis. Mice that are null mutant for the Teashirt3 (Tshz3) gene exhibit congenital PUJO with defective smooth muscle differentiation and absent peristalsis in the proximal ureter. Given the phenotype of Tshz3 mutant mice, we considered that Teashirt genes, which code for a family of transcription factors, might represent candidate genes for human PUJO. To evaluate this possibility, we used in situ hydridization to analyse the three mammalian Tshz genes in mouse embryonic ureters and determined whether TSHZ3 was expressed in the human embryonic ureter. TSHZ2 and TSHZ3 were sequenced in index cases with non-syndromic PUJO. Tshz2 and Tshz3 genes were detected in mouse ureters and TSHZ3 was expressed in the human embryonic renal pelvis. Direct sequencing of TSHZ2 and TSHZ3 did not identify any mutations in an initial cohort of 48 PUJO index cases, excluding these genes as a major cause of this condition. A polymorphic missense change (E469G) in TSHZ3 was identified at a residue highly conserved throughout evolution in all Teashirt proteins, although subsequently no significant difference between the E469G allele frequency in Albanian and Macedonian PUJO index cases (3.2%) versus 633 control individuals (1.7%) was found (P = 0.18). Mutations in TSHZ2 and TSHZ3 are not a major cause of PUJO, at least in Albanian and Macedonian populations. Expression of these genes in the human fetal ureter emphasizes the importance of analysing these genes in other groups of patients with renal tract malformations. 	Nephrol._Dial._Transplant.	D016428
11717165	20011122	The complete gene sequence of titin, expression of an unusual approximately 700-kDa titin isoform, and its interaction with obscurin identify a novel Z-line to I-band linking system.	Titin is a giant vertebrate striated muscle protein with critical importance for myofibril elasticity and structural integrity. We show here that the complete sequence of the human titin gene contains 363 exons, which together code for 38 138 residues (4200 kDa). In its central I-band region, 47 novel PEVK exons were found, which contribute to titin's extensible spring properties. Additionally, 3 unique I-band titin exons were identified (named novex-1 to -3). Novex-3 functions as an alternative titin C-terminus. The novex-3 titin isoform is approximately 700 kDa in size and spans from Z1-Z2 (titin's N-terminus) to novex-3 (C-terminal exon). Novex-3 titin specifically interacts with obscurin, a 721-kDa myofibrillar protein composed of 57 Ig/FN3 domains, followed by one IQ, SH3, DH, and a PH domain at its C-terminus. The obscurin domains Ig48/Ig49 bind to novex-3 titin and target to the Z-line region when expressed as a GFP fusion protein in live cardiac myocytes. Immunoelectron microscopy detected the C-terminal Ig48/Ig49 obscurin epitope near the Z-line edge. The distance from the Z-line varied with sarcomere length, suggesting that the novex-3 titin/obscurin complex forms an elastic Z-disc to I-band linking system. This system could link together calcium-dependent, SH3-, and GTPase-regulated signaling pathways in close proximity to the Z-disc, a structure increasingly implicated in the restructuring of sarcomeres during cardiomyopathies.

9131652	19970301	A novel SOD1 mutation in an Austrian family with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	We report on an Austrian pedigree with autosomal dominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), diagnosed in six patients from two generations. The only surviving clinically affected family member was examined in our ALS clinic. Historical information on other affected individuals was obtained from knowledgeable family members. The mean +/- S.D. age of onset of the disease was 54 +/- 6.9 years, with a range of 43-66 years. The duration of the index patient's disease until death was 8 months. Using single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, we studied the index patient's exons 1, 2 and 4 of the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase gene (SOD1) on chromosome 21. A variant banding pattern was observed for exon 1. Sequencing studies showed a previously undescribed T to A missense mutation at position 8 in exon 1 of the SOD1 gene. This mutation results in the elimination of an Eco57I restriction site. Whereas the index patient was heterozygous for this restriction site, 50 unrelated healthy controls and an unaffected brother were not. The mutation lies in a region involved in dimer contact in the three-dimensional structure of the SOD1 protein. This region comprises other known sites for ALS-causing mutations.

12747765	20030516	Humoral immunity to human breast cancer: antigen definition and quantitative analysis of mRNA expression.	The ability of the immune system to recognize structurally altered, amplified or aberrantly expressed proteins can be used to identify molecules of etiologic relevance to cancer and to define targets for cancer immunotherapy. In the current study, ninety-four distinct antigens reactive with serum IgG from breast cancer patients were identified by immunoscreening breast cancer-derived cDNA expression libraries (SEREX). A serological profile was generated for each antigen on the basis of reactivity with allogeneic sera from normal individuals and cancer patients, and mRNA expression profiles for coding sequences were assembled based upon the tissue distribution of expressed sequence tags, Northern blots and real-time RT-PCR. Forty antigens reacted exclusively with sera from cancer patients. These included well-characterized tumor antigens, e.g. MAGE-3, MAGE-6, NY-ESO-1, Her2neu and p53, as well as newly-defined breast cancer antigens, e.g. kinesin 2, TATA element modulatory factor 1, tumor protein D52 and MAGE D, and novel gene products, e.g. NY-BR-62, NY-BR-75, NY-BR-85, and NY-BR-96. With regard to expression profiles, two of the novel gene products, NY-BR-62 and NY-BR-85, were characterized by a high level of testicular mRNA expression, and were overexpressed in 60% and 90% of breast cancers, respectively. In addition, mRNA encoding tumor protein D52 was overexpressed in 60% of breast cancer specimens, while transcripts encoding SNT-1 signal adaptor protein were downregulated in 70% of these cases. This study adds to the growing list of breast cancer antigens defined by SEREX and to the ultimate objective of identifying the complete repertoire of immunogenic gene products in human cancer (the cancer immunome).

22892528	20120816	Missense mutation in the ATPase, aminophospholipid transporter protein ATP8A2 is associated with cerebellar atrophy and quadrupedal locomotion.	Cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation and dysequilibrium syndrome is a rare and heterogeneous condition. We investigated a consanguineous family from Turkey with four affected individuals exhibiting the condition. Homozygosity mapping revealed that several shared homozygous regions, including chromosome 13q12. Targeted next-generation sequencing of an affected individual followed by segregation analysis, population screening and prediction approaches revealed a novel missense variant, p.I376M, in ATP8A2. The mutation lies in a highly conserved C-terminal transmembrane region of E1 E2 ATPase domain. The ATP8A2 gene is mainly expressed in brain and development, in particular cerebellum. Interestingly, an unrelated individual has been identified, in whom mental retardation and severe hypotonia is associated with a de novo t(10;13) balanced translocation resulting with the disruption of ATP8A2. These findings suggest that ATP8A2 is involved in the development of the cerebro-cerebellar structures required for posture and gait in humans. 	Eur._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013485
10581027	19991202	Loss-of-function mutations in the cathepsin C gene result in periodontal disease and palmoplantar keratosis.	Papillon-Lefèvre syndrome, or keratosis palmoplantaris with periodontopathia (PLS, MIM 245000), is an autosomal recessive disorder that is mainly ascertained by dentists because of the severe periodontitis that afflicts patients. Both the deciduous and permanent dentitions are affected, resulting in premature tooth loss. Palmoplantar keratosis, varying from mild psoriasiform scaly skin to overt hyperkeratosis, typically develops within the first three years of life. Keratosis also affects other sites such as elbows and knees. Most PLS patients display both periodontitis and hyperkeratosis. Some patients have only palmoplantar keratosis or periodontitis, and in rare individuals the periodontitis is mild and of late onset. The PLS locus has been mapped to chromosome 11q14-q21 (refs 7, 8, 9). Using homozygosity mapping in eight small consanguineous families, we have narrowed the candidate region to a 1.2-cM interval between D11S4082 and D11S931. The gene (CTSC) encoding the lysosomal protease cathepsin C (or dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I) lies within this interval. We defined the genomic structure of CTSC and found mutations in all eight families. In two of these families we used a functional assay to demonstrate an almost total loss of cathepsin C activity in PLS patients and reduced activity in obligate carriers. 	Nat._Genet.

12972431	20030916	Novel cadherin-related membrane proteins, Alcadeins, enhance the X11-like protein-mediated stabilization of amyloid beta-protein precursor metabolism.	Previously we found that X11-like protein (X11L) associates with amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP). X11L stabilizes APP metabolism and suppresses the secretion of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) that are the pathogenic agents of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we found that Alcadein (Alc), a novel membrane protein family that contains cadherin motifs and originally reported as calsyntenins, also interacted with X11L. Alc was abundant in the brain and occurred in the same areas of the brain as X11L. X11L could simultaneously associate with APP and Alc, resulting in the formation of a tripartite complex in brain. The tripartite complex stabilized intracellular APP metabolism and enhanced the X11L-mediated suppression of Abeta secretion that is due to the retardation of intracellular APP maturation. X11L and Alc also formed another complex with C99, a carboxyl-terminal fragment of APP cleaved at the beta-site (CTFbeta). The formation of the Alc.X11L.C99 complex inhibited the interaction of C99 with presenilin, which strongly suppressed the gamma-cleavage of C99. In AD patient brains, Alc and APP were particularly colocalized in dystrophic neurites in senile plaques. Deficiencies in the X11L-mediated interaction between Alc and APP and/or CTFbeta enhanced the production of Abeta, which may be related to the development or progression of AD. 	J._Biol._Chem.

20725928	20100821	Missense mutations in the AFG3L2 proteolytic domain account for ?1.5% of European autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias.	Spinocerebellar ataxia type 28 is an autosomal dominant form of cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) caused by mutations in AFG3L2, a gene that encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial m-AAA protease. We screened 366 primarily Caucasian ADCA families, negative for the most common triplet expansions, for point mutations in AFG3L2 using DHPLC. Whole-gene deletions were excluded in 300 of the patients, and duplications were excluded in 129 patients. We found six missense mutations in nine unrelated index cases (9/366, 2.6%): c.1961C&gt;T (p.Thr654Ile) in exon 15, c.1996A&gt;G (p.Met666Val), c.1997T&gt;G (p.Met666Arg), c.1997T&gt;C (p.Met666Thr), c.2011G&gt;A (p.Gly671Arg), and c.2012G&gt;A (p.Gly671Glu) in exon 16. All mutated amino acids were located in the C-terminal proteolytic domain. In available cases, we demonstrated the mutations segregated with the disease. Mutated amino acids are highly conserved, and bioinformatic analysis indicates the substitutions are likely deleterious. This investigation demonstrates that SCA28 accounts for ?3% of ADCA Caucasian cases negative for triplet expansions and, in extenso, to ?1.5% of all ADCA. We further confirm both the involvement of AFG3L2 gene in SCA28 and the presence of a mutational hotspot in exons 15-16. Screening for SCA28, is warranted in patients who test negative for more common SCAs and present with a slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia accompanied by oculomotor signs. 	Hum._Mutat.

8161368	19931125	Heterogeneity of mutations in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD): screening and identification of affected E1 alpha and E1 beta subunits of the branched-chain alpha-keto-acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complex.	Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a deficiency in subunits of the branched-chain alpha-keto-acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDH). To characterize the mutations present in five patients with MSUD (four classic and one intermediate), three-step analyses were established: (1), identification of the involved subunit by complementation analysis using three different cell lines derived from homozygotes having E1 alpha, E1 beta or the E2 mutant gene; (2), screening for a mutation site in cDNA of the corresponding subunit by RT-PCR-SSCP and (3), mutant analysis by sequencing the amplified cDNA fragment. Four single-base missense mutations, R115W, Q146K [corrected], A209T and I282T, were detected in the E1 alpha subunit. A single-base missense mutation H156R and three frame-shift mutations to generate stop codons downstream, including an 11-bp deletion of the tandem repeat in exon 1, a single-base (T) deletion and a single-base (G) insertion, were identified in the E1 beta subunit gene. All except one (11-bp deletion in E1 beta (Nobukuni, Y., Mitsubuchi, H., Akaboshi, I., Indo, Y., Endo, F., Yoshioka, A. and Matsuda, I. (1991) J. Clin. Invest. 87, 1862-1866)) were novel mutations. The sites of amino-acid substitution were all conserved in other species. Thus, mutations causing MSUD are heterogenous. 	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D013485
1946412	19911101	Genetic variants of serum albumin in Americans and Japanese.	A collaborative search for albumin genetic variants (alloalbumins) was undertaken by cellulose acetate and agarose electrophoresis at pH 8.6 of the sera of patients at two major medical centers in the United States and of nearly 20,000 blood donors in Japan. Seventeen instances of alloalbuminemia were ascertained, and seven different alloalbumin types were characterized by structural study. Two previously unreported alloalbumin types were identified. In one type, which was present in a Caucasian family and designated Iowa City-1, aspartic acid at position 365 was replaced by valine (365 Asp----Val); this is the second reported mutation at this position. The other type present in a Japanese blood donor had the mutation 128 His----Arg. An unexpected finding was the presence in a single Japanese of a Naskapi-type alloalbumin (372 Lys----Glu), a variant that had previously been described only for certain Amerindian tribes in whom it occurs with a polymorphic frequency (greater than 1%) and in Eti Turks. An arginyl-albumin (-1 Arg, 1 Asp----Val) occurred in an American family. The other alloalbumin types identified were proalbumins Lille and Christchurch and albumin B that have a cumulative frequency of about 1:3500 in Caucasians probably because of the hypermutability of CpG dinucleotides at the mutated sites. All of the variants characterized in this study are point mutants, and the sites are spread throughout the albumin gene. However, about one-fourth of all known albumin mutations are clustered in the sequence segment from position 354 through 382. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D003160 D016428 D013487
12740395	20030513	M phase phosphoprotein 1 is a human plus-end-directed kinesin-related protein required for cytokinesis.	The human M phase phosphoprotein 1 (MPP1), previously identified through a screening of a subset of proteins specifically phosphorylated at the G2/M transition (Matsumoto-Taniura, N., Pirollet, F., Monroe, R., Gerace, L., and Westendorf, J. M. (1996) Mol. Biol. Cell 7, 1455-1469), is characterized as a plus-end-directed kinesin-related protein. Recombinant MPP1 exhibits in vitro microtubule-binding and microtubule-bundling properties as well as microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity. In gliding experiments using polarity-marked microtubules, MPP1 is a slow molecular motor that moves toward the microtubule plus-end at a 0.07 microm/s speed. In cycling cells, MPP1 localizes mainly to the nuclei in interphase. During mitosis, MPP1 is diffuse throughout the cytoplasm in metaphase and subsequently localizes to the midzone to further concentrate on the midbody. MPP1 suppression by RNA interference induces failure of cell division late in cytokinesis. We conclude that MPP1 is a new mitotic molecular motor required for completion of cytokinesis.

25558065	20150106	Accelerating novel candidate gene discovery in neurogenetic disorders via whole-exome sequencing of prescreened multiplex consanguineous families.	Our knowledge of disease genes in neurological disorders is incomplete. With the aim of closing this gap, we performed whole-exome sequencing on 143 multiplex consanguineous families in whom known disease genes had been excluded by autozygosity mapping and candidate gene analysis. This prescreening step led to the identification of 69 recessive genes not previously associated with disease, of which 33 are here described (SPDL1, TUBA3E, INO80, NID1, TSEN15, DMBX1, CLHC1, C12orf4, WDR93, ST7, MATN4, SEC24D, PCDHB4, PTPN23, TAF6, TBCK, FAM177A1, KIAA1109, MTSS1L, XIRP1, KCTD3, CHAF1B, ARV1, ISCA2, PTRH2, GEMIN4, MYOCD, PDPR, DPH1, NUP107, TMEM92, EPB41L4A, and FAM120AOS). We also encountered instances in which the phenotype departed significantly from the established clinical presentation of a known disease gene. Overall, a likely causal mutation was identified in &gt;73% of our cases. This study contributes to the global effort toward a full compendium of disease genes affecting brain function.

9373237	19971231	Fusion of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta to a novel gene CEV14 in acute myelogenous leukemia after clonal evolution.	Chromosomal translocations involving band 5q31-35 occur in several hematologic disorders. A clone with a t(5; 14)(q33; q32) translocation appeared at the relapse phase in a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia who exhibited a sole chromosomal translocation, t(7; 11), at initial diagnosis. After the appearance of this clone, the leukemia progressed with marked eosinophilia, and combination chemotherapy was ineffective. Southern blot analysis showed a rearrangement of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRbeta) gene at 5q33 which was not observed at initial diagnosis. This translocation resulted in a chimeric transcript fusing the PDGFRbeta gene on 5q33 with a novel gene, CEV14, located at 14q32. Expression of the 5' region of the PDGFRbeta cDNA, upstream of the breakpoint, was not detected. However, the 3' region of PDGFRbeta, which was transcribed as part of the CEV14-PDGFRbeta fusion gene, was detected. A partial cDNA for a novel gene, CEV14, includes a leucine zipper motif and putative thyroid hormone receptor interacting domain and is expressed in a wide range of tissues. The expression of a CEV14-PDGFRbeta fusion gene in association with aggressive leukemia progression suggests that this protein has oncogenic potential. 	Blood	D016428
12628722	20030312	A novel missense mutation in the myosin binding protein-C gene is responsible for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular dysfunction and dilation in elderly patients.	We studied the clinical features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) caused by a novel mutation in the myosin binding protein-C (MyBP-C) gene in patients and family members of Japanese descent. Previous reports have demonstrated that the clinical features of HCM associated with mutations in the MyBP-C gene include late onset and a favorable clinical course. Recently, some mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins have been reported to be a cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), as well as HCM. However, mutations of the MyBP-C gene have not been reported as a cause of DCM up to now. We analyzed MyBP-C gene mutations in 250 unrelated probands with HCM and in 90 with DCM. We used electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography to determine clinical phenotypes. We identified 17 individuals in 8 families (7 HCM, 1 DCM) with an Arg820Gln mutation in the MyBP-C gene. Overall, 2 (40%) of 5 carriers age &gt;70 years displayed &quot;burnt-out&quot; phase HCM, and one of them had been diagnosed as having DCM before genetic identification. The disease penetrance in subjects age &gt;50 years was 70% by echocardiography and 100% by ECG, and that in those age &lt;50 years was 40% and 50%, respectively. Elderly patients with Arg820Gln mutation may show &quot;burnt-out&quot; phase HCM, and patients with this mutation may be included among those diagnosed as having DCM. Screening of patients with DCM, as well as HCM, for this mutation is of significant importance because patients with this mutation may be diagnosed clinically as having DCM. 	J._Am._Coll._Cardiol.

8577393	19951027	A mutation in codon 717 of the amyloid precursor protein gene in an Australian family with Alzheimer's disease.	DNA from the probands of seven Australian families with hereditary Alzheimer's disease was screened for the presence of known mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene on chromosome 21 using single stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis [14]. One subject was found to have a mutation causing a Val--&gt;Ile substitution at position 717. This was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. The mutation has been found in both the other affected family members available for study and in two at-risk relatives. It was not present in the only living unaffected relative who has passed the usual age of onset in this family. There is so far no evidence that apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype influences age of onset in this family, though numbers are small. Two other families with autopsy confirmation and age of onset in the fifth decade had no APP mutation and are thought likely to have a mutation on chromosome 14 on the basis of their earlier onset age.

11925379	20020402	A human homologue of mouse Mater, a maternal effect gene essential for early embryonic development.	Mater is a maternal effect gene required for early embryonic development in mice, and its protein serves as an autoantigen in a mouse model of autoimmune premature ovarian failure. Human MATER cDNA was cloned by PCR techniques. The mRNA and protein were determined using hybridization and immunodetection respectively. The cDNA and protein sequences were analysed using bioinformatics software. Human MATER gene spans a approximately 63 kbp DNA at chromosome 19 and is composed of 15 exons and 14 introns. Expression of its mRNA (approximately 4.2 kb) is restricted to the oocytes. Human MATER cDNA (3885 nt) shows an open reading frame (3600 nt) encoding a polypeptide chain composed of 1200 residues with a predicted molecular mass of 134 236 Da. MATER protein (approximately 134 kDa) was detected in human oocytes. The human and mouse cDNA share 67% homology while their deduced polypeptide chains have 53% identity of amino acids. Also, their protein structures have a number of similar features. The human MATER and mouse Mater genes and proteins are conserved. Characterization of the human MATER and its protein provides a basis for investigating their clinical implications in autoimmune premature ovarian failure and infertility in women. 	Hum._Reprod.

12036297	20020531	Nineteen additional unpredicted transcripts from human chromosome 21.	The identification of all human chromosome 21 (HC21) genes is a necessary step in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). The first analysis of the sequence of 21q included 127 previously characterized genes and predicted an additional 98 novel anonymous genes. Recently we evaluated the quality of this annotation by characterizing a set of HC21 open reading frames (C21orfs) identified by mapping spliced expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and predicted genes (PREDs), identified only in silico. This study underscored the limitations of in silico-only gene prediction, as many PREDs were incorrectly predicted. To refine the HC21 annotation, we have developed a reliable algorithm to extract and stringently map sequences that contain bona fide 3' transcript ends to the genome. We then created a specific 21q graphical display allowing an integrated view of the data that incorporates new ESTs as well as features such as CpG islands, repeats, and gene predictions. Using these tools we identified 27 new putative genes. To validate these, we sequenced previously cloned cDNAs and carried out RT-PCR, 5'- and 3'-RACE procedures, and comparative mapping. These approaches substantiated 19 new transcripts, thus increasing the HC21 gene count by 9.5%. These transcripts were likely not previously identified because they are small and encode small proteins. We also identified four transcriptional units that are spliced but contain no obvious open reading frame. The HC21 data presented here further emphasize that current gene prediction algorithms miss a substantial number of transcripts that nevertheless can be identified using a combination of experimental approaches and multiple refined algorithms.

14732481	20040121	Hypobetalipoproteinemia with an apparently recessive inheritance due to a &quot;de novo&quot; mutation of apolipoprotein B.	Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL) is a co-dominant disorder either linked or not linked to apolipoprotein (apo) B gene. Abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) is a recessive disorder due to mutations of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) gene. We investigated a patient with apparently recessive hypobetalipoproteinemia consistent with symptomatic heterozygous FHBL or a &quot;mild&quot; form of ABL. The proband had fatty liver associated with LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and apo B levels &lt;5th percentile but no truncated apo B forms detectable in plasma. MTP gene sequence revealed that he was a carrier of the I128T polymorphism and an unreported amino acid substitution (V168I) unlikely to be the cause of hypobetalipoproteinemia. Apo B gene sequence showed that he was heterozygous for two single base substitutions in exon 9 and 22 resulting in a nonsense (Q294X) and a missense (R1101H) mutation, respectively. Neither of his parents carried the Q294X; his father and paternal grandmother carried the R1101H mutation. Analysis of polymorphic genetic markers excluded non-paternity. In conclusion, the proband has a &quot;de novo&quot; mutation of apo B gene resulting in a short truncated apo B form (apo B-6.46). Sporadic cases of FHBL with an apparently recessive transmission may be caused by &quot;de novo&quot; mutations of apo B gene. 	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D003160 D016428 D013485
7789512	19950605	Primary structures of two homologous subunits of PA28, a gamma-interferon-inducible protein activator of the 20S proteasome.	The primary structures of two proteins that comprise PA28, an activator of the 20S proteasome, have been determined by cDNA cloning and sequencing. These protein subunits, termed PA28 alpha and PA28 beta, are about 50% identical to one another and are highly conserved between rat and human. PA28 alpha and PA28 beta are homologous to a previously described protein, Ki antigen, whose function is unknown. PA28 alpha, but neither PA28 beta nor Ki antigen, contains a 'KEKE motif', which has been postulated to promote the binding of proteins having this structural feature. PA28 alpha and PA28 beta were coordinately regulated by gamma-interferon, which greatly induced mRNA levels of both proteins in cultured cells. The mRNA level of the Ki antigen also increased in response to gamma-interferon treatment, but the magnitude of the increase was less than that for the PA28s, and the effect was transient. These results demonstrate the existence of a new protein family, at least two of whose members are involved in proteasome activation. They also provide the basis for future structure/function studies of PA28 subunits and the determination of their relative physiological roles in the regulation of proteasome activity. 	FEBS_Lett.

Vascular endothelial cells (EC) play a key role in a variety of pathophysiologic processes, such as angiogenesis, inflammation, cancer metastasis, and vascular diseases. As part of a strategy to identify all genes expressed in human EC, a full-length cDNA encoding a potential secreted protein harboring 10 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and one CUB domain at the carboxyl terminus (termed, SCUBE1 for Signal peptide-CUB-EGF-like domain containing protein 1) was identified. SCUBE1 shares homology with several protein families, including members of the fibrillin and Notch families, and the anticoagulant proteins, thrombomodulin and protein C. SCUBE1 mRNA is found in several highly vascularized tissues such as liver, kidney, lung, spleen, and brain and is selectively expressed in EC by in situ hybridization. SCUBE1 is a secreted glycoprotein that can form oligomers and manifests a stable association with the cell surface. A second gene encoding a homologue (designated SCUBE2) was also identified and is expressed in EC as well as other cell types. SCUBE2 is also a cell-surface protein and can form a heteromeric complex with SCUBE1. Both SCUBE1 and SCUBE2 are rapidly down-regulated in EC after interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment in vitro and after lipopolysaccharide injection in vivo. Thus, SCUBE1 and SCUBE2 define an emerging family of human secreted proteins that are expressed in vascular endothelium and may play important roles in development, inflammation, and thrombosis.

12565913	20030205	Principal mutation hotspot for central core disease and related myopathies in the C-terminal transmembrane region of the RYR1 gene.	The congenital myopathies are a group of disorders characterised by the predominance of specific histological features observed in biopsied muscle. Central core disease and nemaline myopathy are examples of congenital myopathies that have specific histological characteristics but significantly overlapping clinical pictures. Central core disease is an autosomal dominant disorder with variable penetrance which has been linked principally to the gene for the skeletal muscle calcium release channel (RYR1). Two recent reports have identified the 3' transmembrane domain of this gene as a common site for mutations. Two other studies have reported single families that have features of both central core disease and nemaline myopathy (core/rod disease) caused by mutations in RYR1. Screening of the 3' region (exons 93-105) of the RYR1 gene for mutations in 27 apparently unrelated patients with either central core disease or core/rod disease by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing identified three described and nine novel mutations in 15 patients.

10388558	19990702	Comparative sequence analysis of the complete human sarcomeric myosin heavy chain family: implications for functional diversity.	The conventional myosin motor proteins that drive mammalian skeletal and cardiac muscle contraction include eight sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms. Six skeletal MyHCs are encoded by genes found in tightly linked clusters on human and mouse chromosomes 17 and 11, respectively. The full coding regions of only two out of six mammalian skeletal MyHCs had been sequenced prior to this work. In an effort to assess the extent of sequence diversity within the human MyHC family we present new full-length coding sequences corresponding to four additional human genes: MyHC-IIb, MyHC-extraocular, MyHC-IIa and MyHC-IIx/d. This represents the first opportunity to compare the full coding sequences of all eight sarcomeric MyHC isoforms within a vertebrate organism. Sequence variability has been analyzed in the context of available structure/function data with an emphasis on potential functional diversity within the family. Results indicate that functional diversity among MyHCs is likely to be accomplished by having small pockets of sequence diversity in an otherwise highly conserved molecule. 	J._Mol._Biol.

1448173	19921203	Molecular cloning of ICAM-3, a third ligand for LFA-1, constitutively expressed on resting leukocytes.	The co-ordinated function of effector and accessory cells in the immune system is assisted by adhesion molecules on the cell surface that stabilize interactions between different cell types. Leukocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) is expressed on the surface of all white blood cells and is a receptor for intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM) 1 and 2 (ref. 3) which are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The interaction of LFA-1 with ICAMs 1 and 2 provides essential accessory adhesion signals in many immune interactions, including those between T and B lymphocytes and cytotoxic T cells and their targets. In addition, both ICAMs are expressed at low levels on resting vascular endothelium; ICAM-1 is strongly upregulated by cytokine stimulation and plays a key role in the arrest of leukocytes in blood vessels at sites of inflammation and injury. Recent work has indicated that resting leukocytes express a third ligand, ICAM-3, for LFA-1 (refs 11, 12). ICAM-3 is potentially the most important ligand for LFA-1 in the initiation of the immune response because the expression of ICAM-1 on resting leukocytes is low. We report the expression cloning of a complementary DNA, pICAM-3, encoding a protein constitutively expressed on all leukocytes, which binds LFA-1. ICAM-3 is closely related to ICAM-1, consists of five immunoglobulin domains, and binds LFA-1 through its two N-terminal domains. 	Nature	D003160 D016428 D013485

11781695	20020110	An mtDNA mutation, 14453G--&gt;A, in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 associated with severe MELAS syndrome.	We report a novel point mutation in the gene for the mitochondrially encoded ND6 subunit of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I of the respiratory chain) in a patient with MELAS syndrome. The mutation causes a change from alanine to valine in the most conserved region of the ND6 subunit. The patient was heteroplasmic for the mutation in both muscle and blood, but the mutation was not detected in the patient's mother. A marked reduction of complex I activity was found in the patient's muscular tissue. This is the first report of a mutation in the ND6 subunit causing MELAS. Our data confirm the genetic heterogeneity in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes syndrome, and confirms that MELAS can be caused by mutation in polypeptide-coding mtDNA genes.

9662398	19980714	Total colourblindness is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the cone photoreceptor cGMP-gated cation channel.	Total colourblindness (OMIM 216900), also referred to as rod monochromacy (RM) or complete achromatopsia, is a rare, autosomal recessive inherited and congenital disorder characterized by photophobia, reduced visual acuity, nystagmus and the complete inability to discriminate between colours. Electroretinographic recordings show that in RM, rod photoreceptor function is normal, whereas cone photoreceptor responses are absent. The locus for RM has been mapped to chromosome 2q11 (ref. 2), however the gene underlying RM has not yet been identified. Recently, a suitable candidate gene, CNGA3, encoding the alpha-subunit of the cone photoreceptor cGMP-gated cation channel, a key component of the phototransduction pathway, has been cloned and assigned to human chromosome 2q11 (refs 3,4). We report the identification of missense mutations in CNGA3 in five families with RM. Homozygous mutations are present in two families, whereas the remaining families show compound heterozygous mutations. In all cases, the segregation pattern of the mutations is consistent with the autosomal recessive inheritance of the disease and all mutations affect amino acids that are highly conserved among cyclic nucleotide gated channels (CNG) in various species. This is the first report of a colour vision disorder caused by defects other than mutations in the cone pigment genes, and implies at least in this instance a common genetic basis for phototransduction in the three different cone photoreceptors of the human retina.

11587540	20011006	How does a g993t mutation in the emerin gene cause Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy?	X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is usually caused by absence of the nuclear membrane protein, emerin, due to nonsense mutations or deletions, but a few missense mutations also exist. A pathogenic g993t mutation causes a Q133H change in the nuclear targeting region of emerin, but it may also reduce emerin levels by affecting mRNA splicing. We have introduced the g993t mutation by in vitro mutagenesis and studied the effect of Q133H on nuclear targeting by transfection of COS-7 cells. No qualitative or quantitative differences in nuclear targeting were observed between normal and mutant emerin. Quantitative BIAcore analysis showed no significant change in lamin A binding to emerin when the mutation was present. We conclude that Q133 is not essential for nuclear targeting of emerin or its interaction with lamin A. Reduced emerin levels due to altered splicing or defective interaction with an unidentified binding partner remain possible pathogenic mechanisms. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.	D016428 D013485
19118815	20090103	Infection-triggered familial or recurrent cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy caused by mutations in a component of the nuclear pore, RANBP2.	Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) is a rapidly progressive encephalopathy that can occur in otherwise healthy children after common viral infections such as influenza and parainfluenza. Most ANE is sporadic and nonrecurrent (isolated ANE). However, we identified a 7 Mb interval containing a susceptibility locus (ANE1) in a family segregating recurrent ANE as an incompletely penetrant, autosomal-dominant trait. We now report that all affected individuals and obligate carriers in this family are heterozygous for a missense mutation (c.1880C--&gt;T, p.Thr585Met) in the gene encoding the nuclear pore protein Ran Binding Protein 2 (RANBP2). To determine whether this mutation is the susceptibility allele, we screened controls and other patients with ANE who are unrelated to the index family. Patients from 9 of 15 additional kindreds with familial or recurrent ANE had the identical mutation. It arose de novo in two families and independently in several other families. Two other patients with familial ANE had different RANBP2 missense mutations that altered conserved residues. None of the three RANBP2 missense mutations were found in 19 patients with isolated ANE or in unaffected controls. We conclude that missense mutations in RANBP2 are susceptibility alleles for familial and recurrent cases of ANE. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013485
12868055	20030718	Investigations into the polymorphisms at the ECM38 locus of two widely used Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C strains, YPH499 and BY4742.	The ECM38 gene encodes the gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase enzyme, an enzyme involved in glutathione turnover. The enzyme was found to be present in the S288C strain, BY4742, but absent in another widely used strain congenic to S288C, YPH499. Cloning and sequencing the genes from these yeasts indicated the presence of 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding region and eight single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region of the ECM38 gene of YPH499 (but none in that of BY4742). One of the SNPs in the ECM38 ORF led to a G --&gt; D conversion in a region conserved in all gamma-GT enzymes and was found to be responsible for the loss of activity in this strain. The presence of gamma-GT activity in other YPH strains led us to trace the origins of the polymorphisms in YPH499. Our results indicated that among the progenitor strains, YPH1 and YPH2, YPH1 carried the polymorphisms seen in YPH499 and also lacked the gamma-GT activity. The implications of these results for the use of these widely used S288C strains and the origin of these single nucleotide polymorphisms are presented. 	Yeast	D003160 D016428 D013485
1655907	19911101	The T cell activation antigen CD27 is a member of the nerve growth factor/tumor necrosis factor receptor gene family.	CD27 is a dimeric membrane glycoprotein found on the surface of most human T lymphocytes. Activation of T cells by engagement of the Ag receptor increases CD27 surface expression, and anti-CD27 antibodies augment Ag receptor-mediated T cell proliferation. In this study a cDNA-encoding CD27 was isolated by expression and immunoselection in COS cells. The predicted polypeptide was found to belong to a recently characterized family of cysteine-rich receptors whose known ligands include nerve growth factor and TNF-alpha and -beta. Structural similarities suggest that CD27 belongs to a lymphocyte-specific subgroup of the family, comprised of the B cell Ag CD40, the rat T cell subset Ag OX40, and the mouse T cell activation Ag 4-1BB. Recent studies suggest some of these molecules may play a role in the survival of activated cells. 	J._Immunol.	D003160 D016428 D013485
8973917	19961201	Isolation and genomic structure of a human homolog of the yeast periodic tryptophan protein 2 (PWP2) gene mapping to 21q22.3.	As part of efforts to identify candidate genes for disease mapping to the 21q22.3 region, we have assembled a 770-kb cosmid and BAC contig containing eight tightly linked markers. These cosmids and BACs were restriction mapped using eight rare cutting enzymes, with the goal of identifying CpG-rich islands. One such island was identified by the clustering of NotI, EagI, SstII, and BssHII sites, and corresponded to the NotI linking clone LJ104 described previously. A 7.6-kb HindIII fragment containing this CpG-rich island was subcloned and partially sequenced. A homology search using the sequence obtained from either side of the NotI site identified an expressed sequence tag with homology to the yeast periodic tryptophan protein 2 (PWP2). Several cDNAs corresponding to the human PWP2 gene were identified and partially sequenced. Northern blot analysis revealed a 3.3-kb transcript that was well expressed in all tissues tested. A cDNA consensus of 3157 bp was obtained, and an open reading frame potentially encoding 919 amino acid residues was identified. The predicted protein shows 42% identity and 57% similarity at the amino acid level to the yeast PWP2 protein, which is a member of the WD-repeat containing superfamily, and potentially encodes a G-protein beta subunit. The PWP2 gene is split into 21 exons, ranging in size from 53 to 516 bp, and spans an estimated 25 kb. The gene is transcribed in a 21cen--&gt;21qter direction, with its 5' end mapping approximately 195 kb proximal to the 5' end of the phosphofructokinase-liver isoform gene. Four single base-pair polymorphisms were identified using single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis. Possible functions of the protein based on homology to other members of the WD-repeat-containing family are discussed. 	Genome_Res.	D016422 D013485
24140113	20131022	Defects in the IFT-B component IFT172 cause Jeune and Mainzer-Saldino syndromes in humans.	Intraflagellar transport (IFT) depends on two evolutionarily conserved modules, subcomplexes A (IFT-A) and B (IFT-B), to drive ciliary assembly and maintenance. All six IFT-A components and their motor protein, DYNC2H1, have been linked to human skeletal ciliopathies, including asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD; also known as Jeune syndrome), Sensenbrenner syndrome, and Mainzer-Saldino syndrome (MZSDS). Conversely, the 14 subunits in the IFT-B module, with the exception of IFT80, have unknown roles in human disease. To identify additional IFT-B components defective in ciliopathies, we independently performed different mutation analyses: candidate-based sequencing of all IFT-B-encoding genes in 1,467 individuals with a nephronophthisis-related ciliopathy or whole-exome resequencing in 63 individuals with ATD. We thereby detected biallelic mutations in the IFT-B-encoding gene IFT172 in 12 families. All affected individuals displayed abnormalities of the thorax and/or long bones, as well as renal, hepatic, or retinal involvement, consistent with the diagnosis of ATD or MZSDS. Additionally, cerebellar aplasia or hypoplasia characteristic of Joubert syndrome was present in 2 out of 12 families. Fibroblasts from affected individuals showed disturbed ciliary composition, suggesting alteration of ciliary transport and signaling. Knockdown of ift172 in zebrafish recapitulated the human phenotype and demonstrated a genetic interaction between ift172 and ift80. In summary, we have identified defects in IFT172 as a cause of complex ATD and MZSDS. Our findings link the group of skeletal ciliopathies to an additional IFT-B component, IFT172, similar to what has been shown for IFT-A. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013485
24899140	20140606	Rare mutations in SQSTM1 modify susceptibility to frontotemporal lobar degeneration.	Mutations in the gene coding for Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) have been genetically associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Paget disease of bone. In the present study, we analyzed the SQSTM1 coding sequence for mutations in an extended cohort of 1,808 patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), ascertained within the European Early-Onset Dementia consortium. As control dataset, we sequenced 1,625 European control individuals and analyzed whole-exome sequence data of 2,274 German individuals (total n = 3,899). Association of rare SQSTM1 mutations was calculated in a meta-analysis of 4,332 FTLD and 10,240 control alleles. We identified 25 coding variants in FTLD patients of which 10 have not been described. Fifteen mutations were absent in the control individuals (carrier frequency &lt;0.00026) whilst the others were rare in both patients and control individuals. When pooling all variants with a minor allele frequency &lt;0.01, an overall frequency of 3.2 % was calculated in patients. Rare variant association analysis between patients and controls showed no difference over the whole protein, but suggested that rare mutations clustering in the UBA domain of SQSTM1 may influence disease susceptibility by doubling the risk for FTLD (RR = 2.18 [95 % CI 1.24-3.85]; corrected p value = 0.042). Detailed histopathology demonstrated that mutations in SQSTM1 associate with widespread neuronal and glial phospho-TDP-43 pathology. With this study, we provide further evidence for a putative role of rare mutations in SQSTM1 in the genetic etiology of FTLD and showed that, comparable to other FTLD/ALS genes, SQSTM1 mutations are associated with TDP-43 pathology.

23913389	20130806	Mutations in NPHS2 (podocin) in Mexican children with nephrotic syndrome who respond to standard steroid treatment.	Human nephrotic syndrome has been related to mutations in glomerular proteins. Mutations in the NPHS2 gene that encodes podocin have been described as responsible for steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. It has been advised to test for NPHS2 mutations in parallel or before giving steroid treatment in nephrotic syndrome patients in order to avoid unnecessary therapy. We identified NPHS2 mutations in Mexican children with nephrotic syndrome. The study included 13 children with nephrotic syndrome and 2 healthy control individuals; 8 patients were steroid-resistant and 5 were steroid-sensitive. We analyzed the 3rd exon of NPHS2 by DNA sequencing. Podocin heterozygous missense mutations L139R and L142P were found; the former was found in both steroid-sensitive and steroid-resistant children, while the latter was found in a steroid-resistant child. We conclude that NPHS2 mutations should be investigated to help decide the course of treatment in nephrotic syndrome patients. 	Genet._Mol._Res.	D016428 D013485

This is a previously unrecognised form of PDH deficiency, which most commonly results from mutations in the X-linked gene for the E1alpha subunit.

9373253	19971231	Activation of human platelets by the membrane-expressed A1 domain of von Willebrand factor.	Platelet activation and microthrombus formation are invariable features of xenograft rejection and the vascular injury observed when porcine organs are transplanted into primates. This pathological process could be mediated, at least in part, by aberrant interactions of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) associated with the donor vasculature with host platelets. Unlike human vWF, native porcine vWF (pvWF) interacts with human GPIb independently of shear stress or nonphysiological stimuli, eg, ristocetin. We therefore contrasted the potential of isolated human and porcine vWF-A1-domains to interact with human platelets in vitro. Both human and porcine vWF-A1-domains expressed as glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-linked FLAG fusion proteins on COS-7 cells induced GPIb-dependent aggregation and intracellular Ca++ uptake of platelets, independent of both the remainder of the vWF protein and additional modifying factors. Porcine A1-domains were more potent than human homologues, and in addition ristocetin could boost platelet aggregation only with the human A1-domain. Putative conformational changes in the porcine A1-domain could result in the heightened, ristocetin-independent interactions observed with human platelets and may be of importance for xenograft survival.

16271074	20051108	Identification of glioma-specific RFX4-E and -F isoforms and humoral immune response in patients.	For regulatory factor X4 (RFX4), two alternatively spliced variants, RFX4-A and -B, were reported in the testis. In this study, we identified transcript variants RFX4-C, -D, -E, and -F, and demonstrated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that RFX4-A, -B and -C mRNAs were expressed only in the testis, and RFX4-D mRNA was expressed only in normal brain tissues. In tumors, RFX4-E and -F in addition to RFX4-D mRNA were expressed in gliomas by rapid amplification of cDNA ends and RT-PCR analyses. Expression of RFX4 mRNA was not observed in other tumors, such as lung, esophageal, stomach, colon or liver cancers. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR using common primer pairs detecting all of the variant transcripts showed high expression in normal testis, low expression in the brain (1% compared to the expression in testis), and overexpression in 17 of 61 gliomas (28%). Western blot analysis using DC28 monoclonal antibody (mAb) produced against recombinant RFX4-D C-terminus protein showed expression of RFX4-A and -C proteins, but not RFX4-B protein, in the testis, and expression of RFX4-D protein in the brain. Moreover, expression of RFX4-E and -F proteins, but not RFX4-D protein, was observed in gliomas. Immunohistochemistry analysis using DC28 mAb showed positive staining in the nuclei of spermatocytes in the testis and glioma cells. Antibody against RFX4 was detected in the sera of 3 of 58 (5%) glioma patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, suggesting the immunogenicity of RFX4-E and -F proteins in glioma patients.

11050079	20001026	ETL, a novel seven-transmembrane receptor that is developmentally regulated in the heart. ETL is a member of the secretin family and belongs to the epidermal growth factor-seven-transmembrane subfamily.	Using differential display of rat fetal and postnatal cardiomyocytes, we have identified a novel seven-transmembrane receptor, ETL. The cDNA-predicted amino acid sequence of ETL indicated that it encodes a 738-aa protein composed of a large extracellular domain with epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, a seven-transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. ETL belongs to the secretin family of G-protein-coupled peptide hormone receptors and the EGF-TM7 subfamily of receptors. The latter are characterized by a variable number of extracellular EGF and cell surface domains and conserved seven transmembrane-spanning regions. ETL mRNA expression is up-regulated in the adult rat and human heart. In situ hybridization analyses revealed expression in rat cardiomyocytes and abundant expression in vascular and bronchiolar smooth muscle cells. In COS-7 cells transfected with Myc-tagged rat ETL, rat ETL exists as a stable dimer and undergoes endoproteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain. The proteolytic activity can be abolished by a specific mutation, T455A, in this domain. In transfected mammalian cells, ETL is associated with cell membranes and is also observed in cytoplasmic vesicles. ETL is the first seven-transmembrane receptor containing EGF-like repeats that is developmentally regulated in the heart. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
9631401	19980619	LGMD 2E in Tunisia is caused by a homozygous missense mutation in beta-sarcoglycan exon 3.	Four of the currently recognized autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD type 2C-F) are caused by mutations in the genes encoding components of the sarcoglycan complex. LGMD 2C, caused by mutations in gamma-sarcoglycan, is prevalent in northern Africa, especially in Tunisia, where this type of muscular dystrophy was originally described. Although the disease initially was assumed to be genetically homogeneous in this region, linkage to the alpha-sarcoglycan locus (LGMD 2D) has also been found. We have now identified the first Tunisian family with beta-sarcoglycanopathy (LGMD 2E), further adding to the genetic heterogeneity of autosomal recessive LGMD in this population. Direct sequencing of the beta-sarcoglycan gene revealed a homozygous mutation (G272--&gt;T, Arg91Leu) in exon 3. This change affects the same arginine residue in the immediate extracellular domain of the protein that was mutated to a proline (G272--&gt;C, Arg91Pro) in a Brazilian family with a severe form of the disease. Immunohistochemical analysis for the sarcoglycan complex demonstrates absence of the known components of the complex in both of these families. We postulate that the immediate extracellular domain of beta-sarcoglycan may be important for the assembly and/or maintenance of this complex, potentially mediated by disulfide-bond formation to another sarcoglycan via the single cysteine residue in that domain.

24369382	20131227	The tumour suppressor gene WWOX is mutated in autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia with epilepsy and mental retardation.	We previously localized a new form of recessive ataxia with generalized tonic-clonic epilepsy and mental retardation to a 19 Mb interval in 16q21-q23 by homozygosity mapping of a large consanguineous Saudi Arabian family. We now report the identification by whole exome sequencing of the missense mutation changing proline 47 into threonine in the first WW domain of the WW domain containing oxidoreductase gene, WWOX, located in the linkage interval. Proline 47 is a highly conserved residue that is part of the WW motif consensus sequence and is part of the hydrophobic core that stabilizes the WW fold. We demonstrate that proline 47 is a key amino acid essential for maintaining the WWOX protein fully functional, with its mutation into a threonine resulting in a loss of peptide interaction for the first WW domain. We also identified another highly conserved homozygous WWOX mutation changing glycine 372 to arginine in a second consanguineous family. The phenotype closely resembled the index family, presenting with generalized tonic-clonic epilepsy, mental retardation and ataxia, but also included prominent upper motor neuron disease. Moreover, we observed that the short-lived Wwox knock-out mouse display spontaneous and audiogenic seizures, a phenotype previously observed in the spontaneous Wwox mutant rat presenting with ataxia and epilepsy, indicating that homozygous WWOX mutations in different species causes cerebellar ataxia associated with epilepsy.

11241844	20010310	An improved high throughput heteroduplex mutation detection system for screening BRCA2 mutations-fluorescent mutation detection (F-MD).	We describe an improved, fast, automated method for screening large genes such as BRCA2 for germline genomic mutations. The method is based on heteroduplex analysis, and has been adapted for a high throughput application by combining the fluorescent technology of automated sequencers and robotic sample handling. This novel approach allows the entire BRCA2 gene to be screened with appropriate overlaps in four lanes of an ABI 377 gel. The method will detect all types of mutations, especially point mutations, more reliably and robustly than other commonly used conformational sensitive methods (e.g. CSGE). In addition we show that this approach, which relies on band shift detection, is able to detect single base substitutions that have hitherto only been detectable by direct sequencing methods.

18297072	20080226	Disruption of P2RY5, an orphan G protein-coupled receptor, underlies autosomal recessive woolly hair.	The genetic determinants of hair texture in humans are largely unknown. Several human syndromes exist in which woolly hair comprises a part of the phenotype; however, simple autosomal recessive inheritance of isolated woolly hair has only rarely been reported. To identify a gene involved in controlling hair texture, we performed genetic linkage analysis in six families of Pakistani origin with autosomal recessive woolly hair (ARWH; OMIM 278150). All six families showed linkage to chromosome 13q14.2-14.3 (Z = 17.97). In all cases, we discovered pathogenic mutations in P2RY5, which encodes a G protein-coupled receptor and is a nested gene residing within intron 17 of the retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) gene. P2RY5 is expressed in both Henle's and Huxley's layers of the inner root sheath of the hair follicle. Our findings indicate that disruption of P2RY5 underlies ARWH and, more broadly, uncover a new gene involved in determining hair texture in humans. 	Nat._Genet.	D002363 D016428 D052061
8845841	19960401	Cloning and characterization of the human homologue of a dystrophin related phosphoprotein found at the Torpedo electric organ post-synaptic membrane.	Dystrophin is the protein product which is absent in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In mammalian skeletal muscle, dystrophin is found in association with several integral and peripheral membrane proteins, forming a complex known as the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC). In an expressed sequence tag (EST) database search to identify new dystrophin related genes, we isolated EST00891 which showed 57% homology to the cysteine-rich domain of dystrophin and localized to 18q12.1-12.2. This EST is also highly homologous (90%) to the Torpedo californica post-synaptic 87 kDa phosphoprotein. Screening human adult brain and skeletal muscle cDNA libraries with this EST resulted in cloning multiple cDNAs which encode several splice forms all homologous to the C-terminal domain of dystrophin. The largest open reading frame isolated shows 94% homology (86% identity) to the Torpedo 87 kDa protein and 50% homology to the cysteine-rich and carboxy-terminal domains of dystrophin. The other cDNAs isolated encode smaller splice forms of this gene which we have named dystrobrevin. The tissue distribution of dystrobrevin mRNA shows five distinct transcripts which are preferentially expressed between different tissues. In addition, antibodies against either the Torpedo 87 kDa protein or human dystrobrevin demonstrate that at least three of the splice forms are translated as proteins in human brain tissue extracts.

12325075	20020927	Imaging the metabolic footprint of Glut1 deficiency on the brain.	Cerebral 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in 14 patients with microcephaly, developmental delay, seizures, and mutations of the glucose transporter Glut1 (Glut1 deficiency syndrome) showed distinct abnormalities. Within a global context of diminished cortical uptake, more severe hypometabolism was found in the mesial temporal regions and thalami, accentuating a relative signal increase in the basal ganglia. In contrast, the structure of the brain appeared preserved in patients additionally investigated by magnetic resonance imaging. This metabolic footprint was relatively constant in all patients regardless of age, seizure history, or therapies and therefore constitutes a radiological signature of the disease. The full expression of the signature in the youngest patient (aged 19 months) indicates that the state of haploinsufficiency caused by Glut1 mutation leaves a permanent footprint on the nervous system from its earlier postnatal stages of development. The potential benefit of prompt diagnosis, aided by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, and early initiation of available therapies is underscored by our results. 	Ann._Neurol.

22462537	20120403	Phenotype in 18 Danish subjects with genetically verified CHARGE syndrome.	CHARGE (coloboma of the eye, heart defects, choanal atresia, retarded growth and development, genital hypoplasia and ear anomalies and/or hearing loss) syndrome is a rare genetic, multiple-malformation syndrome. About 80% of patients with a clinical diagnose, have a mutation or a deletion in the gene encoding chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7). Genotype-phenotype correlation is only partly known. In this nationwide study, phenotypic characteristics of 18 Danish CHD7 mutation positive CHARGE individuals (N = 18) are presented. We studied patient records, clinical photographs, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Information was not available for all traits in all subjects. Therefore, the results are presented as fractions. The following prevalence of cardinal symptoms were found: coloboma, 16/17; heart defects, 14/18; choanal atresia, 7/17; retarded growth and development, 11/13; genital abnormalities, 5/18; ear anomalies, 15/17 and sensorineural hearing loss, 14/15. Vestibular dysfunction (10/13) and swallowing problems (12/15) were other frequent cranial nerve dysfunctions. Three-dimensional reconstructions of MRI scans showed temporal bone abnormalities in &gt;85%. CHARGE syndrome present a broad phenotypic spectrum, although some clinical features are more frequently occurring than others. Here, we suggest that genetic testing for CHD7 mutation should be considered in neonates with a specific combination of several clinical symptoms. 	Clin._Genet.	D016428
23092983	20121025	Analysis of the chromosome X exome in patients with autism spectrum disorders identified novel candidate genes, including TMLHE.	The striking excess of affected males in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) suggests that genes located on chromosome X contribute to the etiology of these disorders. To identify new X-linked genes associated with ASD, we analyzed the entire chromosome X exome by next-generation sequencing in 12 unrelated families with two affected males. Thirty-six possibly deleterious variants in 33 candidate genes were found, including PHF8 and HUWE1, previously implicated in intellectual disability (ID). A nonsense mutation in TMLHE, which encodes the ?-N-trimethyllysine hydroxylase catalyzing the first step of carnitine biosynthesis, was identified in two brothers with autism and ID. By screening the TMLHE coding sequence in 501 male patients with ASD, we identified two additional missense substitutions not found in controls and not reported in databases. Functional analyses confirmed that the mutations were associated with a loss-of-function and led to an increase in trimethyllysine, the precursor of carnitine biosynthesis, in the plasma of patients. This study supports the hypothesis that rare variants on the X chromosome are involved in the etiology of ASD and contribute to the sex-ratio disequilibrium. 	Transl_Psychiatry	D016428 D013485
14705112	20040106	De novo mutations in the mitochondrial ND3 gene as a cause of infantile mitochondrial encephalopathy and complex I deficiency.	Both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA mutations can cause energy generation disorders. Respiratory chain complex I deficiency is the most common energy generation disorder and a frequent cause of infantile mitochondrial encephalopathies such as Leigh's disease and lethal infantile mitochondrial disease. Most such cases have been assumed to be caused by nuclear gene defects, but recently an increasing number have been shown to be caused by mutations in the mitochondrially encoded complex I subunit genes ND4, ND5, and ND6. We report the first four cases of infantile mitochondrial encephalopathies caused by mutations in the ND3 subunit gene. Three unrelated children have the same novel heteroplasmic mutation (T10158C), only the second mutation reported in ND3, and one has the previously identified T10191C mutation. Both mutations cause disproportionately greater reductions in enzyme activity than in the amount of fully assembled complex I, suggesting the ND3 subunit plays an unknown but important role in electron transport, proton pumping, or ubiquinone binding. Three cases appear to have a de novo mutation, with no mutation detected in maternal relatives. Mitochondrial DNA disease may be considerably more prevalent in the pediatric population than currently predicted and should be considered in patients with infantile mitochondrial encephalopathies and complex I deficiency.

8193355	19940601	Isolation and characterization of the human interleukin-9 receptor gene.	To better understand the regulation of interleukin-9 (IL-9) receptor expression, we have isolated the genomic clone of the human IL-9 receptor based on its sequence homology with a human IL-9 receptor cDNA isolated from the human megakaryocyte cell line UT-7. The entire genomic structure has been determined. The human IL-9 receptor gene consists of 10 exons spread over approximately 13.7 kb of DNA. The nucleotide sequence of the coding region from the genomic DNA is identical to our cDNA clone. Several blocks of transcriptional control sequence have been identified at the 5' noncoding region of the IL-9 receptor gene that may play an important role in the regulation of the IL-9 receptor gene. A fusion gene containing 659 bp of human IL-9 receptor 5' noncoding region linked to the firefly luciferase gene directed expression of luciferase activity in human embryonic kidney 293 cell line, but not in the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 cells.

20141357	20100210	Severe retinopathy of prematurity associated with FZD4 mutations.	To determine whether mutations in the FZD4 gene are a risk factor for developing severe ROP. Three Canadian tertiary care centers recruited premature infants prospectively and retrospectively, and assigned affectation status based on the maximum degree of severity of ROP recorded in both eyes. Mutation screening of the FZD4 gene was performed using direct sequencing. All sequence changes were evaluated for functional significance. Two novel FZD4 mutations (Ala370Gly or Lys203Asn) were identified in two infants from the severe ROP group (n=71). No mutation was detected in the mild to no ROP group (n=33), and the two novel mutations were absent in 173 random Caucasian samples. Mutation Ala370Gly was also found in one sibling and one parent of the affected infant, but no signs of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), a condition with phenotypic overlap with ROP known to be caused by FZD4 mutations, were present in either family member. Mutations in the FZD4 gene in this group of premature infants supports a role for the FZD4 pathway in the development of severe ROP and accounts for approximately 3% of severe ROP in Caucasian premature infants.

16436457	20060127	Mutations in a new cytochrome P450 gene in lamellar ichthyosis type 3.	We report the identification of mutations in a non-syndromic autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) in a new gene mapping within a previously identified locus on chromosome 19p12-q12, which has been defined as LI3 in the OMIM database (MIM 604777). The phenotype usually presents as lamellar ichthyosis and hyperlinearity of palms and soles. Seven homozygous mutations including five missense mutations and two deletions were identified in a new gene, FLJ39501, on chromosome 19p12 in 21 patients from 12 consanguineous families from Algeria, France, Italy and Lebanon. FLJ39501 encodes a protein which was found to be a cytochrome P450, family 4, subfamily F, polypeptide 2 homolog of the leukotriene B4-omega-hydroxylase (CYP4F2) and could catalyze the 20-hydroxylation of trioxilin A3 from the 12(R)-lipoxygenase pathway. Further oxidation of this substrate by the fatty alcohol:nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide oxidoreductase (FAO) enzyme complex, in which one component, ALDH3A2, is known to be mutated in Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (characterized by ichthyosis and spastic paraplegia), would lead to 20-carboxy-(R)-trioxilin A3. This compound could be involved in skin hydration and would be the essential missing product in most forms of ARCI. Its chiral homolog, 20-carboxy-(S)-trioxilin A3, could be implicated in spastic paraplegia and in the maintenance of neuronal integrity. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D013485
14711881	20040109	Phenotypic clustering in MPZ mutations.	Myelin protein zero (MPZ) is a member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily with single extracellular, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Homotypic interactions between extracellular domains of MPZ adhere adjacent myelin wraps to each other. MPZ is also necessary for myelin compaction since mice which lack MPZ develop severe dysmyelinating neuropathies in which compaction is dramatically disrupted. MPZ mutations in humans cause the inherited demyelinating neuropathy CMT1B. Some mutations cause the severe neuropathies of infancy designated as Dejerine-Sottas disease, while others cause a 'classical' Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease Type 1B (CMT1B) phenotype with normal early milestones but development of disability during the first two decades of life. Still other mutations cause a neuropathy that presents in adults, with normal nerve conduction velocities, designated as a 'CMT2' form of CMT1B. To correlate the phenotype of patients with MPZ mutations with their genotype, we identified and evaluated 13 patients from 12 different families with eight different MPZ mutations. In addition, we re-analysed the clinical data from 64 cases of CMT1B from the literature. Contrary to our expectations, we found that most patients presented with either an early onset neuropathy with signs and symptoms prior to the onset of walking or a late onset neuropathy with signs and symptoms at around age 40 years. Only occasional patients presented with a 'classical' CMT phenotype. Correlation of specific MPZ mutations with their phenotypes demonstrated that addition of either a charged amino acid or altering a cysteine residue in the extracellular domain caused a severe early onset neuropathy. Severe neuropathy was also caused by truncation of the cytoplasmic domain or alteration of an evolutionarily conserved amino acid. Taken together, these data suggest that early onset neuropathy is caused by MPZ mutations that significantly disrupt the tertiary structure of MPZ and thus interfere with MPZ-mediated adhesion and myelin compaction. In contrast, late onset neuropathy is caused by mutations that more subtly alter myelin structure and which probably disrupt Schwann cell-axonal interactions. 	Brain	D016428 D013485 D013487 D016454

Barth syndrome (BTHS) is a rare X-linked disorder characterized by cardiomyopathy, short stature, neutropenia, and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. Mutations have been identified in the TAZ ( G4.5) gene in patients with BTHS. This article presents a mutation analysis of this gene in a Japanese boy with cardiomyopathy with abnormal mitochondria, cyclic neutropenia, and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (type 2). The analysis revealed a novel missense mutation (R94S) caused by a single nucleotide substitution (C-to-A) in this patient. 	J._Hum._Genet.	D002363 D016428 D013485
23086397	20121023	De novo gain-of-function KCNT1 channel mutations cause malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy.	Malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy (MMPSI) is a rare epileptic encephalopathy of infancy that combines pharmacoresistant seizures with developmental delay. We performed exome sequencing in three probands with MMPSI and identified de novo gain-of-function mutations affecting the C-terminal domain of the KCNT1 potassium channel. We sequenced KCNT1 in 9 additional individuals with MMPSI and identified mutations in 4 of them, in total identifying mutations in 6 out of 12 unrelated affected individuals. Functional studies showed that the mutations led to constitutive activation of the channel, mimicking the effects of phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain by protein kinase C. In addition to regulating ion flux, KCNT1 has a non-conducting function, as its C terminus interacts with cytoplasmic proteins involved in developmental signaling pathways. These results provide a focus for future diagnostic approaches and research for this devastating condition. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013485
10987650	20000915	DGGE screening of PKD1 gene reveals novel mutations in a large cohort of 146 unrelated patients.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most commonly inherited renal diseases. ADPKD is a genetically heterogeneous disorder involving at least three different genes. PKD1, the major locus mapped to chromosome 16p13.3 accounts for approximately 85% of ADPKD cases. The search for mutations is a very important step in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying ADPKD. Despite intense screening by many groups, only a small number of mutations have been described so far. We undertook the first study using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to scan for mutations in the non-duplicated region of the PKD1 gene in a large cohort of 146 French unrelated ADPKD patients. We successfully identified novel mutations: 3 are frameshift mutations, 2 nonsense mutations, 2 missense mutations, 1 is an insertion in the frame of 9 nucleotides, 3 intronic variations and several polymorphisms. One of these mutations is the fourth de novo mutation described in this gene. We also describe a family with possible clinical anticipation. DGGE is an effective method for detecting nucleotide changes in the PKD1 gene. 	Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
7981681	19940701	Proof of a non-functional muscle chloride channel in recessive myotonia congenita (Becker) by detection of a 4 base pair deletion.	Recessive myotonia congenita (Becker) is genetically linked to HUMCLC, the gene encoding the muscular chloride channel, localized on chromosome 7q35. Three point mutations have so far been reported in HUMCLC, one causing recessive Becker-type myotonia, the others causing the clinically similar Thomsen-type myotonia, which is inherited as a dominant trait. We report a homozygous patient having a 4 base pair deletion in HUMCLC that shifts the reading frame and causes early stop codons, thus destroying the gene's coding potential for several membrane-spanning domains. In addition, we report a patient homozygous for a novel point mutation located at the extracellular side of the first membrane-spanning domain that causes removal of a negative charge (aspartic acid-136-glycine). Both mutations lead to the recessive type of myotonia congenita. Since the patient having the deletion presents less severe clinical myotonia than the patient carrying the missense mutation, it seems that the absence or truncation of the channel protein may disturb muscle fibre function less than the substitution of a single amino acid.

19654412	20090806	Mndal, a new interferon-inducible family member, is highly polymorphic, suppresses cell growth, and may modify plasmacytoma susceptibility.	The human HIN-200 gene cluster and its mouse counterpart, the interferon inducible-200 (Ifi200) family, both on Chr 1, are associated with several diseases, including solid tumors and lupus. Our study was initiated to identify the modifier gene(s) encoded by the Pctm locus, in which mouse B-cell plasmacytomas induced by pristane are associated with heterozygosity of Chr 1 genes near the Ifi200 cluster. A screen for differentially expressed genes in granulomatous tissues induced by pristane in resistant and susceptible strains identified a new Ifi200 member whose expression was 1000-fold higher in the strain carrying the resistant allele of Pctm and was the most highly expressed Ifi200 gene. The gene, designated Mndal (for MNDA-like, myeloid nuclear differentiation antigen-like), was absent in the susceptible genome, as were genomic sequences upstream of Ifi203, the gene adjacent to Mndal. Ectopic expression of MNDAL suppressed cell growth, which, together with the disease susceptibility of heterozygotes at the Pctm locus, suggests that Mndal, perhaps with Ifi203, acts as a tumor suppressor and display(s) haploinsufficiency. Mndal is highly polymorphic among inbred mouse strains, because it is absent in 10 of 24 strains. This polymorphism may have implications for other disease modifiers mapping to the same region.

10366743	19990615	Structure and regulation of the human NeuroD (BETA2/BHF1) gene.	In this study, we isolated and characterized the human NeuroD (BETA2/BHF1) gene. This gene was found to consist of two exons and one intron. The promoter regions were well-conserved compared with the mouse NeuroD gene. Two transcription start points (TSPs) were determined by the oligo-capping method. One TATA box was located at -31 bp from the lower TSP. The results of a transient transfection assay using the human neuroblastoma cell line IMR-32 and hamster insulin tumor cell line HIT-T15 suggested that there are at least three positive regulatory regions in the promoter. In these regions, four E boxes (CANNTG), named the E1 to E4 boxes, and two GC boxes were present. Cotransfection of the NeuroD expression vector into IMR-32 cells enhanced the NeuroD promoter activity by about 4-fold. A deletion and mutation analysis revealed that the E1 and E4 boxes, especially the E1 box, are associated with autoactivation and that E2 and E3 boxes are not associated with autoactivation. As mutation analysis of E3 box showed a decrease in the enhancer activity to the basal level, it showed that the E3 box is important to activate the NeuroD transcription. These results raised the possibility that the NeuroD gene expression is positively regulated through the E box sequence, not only by NeuroD itself but also by another E box binding protein.

18579543	20080627	Novel mutations in the folliculin gene associated with spontaneous pneumothorax.	Spontaneous pneumothorax is mostly sporadic but may also occur in families with genetic disorders, such as Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the folliculin (FLCN) gene. The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence and type of mutation in a Swiss pedigree and in a sporadic case. Clinical examination, lung function tests and high-resolution computed tomography were performed. All coding exons and flanking intronic regions of FLCN were amplified by PCR and directly sequenced. The amount of FLCN transcripts was determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Two novel mutations in FLCN were identified. Three investigated family members with a history of at least one spontaneous pneumothorax were heterozygous for a single nucleotide substitution (c.779G&gt;A) that leads to a premature stop codon (p.W260X). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed a reduction of FLCN transcripts from the patient compared with an unaffected family member. DNA from the sporadic case carried a heterozygous missense mutation (c.394G&gt;A). Lung function of this patient was normal and computed tomography showed similar bilateral cysts, as observed in the two members of the unrelated Swiss family. Mutations in the folliculin gene are associated with cystic lung lesions in an otherwise morphological normal lung and predispose to spontaneous pneumothorax. 	Eur._Respir._J.	D002363 D016428
5824070	19691101	Hemoglobin NYU, a delta chain variant, alpha 2 delta 2 lys.	A minor hemoglobin (Hb) component with the electrophoretic properties of the delta-chain variant Hb A(2') was encountered in two unrelated families of Russian-Jewish ancestry. This minor component, designated Hb NYU, was shown to result from the substitution of lysine for asparagine at delta(12). We have confirmed studies of others that hemoglobin A(2') isolated from the hemoglobin of some African subjects, results from the replacement of the normal glycine at delta(16) by arginine. Thus for interpretations of the incidence of delta-chain variants in different populations, electrophoretic data are not sufficient. In members of one of the families in the present study, the visual estimations of normal Hb A(2) and of Hb NYU on starch-gel electrophoretic patterns suggested the presence of delta-thalassemia. In hemolysates of one of the heterozygotes for Hb NYU, hemoglobin A(2) was not demonstrable with starch-gel electrophoretic methods but was readily recovered by column chromatography in approximately the amounts expected for delta-chain heterozygotes.

18674745	20080805	Impairment of SLC17A8 encoding vesicular glutamate transporter-3, VGLUT3, underlies nonsyndromic deafness DFNA25 and inner hair cell dysfunction in null mice.	Autosomal-dominant sensorineural hearing loss is genetically heterogeneous, with a phenotype closely resembling presbycusis, the most common sensory defect associated with aging in humans. We have identified SLC17A8, which encodes the vesicular glutamate transporter-3 (VGLUT3), as the gene responsible for DFNA25, an autosomal-dominant form of progressive, high-frequency nonsyndromic deafness. In two unrelated families, a heterozygous missense mutation, c.632C--&gt;T (p.A211V), was found to segregate with DFNA25 deafness and was not present in 267 controls. Linkage-disequilibrium analysis suggested that the families have a distant common ancestor. The A211 residue is conserved in VGLUT3 across species and in all human VGLUT subtypes (VGLUT1-3), suggesting an important functional role. In the cochlea, VGLUT3 accumulates glutamate in the synaptic vesicles of the sensory inner hair cells (IHCs) before releasing it onto receptors of auditory-nerve terminals. Null mice with a targeted deletion of Slc17a8 exon 2 lacked auditory-nerve responses to acoustic stimuli, although auditory brainstem responses could be elicited by electrical stimuli, and robust otoacoustic emissions were recorded. Ca(2+)-triggered synaptic-vesicle turnover was normal in IHCs of Slc17a8 null mice when probed by membrane capacitance measurements at 2 weeks of age. Later, the number of afferent synapses, spiral ganglion neurons, and lateral efferent endings below sensory IHCs declined. Ribbon synapses remaining by 3 months of age had a normal ultrastructural appearance. We conclude that deafness in Slc17a8-deficient mice is due to a specific defect of vesicular glutamate uptake and release and that VGLUT3 is essential for auditory coding at the IHC synapse.

16181229	20050927	SRD5A2 gene analysis in an Italian population of under-masculinized 46,XY subjects.	The differential diagnosis of male under-masculinization, including a wide spectrum of phenotypes and a heterogeneous genetic basis, is crucial for the correct management of the patients. To characterize an Italian population of under-masculinized males, we performed the molecular analysis of the SRD5A2 gene (2p23), encoding the 5alpha-reductase-2 enzyme that converts testosterone (T) to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and is required for full masculinization of the male foetus. Twenty-six Italian patients with 46,XY kariotype and various degrees of ambiguous genitalia were retrospectively selected for this study. Twelve of these patients, 10 of whom were referred for partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS), were raised as females; 15 were raised as males and all had a severe hypospadias. For most of the patients, the case histories and hormonal findings were incomplete but all could be included in the clinical characteristics of under-masculinization. For hormonal evaluation, T and DHT were measured by means of radioimmunoassay (RIA) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-RIA methods, respectively. Genomic DNA of all patients and relatives was extracted from peripheral blood, the five exons of the SRD5A2 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and submitted to automatic sequencing. Five known mutations affecting the NADPH binding function and one new mutation affecting the enzyme C-terminus were identified in a total of eight patients (two of whom were sisters). Five families were characterized, and in two patients only one affected allele was observed. The extension of the analysis to the regions flanking exons allowed the identification of a new polymorphism in intron 2, whose frequency was determined. This first report of an Italian population underlines the importance of differential diagnoses in patients with under-masculinization. The lack of precise genotype-phenotype correlation in some of the mutations highlights the necessity to improve knowledge about the biochemical aspects of steroid 5alpha-reductase action and about the interactions of genetic and environmental factors.

8673091	19960501	BRCA2 germline mutations in male breast cancer cases and breast cancer families.	The breast cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA2 on chromosome 13q12-13, was recently isolated. Mutations in BRCA2 are thought to account for as much as 35% of all inherited breast cancer as wall as a proportion of inherited ovarian cancer. Many BRCA2-linked families also contain cases of male breast cancer. We have analysed germline DNA from 50 males with breast cancer (unselected for family history) and 26 individuals from site-specific female breast and breast-ovarian cancer families for mutations in BRCA2. All 17 breast-ovarian cancer families have been screened for BRCA1 coding region mutations and none were detected. Conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) analysis of PCR-amplified DNA followed by direct sequencing was used to detect sequence variants. Three of eleven individuals carry the same mutation, all are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, supporting the observation by Neuhausen et al. in this issue that there is a common mutation in this population. Eleven truncating mutations and nine polymorphisms were identified -- all were coding region variants. No loss-of-transcript mutations were identified in the sixteen samples for which this analysis was possible. Seven of the nine disease-associated mutations were detected in the 50 men with breast cancers; for thus in our series, BRCA2 mutations account for 14% of male breast cancer, all but one of which had a family history of male and/or female breast cancer.

2318848	19900415	Characterization of the gene for human plasminogen, a key proenzyme in the fibrinolytic system.	The organization and structure of the gene coding for plasminogen has been determined by a combination of in vitro amplification of leukocyte DNA from normal individuals and isolation of unique clones from three different human genomic libraries. These clones were characterized by restriction mapping, Southern blotting, and DNA sequencing. The gene for human plasminogen spanned about 52.5 kilobases of DNA and consisted of 19 exons separated by 18 introns. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the five kringle structures in plasminogen were coded by two exons. The nucleotides in the introns at the intron-exon boundaries were GT-AG analogous to those found in other eukaryotic genes. Three polyadenylation sites for plasminogen mRNA were also identified. When the amino acid sequences deduced from the genomic DNA and cDNAs of plasminogen were compared with that of the plasma protein determined by amino acid sequence analysis, an apparent amino acid polymorphism was observed in several positions of the polypeptide chain. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the amplified genomic DNAs and genomic clones also revealed that the plasminogen gene was very closely related to several other proteins, including apolipoprotein(a). This protein may have evolved via duplication and exon shuffling of the plasminogen gene. The presence of another plasminogen-related gene(s) in the human genomic library was also observed.

1356075	19920918	CLIP-170 links endocytic vesicles to microtubules.	Binding of endocytic carrier vesicles to microtubules depends on the microtubule-binding protein CLIP-170 in vitro. In vivo, CLIP-170 colocalizes with a subset of transferrin receptor-positive endocytic structures and, more extensively, with endosomal tubules induced by brefeldin A. The structure of CLIP-170 has been analyzed by cloning its cDNA. The predicted non-helical C- and N-terminal domains of the homodimeric protein are connected by a long coiled-coil domain. We have identified a novel motif present in a tandem repeat in the N-terminal domain of CLIP-170 that is involved in binding to microtubules. This motif is also found in the Drosophila Glued and yeast BIK1 proteins. These features, together with its very elongated structure, suggest that CLIP-170 belongs to a novel class of proteins, cytoplasmic linker proteins (CLIPs), mediating interactions of organelles with microtubules.

11857544	20020222	Apparent genotype-phenotype correlation in childhood, adolescent, and adult Chediak-Higashi syndrome.	Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe immunologic defects, reduced pigmentation, bleeding tendency, and progressive neurological dysfunction. Most patients present in early childhood and die unless treated by bone marrow transplantation. About 10-15% of patients exhibit a much milder clinical phenotype and survive to adulthood, but develop progressive and often fatal neurological dysfunction. Very rare patients exhibit an intermediate adolescent CHS phenotype, presenting with severe infections in early childhood, but a milder course by adolescence, with no accelerated phase. Here, we describe the organization and genomic DNA sequence of the CHS1 gene and mutation analysis of 21 unrelated patients with the childhood, adolescent, and adult forms of CHS. In patients with severe childhood CHS, we found only functionally null mutant CHS1 alleles, whereas in patients with the adolescent and adult forms of CHS we also found missense mutant alleles that likely encode CHS1 polypeptides with partial function. Together, these results suggest an allelic genotype-phenotype relationship among the various clinical forms of CHS. 	Am._J._Med._Genet.	D016428 D013485 D013487
11140841	20010105	Mutational analysis and genotype/phenotype correlation in Turkish Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type 1 and HNPP patients.	The major Charcot- Marie-Tooth Type 1 (CMT1) locus, CMT1A, and Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) cosegregate with a 1.5-Mb duplication and a 1.5-Mb deletion, respectively, in band 17p11.2. Point mutations in peripheral myelin gene 22 (PMP22), myelin protein zero (MPZ), and connexin 32 (Cx32) have been reported in CMT1, and in PMP22 in HNPP patients without deletion. We have screened 54 CMT1 patients, of variable clinical severity, and 25 HNPP patients from Turkey, with no duplication or deletion, for mutations in the PMP22 and Cx32 genes. A novel frameshift mutation affecting the second extracellular domain of PMP22 was found in an HNPP patient, while a point mutation in the second transmembrane domain of the protein was detected in a CMT1 patient. Two point mutations affecting different domains of Cx32 were identified in two CMTX patients. Another patient was found to carry a polymorphism in a non-conserved codon of the Cx32 gene. The clinical phenotypes of the patients correlate well with the effect of the mutation on the protein. 	Clin._Genet.	D016428 D013485
12504854	20021231	MBD3L1 and MBD3L2, two new proteins homologous to the methyl-CpG-binding proteins MBD2 and MBD3: characterization of MBD3L1 as a testis-specific transcriptional repressor.	Methylation of cytosines at CpG dinucleotides is essential for mammalian development. MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, and MBD4 comprise a family of proteins that contain a methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD). Except for MBD4, these proteins are involved in gene silencing imposed by methylated DNA. We have identified a human gene that codes for a protein that is 42% identical to MBD3 and 38% identical to MBD2 but lacks the methyl-CpG binding domain. The recombinant protein does not bind to methylated DNA in vitro. The corresponding mouse Mbd3L1 gene was also cloned. The MBD3L1 gene is expressed specifically in testis. During spermatogenesis, expression of MBD3L1 is observed only in round spermatids, suggesting a role for the gene product in the postmeiotic stages of male germ cell development. The MBD3L1 protein is localized to discrete areas in the nucleus and contains an N-terminal transcriptional repression domain. This repression is independent of histone deacetylase inhibition. A homologue of MBD3L1, MBD3L2, was also identified and cloned. Expression of MBD3L2 was found in germ cell tumors and some somatic tissues. These novel proteins may function as counterparts of MBD2 and/or MBD3 in developmental stage-specific transcriptional repression. 	Genomics	D016428 D013487
17221863	20070116	Incidence and clinical features of X-linked Cornelia de Lange syndrome due to SMC1L1 mutations.	Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a multisystem developmental disorder characterized by facial dysmorphism, growth and mental retardation, microcephaly, and various malformations. Heterozygous mutations in the NIPBL gene have been detected in approximately 45% of affected individuals. Recently, a second CdLS gene, mapping to the X chromosome, has been identified: SMC1L1 (structural maintenance of chromosomes 1-like 1; or SMC1A). In order to estimate the incidence and refine the clinical presentation of X-linked CdLS, we have screened a series of 11 CdLS boys carrying no NIPBL anomaly. We have identified two novel de novo SMC1L1 missense mutations (c.587G&gt;A [p.Arg196His] and c.3254A&gt;G [p.Tyr1085Cys]). Our results confirm that SMC1L1 mutations cause CdLS and support the view that SMC1L1 accounts for a significant fraction of boys with unexplained CdLS. Furthermore, we suggest that SMC1L1 mutations have milder effects than NIPBL mutations with respect to pre- and postnatal growth retardation and associated malformations. If confirmed, these data may have important implications for directing mutation screening in CdLS. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428
12543779	20030125	BRD4-NUT fusion oncogene: a novel mechanism in aggressive carcinoma.	The poorly differentiated carcinoma with t(15;19)(q13, p13.1) is characterized by its highly aggressive, invariably lethal clinical course. The chromosome 19 translocation breakpoint targets the BRD4 double bromodomain-containing gene, which functions in regulation of cell cycle progression. Herein we demonstrate that BRD4 is fused with nearly the entire transcript of the novel 15q13 gene, NUT (nuclear protein in testis), forming a 6.4-kb fusion oncogene, BRD4-NUT. NUT, like BRD4, is predicted to encode a nuclear protein but, unlike the ubiquitous BRD4 transcript, is expressed only in testis. These findings establish a model to elucidate the oncogenic consequences of unscheduled NUT expression and altered BRD4 function. Very few fusion oncogenes have been identified in epithelial tumors, and BRD4-NUT is the first fusion oncogene mechanism identified in a highly lethal form of carcinoma. 	Cancer_Res.	D016428 D013487
16780893	20060620	Cloning of a novel human caspase-9 splice variant containing only the CARD domain.	Caspase-9 plays a key role in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and currently two splice variants (caspase-9-alpha and -beta) have been identified. The present study cloned and characterized a novel caspase-9 splice variant, hereby designated Casp9-gamma. Casp9-gamma is generated from an additional alternative 3' splice site in the fourth exon of caspase-9, resulting in a 58-nucleotide fragment insertion compared with the full-length caspase-9-alpha. The fragment introduces an in-frame stop codon, and the resulting open reading frame (ORF) is preterminated. The Casp9-gamma comprises the deduced 154 amino acid residues containing only the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and does not contain the large and small subunits. The Casp9-gamma does not promote apoptosis when overexpressed in mammalian cells. Moreover, it inhibits the cleavage of procaspase-3 mediated by proapoptotic member Bax or apoptosis inductor staurosporine. Therefore, Casp9-gamma may function as an endogenous apoptotic inhibitor by interfering with the CARD-CARD interaction between Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease activating factor-1) and procaspase-9. In addition, Casp9-gamma does not enhance NF-kappaB activation in transfected 293T cells, conflicting with previous evidence that the isolated CARD of caspase-9 activates NF-kappaB in ND7 cells. This suggests that the procaspase-9-mediated NF-kappaB activation in response to cellular stresses is cell type-specific through an unidentified mechanism. 	Life_Sci.	D016428
12189496	20020822	Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts; a founder effect in Israeli patients and a higher than expected carrier rate among Libyan Jews.	Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) is a progressive inherited neurological disorder characterized by macrocephaly, deterioration in motor functions and cerebellar ataxia. In Israel the disease is found in an increased frequency among Libyan Jews. The disease is caused by mutations in the MLC1 gene, which encodes a putative CNS membrane transporter. We describe three novel mutations (p.G59E, p.P92S, and 134_136insC) in seven MLC families. One of these mutations, p.G59E, was found in the vast majority of MLC patients in Israel. Screening of 200 normal Libyan Jewish individuals for the p.G59E mutation, revealed a carrier rate of 1/40 compared with an expected carrier rate of 1/81. Several explanations could account for this difference the most likely one is an admixture of the Libyan Jewish population. 	Hum._Genet.	D003160 D016428 D013485
7711734	19950101	DNA-based mutation analysis of Bruton's tyrosine kinase gene in patients with X-linked agammaglobulinaemia.	The identification of the BTK (Bruton's tyrosine kinase) gene defective in human immunoglobulin deficiency X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA) and characterisation of BTK exon-intron boundaries has now allowed the analysis of mutations and polymorphisms at the level of genomic DNA. Using Southern blot analysis and the polymerase chain reaction single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) assay, amplifying all 19 exons and the putative promoter region with a single annealling temperature, mutations have been identified in 19 out of 24 unrelated patients diagnosed as having XLA. Apart from a large deletion involving exon 19, nine missense (F25S, R288W, 1370M, M509V, R525P, N526K, R562W, A582V and G594R), two nonsense (E277X and R525X), five frameshift and two splice site mutations have been found affecting most coding exons and all major enzyme domains. No mutations or polymorphisms were detected in the putative promoter region. A single nucleotide deletion located in the last exon, resulting in a truncation of the eight C-terminal residues of Btk and a typical XLA phenotype, indicates structural and/or functional importance of Btk helix I in the catalytic domain. Although allelic heterogeneity at the BTK locus may partly explain clinical variability in families with XLA, compensatory and redundant mechanisms involved in B-cell development must play a role in the phenotypic diversity of the disease.

17893149	20070926	KEG1/YFR042w encodes a novel Kre6-binding endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein responsible for beta-1,6-glucan synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	KEG1/YFR042w of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an essential gene that encodes a 200-amino acid polypeptide with four predicted transmembrane domains. The green fluorescent protein- or Myc(6)-tagged Keg1 protein showed the typical characteristics of an integral membrane protein and was found in the endoplasmic reticulum by fluorescence imaging. Immunoprecipitation from the Triton X-100-solubilized cell lysate revealed that Keg1 binds to Kre6, which has been known to participate in beta-1,6-glucan synthesis. To analyze the essential function of Keg1 in more detail, we constructed temperature-sensitive mutant alleles by error-prone polymerase chain reaction. The keg1-1 mutant cells showed a common phenotype with Deltakre6 mutant including hypersensitivity to Calcofluor white, reduced sensitivity to the K1 killer toxin, and reduced content of beta-1,6-glucan in the cell wall. These results suggest that Keg1 and Kre6 have a cooperative role in beta-1,6-glucan synthesis in S. cerevisiae. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
10632938	20000113	Keratin 9 mutations in the coil 1A region in epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma.	The palmoplantar keratodermas (PPK) are a heterogeneous group of conditions, most frequently inherited in autosomal dominant fashion. A few are well-documented autosomal recessive disorders; other are acquired in association with certain metabolic disorders and malignancies. Recently different point mutations of the keratin 9 (K9) gene have been identified in unrelated families with epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (EPPK). We investigated two unrelated Hungarian families with EPPK. In one, a mutation consisting of a G--&gt;A transversion at nucleotide position 551, which changes codon arginine to glutamine at codon 162 (R162Q), was found. In the other, we observed a novel mutation at nucleotide position 571, which changes codon 169 lysine (AAG) into the amber stop codon (TAG) (K169X). Each found mutation is present in the highly conserved coil 1A region of the rod domain. In the case of a stop codon type of mutation, it is questionable whether it really results in a clinical phenotype, but segregation analysis revealed cosegregation of the PPK phenotype with the mutant allele.

14662654	20031210	Mutations in the human RAX homeobox gene in a patient with anophthalmia and sclerocornea.	Anophthalmia and microphthalmia are among the most common ocular birth defects and a significant cause of congenital blindness. The etiology of anophthalmia and microphthalmia is diverse, with multiple genetic mutations associated with each of these conditions, along with potential environmental causes. Based on findings that mutations in the Rx/Rax homeobox genes in mice and fish lead to defects in retinal development and result in animal models of anophthalmia, we screened 75 individuals with anophthalmia and/or microphthalmia for mutations in the human RAX gene. We identified a single proband from this population who is a compound heterozygote for mutations in the RAX gene. This individual carries a truncated allele (Q147X) and a missense mutation (R192Q), both within the DNA-binding homeodomain of the RAX protein, and we have characterized the biochemical properties of these mutations in vitro. Parents and grandparents of the proband were found to be carriers without visible ocular defects, consistent with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. This is the first report of genetic mutations in the human RAX gene. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D013485 D013487
15278437	20040728	Scd1ab-Xyk: a new asebia allele characterized by a CCC trinucleotide insertion in exon 5 of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 gene in mouse.	We describe here a spontaneous, autosomal recessive mutant mouse suffering from skin and hair defects, which arose in the outbred Kunming strain. By haplotype analysis and direct sequencing of PCR products, we show that this mutation is a new allele of the asebia locus with a naturally occurring mutation in the Scd1 gene (a CCC insertion at nucleotide position 835 in exon 5), which codes for stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1. This mutation introduces an extra proline residue at position 279 in the Scd1 protein. The mutant mice, originally designated km/km but now assigned the name Scd1ab-Xyk (hereafter abbreviated as abXyk/abXyk), have a similar gross and histological phenotype to that reported for previously characterized allelic asebia mutations (Scd1ab, Scd1abJ, Scd1ab2J, and Scd1tm1Ntam). Histological analysis showed they were also characterized by hypoplasic sebaceous glands and abnormal hair follicles. In a cross between Kunming- abXyk/abXyk and ABJ/Le-abJ/abJ mice, all the progeny showed the same phenotype, indicating that the two mutations were non-complementing and therefore allelic. Comparisons with the other four allelic mutants indicate that the Scd1ab-Xyk mutation causes the mildest change in Scd1 function. This new mouse mutant is a good model not only for the study of scarring alopecias in humans, which are characterized by hypoplasic sebaceous glands, but also for studying the structure and function of the Scd1 protein.

9697703	19980811	Mutations in a plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase gene cause deafness in deafwaddler mice.	Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. Because the auditory systems of mice and humans are conserved, studies on mouse models have predicted several human deafness genes and identified new genes involved in hearing. The deafwaddler (dfw) mouse mutant is deaf and displays vestibular/motor imbalance. Here we report that the gene encoding a plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase type 2 pump (Atp2b2, also known as Pmca2) is mutated in dfw. An A--&gt;G nucleotide transition in dfw DNA causes a glycine-to-serine substitution at a highly conserved amino-acid position, whereas in a second allele, dfw2J, a 2-base-pair deletion causes a frameshift that predicts a truncated protein. In the cochlea, the protein Atp2b2 is localized to stereocilia and the basolateral wall of hair cells in wild-type mice, but is not detected in dfw2J mice. This indicates that mutation of Atp2b2 may cause deafness and imbalance by affecting sensory transduction in stereocilia as well as neurotransmitter release from the basolateral membrane. These mutations affecting Atp2b2 in dfw and dfw2J are the first to be found in a mammalian plasma membrane calcium pump and define a new class of deafness genes that directly affect hair-cell physiology.

12142729	20020727	Polymorphisms in a human kidney xenobiotic transporter, OCT2, exhibit altered function.	The completion of the Human Genome Project and the development of high-throughput polymorphism identification methods have allowed researchers to carry out full genetic analyses of many clinically relevant genes. However, few studies have combined genetic analysis with in vitro phenotyping to better understand the relationship between genetic variation and protein function. Many transporters in the kidney are thought to play key roles in defense against a variety of foreign substances. The goal of this study was to understand the relationship between variation in a gene encoding a major renal xenobiotic transporter, OCT2, and transporter function. We report a comprehensive genetic analysis and functional characterization of variants of OCT2. Twenty-eight variable sites in the OCT2 gene were identified in a collection of 247 ethnically diverse DNA samples. Eight caused non-synonymous amino acid changes, of which four were present at &gt;/= 1% in an ethnic population. All four of these altered transporter function assayed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Analysis of nucleotide diversity (pi) revealed a higher prevalence of synonymous (pi = 22.4 x 10-4) versus non-synonymous (pi = 2.1 x 10-4) changes in OCT2 than in other genes. In addition, the non-synonymous sites had a significant tendency to exhibit more skewed allele frequencies (more negative Tajima's D-values) compared to synonymous sites. The population-genetic analysis, together with the functional characterization, suggests that selection has acted against amino acid changes in OCT2. This selection may be due to a necessary role of OCT2 in the renal elimination of endogenous amines or xenobiotics, including environmental toxins, neurotoxic amines and therapeutic drugs.

17183314	20061222	A new progeroid syndrome reveals that genotoxic stress suppresses the somatotroph axis.	XPF-ERCC1 endonuclease is required for repair of helix-distorting DNA lesions and cytotoxic DNA interstrand crosslinks. Mild mutations in XPF cause the cancer-prone syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum. A patient presented with a severe XPF mutation leading to profound crosslink sensitivity and dramatic progeroid symptoms. It is not known how unrepaired DNA damage accelerates ageing or its relevance to natural ageing. Here we show a highly significant correlation between the liver transcriptome of old mice and a mouse model of this progeroid syndrome. Expression data from XPF-ERCC1-deficient mice indicate increased cell death and anti-oxidant defences, a shift towards anabolism and reduced growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signalling, a known regulator of lifespan. Similar changes are seen in wild-type mice in response to chronic genotoxic stress, caloric restriction, or with ageing. We conclude that unrepaired cytotoxic DNA damage induces a highly conserved metabolic response mediated by the IGF1/insulin pathway, which re-allocates resources from growth to somatic preservation and life extension. This highlights a causal contribution of DNA damage to ageing and demonstrates that ageing and end-of-life fitness are determined both by stochastic damage, which is the cause of functional decline, and genetics, which determines the rates of damage accumulation and decline.

12417605	20021106	A novel six-nucleotide insertion in exon 4 of the MEN1 gene, 878insCTGCAG, in three patients with familial insulinoma and primary hyperparathyroidism.	Three Japanese patients (a man and his two sons) in a family with clinical diagnosis of familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) suffered from insulinoma(s), primary hyperparathyroidism and pituitary microadenoma. Genomic DNA of the patients was analyzed by sequencing for the MEN1 gene and an insertion of six nucleotides, CTGCAG, in exon 4, resulting in insertion of two amino acids, Leu-Gln, after the 256th amino acid of the menin (256insLQ), was identified. CTGCAG is a palindromic sequence and repeated twice in the wild-type allele (nucleotides 879-890). It is speculated that mutations involving only exon 4 of the MEN1 gene might induce development of insulinoma(s). 	Jpn._J._Clin._Oncol.	D002363 D016428
10835628	20000603	Missense mutations interfere with VEGFR-3 signalling in primary lymphoedema.	Primary lymphoedema is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder that leads to a disabling and disfiguring swelling of the extremities and, when untreated, tends to worsen with time. Here we link primary human lymphoedema to the FLT4 locus, encoding vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3), in several families. All disease-associated alleles analysed had missense mutations and encoded proteins with an inactive tyrosine kinase, preventing downstream gene activation. Our study establishes that VEGFR-3 is important for normal lymphatic vascular function and that mutations interfering with VEGFR-3 signal transduction are a cause of primary lymphoedema. 	Nat._Genet.

18176751	20080108	Conradi-Hünermann-Happle syndrome (X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata) confirmed by plasma sterol and mutation analysis.	Conradi-Hünermann-Happle syndrome, or X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by skeletal dysplasia, stippled epiphyses, cataracts, transient ichthyosis and atrophic residua in a mosaic pattern. Mutations in the gene encoding the emopamil-binding protein have been identified as an underlying cause. A 5-year-old girl presented for evaluation of ill-defined patches of cicatricial alopecia. In addition, subtle follicular atrophoderma, esotropia, craniofacial asymmetry and short stature were noted. Her history revealed widespread scaly erythema and eye surgery for congenital cataract in the first months of life. Diagnosis of Conradi-Hünermann-Happle syndrome was confirmed by plasma sterol analysis showing markedly elevated levels of 8(9)-cholestenol and 8-dehydrocholesterol and by detection of a missense mutation (c.307G&gt;A; p.E103K) in the emopamil-binding protein gene. We suggest that plasma sterol analysis is a reliable method of establishing the diagnosis of Conradi-Hünermann-Happle syndrome, even in patients with less striking phenotypical changes beyond infancy.

7579394	19951015	Eleven novel mutations in the factor VIII gene from Brazilian hemophilia A patients.	The molecular characterization of the mutations in hemophilia A patients is hampered by the large size of the factor VIII gene and the great heterogeneity of mutations. In this study, we have performed a protocol involving multiplex polymerase chain reaction in which 19 exons were amplified in four different combinations followed by nonradioactive single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) to screen for mutations. Southern blotting was used to detect inversion of the factor VIII gene resulting from recombination between copies of the gene A (F8A) located in intron 22 of the factor VIII gene and two copies close telomeric region of X chromosome. Forty-two hemophilia A patients (21 with severe and 21 with mild-to-moderate disease) were studied. The inversion of factor VIII occurred in 13 of 21 patients affected by severe hemophilia A. One patient showed a large extra band in addition to the three bands observed after Southern blotting with the F8A probe. An abnormal electrophoretic pattern of SSCP was detected in 85% and 50% of the patients affected by mild-to-moderate and severe disease, respectively. Sixteen different mutations were identified. Eleven mutations were novel and comprised 9 point mutations and 2 small deletions. This study shows that the methodology used is safe and rapid and has potential for detecting almost all of the genetic defects of the studied hemophilia A patients. 	Blood	D016428
23533021	20130328	Genotype-phenotype relationships in the low-phospholipid-associated cholelithiasis syndrome: a study of 156 consecutive patients.	The low-phospholipid-associated cholelithiasis syndrome (LPAC; OMIM 171060) is a peculiar form of intrahepatic cholelithiasis occurring in young adults, associated with ABCB4/MDR3 gene sequence variations. Our aim was to determine the genotype-phenotype relationships in 156 consecutive patients with the criteria of LPAC syndrome. A variant was detected in 79 (61 missense and 18 truncating sequence variants), 63 being monoallelic. The clinical features (age at onset, high prevalence in women, frequency and severity of acute and chronic complications, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy [ICP]) were similar in the patients with or without ABCB4 gene sequence variation. Truncating variations were associated with an earlier onset of symptoms both in women and men. Acute and chronic biliary complications were variant-independent. Half of the women who had pregnancy developed ICP. The frequency of ICP and fetal complications were similar in patients with missense and truncating variants. The LPAC syndrome is more frequent in women and highly associated with ICP. Half of the patients harbored missense or truncating variants of the ABCB4 gene. The characteristics of the patients without detectable variant are similar to those with variant, indicating that yet unexplored regions of the ABCB4 and other genes may be involved.

20537300	20100612	GJC2 missense mutations cause human lymphedema.	Lymphedema is the clinical manifestation of defects in lymphatic structure or function. Mutations identified in genes regulating lymphatic development result in inherited lymphedema. No mutations have yet been identified in genes mediating lymphatic function that result in inherited lymphedema. Survey microarray studies comparing lymphatic and blood endothelial cells identified expression of several connexins in lymphatic endothelial cells. Additionally, gap junctions are implicated in maintaining lymphatic flow. By sequencing GJA1, GJA4, and GJC2 in a group of families with dominantly inherited lymphedema, we identified six probands with unique missense mutations in GJC2 (encoding connexin [Cx] 47). Two larger families cosegregate lymphedema and GJC2 mutation (LOD score = 6.5). We hypothesize that missense mutations in GJC2 alter gap junction function and disrupt lymphatic flow. Until now, GJC2 mutations were only thought to cause dysmyelination, with primary expression of Cx47 limited to the central nervous system. The identification of GJC2 mutations as a cause of primary lymphedema raises the possibility of novel gap-junction-modifying agents as potential therapy for some forms of lymphedema.

11794707	20020117	Two novel gene mutations in type I antithrombin deficiency.	We studied the molecular basis of type I antithrombin (AT) deficiency in 2 Japanese families, in which affected persons had histories of recurrent venous thrombosis and low (about 50% of normal) levels of AT protein according to measurements by both functional and antigen assays. Southern blotting of DNA isolated from peripheral leukocytes revealed no abnormalities in all the cases examined. Direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products from case I suggested a novel heterozygous nonsense mutation in exon 4 (GAG--&gt;TAG at nucleotide position 7627, leading to Glu306 stop). The sequencing of the subclones of the patient's exon 4 products confirmed the nonsense mutation. No other sequence abnormalities were detected in the rest of the PCR products. The same mutation was detected in this patient's brother, who had a history of recurrent venous thrombosis and a reduced level of AT activity. In case 2, the direct sequencing of PCR products suggested a novel heterozygous 9-bp deletion in exon 3a (-CACTTC at nucleotide position 5354-5362, leading to the deletion of 3 amino acids, His120, Phel21, and Phe122). The 9-bp deletion mutation in the region of a unique quasi palindrome was confirmed by sequencing several of the subclones of the patient's exon 3a from the PCR products. No other mutations were found by direct sequencing of the rest of the coding regions. The 2 mutations found in this study are novel. The use of PCR and the sequencing of the PCR product subclones has simplified and confirmed the detection and characterization of the various AT mutations. 	Int._J._Hematol.	D002363 D016428
23349227	20130126	Whole exome sequencing identifies a mutation for a novel form of corneal intraepithelial dyskeratosis.	Corneal intraepithelial dyskeratosis is an extremely rare condition. The classical form, affecting Native American Haliwa-Saponi tribe members, is called hereditary benign intraepithelial dyskeratosis (HBID). Herein, we present a new form of corneal intraepithelial dyskeratosis for which we identified the causative gene by using deep sequencing technology. A seven member Caucasian French family with two corneal intraepithelial dyskeratosis affected individuals (6-year-old proband and his mother) was ascertained. The proband presented with bilateral complete corneal opacification and dyskeratosis. Palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and laryngeal dyskeratosis were associated with the phenotype. Histopathology studies of cornea and vocal cord biopsies showed dyskeratotic keratinisation. Quantitative PCR ruled out 4q35 duplication, classically described in HBID cases. Next generation sequencing with mean coverage of 50× using the Illumina Hi Seq and whole exome capture processing was performed. Sequence reads were aligned, and screened for single nucleotide variants and insertion/deletion calls. In-house pipeline filtering analyses and comparisons with available databases were performed. A novel missense mutation M77T was discovered for the gene NLRP1 which maps to chromosome 17p13.2. This was a de novo mutation in the proband's mother, following segregation in the family, and not found in 738 control DNA samples. NLRP1 expression was determined in adult corneal epithelium. The amino acid change was found to destabilise significantly the protein structure. We describe a new corneal intraepithelial dyskeratosis and how we identified its causative gene. The NLRP1 gene product is implicated in inflammation, autoimmune disorders, and caspase mediated apoptosis. NLRP1 polymorphisms are associated with various diseases. 	J._Med._Genet.

8609404	19960415	Human mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) demonstrates structural and functional similarities to the alpha 4 beta 7-integrin binding domains of murine MAdCAM-1, but extreme divergence of mucin-like sequences.	The mucosal vascular addressin, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), is an Ig family adhesion receptor preferentially expressed by venular endothelial cells at sites of lymphocyte extravasation in murine mucosal lymphoid tissues and lamina propria. MAdCAM-1 specifically binds both human and mouse lymphocytes that express the homing receptor for Peyer's patches, the integrin alpha 4 beta 7. Functional expression cloning was used to isolate a cDNA from a macaque mesenteric lymph node library that encodes the homologue to murine MAdCAM-1. The macaque cDNA was subsequently used to clone the human homologue as well. Expression of human MAdCAM-1 RNA is restricted to mucosal tissues, gut-associated lymphoid tissues and spleen. Human MAdCAM-1 selectively binds both murine and human lymphocyte cell lines expressing alpha 4 beta 7. Human and macaque MAdCAM-1 have two Ig-like domains that are similar to the two amino-terminal integrin binding domains of murine MAdCAM-1. The conservation of sequences within the region homologous to the mucin/IgA domain of murine MAdCAM-1 is, however, much less apparent. These receptors exhibit considerable variation from murine MAdCAM-1 with respect to the length of the mucin-like sequence and the lack of a membrane proximal Ig (IgA-like) domain. The isolation of these different species of MAdCAM-1 demonstrates greater seleoffctive pressure for maintenance of amino acids involved in alpha 4 beta 7 binding than those sequences presumably involved in the presentation of carbohydrates for selectin binding.

9295324	19970920	Cellular UDP-glucose deficiency caused by a single point mutation in the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase gene.	We previously isolated a mutant cell that is the only mammalian cell reported to have a persistently low level of UDP-glucose. In this work we obtained a spontaneous revertant whose UDP-glucose level lies between those found in the wild type and the mutant cell. The activity of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UDPG:PP), the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of UDP-glucose, was in the mutant 4% and in the revertant 56% of the activity found in the wild type cell. Sequence analysis of UDPG: PP cDNAs from the mutant cell showed one missense mutation, which changes amino acid residue 115 from glycine to aspartic acid. The substituted glycine is located within the largest stretch of strictly conserved residues among eukaryotic UDPG:PPs. The analysis of the cDNAs from the revertant cell indicated the presence of an equimolar mixture of the wild type and the mutated mRNAs, suggesting that the mutation has reverted in only one of the alleles. In summary, we demonstrate that the G115D substitution in the Chinese hamster UDPG:PP dramatically impairs its enzymatic activity, thereby causing cellular UDP-glucose deficiency. 	J._Biol._Chem.

20507924	20100529	Novel mutations in the long isoform of the USH2A gene in patients with Usher syndrome type II or non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa.	Usher syndrome type II (USH2) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss. Mutations in the USH2A gene are the most common cause of USH2 and are also a cause of some forms of RP without hearing loss (ie, non-syndromic RP). The USH2A gene was initially identified as a transcript comprised of 21 exons but subsequently a longer isoform containing 72 exons was identified. The 51 exons unique to the long isoform of USH2A were screened for mutations among a core set of 108 patients diagnosed with USH2 and 80 patients with non-syndromic RP who were all included in a previously reported screen of the short isoform of USH2A. For several exons, additional patients were screened. In total, 35 deleterious mutations were identified including 17 nonsense mutations, 9 frameshift mutations, 5 splice-site mutations, and 4 small in-frame deletions or insertions. Twenty-seven mutations were novel. In addition, 65 rare missense changes were identified. A method of classifying the deleterious effect of the missense changes was developed using the summed results of four different mutation assessment algorithms, SIFT, pMUT, PolyPhen, and AGVGD. This system classified 8 of the 65 changes as 'likely deleterious' and 9 as 'possibly deleterious'. At least one mutation was identified in 57-63% of USH2 cases and 19-23% of cases of non-syndromic recessive RP (calculated without and including probable/possible deleterious changes) thus supporting that USH2A is the most common known cause of RP in the USA.

10854111	20000615	Small in-frame deletions and missense mutations in CADASIL: 3D models predict misfolding of Notch3 EGF-like repeat domains.	CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) is a hereditary microangiopathic condition causing stroke in young adults. The responsible gene has recently been identified as the Notch3 gene. Notch3 encodes a large transmembrane receptor with 34 extracellularly localised epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeat domains. We screened 71 unrelated CADASIL families for mutations in two exons coding for the first five EGF-like repeats and found mutations in 70% of the families (n = 50). Two types of mutations were identified: 48 families (96%) had missense mutations and two families (4%) had small in-frame deletions. Seven mutations occurred multiple times. All of them are C to T transitions that affect CpG dinucleotides, suggesting that their multiple occurrence is due to the hypermutability of this sequence. All mutations, including the two deletions, result in the gain or loss of a cysteine residue, thus substantiating the pivotal role of an uneven number of cysteine residues within EGF-like repeat domains of Notch3 in the pathogenesis of CADASIL. To study the potential effects of these mutations 3D homology models of the first six EGF domains were generated on the basis of NMR data from human fibrillin-1. These models predict domain misfolding for a subset of mutations. 	Eur._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
9032114	19970301	Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene in MODY and early-onset NIDDM: evidence for a mutational hotspot in exon 4.	We have recently shown that mutations in the gene encoding the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha are the cause of one form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY3). Here, we report the exon-intron organization and partial sequence of the human HNF-1alpha gene. In addition, we have screened the ten exons and flanking introns of this gene for mutations in a group of 25 unrelated white subjects from Germany who presented with NIDDM before 35 years of age and had a first-degree relative with NIDDM. Mutations were identified in nine of these individuals, suggesting that mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene are a common cause of diabetes in German subjects with early-onset NIDDM and a family history of diabetes. Thus, screening for mutations in this gene may be indicated in subjects with early-onset NIDDM. Interestingly, three of the nine mutations occurred at the same site in exon 4 with insertion of a C in a polyC tract, centered around codon 290 (designated Pro291fsinsC), thereby resulting in a frameshift during translation and premature termination. Analyses of linked DNA polymorphisms in the HNF-1alpha gene indicated that the Pro291fsinsC mutation was present on a different haplotype in each subject, implying that the polyC tract represents a mutational hot spot. We have also identified the mutation in the HNF-1alpha gene in the Jutland pedigree, one of the original MODY pedigrees reported in the literature, as being a T--&gt;G substitution in codon 241, resulting in the replacement of a conserved Cys by Gly (C241G). The information on the sequence of the HNF-1alpha gene and its promoter region will facilitate the search for mutations in other subjects and studies of the role of the gene in determining normal beta-cell functions.

2977358	19881220	Two human genes isolated by a novel method encode DNA-binding proteins containing a common region of homology.	Two cDNAs encoding new DNA-binding proteins (Dbps) have been cloned using a human placenta lambda gt11 recombinant cDNA library and DNA fragments as probes. Hybrid proteins expressed by the lambda gt11 cDNA library were blotted onto nitrocellulose filters, and incubated with three different radio-labeled DNA probes containing the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor enhancer or the human c-erbB-2 promoter. Two kinds of clones, named dbpA and dbpB, showed high affinities for the DNA probes. The comparison of the nucleotide and the deduced amino acid (aa) sequences between these two cDNAs indicated that 100 of 109 aa located in the central region of these two Dbps were identical. The dbpA and dbpB-coded proteins also had an affinity for other cDNA probes such as the human c-ski gene, but not for poly(dI-dC).poly(dI-dC), suggesting that the sequence(s) recognized by the dbpA and dbpB-coded proteins may occur frequently, or that these proteins bind to DNA non-specifically in a different manner from that of histones. A simple method, described in this paper, can be used to isolate cDNA clones encoding Dbps. Strategies used for the detection of sequence-specific and non-specific Dbps are discussed. 	Gene	D016428
11106718	20001207	Mutations in sarcomere protein genes as a cause of dilated cardiomyopathy.	The molecular basis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, a primary myocardial disorder that results in reduced contractile function, is largely unknown. Some cases of familial dilated cardiomyopathy are caused by mutations in cardiac cytoskeletal proteins; this finding implicates defects in contractile-force transmission as one mechanism underlying this disorder. To elucidate this important cause of heart failure, we investigated other genetic causes of dilated cardiomyopathy. Clinical evaluations were performed in 21 kindreds with familial dilated cardiomyopathy. A genome-wide linkage study prompted a search of the genes encoding beta-myosin heavy chain, troponin T, troponin I, and alpha-tropomyosin for disease-causing mutations. A genetic locus for mutations associated with dilated cardiomyopathy was identified at chromosome 14q11.2-13 (maximal lod score, 5.11; theta=0), where the gene for cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain is encoded. Analyses of this and other genes for sarcomere proteins identified disease-causing dominant mutations in four kindreds. Cardiac beta-myosin heavy-chain missense mutations (Ser532Pro and Phe764Leu) and a deletion in cardiac troponin T (deltaLys210) caused early-onset ventricular dilatation (average age at diagnosis, 24 years) and diminished contractile function and frequently resulted in heart failure. Affected persons had neither antecedent cardiac hypertrophy (average maximal left-ventricular-wall thickness, 8.5 mm) nor histopathological findings characteristic of hypertrophy. Mutations in sarcomere protein genes account for approximately 10 percent of cases of familial dilated cardiomyopathy and are particularly prevalent in families with early-onset ventricular dilatation and dysfunction. Because distinct mutations in sarcomere proteins cause either dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the effects of mutant sarcomere proteins on muscle mechanics must trigger two different series of events that remodel the heart.

12473748	20021211	Identification and cloning of human polynucleotide phosphorylase, hPNPase old-35, in the context of terminal differentiation and cellular senescence.	Terminal differentiation and cellular senescence display common properties including irreversible growth arrest. To define the molecular and ultimately the biochemical basis of the complex physiological changes associated with terminal differentiation and senescence, an overlapping-pathway screen was used to identify genes displaying coordinated expression as a consequence of both processes. This approach involved screening of a subtracted cDNA library prepared from human melanoma cells induced to terminally differentiate by treatment with fibroblast IFN and mezerein with mRNA derived from senescent human progeria cells. This strategy identified old-35, which encodes an evolutionary conserved gene, human polynucleotide phosphorylase (hPNPase(old-35)), that is regulated predominantly by type I IFNs. The hPNPase(OLD-35) protein localizes in the cytoplasm of human cells and induces RNA degradation in vitro, as does its purified bacterial protein homologue. Ectopic expression of hPNPase(old-35) in human melanoma cells reduces colony formation, confirming inhibitory activity of this RNA-degradation enzyme. Identification of hPNPase(old-35), an IFN-inducible 3'-5' RNA exonuclease, provides additional support for a relationship between IFN action and RNA processing and suggests an important role for this gene in growth control associated with terminal differentiation and cellular senescence.

19241098	20090226	Novel mutations in the CDKL5 gene, predicted effects and associated phenotypes.	It has been found that CDKL5 gene mutations are responsible for early-onset epilepsy and drug resistance. We screened a population of 92 patients with classic/atypical Rett syndrome, 17 Angelman/Angelman-like patients and six idiopathic autistic patients for CDKL5 mutations and exon deletions and identified seven novel mutations: six in the Rett subset and one in an Angelman patient. This last, an insertion in exon 11, c.903_904 dupGA, p.Leu302Aspfx49X, is associated with a relatively mild clinical presentation as the patient is the only one capable of sitting and walking alone. Of the six mutations, two are de novo missense changes affecting highly conserved aminoacid residues, c.215 T &gt; C p.Ile72Thr and c.380A &gt; G p.His127Arg (present in a mosaic condition) found in two girls with the most severe clinical presentation, while the remaining are the splicing c.145 + 2 T &gt; C and c.2376 + 5G &gt; A, the c.1648C &gt; T p.Arg550X and the MPLA-identified c.162_99del261 mutation. RNA characterisation of four mutations revealed the aberrant transcript of the missense allele (case 2) and not the stop mutation (case 3), but also allowed the splicing mutation (case 1) and the c.-162_99del261 (case 4) to be categorised as truncating. The obtained data reinforce the view that a more severe phenotype is due more to an altered protein than haploinsufficiency. Furthermore, the mutational repertoire of the CDKL5 gene is shown to be expanded by testing patients with phenotypical overlap to Rett syndrome and applying multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification.

7926722	19940515	The DCC gene product in cellular differentiation and colorectal tumorigenesis.	The analysis of human colorectal tumors has revealed frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the long arm of chromosome 18. A novel gene, DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), located within the region of LOH on chromosome 18q was identified and has been implicated as a tumor suppressor gene. We have now shown that DCC encodes a membrane-bound protein of the immunoglobulin-CAM family, as demonstrated by cell-surface labeling, immunohistochemical analysis, and sequencing of cDNA clones. The DCC protein was found in axons of the central and peripheral nervous system and in differentiated cell types of the intestine. Colorectal tumors that lost their capacity to differentiate into mucus producing cells uniformly lacked DCC expression and loss of a chromosome 18q allele was often accompanied by loss of DCC expression in colon tumors. These results provide evidence that DCC encodes a cell surface-localized protein and emphasize the inverse relationship between differentiation and tumorigenesis. 	Genes_Dev.	D016428 D013485 D013487
11159935	20010213	Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA): effect of TRKA (NTRK1) missense mutations on autophosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinase for nerve growth factor.	Human TRKA (NTRK1) encodes the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) for nerve growth factor (NGF) and is the gene responsible for congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a lack of pain sensation and anhidrosis. We reported 11 putative missense mutations in 31 CIPA families from various ethnic groups. Here we have introduced the corresponding mutations into the TRKA cDNA and examined NGF-stimulated autophosphorylation. We find that wild-type TRKA precursor proteins in a neuronal and a non-neuronal cell line were differentially processed and phosphorylated in an NGF-dependent and -independent manner, respectively. Two mutants (L93P and L213P) in the extracellular domain were aberrantly processed and showed diminished autophosphorylation in neuronal cells. Five mutants (G516R, G571R, R643W, R648C and G708S) in the tyrosine kinase domain were processed as wild-type TRKA but showed significantly diminished autophosphorylation in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. In contrast, R85S and (H598Y; G607V), detected previously as double and triple mutations, are probably polymorphisms in a particular ethnic background. The other putative mutant D668Y might be a rare polymorphism or might impair the function of TRKA without compromising autophosphorylation. Mutated residues in the tyrosine kinase domain are conserved in various RTKs and probably contribute to critical function of these proteins. Thus, naturally occurring TRKA missense mutations with loss of function provide considerable insight into the structure-function relationship in the RTK family. Our data may aid in developing a drug which targets the clinically devastating 'complex regional pain syndrome'. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D013485
24362817	20131224	Germline loss-of-function mutations in LZTR1 predispose to an inherited disorder of multiple schwannomas.	Constitutional SMARCB1 mutations at 22q11.23 have been found in ?50% of familial and &lt;10% of sporadic schwannomatosis cases. We sequenced highly conserved regions along 22q from eight individuals with schwannomatosis whose schwannomas involved somatic loss of one copy of 22q, encompassing SMARCB1 and NF2, with a different somatic mutation of the other NF2 allele in every schwannoma but no mutation of the remaining SMARCB1 allele in blood and tumor samples. LZTR1 germline mutations were identified in seven of the eight cases. LZTR1 sequencing in 12 further cases with the same molecular signature identified 9 additional germline mutations. Loss of heterozygosity with retention of an LZTR1 mutation was present in all 25 schwannomas studied. Mutations segregated with disease in all available affected first-degree relatives, although four asymptomatic parents also carried an LZTR1 mutation. Our findings identify LZTR1 as a gene predisposing to an autosomal dominant inherited disorder of multiple schwannomas in ?80% of 22q-related schwannomatosis cases lacking mutation in SMARCB1.

10720040	20000317	Predicting phenotype in steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency? Comprehensive genotyping in 155 unrelated, well defined patients from southern Germany.	Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders. CAH is most often caused by deficiency of steroid 21-hydroxylase. The frequency of CYP21-inactivating mutations and the genotype-phenotype relationship were characterized in 155 well defined unrelated CAH patients. We were able to elucidate 306 of 310 disease-causing alleles (diagnostic sensitivity, 98.7%). The most frequent mutation was the intron 2 splice site mutation (30.3%), followed by gene deletions (20.3%), the I172N mutation (19.7%) and large gene conversions (7.1%). Five point mutations were detected that have not been described in other CAH cohorts. Genotypes were categorized in 4 mutation groups (null, A, B, and C) according to their predicted functional consequences and compared to the clinical phenotype. The positive predictive value for null mutations (ppv(null)) was 100%, as all patients with these mutations had a salt-wasting phenotype. In mutation group A (intron 2 splice site mutation in homozygous or heterozygous form with a null mutation), the ppv(A) to manifest with salt-wasting CAH was 90%. In group B predicted to result in simple virilizing CAH (I172N in homozygous or compound heterozygous form with a more severe mutation), ppv(B) was 74%. In group C (P30L, V281L, P453S in homozygous or compound heterozygous form with a more severe mutation), ppv(C) was 64.7% to exhibit the nonclassical form of CAH, but 90% when excluding the P30L mutation. Thus, in general, a good genotype-phenotype relationship is shown in patients with either the severest or the mildest mutations. A considerable degree of divergence is observed within mutation groups of intermediate severity. As yet undefined factors modifying 21-hydroxylase gene expression and steroid hormone action are likely to account for these differences in phenotypic expression. 	J._Clin._Endocrinol._Metab.

23542698	20130402	Recessive mutations in DGKE cause atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome.	Pathologic thrombosis is a major cause of mortality. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) features episodes of small-vessel thrombosis resulting in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal failure. Atypical HUS (aHUS) can result from genetic or autoimmune factors that lead to pathologic complement cascade activation. Using exome sequencing, we identified recessive mutations in DGKE (encoding diacylglycerol kinase ?) that co-segregated with aHUS in nine unrelated kindreds, defining a distinctive Mendelian disease. Affected individuals present with aHUS before age 1 year, have persistent hypertension, hematuria and proteinuria (sometimes in the nephrotic range), and develop chronic kidney disease with age. DGKE is found in endothelium, platelets and podocytes. Arachidonic acid-containing diacylglycerols (DAG) activate protein kinase C (PKC), which promotes thrombosis, and DGKE normally inactivates DAG signaling. We infer that loss of DGKE function results in a prothrombotic state. These findings identify a new mechanism of pathologic thrombosis and kidney failure and have immediate implications for treating individuals with aHUS. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013485
8100215	19930501	A restriction fragment length polymorphism results in a nonconservative amino acid substitution encoded within the first exon of the human lysyl oxidase gene.	A cDNA covering most of the coding sequence for human lysyl oxidase was used to screen, by Southern blot analysis, genomic DNA from circulating lymphocytes obtained from unrelated, apparently normal individuals. A heritable restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) within a PstI restriction site was detected in 36% of individuals screened (a total of 72 chromosomes were analyzed). The major allele was represented as a 1.7-kb PstI restriction fragment. The minor allele was detected as 1.4 and 0.3kb restriction fragments. Lambda phage-DNA recombinants were isolated from a human lung fibroblast genomic DNA library using the human lysyl oxidase cDNA clone. DNA sequence analysis of several selected phage recombinants revealed that 83% of the coding sequence of lysyl oxidase was localized in four separate exons. Analysis of the coding sequence within exon 1, the most 5' exon within the lysyl oxidase gene, revealed that the PstI RFLP was due to a G--&gt;A transition resulting in a nonconservative arginine to glutamine substitution proximal to a propeptide cleavage domain encoded by exon 1 of the lysyl oxidase gene.

8294199	19931001	Hb Melusine [alpha 114(GH2)Pro--&gt;Ser]: a new neutral hemoglobin variant.	Hb Melusine [alpha 114(GH2)Pro--&gt;Ser] was found in an Algerian patient during a systematic screening for hemoglobinopathies performed in Luxembourg. The abnormal hemoglobin was suspected when a thickening of the Hb A band was observed by isoelectrofocusing. The mutant hemoglobin was silent in all other electrophoretic methods used for presumptive diagnosis with the exception of globin electrophoresis in the presence of Triton X-100. This technique revealed an alpha chain considerably more hydrophobic than normal. The structural abnormality of Hb Melusine concerns position alpha 114(GH2) that belongs to a cluster of hydrophobic residues localized in the N-terminal half of the alpha T-12b tryptic peptide. It has been shown in the case of another variant of that position (Hb Nouakchott), that the replacement of the Pro GH2 by a Leu was responsible for a dramatic increase in the retention time of the alpha polypeptide chain during reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography, much higher than that reported for similar substitutions in other regions of the hemoglobin molecule.

10468599	19990901	Three new allelic mouse mutations that cause skeletal overgrowth involve the natriuretic peptide receptor C gene (Npr3).	In 1979, a BALB/cJ mouse was identified with an exceptionally long body. This phenotype was found to be caused by a recessive mutation, designated longjohn (lgj), that mapped to the proximal region of chromosome 15. Several years later, a mouse with a similarly elongated body was identified in an outbred stock after chemical mutagenesis with ethylnitrosourea. This phenotype also was caused by a recessive mutation, designated strigosus (stri). The two mutations were found to be allelic. A third allele was identified in a DBA/2J mouse and was designated longjohn-2J (lgj(2J)). Analysis of skeletal preparations of stri/stri mice indicated that the endochondral ossification process was slightly delayed, resulting in an extended proliferation zone. A recent study reported that mice overexpressing brain natriuretic peptide, one of the members of the natriuretic peptide family, exhibit a skeletal-overgrowth syndrome with endochondral ossification defects. The Npr3 gene coding for type C receptor for natriuretic peptides (NPR-C), which is mainly involved in the clearance of the natriuretic peptides, mapped in the vicinity of our mouse mutations and thus was a candidate gene. The present study reports that all three mutations involve the Npr3 gene and provides evidence in vivo that there is a natriuretic-related bone pathway, underscoring the importance of natriuretic peptide clearance by natriuretic peptide type C receptor.

19061985	20081209	Ribosomal protein L5 and L11 mutations are associated with cleft palate and abnormal thumbs in Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients.	Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a congenital bone-marrow-failure syndrome, is characterized by red blood cell aplasia, macrocytic anemia, clinical heterogeneity, and increased risk of malignancy. Although anemia is the most prominent feature of DBA, the disease is also characterized by growth retardation and congenital anomalies that are present in approximately 30%-50% of patients. The disease has been associated with mutations in four ribosomal protein (RP) genes, RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, and RPL35A, in about 30% of patients. However, the genetic basis of the remaining 70% of cases is still unknown. Here, we report the second known mutation in RPS17 and probable pathogenic mutations in three more RP genes, RPL5, RPL11, and RPS7. In addition, we identified rare variants of unknown significance in three other genes, RPL36, RPS15, and RPS27A. Remarkably, careful review of the clinical data showed that mutations in RPL5 are associated with multiple physical abnormalities, including craniofacial, thumb, and heart anomalies, whereas isolated thumb malformations are predominantly present in patients carrying mutations in RPL11. We also demonstrate that mutations of RPL5, RPL11, or RPS7 in DBA cells is associated with diverse defects in the maturation of ribosomal RNAs in the large or the small ribosomal subunit production pathway, expanding the repertoire of ribosomal RNA processing defects associated with DBA.

23988467	20130831	Novel de novo SCN2A mutation in a child with migrating focal seizures of infancy.	Migrating focal seizures of infancy are characterized by seizure onset within 7 months of age, migrating focal motor seizures with multifocal ictal electroencephalography discharges intractable to conventional antiepileptic drugs, and poor prognosis. Reported genetic etiologies include SCN1A and KCNT1 mutations and homozygous deletion of the PLCB1 gene. Here we report a novel SCN2A mutation in a child with this syndrome. A 7-week-old girl was admitted to our hospital for management of status epilepticus. She was the product of a full-term unremarkable pregnancy. Seizures started around 5 weeks of age and remained medically refractory. Electroencephalography showed multifocal epileptiform discharges as well as seizures arising from multifocal regions in both cerebral hemispheres. Based on her phenotype, a diagnosis of migrating focal seizures of infancy was made. A novel de novo missense mutation was identified in the SCN2A gene, exon 22 (coding for voltage-gated sodium channel type II): c.3977T&gt;A (p.V1326D). This mutation affects a highly evolutionarily conserved area of the gene and replaces hydrophobic nonpolar valine with polar aspartic acid; thus, it is predicted to affect protein function and is presumed pathogenic. This report expands our knowledge of the genetic basis of migrating focal seizures of infancy to include mutations in SCN2A gene. 	Pediatr._Neurol.	D002363 D016428
7668283	19950901	Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA: identification of a common missense mutation I113F in the N-Acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase gene.	Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase. The recent isolation and characterization of cDNA and genomic sequences encoding GALNS has facilitated identification of the molecular lesions that cause MPS IVA. We identified a common missense mutation among Caucasian MPS IVA patients. The mutation was originally detected by SSCP, and successive sequencing revealed an A--&gt;T transversion at nt 393. This substitution altered the isoleucine at position 113 to phenylalanine (I113F) in the 622 amino acid GALNS protein and was associated with a severe phenotype in a homozygote. Compound heterozygotes with one I113F-allele mutation have a wide range of clinical phenotypes. Transfection experiments in GALNS-deficient fibroblasts revealed that the mutation drastically reduces the enzyme activity of GALNS. Allele-specific oligonucleotide or SSCP analysis indicated that this mutation accounted for 22.5% (9/40) of unrelated MPS IVA chromosomes from 23 Caucasian patients, including 6 consanguineous cases. Of interest, the I1e 113--&gt;Phe substitution occurred in only Caucasian MPS IVA patients and in none of the GALNS alleles of 20 Japanese patients. These findings identify a frequent missense mutation among MPS IVA patients of Caucasian ancestry, that results in severe MPS IVA when homoallelic, and will facilitate molecular diagnosis of most such patients and identification of heterozygous carriers. In addition to this common mutation, 10 different point mutations and 2 small deletions were detected, suggesting allelic heterogeneity in GALNS gene. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
22661499	20120605	The spectrum of mutations that underlie the neuromuscular junction synaptopathy in DOK7 congenital myasthenic syndrome.	Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a group of inherited diseases that affect synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction and result in fatiguable muscle weakness. A subgroup of CMS patients have a recessively inherited limb-girdle pattern of weakness caused by mutations in DOK7. DOK7 encodes DOK7, an adaptor protein that is expressed in the skeletal muscle and heart and that is essential for the development and maintenance of the neuromuscular junction. We have screened the DOK7 gene for mutations by polymerase chain reaction amplification and bi-directional sequencing of exonic and promoter regions and performed acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering assays and used exon trapping to determine the pathogenicity of detected variants. Approximately 18% of genetically diagnosed CMSs in the UK have mutations in DOK7, with mutations in this gene identified in more than 60 kinships to date. Thirty-four different pathogenic mutations were identified as well as 27 variants likely to be non-pathogenic. An exon 7 frameshift duplication c.1124_1127dupTGCC is commonly found in at least one allele. We analyse the effect of the common frameshift c.1124_1127dupTGCC and show that 10/11 suspected missense mutations have a deleterious effect on AChR clustering. We identify for the first time homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations that are localized 5' to exon 7. In addition, three silent variants in the N-terminal half of DOK7 are predicted to alter the splicing of the DOK7 RNA transcript. The DOK7 gene is highly polymorphic, and within these many variants, we define a spectrum of mutations that can underlie DOK7 CMS that will inform in managing this disorder. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.

24852644	20140524	Mutation in TMEM98 in a large white kindred with autosomal dominant nanophthalmos linked to 17p12-q12.	Nanophthalmos is a congenital disorder characterized by small eyes, with the main complications being severe hyperopia and angle-closure glaucoma. To perform a clinical and genetic investigation of a large white family with autosomal dominant nanophthalmos. Detailed clinical evaluation and a genome-wide linkage scan was conducted in the family NNO-SA1. Linkage was evaluated with a 10K single-nucleotide polymorphism array, followed by whole exome sequencing, to identify novel segregating coding variants within the linked region. The candidate gene was screened for mutations in additional independent families by direct sequencing of the coding exons and intron/exon boundaries. The expression pattern of the candidate gene in ocular tissues was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Participants were recruited through ophthalmology clinics at Flinders Medical Centre, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia. Nanophthalmos was defined as an axial length less than 20.0 mm and/or refractive error greater than +7.00. Of the 35 available individuals from family NNO-SA1, 16 participants (46%) had a diagnosis of nanophthalmos, with mean refraction of +11.8 D and mean axial length of 17.6 mm. Unaffected unrelated individuals serving as controls were screened for the identified mutation. Additional independent families with clinically diagnosed nanophthalmos were also recruited. Nanophthalmos status. Significant linkage was detected on chromosome 17 between single-nucleotide polymorphism markers rs2323659 and rs967293, with a maximum location score of 4.1. Exome sequencing identified a single novel segregating missense variant within the linkage region located in exon 8 of the transmembrane-98 (TMEM98) gene c.577G&gt;C (p.Ala193Pro), which was absent in the Exome Variant Server database and among 285 local white individuals serving as controls. The TMEM98 gene was expressed in all ocular tissues tested including sclera and optic nerve head. A novel gene associated with nanophthalmos, TMEM98 most likely represents the cause of the disease in this family. To our knowledge, this represents the first gene identified causing autosomal dominant nanophthalmos. 	JAMA_Ophthalmol	D016428 D013485
11350191	20010515	Mutation analysis of the MCM gene in Israeli patients with mut(0) disease.	Three novel mutations (IVS8+3a --&gt; g, N219Y, and E414X) were identified in 6 unrelated patients with mut(0) methylmalonic aciduria. The presence of a wild-type along with rearranged fragments in homozygotes for the IVS8+3a --&gt; g mutation may contribute to their later age of onset (3-11 months of age). Nonetheless, delayed onset was not associated with better neurological outcome and prolonged survival. The large number of undiagnosed dead sibs in most families suggests that the disease is largely underdiagnosed in this region. 	Mol._Genet._Metab.	D002363 D016428 D013485
11502588	20010815	Cloning and characterization of the human urea transporter UT-A1 and mapping of the human Slc14a2 gene.	We have isolated and characterized the human homolog of the rat largest urea transporter of the UT-A family (hUT-A1). The 4.2-kb hUT-A1 cDNA encodes a 920-amino acid peptide, which is 89% identical to the rat UT-A1 protein. By Northern hybridization, hUT-A1 expression is detected in the human inner medulla as a approximately 4.4-kb mRNA transcript. By Western analysis, hUT-A1 is identified as a approximately 100-kDa protein in the human inner medulla. By immunohistochemistry, hUT-A1 expression is localized to the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD). When transfected into HEK-293 cells hUT-A1 cDNA is translated into a approximately 98-kDa protein. Expression of hUT-A1 in Xenopus oocytes results in phloretin-inhibitable uptake of (14)C-urea, which shows only modest stimulation by cAMP, suggesting that in the human IMCD vasopressin may have a limited role in the short-term regulation of hUT-A1-mediated urea transport. We determined the organization of the human Slc14a2 gene and identified 20 exons distributed over approximately 67.5 kb on chromosome 18, from which hUT-A1 and the other human urea transporter, hUT-A2, are transcribed.

16625196	20060421	DNA sequence of human chromosome 17 and analysis of rearrangement in the human lineage.	Chromosome 17 is unusual among the human chromosomes in many respects. It is the largest human autosome with orthology to only a single mouse chromosome, mapping entirely to the distal half of mouse chromosome 11. Chromosome 17 is rich in protein-coding genes, having the second highest gene density in the genome. It is also enriched in segmental duplications, ranking third in density among the autosomes. Here we report a finished sequence for human chromosome 17, as well as a structural comparison with the finished sequence for mouse chromosome 11, the first finished mouse chromosome. Comparison of the orthologous regions reveals striking differences. In contrast to the typical pattern seen in mammalian evolution, the human sequence has undergone extensive intrachromosomal rearrangement, whereas the mouse sequence has been remarkably stable. Moreover, although the human sequence has a high density of segmental duplication, the mouse sequence has a very low density. Notably, these segmental duplications correspond closely to the sites of structural rearrangement, demonstrating a link between duplication and rearrangement. Examination of the main classes of duplicated segments provides insight into the dynamics underlying expansion of chromosome-specific, low-copy repeats in the human genome.

6354707	19830101	Structure and expression of the mouse beta 2-microglobulin gene isolated from somatic and non-expressing teratocarcinoma cells.	Mouse teratocarcinoma cells express neither H-2 heavy chains nor beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m). We have constructed two genomic libraries, one from PCC4-aza-RI embryonal carcinoma cells and the other from their adult syngenic counterpart 129/Sv liver cells (H-2bc). The libraries were screened with a full length mouse beta 2-m cDNA probe which we isolated and sequenced. Two cosmid clones carrying the entire beta 2-m gene were isolated, one from each library. There was no detectable difference in structure between the two genes. Furthermore, both were shown to be active and to restore beta 2-m synthesis upon transfer into mutant cells deficient in beta 2-m. Irreversible DNA alterations in or around the beta 2-m gene are thus unlikely to account for the lack of beta 2-m gene expression in embryonal teratocarcinoma cells. 	EMBO_J.	D003160 D016428 D013485
9043869	19960101	Exon-scanning mutation analysis of the ATM gene in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia.	Using a polymerase chain reaction single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) assay, which amplifies individually all coding exons of the ATM gene deficient ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), we have analyzed 10 patients with A-T for ATM mutations. Mutation were detected in 9 patients. We describe the first ATM mutation in the splice junction found in the 5' splice site of intron 17, leading to exon skipping. However, most mutations were small deletions or insertions resulting in premature termination of the translation product. The development of DNA-based methods for detection of unknown mutations and further characterization of ATM mutation pattern will facilitate identification of A-T carriers and assessment of their cancer risk.

23738509	20130607	Central precocious puberty caused by mutations in the imprinted gene MKRN3.	The onset of puberty is first detected as an increase in pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis results in central precocious puberty. The timing of pubertal development is driven in part by genetic factors, but only a few, rare molecular defects associated with central precocious puberty have been identified. We performed whole-exome sequencing in 40 members of 15 families with central precocious puberty. Candidate variants were confirmed with Sanger sequencing. We also performed quantitative real-time polymerase-chain-reaction assays to determine levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) in the hypothalami of mice at different ages. We identified four novel heterozygous mutations in MKRN3, the gene encoding makorin RING-finger protein 3, in 5 of the 15 families; both sexes were affected. The mutations included three frameshift mutations, predicted to encode truncated proteins, and one missense mutation, predicted to disrupt protein function. MKRN3 is a paternally expressed, imprinted gene located in the Prader-Willi syndrome critical region (chromosome 15q11-q13). All affected persons inherited the mutations from their fathers, a finding that indicates perfect segregation with the mode of inheritance expected for an imprinted gene. Levels of Mkrn3 mRNA were high in the arcuate nucleus of prepubertal mice, decreased immediately before puberty, and remained low after puberty. Deficiency of MKRN3 causes central precocious puberty in humans. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.). 	N._Engl._J._Med.	D016428 D052061 D013485
11166164	20010213	Mild phenotype of nemaline myopathy with sleep hypoventilation due to a mutation in the skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) gene.	Nemaline myopathy is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition. The clinical spectrum ranges from severe cases with antenatal or neonatal onset and early death to late onset cases with only slow progression. Three genes are known to cause nemaline myopathy: the genes for nebulin (NEB) on chromosome 2q22, slow alpha-tropomyosin (TPM3) on chromosome 1q21 and skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) on chromosome 1q42. We present a 39-year-old lady with a mild form of nemaline myopathy, whom we have followed over a period of 25 years. She presented at the age of 7 years with symptoms of mild axial and proximal muscle weakness. The overall course was essentially static, but at 36 years, she went into life-threatening respiratory failure, for which she is currently treated with night-time ventilation. Muscle biopsies at 12, 17 and 39 years of age showed typical nemaline rods, particularly in type 1 fibres. Areas with unevenness of oxidative stain were present in the second and third biopsies. The presence of rods and core-like areas was confirmed on electron microscopy. There was no detectable alteration in actin expression immunocytochemically. A dominant missense mutation in the skeletal muscle alpha-actin gene (ACTA1) was found. This case illustrates the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of nemaline myopathy, and one phenotype of the wide spectrum of severity caused by mutations in the skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) gene. In addition, it shows the diversity of pathological features that can occur in congenital myopathies due to mutations in the same gene. 	Neuromuscul._Disord.	D002363 D016428 D013485
10408779	19990717	Genomic structure and identification of 11 novel mutations of the PEX6 (peroxisome assembly factor-2) gene in patients with peroxisome biogenesis disorders.	The PEX6 (peroxisome assembly factor-2, PAF-2) gene encodes a member of the AAA protein (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) family and restores peroxisome assembly in fibroblasts from peroxisome biogenesis disorder patients belonging to complementation group C (group 4 in the United States). We have now clarified the genomic DNA structure of human PEX6 and identified mutations in patients from various ethnic groups. The human PEX6 gene consists of 17 exons and 16 introns, spanning about 14kb. The largest exon, exon 1, has at least 952 bp nucleotides. Eleven novel mutations (18 alleles) were identified by direct sequencing of the PEX6 cDNA from 10 patients. All these mutations have been confirmed in the corresponding genomic DNA. There was no common mutation, but an exon skip was identified in two unrelated Japanese patients. Most of the mutations led to premature termination or large deletions of the PEX6 protein and resulted in the most severe peroxisome biogenesis disorder phenotype of Zellweger syndrome. A patient with an atypical Zellweger syndrome had a missense mutation that was shown to disrupt the cell's ability to form peroxisomes. This mutation analysis will aid in understanding the functions of the PEX6 protein in peroxisomal biogenesis. Hum Mutat 13:487-496, 1999. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428 D013485
16401616	20060113	Mutational analysis of the PINK1 gene in early-onset parkinsonism in Europe and North Africa.	Parkinson's disease is a frequent disorder caused primarily by the loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Mutations in the PTEN-induced kinase (PINK1) gene, in addition to those in parkin and DJ-1, have been found in families with recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease. We screened for parkin and PINK1 mutations in a panel of 177 autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease families with ages at onset &lt; or =60 years, mostly from Europe. In 7 unrelated families, we identified 10 pathogenic PINK1 mutations (5 missense, 2 nonsense and 3 frameshift deletion mutations), 8 of which were novel. All the mutations were in the homozygous or compound heterozygous states. Interestingly, pseudo-dominant inheritance was observed in a family with two different mutations. The clinical characteristics of 12 PINK1 patients and 114 parkin patients were similar, even for signs such as dystonia at onset and increased reflexes, which were thought to be specific to parkin. In contrast, onset in patients with PINK1 mutations was earlier and increased reflexes were found more frequently than in patients without PINK1 or parkin mutations. These results suggest that PINK1 is the second most frequent causative gene in early-onset Parkinson's disease with a slowly progressive phenotype, indistinguishable from early-onset patients with parkin mutations.

8402897	19931008	SREBP-1, a basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper protein that controls transcription of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene.	Sterol regulatory element 1 (SRE-1), a decamer (5'-ATC-ACCCCAC-3') flanking the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene, activates transcription in sterol-depleted cells and is silenced by sterols. We report the cDNA cloning of human SREBP-1, a protein that binds SRE-1, activates transcription, and thereby mediates the final regulatory step in LDL metabolism. SREBP-1 contains a basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLH-ZIP) motif, but it differs from other bHLH-ZIP proteins in its larger size (1147 amino acids) and target sequence. Instead of an inverted repeat (CANNTG), the target for all known bHLH-ZIP proteins, SRE-1 contains a direct repeat of CAC. Overexpression of SREBP-1 activates transcription of reporter genes containing SRE-1 in the absence (15-fold) and presence (90-fold) of sterols, abolishing sterol regulation. We suggest that SREBP-1 is regulated by an unknown factor that is overwhelmed when SREBP-1 is overexpressed. Understanding the regulation of SREBP-1 may be crucial for understanding the control of plasma cholesterol in humans. 	Cell	D003160 D016428 D013485 D013487
22331663	20120215	Mutations in the prostaglandin transporter encoding gene SLCO2A1 cause primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy and isolated digital clubbing.	Digital clubbing is usually secondary to different acquired diseases. Primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (PHO) is a rare hereditary disorder with variable digital clubbing as the most prominent feature, subperiosteal new bone formation, and arthropathy. Recently, mutations in the 15-hydroxy-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) encoding gene HPGD were found to cause PHO. Here, we identified three unrelated families with different mutations in the prostaglandin transporter (PGT) encoding gene SLCO2A1 which presumably result in reduced metabolic clearance by 15-PGDH due to diminished cellular uptake of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) by mutant PGT. In two consanguineous families, homozygous mutations, an intragenic deletion that results in frameshift and a missense mutation, are associated with a severe PHO phenotype. In a third family, a heterozygous carrier of a stop mutation presents with isolated digital clubbing. Thus, our study further supports the importance of PGE(2) metabolism in the pathogenesis of digital clubbing and PHO. 	Hum._Mutat.	D002363 D016428
15356051	20040910	Mutations in the desert hedgehog (DHH) gene in patients with 46,XY complete pure gonadal dysgenesis.	Mutations of SRY are the cause of complete pure gonadal dysgenesis (PGD) in 10-15% of patients. In the remaining individuals, it has been suggested that mutations in other genes involved in the testis-determining pathway could be causative. We describe the first report in which three cases of 46,XY complete PGD are attributed to mutations of the Desert hedgehog (DHH) gene. DHH was sequenced using genomic DNA from paraffin-embedded gonadal tissue from six patients with complete 46,XY PGD. Mutations were found in three patients: a homozygous mutation in exon 2, responsible for a L162P, and a homozygous 1086delG in exon 3. Mutated individuals displayed 46,XY complete PGD, differentiating from the only previously described patient with a homozygous DHH mutation, who exhibited a partial form of PGD with polyneuropathy, suggesting that localization of mutations influence phenotypic expression. This constitutes the first report where mutations of DHH are associated with the presence of 46,XY complete PGD, demonstrating that the genetic origin of this entity is heterogeneous and that disorders in other genes, different from SRY, involved in the testis-determining pathway are implicated in abnormal testicular differentiation in humans. These data extend previous reports demonstrating DHH is a key gene in gonadal differentiation. 	J._Clin._Endocrinol._Metab.	D016428 D013485
9368041	19971231	Evolution of fucosyltransferase genes in vertebrates.	Cloning and expression of chimpanzee FUT3, FUT5, and FUT6 genes confirmed the hypothesis that the gene duplications at the origin of the present human cluster of genes occurred between: (i) the great mammalian radiation 80 million years ago and (ii) the separation of man and chimpanzee 10 million years ago. The phylogeny of fucosyltransferase genes was completed by the addition of the FUT8 family of alpha(1,6)fucosyltransferase genes, which are the oldest genes of the fucosyltransferase family. By analysis of data banks, a new FUT8 alternative splice expressed in human retina was identified, which allowed mapping the human FUT8 gene to 14q23. The results suggest that the fucosyltransferase genes have evolved by successive duplications, followed by translocations, and divergent evolution from a single ancestral gene. 	J._Biol._Chem.

9382091	19971023	Mutation profile of all 49 exons of the human myosin VIIA gene, and haplotype analysis, in Usher 1B families from diverse origins.	Usher syndrome types I (USH1A-USH1E) are a group of autosomal recessive diseases characterized by profound congenital hearing loss, vestibular areflexia, and progressive visual loss due to retinitis pigmentosa. The human myosin VIIA gene, located on 11q14, has been shown to be responsible for Usher syndrome type 1B (USH1B). Haplotypes were constructed in 28 USH1 families by use of the following polymorphic markers spanning the USH1B locus: D11S787, D11S527, D11S1789, D11S906, D11S4186, and OMP. Affected individuals and members of their families from 12 different ethnic origins were screened for the presence of mutations in all 49 exons of the myosin VIIA gene. In 15 families myosin VIIA mutations were detected, verifying their classification as USH1B. All these mutations are novel, including three missense mutations, one premature stop codon, two splicing mutations, one frameshift, and one deletion of &gt;2 kb comprising exons 47 and 48, a part of exon 49, and the introns between them. Three mutations were shared by more than one family, consistent with haplotype similarities. Altogether, 16 USH1B haplotypes were observed in the 15 families; most haplotypes were population specific. Several exonic and intronic polymorphisms were also detected. None of the 20 known USH1B mutations reported so far in other world populations were identified in our families. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
9373179	19971231	Characterization of two receptors for TRAIL.	Two receptors for TRAIL, designated TRAIL-R2 and TRAIL-R3, have been identified. Both are members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. TRAIL-R2 is structurally similar to the death-domain-containing receptor TRAIL-R1 (DR-4), and is capable of inducing apoptosis. In contrast, TRAIL-R3 does not promote cell death. TRAIL-R3 is highly glycosylated and is membrane bound via a putative phosphatidylinositol anchor. The extended structure of TRAIL-R3 is due to the presence of multiple threonine-, alanine-, proline- and glutamine-rich repeats (TAPE repeats). TRAIL-R2 shows a broad tissue distribution, whereas the expression of TRAIL-R3 is restricted to peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and skeletal muscle. All three TRAIL receptors bind TRAIL with similar affinity, suggesting a complex regulation of TRAIL-mediated signals. 	FEBS_Lett.	D016428 D013485
11418480	20010622	The development of lymphomas in families with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome with germline Fas mutations and defective lymphocyte apoptosis.	Lymphomas were studied in kindreds with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS; Canale-Smith syndrome), a disorder of lymphocyte homeostasis usually associated with germline Fas mutations. Fas (CD95/APO-1) is a cell surface receptor that initiates programmed cell death, or apoptosis, of activated lymphocytes. Lymphoma phenotype was determined by immunohistochemistry, frequency of CD3(+)CD4(-)CD8(-) T-cell-receptor alpha/beta cells by flow cytometry, nucleotide sequences of the gene encoding Fas (APT1, TNFRSF6), and the percentage of lymphocytes undergoing apoptosis in vitro. Of 223 members of 39 families, 130 individuals possessed heterozygous germline Fas mutations. Eleven B-cell and T-cell lymphomas of diverse types developed in 10 individuals with mutations in 8 families, up to 48 years after lymphoproliferation was first documented. Their risk of non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphomas, respectively, was 14 and 51 times greater than expected (each P &lt;.001). Investigation of these 10 patients and their relatives with Fas mutations revealed that all had defective lymphocyte apoptosis and most had other features of ALPS. The tumor cells retained the heterozygous Fas mutations found in the peripheral blood and manifested defective Fas-mediated killing. These data implicate a role for Fas-mediated apoptosis in preventing B-cell and T-cell lymphomas. Inherited defects in receptor-mediated lymphocyte apoptosis represent a newly appreciated risk factor for lymphomas. 	Blood	D002363 D016428 D013485 D013487
10090472	19990325	Germline mutations in the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 gene: evidence for frequent splicing defects.	Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is a familial cancer syndrome characterized by parathyroid hyperplasia, pituitary adenomas, and neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas and duodenum. In 1997, the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene was identified, and numerous germline mutations have been reported to be distributed throughout the gene. We used single strand conformational variant (SSCV) analysis to search for germline mutations in the members of 33 kindreds with a confirmed diagnosis of MEN 1. SSCV analysis revealed 25 conformational variants representing germline mutations that are predicted to result in loss of normal menin function. Twenty different disease-associated mutations were identified: five resulting in potential abnormal RNA splicing, two missense mutations, seven nonsense mutations, and six frameshift mutations. The aberrant splice products were identified and confirmed by RT-PCR and direct sequence analysis for two of the five splice mutations. Sixteen of the 20 (80%) mutations identified have not been previously reported. Mutations were not identified in eight kindreds with signs and symptoms consistent with MEN 1. The SSCV analysis revealed mutations in 76% (25 of 33) of the kindreds investigated, thus showing SSCV analysis to be a reliable mutation detection strategy. One-fifth of the mutations identified in this study involve intron sequences, therefore, highlighting the importance of including intron sequences in the search for germline mutations in the MEN1 gene. The need to investigate the entire gene when characterizing new MEN 1 families presents challenges in the translation of genetic studies to efficient clinical diagnostic tests. 	Hum._Mutat.

1409710	19921015	von Willebrand disease type B: a missense mutation selectively abolishes ristocetin-induced von Willebrand factor binding to platelet glycoprotein Ib.	von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a multimeric glycoprotein that mediates the adhesion of platelets to the subendothelium by binding to platelet glycoprotein Ib. For human vWF, this interaction can be induced in vitro by the antibiotic ristocetin or the snake venom protein botrocetin. A missense mutation, Gly-561--&gt;Ser, was identified within the proposed glycoprotein Ib binding domain of vWF in the proband with von Willebrand disease type B, a unique variant characterized by no ristocetin-induced, but normal botrocetin-induced, binding to glycoprotein Ib. The corresponding mutant recombinant protein, rvWF(G561S), formed normal multimers and exhibited the same functional defect as the patient's plasma vWF, confirming that this mutation causes von Willebrand disease type B. These data show that botrocetin and ristocetin cofactor activities of vWF can be dissociated by a point mutation and confirm that these mediators promote vWF binding to platelets by different mechanisms. The normal botrocetin-induced binding and the defective ristocetin-induced binding of rvWF(G561S) suggest that the primary defect in von Willebrand disease type B may be a failure of normal allosteric regulation of the glycoprotein Ib binding function of vWF.

15914629	20050526	Mutations in betaB3-crystallin associated with autosomal recessive cataract in two Pakistani families.	To identify the disease locus for autosomal recessive congenital cataracts in consanguineous Pakistani families. Two Pakistani families were ascertained, patients were examined, blood samples were collected, and DNA was isolated. A genome-wide scan was performed using &gt;382 polymorphic microsatellite markers on genomic DNA from affected and unaffected family members. Two-point lod scores were calculated, haplotypes were formed by inspection, and candidate genes were sequenced. Real-time quantitative PCR techniques were used to determine the mRNA levels, and molecular modeling was performed to gain a better understanding of the significance of the disease-causing mutation. In the genome-wide scan, maximum lod scores of 2.67 and 2.77 for family 60004 and 2.02 and 2.04 for family 60006 were obtained for markers D22S539 and D22S315, respectively. The linked region, 22.7 cM (10 Mb) flanked by markers D22S420 and D22S1163, contains the beta-crystallin gene cluster including the genes CRYBA4, CRYBB1, CRYBB2, and CRYBB3. Sequencing of these genes showed a G--&gt;C transition in exon 6 of CRYBB3 resulting in a p.G165R change in the betaB3-crystallin protein that cosegregates with the disease in both families. Real-time PCR analysis suggested that betaB3-crystallin mRNA levels approximate those of other betagamma-crystallins. Molecular modeling predicted changes in electrostatic potential that would be expected to reduce the stability of the fourth Greek-key motif, and hence the entire protein, dramatically. For the first time, a mutation in CRYBB3 is reported in two consanguineous Pakistani families with autosomal recessive congenital cataracts. 	Invest._Ophthalmol._Vis._Sci.	D016428 D013485
18195150	20080116	Progressive external ophthalmoplegia and vision and hearing loss in a patient with mutations in POLG2 and OPA1.	To describe the clinical features, muscle pathological characteristics, and molecular studies of a patient with a mutation in the gene encoding the accessory subunit (p55) of polymerase gamma (POLG2) and a mutation in the OPA1 gene. Clinical examination and morphological, biochemical, and molecular analyses. Tertiary care university hospitals and molecular genetics and scientific computing laboratory. A 42-year-old man experienced hearing loss, progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), loss of central vision, macrocytic anemia, and hypogonadism. His family history was negative for neurological disease, and his serum lactate level was normal. A muscle biopsy specimen showed scattered intensely succinate dehydrogenase-positive and cytochrome-c oxidase-negative fibers. Southern blot of muscle mitochondrial DNA showed multiple deletions. The results of screening for mutations in the nuclear genes associated with PEO and multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions, including those in POLG (polymerase gamma gene), ANT1 (gene encoding adenine nucleotide translocator 1), and PEO1, were negative, but sequencing of POLG2 revealed a G1247C mutation in exon 7, resulting in the substitution of a highly conserved glycine with an alanine at codon 416 (G416A). Because biochemical analysis of the mutant protein showed no alteration in chromatographic properties and normal ability to protect the catalytic subunit from N-ethylmaleimide, we also sequenced the OPA1 gene and identified a novel heterozygous mutation (Y582C). Although we initially focused on the mutation in POLG2, the mutation in OPA1 is more likely to explain the late-onset PEO and multisystem disorder in this patient. 	Arch._Neurol.

We report here that an autosomal dominant form of Stickler syndrome, characterized by mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, osteoarthritis, and sensorineural hearing loss, but no eye involvement, is caused by a splice donor site mutation resulting in &quot;in-frame&quot; exon skipping within the COL11A2 gene, encoding the alpha 2(XI) chain of the quantitatively minor fibrillar collagen XI. We also show that an autosomal recessive disorder with similar, but more severe, characteristics is linked to the COL11A2 locus and is caused by a glycine to arginine substitution in alpha 2(XI) collagen. The results suggest that mutations in collagen XI genes are associated with a spectrum of abnormalities in human skeletal development and support the conclusion of others, based on studies of murine chondrodysplasia, that collagen XI is essential for skeletal morphogenesis.

16015284	20050715	Early onset seizures and Rett-like features associated with mutations in CDKL5.	Mutations in the CDKL5 gene (also known as STK9) have recently been shown to cause early onset epilepsy and severe mental retardation (ISSX or West syndrome). Patients with CDKL5 mutations sometimes also show features similar to those seen in Rett Syndrome (RTT). We have screened the CDKL5 gene in 94 patients with RTT or a RTT-like phenotype who had tested negative for MECP2 mutations (13 classical RTT female subjects, 25 atypical RTT female subjects, 40 RTT-like female and 16 RTT-like male subjects; 33 of the patients had early onset seizures). Novel pathogenic CDKL5 mutations were identified in three girls, two of whom had initially been diagnosed with the early onset seizure variant of RTT and the other with early onset seizures and some features of RTT. In addition, the 33 patients with early seizures were screened for the most common mutations in the ARX gene but none were found. Combining our three new cases with the previously published cases, 13/14 patients with CDKL5 mutations presented with seizures before the age of 3 months. 	Eur._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
14667253	20031212	Evolution of phage with chemically ambiguous proteomes.	The widespread introduction of amino acid substitutions into organismal proteomes has occurred during natural evolution, but has been difficult to achieve by directed evolution. The adaptation of the translation apparatus represents one barrier, but the multiple mutations that may be required throughout a proteome in order to accommodate an alternative amino acid or analogue is an even more daunting problem. The evolution of a small bacteriophage proteome to accommodate an unnatural amino acid analogue can provide insights into the number and type of substitutions that individual proteins will require to retain functionality. The bacteriophage Qbeta initially grows poorly in the presence of the amino acid analogue 6-fluorotryptophan. After 25 serial passages, the fitness of the phage on the analogue was substantially increased; there was no loss of fitness when the evolved phage were passaged in the presence of tryptophan. Seven mutations were fixed throughout the phage in two independent lines of descent. None of the mutations changed a tryptophan residue. A relatively small number of mutations allowed an unnatural amino acid to be functionally incorporated into a highly interdependent set of proteins. These results support the 'ambiguous intermediate' hypothesis for the emergence of divergent genetic codes, in which the adoption of a new genetic code is preceded by the evolution of proteins that can simultaneously accommodate more than one amino acid at a given codon. It may now be possible to direct the evolution of organisms with novel genetic codes using methods that promote ambiguous intermediates. 	BMC_Evol._Biol.	D016428 D013485 D013486 D013487
10441342	19990811	Point mutations throughout the GLI3 gene cause Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome.	Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome, characterized by craniofacial and limb anomalies (GCPS; MIM 175700), previously has been demonstrated to be associated with translocations as well as point mutations affecting one allele of the zinc finger gene GLI3. In addition to GCPS, Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS; MIM 146510) and post-axial polydactyly type A (PAP-A; MIM 174200), two other disorders of human development, are caused by GLI3 mutations. In order to gain more insight into the mutational spectrum associated with a single phenotype, we report here the extension of the GLI3 mutation analysis to 24 new GCPS cases. We report the identification of 15 novel mutations present in one of the patient's GLI3 alleles. The mutations map throughout the coding gene regions. The majority are truncating mutations (nine of 15) that engender prematurely terminated protein products mostly but not exclusively N-terminally to or within the central region encoding the DNA-binding domain. Two missense and two splicing mutations mapping within the zinc finger motifs presumably also interfere with DNA binding. The five mutations identified within the protein regions C-terminal to the zinc fingers putatively affect additional functional properties of GLI3. In cell transfection experiments using fusions of the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 to different segments of GLI3, transactivating capacity was assigned to two adjacent independent domains (TA(1)and TA(2)) in the C-terminal third of GLI3. Since these are the only functional domains affected by three C-terminally truncating mutations, we postulate that GCPS may be due either to haploinsufficiency resulting from the complete loss of one gene copy or to functional haploinsufficiency related to compromised properties of this transcription factor such as DNA binding and transactivation.

24913602	20140611	Hennekam syndrome can be caused by FAT4 mutations and be allelic to Van Maldergem syndrome.	The Hennekam lymphangiectasia-lymphedema syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. It can be caused by mutations in CCBE1 which are found in approximately 25 % of cases. We used homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing in the original HS family with multiple affected individuals in whom no CCBE1 mutation had been detected, and identified a homozygous mutation in the FAT4 gene. Subsequent targeted mutation analysis of FAT4 in a cohort of 24 CCBE1 mutation-negative Hennekam syndrome patients identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in four additional families. Mutations in FAT4 have been previously associated with Van Maldergem syndrome. Detailed clinical comparison between van Maldergem syndrome and Hennekam syndrome patients shows that there is a substantial overlap in phenotype, especially in facial appearance. We conclude that Hennekam syndrome can be caused by mutations in FAT4 and be allelic to Van Maldergem syndrome. 	Hum._Genet.	D003160 D016428
1658743	19911025	The isolation and characterization of a novel cDNA demonstrating an altered mRNA level in nontumorigenic Wilms' microcell hybrid cells.	Wilms' tumor, a pediatric nephroblastoma, has been associated with genetic alterations of the 11p13 and 11p15 regions. The introduction of a der(11) chromosome into the G401 Wilms' tumor cell line has been shown previously to revert the tumorigenic phenotype. A subtractive cDNA/RNA hybridization performed between the tumorigenic parent (G401) and a nontumorigenic microcell hybrid of G401 (110.1/G401.1) containing the der(11) chromosome resulted in the identification of a single novel cDNA clone, designated QM. The cDNA is 745 nucleotides in length and encodes a predicted hydrophilic 25 kd basic protein, primarily consisting of alpha helices. The QM transcript is expressed in a wide variety of embryonic and adult tissues and demonstrates a down regulation of expression in adult kidney and heart. QM is also a member of a multigene family members of which map to chromosomes 6 and 14. The QM mRNA level is modulated between the tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cell lines and therefore may be involved in the maintenance of the nontumorigenic phenotype. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.

26969752	20160313	Spectrum and Prevalence of CALM1-, CALM2-, and CALM3-Encoded Calmodulin Variants in Long QT Syndrome and Functional Characterization of a Novel Long QT Syndrome-Associated Calmodulin Missense Variant, E141G.	Calmodulin (CaM) is encoded by 3 genes, CALM1, CALM2, and CALM3, all of which harbor pathogenic variants linked to long QT syndrome (LQTS) with early and severe expressivity. These LQTS-causative variants reduce CaM affinity to Ca(2+) and alter the properties of the cardiac L-type calcium channel (CaV1.2). CaM also modulates NaV1.5 and the ryanodine receptor, RyR2. All these interactions may play a role in disease pathogenesis. Here, we determine the spectrum and prevalence of pathogenic CaM variants in a cohort of genetically elusive LQTS, and functionally characterize the novel variants. Thirty-eight genetically elusive LQTS cases underwent whole-exome sequencing to identify CaM variants. Nonsynonymous CaM variants were over-represented significantly in this heretofore LQTS cohort (13.2%) compared with exome aggregation consortium (0.04%; P&lt;0.0001). When the clinical sequelae of these 5 CaM-positive cases were compared with the 33 CaM-negative cases, CaM-positive cases had a more severe phenotype with an average age of onset of 10 months, an average corrected QT interval of 676 ms, and a high prevalence of cardiac arrest. Functional characterization of 1 novel variant, E141G-CaM, revealed an 11-fold reduction in Ca(2+)-binding affinity and a functionally dominant loss of inactivation in CaV1.2, mild accentuation in NaV1.5 late current, but no effect on intracellular RyR2-mediated calcium release. Overall, 13% of our genetically elusive LQTS cohort harbored nonsynonymous variants in CaM. Genetic testing of CALM1-3 should be pursued for individuals with LQTS, especially those with early childhood cardiac arrest, extreme QT prolongation, and a negative family history.

16437560	20060127	T118M PMP22 mutation causes partial loss of function and HNPP-like neuropathy.	To determine the clinical consequences of the PMP22 point mutation, T118M, which has been previously considered to either cause an autosomal recessive form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease or be a benign polymorphism. We analyzed patients from five separate kindreds and characterized their peripheral nerve function by clinical and electrophysiological methods. All heterozygous patients had clinical and/or electrophysiological features of a neuropathy similar to hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPPs). The homozygous patient had a severe axonal neuropathy without features of demyelination. These findings suggest that T118M PMP22 retains some normal PMP22 activity, allowing the formation of compact myelin and normal nerve conduction velocities in the homozygous state. Taken together, these findings suggest that T118M is a pathogenic mutation causing a dominantly inherited form of CMT by a partial loss of PMP22 function. 	Ann._Neurol.

11600516	20011016	Analysis of the GNAS1 gene in Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy.	Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) is characterized by phenotypic signs that typically include brachydactyly and sc calcifications occurring with or without hormone resistance toward PTH or other hormones such as thyroid hormone or gonadotropins. Different inactivating mutations of the gene GNAS1 encoding Gsalpha lead to a reduced Gsalpha protein activity in patients with AHO and pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia or without resistance to PTH (pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism). We investigated 29 unrelated patients with AHO and pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia or pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism and their affected family members performing functional and molecular genetic analysis of Gsalpha. In vitro determination of Gsalpha protein activity in erythrocyte membranes was followed by the investigation of the whole coding region of the GNAS1 gene using PCR, nonisotopic single strand conformation analysis, and direct sequencing of the PCR products. All patients showed a reduced Gsalpha protein activity (mean 59% compared with healthy controls). In 21/29 (72%) patients, 15 different mutations in GNAS1 including 11 novel mutations were detected. In addition we add five unrelated patients with a previously described 4 bp deletion in exon 7 (Delta GACT, codon 189/190), confirming the presence of a hot spot for loss of function mutations in GNAS1. In eight patients, no molecular abnormality was found in the GNAS1 gene despite a functional defect of Gsalpha. We conclude that biochemical and molecular analysis of Gsalpha and its gene GNAS1 can be valuable tools to confirm the diagnosis of AHO. However, in some patients with reduced activity of Gsalpha, the molecular defect cannot be detected in the exons encoding the common form of Gsalpha. 	J._Clin._Endocrinol._Metab.	D016428
19006247	20081114	Expanded mutational spectrum in Cohen syndrome, tissue expression, and transcript variants of COH1.	Cohen syndrome is characterised by mental retardation, postnatal microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, pigmentary retinopathy, myopia, and intermittent neutropenia. Mutations in COH1 (VPS13B) have been found in patients with Cohen syndrome from diverse ethnic origins. We have carried out mutation analysis in twelve novel patients with Cohen syndrome from nine families. In this series, we have identified 13 different mutations in COH1, twelve of these are novel including six frameshift mutations, four nonsense mutations, two splice site mutations, and a one-codon deletion. Since different transcripts of COH1 have been reported previously, we have analysed the expression patterns of COH1 splice variants. The transcript variant NM_152564 including exon 28b showed ubiquitous expression in all examined human tissues. In contrast, human brain and retina showed differential splicing of exon 28 (NM_017890). Moreover, analysis of mouse tissues revealed ubiquitous expression of Coh1 homologous to human NM_152564 in all examined tissues but no prevalent alternative splicing. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428 D013485
9182788	19970627	Two new mild homozygous mutations in Gaucher disease patients: clinical signs and biochemical analyses.	Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder resulting from impaired activity of lysosomal beta-glucocerebrosidase. More than 60 mutations have been described in the GBA gene. They have been classified as lethal, severe, and mild on the basis of the corresponding phenotype. The fact that most GD patients are compound heterozygous and that most type 1 patients bear the N370S allele, which by itself causes a mild phenotype, make it difficult to correlate the clinical signs with the mutations. Besides N370S, about 10 mild mutations have been described, but only one undoubtedly classified as mild was found at homozygosity. Here we report 2 novel mutations, I402T and V375L, at homozygosity in 2 adult Italian type 1 GD patients. Some properties of the I402T fibroblast enzyme have been compared to those of the enzyme from cells of several N370S/N370S patients. Analysis of the catalytic properties and heat stability as well as the response to phosphatidylserine and sphingolipid activator protein indicate a marked similarity between the 2 enzymes. The finding of another, unrelated patient bearing the I402T mutation (in this case as a compound heterozygote with mutation N370S) suggests that this allele might be quite frequent in the area of Sicily from where both patients originated. In conclusion, the phenotypic expression in the 2 homozygous patients presented here and the biochemical data for one of them allowed the classification of these mutations as mild thus extending the group of mild mutations found at homozygosity.

18303074	20080228	Primary acid-labile subunit deficiency due to recessive IGFALS mutations results in postnatal growth deficit associated with low circulating insulin growth factor (IGF)-I, IGF binding protein-3 levels, and hyperinsulinemia.	Up to 90% of circulating IGF-I and IGF-II are carried bound to either IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-3 or IGFBP-5 and the acid-labile subunit (ALS) in the form of tertiary complexes that extend their circulating half-life. Three cases of complete ALS deficiency have been recently reported in short-stature patients with very low circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels who presented with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the ALS encoding gene (IGFALS; 16p13.3), thus supporting a role for ALS in the regulation of the bioavailability of IGFs during postnatal growth. We present the molecular and clinical characterization of two novel IGFALS mutations that caused complete ALS deficiency in three unrelated patients with postnatal growth deficit, low IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels, and no GH deficiency. IGFALS mutation screening identified a novel homozygous IGFALS missense mutation, which altered a conserved residue, N276S, in two of the probands. The third proband presented a novel homozygous nonsense mutation, Q320X, that is predicted to generate a severely truncated ALS protein. The affected probands presented a similar phenotype characterized by a moderate postnatal growth deficit associated with undetectable ALS, low IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBP-3, and hyperinsulinemia, and, in two cases, delayed puberty. Primary ALS deficiency due to IGFALS mutations should be considered as a possible cause of postnatal growth deficit in IGF-I-deficient patients in the absence of GH deficiency or insensitivity. Determination of serum ALS levels and basal insulinemia can be helpful in the differential diagnosis of patients with idiopathic IGF-I deficiency. 	J._Clin._Endocrinol._Metab.	D016428 D013485
7684886	19930601	Linkage of a new mutation in the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene to Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) in a large Finnish kindred.	The purpose of this study was to confirm linkage of the proteolipid protein gene (PLP) and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD). A T--&gt;A transversion in nucleotide pair 35 of exon 4 of PLP was found in a large Finnish kindred with PMD. This mutation results in the substitution Val165--&gt;Glu165. We used a combination of single-strand conformational polymorphism and PCR primer extension to determine the presence or absence of the point mutation in family members. A lod score of 2.6 (theta = 0) was found for linkage of the gene and the disease. We examined 101 unrelated X chromosomes and found none with the transversion. This is the second report of linkage of PMD to a missense mutation in PLP. These findings support the hypothesis that PMD in this family is a result of the missense mutation present in exon 4 of PLP. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
7736581	19950421	Polycystic kidney disease: the complete structure of the PKD1 gene and its protein. The International Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium.	Mutations in the PKD1 gene are the most common cause of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Other PKD1-like loci on chromosome 16 are approximately 97% identical to PKD1. To determine the authentic PKD1 sequence, we obtained the genomic sequence of the PKD1 locus and assembled a PKD1 transcript from the sequence of 46 exons. The 14.5 kb PKD1 transcript encodes a 4304 amino acid protein that has a novel domain architecture. The amino-terminal half of the protein consists of a mosaic of previously described domains, including leucine-rich repeats flanked by characteristic cysteine-rich structures, LDL-A and C-type lectin domains, and 14 units of a novel 80 amino acid domain. The presence of these domains suggests that the PKD1 protein is involved in adhesive protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions in the extracellular compartment. We propose a hypothesis that links the predicted properties of the protein with the diverse phenotypic features of ADPKD. 	Cell	D016428 D013485 D013487
23453667	20130305	Mutations in B3GALNT2 cause congenital muscular dystrophy and hypoglycosylation of ?-dystroglycan.	Mutations in several known or putative glycosyltransferases cause glycosylation defects in ?-dystroglycan (?-DG), an integral component of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex. The hypoglycosylation reduces the ability of ?-DG to bind laminin and other extracellular matrix ligands and is responsible for the pathogenesis of an inherited subset of muscular dystrophies known as the dystroglycanopathies. By exome and Sanger sequencing we identified two individuals affected by a dystroglycanopathy with mutations in ?-1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (B3GALNT2). B3GALNT2 transfers N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) in a ?-1,3 linkage to N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc). A subsequent study of a separate cohort of individuals identified recessive mutations in four additional cases that were all affected by dystroglycanopathy with structural brain involvement. We show that functional dystroglycan glycosylation was reduced in the fibroblasts and muscle (when available) of these individuals via flow cytometry, immunoblotting, and immunocytochemistry. B3GALNT2 localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, and this localization was perturbed by some of the missense mutations identified. Moreover, knockdown of b3galnt2 in zebrafish recapitulated the human congenital muscular dystrophy phenotype with reduced motility, brain abnormalities, and disordered muscle fibers with evidence of damage to both the myosepta and the sarcolemma. Functional dystroglycan glycosylation was also reduced in the b3galnt2 knockdown zebrafish embryos. Together these results demonstrate a role for B3GALNT2 in the glycosylation of ?-DG and show that B3GALNT2 mutations can cause dystroglycanopathy with muscle and brain involvement.

10944853	20000817	Association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in the hMSH3 gene and sporadic colon cancer with microsatellite instability.	The association between three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the hMSH3 gene and sporadic colon cancer with microsatellite instability (MSI) was analyzed. Of the three SNPs observed in this population, SNPs at residues 235 and 693 were novel, while that at residue 3133 was previously described. The SNPs at residues 235 and 3133 caused amino acid substitutions, V79I and T1045A, respectively. We analyzed the allele frequencies of the three SNPs in samples from 19 patients with sporadic colon cancer with MSI and 90 healthy controls. We found that the V79 allele frequency was significantly higher in the tumor samples than in controls. In addition, the frequency of the G693 allele showed a higher trend in the tumor samples than in controls. These results indicated that some SNPs in the hMSH3 gene were associated with colon cancer with MSI. 	J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
14671192	20031213	Genetic polymorphism PC-1 K121Q and ethnic susceptibility to insulin resistance.	Genetic susceptibility may be responsible for high prevalence of insulin resistance in Asian Indians. This study was carried out in samples of local Asian Indians and Caucasians to determine whether plasma cell membrane glycoprotein (PC)-1 K121Q and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) G972A polymorphisms contribute significantly to susceptibility to insulin resistance in Asian Indians. The frequency of carrying at least one copy of the PC-1 121Q variant in Asian Indians was significantly higher than that in Caucasians (P = 0.01), but the frequency was similar for IRS-1 972A (6% and 7%). A significantly higher insulin area under the curve during oral glucose tolerance testing (P &lt; 0.0001) and lower insulin sensitivity during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (P = 0.04) were found in Asian Indians with PC-1 121Q variant compared with Asian Indians with wild-type PC-1 and with Caucasians with or without the polymorphism. IRS-1 972A was not associated with any change in insulin sensitivity. We conclude that the PC-1 K121Q polymorphism associates with primary insulin resistance in migrant Asian Indians. A relatively high frequency of this polymorphism thus may be one factor contributing to insulin resistance susceptibility in Asian Indians. This finding indicates the need for expanded studies on the association between PC-1 K121Q and insulin resistance in a representative sample of the Asian Indian population.

10798654	20000508	Truncations in the TIGR gene in individuals with and without primary open-angle glaucoma.	To investigate the coding exons in the trabecular meshwork-induced glucocorticoid response protein (TIGR) gene for mutations in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in Chinese subjects. Ninety-one Chinese patients with POAG and 113 of their family members without glaucoma were screened for sequence alterations in the TIGR gene by polymerase chain reaction, conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis, and DNA sequencing. One hundred thirty-two unrelated individuals without glaucoma, aged 50 years or more, were studied as control subjects. Five sequence variants that lead to amino acid changes were identified. One was novel: Arg91Stop in one patient with POAG. Four had been reported: Arg46Stop in subjects with and without POAG, including an unaffected 77-year-old woman homozygous for Arg46Stop; Gly12Arg in subjects without glaucoma; and Asp208Glu and Thr353Ile in subjects with and without POAG. The previously reported 1-83(G--&gt;A) and Arg76Lys polymorphisms were detected in both patients and controls and always occurred together. A different pattern of TIGR sequence variants exists in the Chinese than in non-Chinese populations. No common TIGR mutation that causes POAG was found. The occurrence of subjects without glaucoma who are heterozygous or homozygous for Arg46Stop suggests that reduction in the amount of TIGR protein does not cause glaucoma. Thus, the TIGR missense mutations known to cause POAG probably do not cause glaucoma by inactivating a normal TIGR function, but rather through the gain of a pathologic function.

15057979	20040402	Response to therapy in carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) deficiency due to a novel missense mutation.	Deficiency of carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) is an autosomal recessive disorder of the carnitine cycle resulting in the inability to transfer fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Only a limited number of affected patients have been reported and the effect of therapy on this condition is still not well defined. Here, we report a new patient with this disorder and follow the response to therapy. Our patient was the product of a consanguineous marriage. He presented shortly after birth with cardiac myopathy and arrhythmia coupled with severe non-ketotic hypoglycemia. Initial metabolic studies indicated severe non-ketotic C6-C10 dicarboxylic aciduria, plasma carnitine deficiency, and a characteristic elevation of plasma C:16:0, C18:1, and C18:2 acylcarnitine species. Enzyme assay confirmed deficiency of CACT activity. Molecular studies indicated that this child was homozygous, and both parents heterozygous, for a single bp change converting glutamine 238 to arginine (Q238R). Therapy with a formula providing most of the fat via medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and carnitine supplementation reduced the concentration of long-chain acylcarnitines and reversed cardiac symptoms and the hypoglycemia. These results suggest that carnitine and MCT may be effective in treating this defect of long-chain fatty acid oxidation. 	Am._J._Med._Genet._A	D016428 D013485 D013487
11266077	20010327	Rabbits possess a serum paraoxonase polymorphism similar to the human Q192R.	Serum paraoxonase (PON1) is a high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated enzyme that hydrolyses aromatic esters, organophosphates and lactones and can protect low-density lipoprotein (LDL) against oxidation. These properties are influenced by a well-characterized polymorphism (Q192R) in human PON1. We now report the identification and characterization of a phenotypically similar, but genetically distinct polymorphism in rabbit PON1. This polymorphism in rabbits was detected by phenotyping sera obtained from 16 inbred rabbit strains and 20 outbred New Zealand White rabbits by paraoxonase/arylesterase activity. The genetic basis of the rabbit polymorphism was determined by DNA sequencing and found to reside in a region distinct from the human Q192R and M55L polymorphisms. Three variant nucleotides within exon 4 (corresponding to P82S, K93E and S1O1G) were found to segregate with the observed rabbit PON1 phenotypes (rPON1A and rPON1B). The rPON1A and rPON1B proteins were purified and compared to the two human isoforms (192Q and 192R). The human and rabbit PON1s displayed similar characteristics with respect to physical properties and substrate specificity. However, rPON1A and rPON1B hydrolysed a variety of substrates at different rates. The rPON1A was also at least three-fold more efficient at protecting LDL from oxidation than rPON1B. Our characterization of a rabbit PON1 polymorphism provides useful insights into important functional residues in PON1. In addition, due to the observed similarities between the rabbit and human polymorphisms, the rabbit may serve as a good model to examine the effect of human PON1 polymorphisms in disease development.

9490297	19980307	A 9-bp deletion (2320del9) on the background of the arylsulfatase A pseudodeficiency allele in a metachromatic leukodystrophy patient and in a patient with nonprogressive neurological symptoms.	A 9-bp deletion (2320del9) was detected in the arylsulfatase A genes of a patient with late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy and of a patient with nonprogressive neurological symptoms and very low arylsulfatase A activity. Both patients are heterozygous for the deletion, which involves codons 406-408 and causes loss of a Ser-Asp-Thr tract in the predicted protein. In both patients the 9-bp deletion lies in a pseudodeficiency allele. The patient with metachromatic leukodystrophy carries the common 459 + 1G &gt; A mutation in the other allele. The other patient is homozygous for the pseudodeficiency allele, and consequently is a compound heterozygote for a metachromatic leukodystrophy allele and a pseudodeficiency allele. We hypothesize that the compound heterozygosity predisposes to the development of nonprogressive neurological symptoms in the presence of additional, still unknown, genetic or nongenetic factors.

9712903	19980826	High expression of inhibitory receptor SHPS-1 and its association with protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 in macrophages.	SHPS-1 (or SIRP) is a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily abundantly expressed in neurons and other cell types. Within its cytoplasmic domain, it possesses at least two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, which are targets for tyrosine phosphorylation and mediate the recruitment of SHP-2, an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase. Since other immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs-containing receptors have critical roles in the negative regulation of hemopoietic cell functions, we wanted to examine the expression of SHPS-1 in cells of hematological lineages. By analyzing a panel of hemopoietic cell lines, evidence was provided that SHPS-1 is abundantly expressed in macrophages and, to a lesser extent, in myeloid cells. No expression was detected in T-cell or B-cell lines. Expression of SHPS-1 could also be documented in normal ex vivo peritoneal macrophages. Further studies showed that SHPS-1 was an efficient tyrosine phosphorylation substrate in macrophages. However, unlike in non-hemopoietic cells, tyrosine-phosphorylated SHPS-1 in macrophages associated primarily with SHP-1 and not SHP-2. Finally, our analyses allowed us to identify several isoforms of SHPS-1 in mouse cells. In part, this heterogeneity was due to differential glycosylation of SHPS-1. Additionally, it was caused by the production of at least two distinct shps-1 transcripts, coding for SHPS-1 polypeptides having different numbers of Ig-like domains in the extracellular region. Taken together, these findings indicate that SHPS-1 is likely to play a significant role in macrophages, at least partially as a consequence of its capacity to recruit SHP-1. 	J._Biol._Chem.

9399890	19971218	Mutations of the Fanconi anemia group A gene (FAA) in Italian patients.	Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive pancytopenia, congenital malformations, and predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia. At least five complementation groups (FA-A-FA-E) have been identified. The relative prevalence of FA-A has been estimated at an average of approximately 65% but may widely vary according to ethnic background. In Italy, 11 of 12 patients analyzed by cell-fusion studies were assigned to group FA-A, suggesting an unusually high relative prevalence of this FA subtype in patients of Italian ancestry. We have screened the 43 exons of the FAA gene and their flanking intronic sequences in 38 Italian FA patients, using RNA-SSCP. Ten different mutations were detected: three nonsense and one missense substitutions, four putative splice mutations, an insertion, and a duplication. Most of the mutations are expected to cause a premature termination of the FAA protein at various sites throughout the molecule. Four protein variants were also found, three of which were polymorphisms. The missense mutation D1359Y, not found in chromosomes from healthy unrelated individuals, was responsible for a local alteration of hydrophobicity in the FAA protein, and it was likely to be pathogenic. Thus, the mutations so far encountered in the FAA gene are essentially all different. Since screening based on the analysis of single exons by genomic DNA amplification apparently detects only a minority of the mutations, methods designed to detect alterations in the genomic structure of the gene or in the FAA polypeptide may be helpful in the identification of FAA mutations.

Lymphedema, lymphangiectasias, mental retardation and unusual facial characteristics define the autosomal recessive Hennekam syndrome. Homozygosity mapping identified a critical chromosomal region containing CCBE1, the human ortholog of a gene essential for lymphangiogenesis in zebrafish. Homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in seven subjects paired with functional analysis in a zebrafish model identify CCBE1 as one of few genes causing primary generalized lymph-vessel dysplasia in humans.

21940685	20110924	A new tyrosine hydroxylase genotype associated with early-onset severe encephalopathy.	We describe a boy affected by an early-onset severe encephalopathy (stagnation of psychomotor development, paroxysmal dystonic postures and movements of limbs, hypokinesia) due to tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency. High blood prolactin and low homovanillic acid in cerebrospinal fluid suggested the diagnosis. Genetic analysis revealed 3 new missense mutations on tyrosine hydroxylase gene: [c.752C&gt;T(p.P251L) and c.887G&gt;A(p.R296Q] harbored by the father and c.836G&gt;T (p.C279F) of maternal origin. Bioinformatics tools have been helpful in predicting the pathogenic role of p.P251L and p.C279F substitutions, while a weak pathogenic effect was ascribed to p.R296Q. 	J._Child_Neurol.

1611092	19920701	Molecular basis for the human erythrocyte glycophorin specifying the Miltenberger class I (MiI) phenotype.	Human glycophorin Mil (HGpMil) is a structural variant of the MNSs blood group system that specifies the Miltenberger class I phenotype. We report here the molecular basis of the HGpMil gene identified in a white family in which the first homozygote was encountered. Immunoblotting analysis showed the expression of HGpMil and HGpB but the absence of HGpA on the homozygous Mil erythrocytes. Southern blot analysis detected no gross alterations in gene structure or band intensity. Genomic sequences encompassing exons II and III of the HGpMil gene were amplified by single-copy polymerase chain reaction. Restriction digestion and direct DNA sequence analysis showed that HGpMil gene is derived from an alpha N allele of HGpA and differs from the latter in the third exon by a single nucleotide change. In HGpMil, the presence of a deoxythymidine at the second position of codon 28 (ATG) not only resulted in a methionine substitution but also altered the consensus sequence for N-glycosylation from Asn-Asp-Thr to Asn-Asp-Met. These data are consistent with the occurrence of Mil on the red blood cell membrane as a variant deficient in the asparagine-linked carbohydrate unit. Significantly, this particular point mutation lies in between the two half-sites of a direct repeat that has been implicated to facilitate the recombination events leading to several other glycophorin genes of the Miltenberger series. Based on this relatedness, we propose an untemplated nucleotide replacement resulting from a gene conversion event as the molecular basis for the origin of HGpMil gene. 	Blood	D016428 D013487
12632031	20030313	Familial thrombophilia is an oligogenetic disease: involvement of the prothrombin G20210A, PROC and PROS gene mutations.	Population-based case-control studies and cases previously published suggest that the prothrombin G20210A mutation is a weak risk factor for thrombosis, leading to clinical expression mainly in the presence of other risk factors. We report the results of plasma and genetic analyses performed in a 13-year-old symptomatic boy homozygous for the 20210A allele and in his family, which are in accordance with this suggestion. These analyses demonstrated the presence of several PROC (R-5W, R87H) and PROS (R60C, T103N) gene mutations in this family. These additional mutations have modulating effects on clinical expression of the G20210A mutation. The present family study illustrates the concept of 'mild' mutation and the hypothesis that familial thrombophilia is a multifactorial disease. 	Blood_Coagul._Fibrinolysis	D002363 D016428
11565033	20010921	Archipelago regulates Cyclin E levels in Drosophila and is mutated in human cancer cell lines.	During Drosophila development and mammalian embryogenesis, exit from the cell cycle is contingent on tightly controlled downregulation of the activity of Cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes that normally promote the transition from G1 to S phase. Although protein degradation has a crucial role in downregulating levels of Cyclin E, many of the proteins that function in degradation of Cyclin E have not been identified. In a screen for Drosophila mutants that display increased cell proliferation, we identified archipelago, a gene encoding a protein with an F-box and seven tandem WD (tryptophan-aspartic acid) repeats. Here we show that archipelago mutant cells have persistently elevated levels of Cyclin E protein without increased levels of cyclin E RNA. They are under-represented in G1 fractions and continue to proliferate when their wild-type neighbours become quiescent. The Archipelago protein binds directly to Cyclin E and probably targets it for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. A highly conserved human homologue is present and is mutated in four cancer cell lines including three of ten derived from ovarian carcinomas. These findings implicate archipelago in developmentally regulated degradation of Cyclin E and potentially in the pathogenesis of human cancers. 	Nature	D016428 D013485 D013487
11278607	20010330	The tumor-sensitive calmodulin-like protein is a specific light chain of human unconventional myosin X.	Human calmodulin-like protein (CLP) is an epithelial-specific Ca(2+)-binding protein whose expression is strongly down-regulated in cancers. Like calmodulin, CLP is thought to regulate cellular processes via Ca(2+)-dependent interactions with specific target proteins. Using gel overlays, we identified a approximately 210-kDa protein binding specifically and in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner to CLP, but not to calmodulin. Yeast two-hybrid screening yielded a CLP-interacting clone encoding the three light chain binding IQ motifs of human &quot;unconventional&quot; myosin X. Pull-down experiments showed CLP binding to the IQ domain to be direct and Ca(2+)-dependent. CLP interacted strongly with IQ motif 3 (K(d) approximately 0.5 nm) as determined by surface plasmon resonance. Epitope-tagged myosin X was localized preferentially at the cell periphery in MCF-7 cells, and CLP colocalized with myosin X in these cells. Myosin X was able to coprecipitate CLP and, to a lesser extent, calmodulin from transfected COS-1 cells, indicating that CLP is a specific light chain of myosin X in vivo. Because unconventional myosins participate in cellular processes ranging from membrane trafficking to signaling and cell motility, myosin X is an attractive CLP target. Altered myosin X regulation in (tumor) cells lacking CLP may have as yet unknown consequences for cell growth and differentiation. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013486 D013487
10620137	20000105	A novel asparagine--&gt;aspartic acid mutation in the rod 1A domain in keratin 2e in a Japanese family with ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens.	Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens is a unique type of congenital ichthyosis characterized by mild hyperkeratosis over the flexural areas and blister formation after mechanical trauma and superficial denuded areas in the hyperkeratotic skin. Recently, mutations in the helix initiation or termination motifs of keratin 2e (KRT2E) have been described in ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens patients. The majority of the mutations reported to date lie in the 2B region. We report a novel amino acid substitution mutation (asparagine--&gt;aspartic acid) in codon 192 at the conserved 1A helix initiation site of the rod domain of KRT2E in a Japanese family with ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens. Our data indicate aspartic acid substitution in codon 192 in the 1A helix initiation site is deleterious to keratin filament network integrity and leads to ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens phenotype.

15806399	20050405	Molecular characterization of histidinemia: identification of four missense mutations in the histidase gene.	Histidinemia (MIM235800) is characterized by elevated histidine in body fluids and decreased urocanic acid in blood and skin and results from histidase (histidine ammonia lyase, EC 4.3.1.3) deficiency. It is the most frequent inborn metabolic error in Japan. Although the original description included mental retardation and speech impairment, neonatal screening programs have identified the majority of histidinemic patients with normal intelligence. Molecular characteristics of histidase in histidinemia have not been determined, and cytogenetically visible deletions of 12q22-24.1 in which histidase gene resides have not been identified in histidinemic patients. In order to investigate whether individuals with this disorder have small deletions, additions, or point mutations in the histidase gene, we screened genomic DNA isolated from 50 histidinemic individuals who were discovered by the neonatal screening program. The methods employed included polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of exons 1-21 of the histidase gene, followed by mutation detection enhancement gel electrophoresis and sequencing of the PCR products displaying heteroduplex bands. Four missense mutations (R322P, P259L, R206T, and R208L), two exonic polymorphisms (T141T c.423A--&gt;T and P259P c.777A--&gt;G), and two intronic polymorphisms (IVS6-5T--&gt;C and IVS9+25A--&gt;G) were identified. The frequencies of each polymorphism estimated either by dot blot allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, restriction enzyme digestion, or direct sequencing of the PCR products amplified from 50 unrelated normal individuals were 0.28, 0.30, 0.40, and less than 0.01, respectively. Mutation analysis of one family demonstrated that the patient inherited R322P from the mother and P259L from the father. This report describes the first mutations occurring in the coding region of the histidase structural gene in patients with histidinemia. 	Hum._Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013485 D013487
10756092	20000411	Identification and characterization of a novel polycystin family member, polycystin-L2, in mouse and human: sequence, expression, alternative splicing, and chromosomal localization.	Polycystins-1, -2, -L, and -REJ are the four known members of the polycystin family of proteins. In this study, we describe a fifth member of the family, polycystin-L2, encoded by PKD2L2 in human and Pkd2l2 in mouse. Full-length cDNA sequences for both mouse and human polycystin-L2 were obtained from testis cDNA. Sequence analysis predicts that the mouse and human polycystin-L2 proteins consist of 621 and 624 amino acid residues, respectively. Polycystin-L2 has significant homology with polycystins-L and -2, with similarities of 58 and 59%, respectively. Both human and murine polycystin-L2 proteins are predicted to have seven putative transmembrane (TM) domains, and, by comparison with transient receptor potential channels, the six carboxyl-terminal TM domains are likely to constitute an ion channel subunit. Northern blot analysis indicated that mouse Pkd2l2 has an abundant approximately 2.5-kb transcript in testis and an approximately 2.2-kb transcript in heart. RT-PCR analysis showed that the full-length transcript is expressed in human brain, kidney, testis, and HepG2 cells, and there are three alternatively spliced variants that were differentially expressed. PKD2L2 consists of 17 exons spanning approximately 50 kb of genomic DNA. PKD2L2 was mapped to human chromosome 5q31 and Pkd2l2 to mouse chromosome 18 in band C. 	Genomics	D016428 D013487
11726612	20011201	Organization of the human IMPG2 gene and its evaluation as a candidate gene in age-related macular degeneration and other retinal degenerative disorders.	To characterize the genomic organization of human IMPG2, the gene encoding the retinal interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM) proteoglycan IPM 200, to evaluate its relationship to IPM 150, and to evaluate its involvement in inherited retinopathies, such as age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, and Leber congenital amaurosis. After isolation of human genomic clones, the structure of IMPG2 was determined by sequence analysis. Mutational analyses were conducted on genomic DNA isolated from 316 probands using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. The IMPG2 gene is organized into 19 exons, and the structure of the gene is highly similar to that of the IMPG1 gene, which encodes another retinal proteoglycan, IPM 150. Mutational analyses indicate that the observed sequence changes are present at approximately equal rates in donors with and without retinal disease. Additional data derived from RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis show that IMPG2 is processed in the human retina into multiple alternatively sized transcripts that may represent splicing isoforms. Analysis of the overall relationship of human IMPG2 (located on chromosome 3q12.2-12.3) to human IMPG1 (located on chromosome 6q14) suggests that these genes have evolved from a common ancestral gene. Although this is an excellent candidate gene for hereditary retinopathies, single-strand conformation polymorphism analyses provided no evidence that variations in IMPG2 coding region are responsible for the inherited retinopathies examined.

15830122	20050415	Association of nucleotide variations in the apolipoprotein B48 receptor gene (APOB48R) with hypercholesterolemia.	Factors predisposing to the phenotypic features of high total cholesterol (T-Cho) in human plasma have not been clearly defined. Here we report an association between two variations in the apolipoprotein B48 receptor gene (APOB48R) and plasma T-Cho levels among 352 adult individuals in Japan. By analyzing phenotypic associations between age- and gender-adjusted levels of plasma T-Cho, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C), we detected a significant correlation between genotypes of the A419P variation and adjusted T-Cho levels. Among homozygous G-allele carriers (n=265), heterozygous carriers (n=78), and homozygous minor C-allele carriers (n=9), T-Cho levels were 2.43+/-0.21 mg/cm(3), 2.48+/-0.24 mg/cm(3), and 2.63+/-0.21 mg/cm(3), respectively, indicating a codominant T-Cho-elevating effect of the minor C-allele (r=0.15, P=0.007). A similar effect was detected for c.934-960/del (r=0.13, P=0.015). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis detected significant LD among eight variant sites that included neighboring loci. Our results indicate that variations in APOB48R and nearby genes are among the many factors involved in hypercholesterolemia. The etiological studies should now include consideration of this novel aspect of the mechanism(s) leading to hypercholesterolemic disease. 	J._Hum._Genet.	D003160 D016428 D013485
7721806	19950414	The human 180-kDa receptor for secretory phospholipases A2. Molecular cloning, identification of a secreted soluble form, expression, and chromosomal localization.	Secretory phospholipases A2 (sPLA2) are structurally related enzymes found in mammals as well as in insect and snake venoms. They have been associated with several physiological, pathological, and toxic processes. Some of these effects are apparently linked to the existence of specific receptors for both venom and mammalian sPLA2s. We report here the molecular cloning and expression of one of these sPLA2 receptors from human kidney. Two transcripts were detected. One encodes for a transmembrane form of the sPLA2 receptor and the other one is an alternatively processed transcript, caused by polyadenylation occurring at a site within an intron in the C terminus part of the transcriptional unit. This transcript encodes for a shortened secreted soluble sPLA2 receptor lacking the coding region for the transmembrane segment. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction experiments indicate a 1.6:1 ratio between the levels of transcripts encoding for the membrane-bound and soluble forms of the receptor, respectively. Soluble and membrane-bound human sPLA2 receptors both bind sPLA2 with high affinities. However, the binding properties of the human receptors are different from those obtained with the rabbit membrane-bound sPLA2 receptor. The 180-kDa human sPLA2 receptor gene has been mapped in the q23-q24 bands of chromosome 2. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
8947847	19961001	Identification and cloning of a novel cDNA belonging to tetratricopeptide repeat gene family from Down syndrome-critical region 21q22.2.	We identified and cloned a novel 9,078-bp cDNA, designated TPRDI, from the Down syndrome-critical region by exon trapping. The cDNA encodes a putative protein (TPRDI) of 2,025 amino acid residues. Two isoforms, TPRDII (8,992 bp) and TPRDIII (7,416 bp), were also isolated. TPRDII, which is probably an alternative splicing product from the TPRD gene transcript, encodes two large open reading frames (ORFs) of 200 amino acid residues and 1,792 amino acid residues, respectively. TPRDIII, which is probably generated by transcription from an alternative start site of the TPRD gene, encodes a putative protein of 1,715 amino acid residues (TPRDIII). Northern blot analysis revealed that TPRDI and its isoforms are present in 7-17 day mouse embryo and in all the human adult and fetal tissues examined. TPRDI has three units of a 34-amino-acid repeat similar to the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motif, which may mediate interaction with various proteins. A larger ORF encoded by TPRDII also has three units of TPR motif, but TPRDIII has only two-thirds of this motif unit. Thus, the TPRD gene may belong to the TPR gene family. Near-central and C terminal regions of TPRDs showed some homology to several matrix proteins such as trichohyalin and bullous pemphigoid antigen. It is possible that the TPRD gene is one of the genes whose overexpression causes several morphological anomalies observed in Down syndrome. 	J._Biochem.	D016428 D013485
10958647	20000825	Identification of a novel protein interacting with RPGR.	A novel protein, called RPGRIP, has been identified as interacting with the RPGR protein, which is mutated in a severe form of human retinal degeneration, X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (RP3 type). The bovine RPGRIP was identified initially by screening for RPGR-interacting proteins with a bovine retina cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system. The specificity of the interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated protein and using RPGR mutants. The human RPGRIP gene was isolated and shown to be expressed in retina and testis. Human RPGRIP spans a genomic interval of 34 kb, and consists of 15 exons, some of which are alternatively spliced. It was mapped using monochromosomal and radiation hybrid cell lines to chromosomal region 14q11. The function of RPGRIP is unknown; it shows no homology to proteins of known function, although it is predicted to form two coiled-coil domains at the N-terminus. RPGRIP is a strong candidate gene for causing human retinal degeneration. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D013485
18830233	20081003	Mutations in mammalian tolloid-like 1 gene detected in adult patients with ASD.	Atrial septal defect (ASD) is an incomplete septation of atria in human heart causing circulatory problems. Its frequency is estimated at one per 10 000. Actions of numerous genes have been linked to heart development. However, no single gene defect causing ASD has yet been identified. Incomplete heart septation similar to ASD was reported in transgenic mice with both inactive alleles of gene encoding mammalian zinc metalloprotease a mammalian tolloid-like 1 (tll1). Here, we have screened 19 ASD patients and 15 healthy age-matched individuals for mutations in TLL1 gene. All 22 exons were analyzed exon by exon for heteroduplex formation. Subsequently, DNA fragments forming heteroduplexes were sequenced. In four nonrelated patients, three missense mutations in coding sequence, and one single base change in the 5'UTR have been detected. Two mutations (Met182Leu, and Ala238Val) were detected in ASD patients with the same clinical phenotype. As the second mutation locates immediately upstream of the catalytic zinc-binding signature, it might change the enzyme substrate specificity. The third change, Leu627Val in the CUB3 domain, has been found in an ASD patient with interatrial septum aneurysm in addition to ASD. The CUB3 domain is important for substrate-specific recognition. In the remaining 15 patients as well as in 15 reference samples numerous base substitutions, deletions, and insertions have been detected, but no mutations changing the coding sequence have been found. Lack of mutations in relation to ASD of these patients could possibly be because of genetic heterogeneity of the syndrome. 	Eur._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
8567980	19960115	Imogen 38: a novel 38-kD islet mitochondrial autoantigen recognized by T cells from a newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic patient.	Cell-mediated autoimmune attack directed against islet proteins of approximately 38 kD in size has been associated with type 1 diabetes. A novel murine cDNA encoding an antigen of this size was cloned using a screening procedure based on the proliferative response of a human diabetic T cell clone (1C6) to a recombinant antigen epitope library. Membrane preparations from COS 7 cells transfected with the full-length 1,267-bp cDNA elicited a proliferative response from the reporter T cells comparable to that of the defined peptide epitope and native insulinoma antigen. In vitro translation and transfection experiments suggested that the protein is initially synthesized as a 44-kD protein and then processed to the native 38-kD form through the proteolytic removal of a 54-aa NH2-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. Differential centrifugation, Percoll density gradient centrifugation, and immunofluorescence studies confirmed localization of the antigen to mitochondria. Northern blot, Western blot, and 1C6 T cell proliferation assays showed that, although imogen 38 was more highly expressed in beta cell than alpha cell lines, it was also present in other tissues. It is concluded that imogen 38 may be a target for bystander autoimmune attack in diabetes rather than a primary autoantigen. 	J._Clin._Invest.	D016428 D013485
7630935	19950701	Isolation and expression of three gibberellin 20-oxidase cDNA clones from Arabidopsis.	Using degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on a pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima) gibberellin (GA) 20-oxidase sequence, six different fragments of dioxygenase genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from arabidopsis thaliana genomic DNA. One of these was used to isolate two different full-length cDNA clones, At2301 and At2353, from shoots of the GA-deficient Arabidopsis mutant ga1-2. A third, related clone, YAP169, was identified in the Database of Expressed Sequence Tags. The cDNA clones were expressed in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins, each of which oxidized GA12 at C-20 to GA15, GA24, and the C19 compound GA9, a precursor of bioactive GAs; the C20 tricarboxylic acid compound GA25 was formed as a minor product. The expression products also oxidized the 13-hydroxylated substrate GA53, but less effectively than GA12. The three cDNAs hybridized to mRNA species with tissue-specific patterns of accumulation, with At2301 being expressed in stems and inflorescences, At2353 in inflorescences and developing siliques, and YAP169 in siliques only. In the floral shoots of the ga1-2 mutant, transcript levels corresponding to each cDNA decreased dramatically after GA3 application, suggesting that GA biosynthesis may be controlled, at least in part, through down-regulation of the expression of the 20-oxidase genes.

10537275	19991028	Germ-line msh6 mutations in colorectal cancer families.	Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma (HNPCC) is due primarily to inherited mutations in two mismatch repair genes, MSH2 and MLH1, whereas germ-line mutations in other mismatch repair genes are rare. We examined the frequency of germ-line msh6 mutations in a population-based series of 140 colorectal cancer patients, including 45 sporadic cases, 91 familial non-HNPCC cases, and 4 HNPCC cases. Among the 91 population-based familial non-HNPCC cases, germ-line msh6 mutations were found in 6 patients (7.1% of probands analyzed; median age at diagnosis, 61 years). These mutations included a splice site mutation, a frameshift mutation, two missense mutations that were demonstrated to be loss of function mutations, and two missense mutations for which functional studies were not possible. In contrast, germ-line msh6 mutations were not found in any of the 45 sporadic cases and the 4 HNPCC cases in the population-based series or in the second series of 58 clinic-based, primarily HNPCC families. Our data suggest that germ-line msh6 mutations predispose individuals to primarily late-onset, familial colorectal carcinomas that do not fulfill classic criteria for HNPCC. 	Cancer_Res.

9621514	19980611	Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha gene (MODY3) are not a major cause of early-onset non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus in Japanese.	Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY3), a monogenic subtype of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) with an early age of onset, is characterized by a primary defect in insulin secretion. Recently, it has been shown that mutations of the gene encoding the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF-1 alpha) cause MODY3. Since NIDDM in Japanese is characterized by insulin secretory defects due to primary beta-cell dysfunction, we screened 60 Japanese nonobese subjects with early-onset NIDDM for mutations in this gene, 45 of whom had a first-degree relative with NIDDM. Direct sequencing of the ten exons and flanking introns of the gene in these subjects identified eight nucleotide substitutions including two amino acid changes, Ile-27-Leu and Ser-487-Asn, the frequencies of which were not significantly different in subjects with early-onset NIDDM and nondiabetic subjects. These results suggest that mutations in the HNF-1 alpha gene are not a major cause of early-onset NIDDM in Japanese. 	J._Hum._Genet.	D003160 D016428 D013485
10473598	19990903	Characterization of the regulatory domains of the human skn-1a/Epoc-1/Oct-11 POU transcription factor.	The Skn-1a POU transcription factor is primarily expressed in keratinocytes of murine embryonic and adult epidermis. Although some POU factors expressed in a tissue-specific manner are important for normal differentiation, the biological function of Skn-1a remains unknown. Previous in vitro studies indicate that Skn-1a has the ability to transactivate markers of keratinocyte differentiation. In this study, we have characterized Skn-1a's transactivation domain(s) and engineered a dominant negative protein that lacked this transactivation domain. Deletional analysis of the human homologue of Skn-1a with three target promoters revealed the presence of two functional domains: a primary C-terminal transactivation domain and a combined N-terminal inhibitory domain and transactivation domain. Skn-1a lacking the C-terminal region completely lost transactivation ability, irrespective of the promoter tested, and was able to block transactivation by normal Skn-1a in competition assays. Compared with full-length, Skn-1a lacking the N-terminal region demonstrated either increased transactivation (bovine cytokeratin 6 promoter), comparable transactivation (human papillomavirus type 1a long control region), or loss of transactivation (human papillomavirus type 18 long control region). The identification of a primary C-terminal transactivation domain enabled us to generate a dominant negative Skn-1a factor, which will be useful in the quest for a better understanding of this keratinocyte-specific gene regulator.

11943152	20020412	Functional distinction of human EAG1 and EAG2 potassium channels.	Human ether à go-go potassium channel 2 (hEAG2) was cloned and its properties were compared with the previously characterized isoform hEAG1. In the Xenopus oocyte expression system the time course of activation was about four times slower and the voltage required for half-maximal subunit activation was about 10 mV greater for hEAG2 channels. However, its voltage dependence was smaller and, therefore, hEAG2 channels start to open at more negative voltages than hEAG1. Coexpression of both isoforms and kinetic analysis of the resulting currents indicated that they can form heteromeric channel complexes in which the slow activation phenotype of hEAG2 is dominant. Upon expression in mammalian cells, quinidine blocked hEAG1 channels (IC(50) 1.4 microM) more potently than hEAG2 channels (IC(50) 152 microM), thus providing a useful tool for the functional distinction between hEAG1 and hEAG2 potassium channels.

12393640	20021024	Rare RHCE phenotypes in black individuals of Afro-Caribbean origin: identification and transfusion safety.	The molecular backgrounds of variants encountered in Afro-Caribbean black individuals and associated with the production of clinically significant antibodies against high-incidence antigens (anti-RH18, anti-RH34) and against Rhe epitopes were determined. We showed that RH:-18 phenotypes are produced by 3 distinct RHCE alleles: ceEK carrying 48G&gt;C (exon 1), 712A&gt;G, 787A&gt;G, 800T&gt;A (exon 5); ceBI carrying 48G&gt;C (exon 1), 712A&gt;G (exon 5), 818C&gt;T (exon 6), 1132C&gt;G (exon 8); and the already known ceAR allele carrying 48G&gt;C (exon 1), 712A&gt;G, 733C&gt;G, 787A&gt;G, 800T&gt;A (exon 5), and 916A&gt;G (exon 6). The RH:-34 phenotype is produced by the (C)ce(s) haplotype described previously and composed of a hybrid D-CE(3-8)-D gene with 4 extra mutations next to a ce(s) allele (733C&gt;G; exon 5) with an extra mutation in exon 7 (1006G&gt;T). Partial Rhe with risk of immunization against lacking epitopes can be produced by the new ce(s) allele carrying an extra mutation in exon 3 (340C&gt;T) and by the ceMO allele described previously. A population of sickle cell disease patients was screened to estimate the incidence of these rare alleles, with the conclusion that a procedure is required to detect the associated phenotypes in black donors to ensure transfusion safety for patients. We also described a new variant [ce(s)(748)] and variants carrying different altered alleles in nonimmunized patients and for whom the risk of immunization is discussed. 	Blood	D016428
9833068	19981202	A novel Leu171Pro mutation in presenilin-1 gene in a Mexican family with early onset Alzheimer disease.	A search for mutations in exons 6, 7, 9 and 12 of the PS1 gene in four Mexican families with Early-Onset (36-40 years) Alzheimer Disease yielded the discovery in one family of a T--&gt;C mismatch in exon 7 which correspond to nucleotide 760 of cDNA, leading to a Leu171Pro mutation. The pedigree analysis and the literature data strongly suggest an etiopathogenic relationship of the mutation with the disorder. 	Ann._Genet.	D016428 D013485
9217217	19970808	Identification of two novel and four uncommon missense mutations among chinese Gaucher disease patients.	Gaucher disease is the most prevalent lysosomal storage disease. It is panethnic and results from an inherited deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. Most mutations to date have been identified among Jewish and non-Jewish Caucasian patients; mutations in Chinese patients are largely unknown. We have performed nucleotide sequence analysis of PCR-amplified glucocerebrosidase genomic DNA from five unrelated Chinese patients affected with type 1 (non-neuropathic) Gaucher disease. A novel heterozygous C --&gt; T mutation at cDNA nucleotide position 475 (R120W) was detected in a patient who is also heterozygous for a C --&gt; T transition at cDNA nucleotide position 259 (R48W). In a second patient, a novel, heterozygous T --&gt; G transversion at cDNA 226 (F37V) was detected. Mutation 1448 (L444P), the most prevalent mutation among non-Jewish Caucasian Gaucher patients, was found in the heterozygous form in four patients. The mutations in the second Gaucher allele in the other three patients are mutations 254 (G46E), 680 (N188S), and 754 (F213I), which were recently reported in Korean, Arab, and Chinese (Taiwanese) patients. We have developed screening methods that utilize PCR amplification of glucocerebrosidase genomic DNA and Eco571, Nci1, Hinc11, BsaJ1, and Bsr1 restriction endonuclease analyses for the detection of each of these mutations. The population genetics of some of these Gaucher alleles and their implications in genotype/phenotype correlation are discussed. 	Am._J._Med._Genet.	D002363 D016428 D013485
18622757	20080716	Polymorphism of prion protein gene in Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus).	Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders of humans and certain other mammals. Prion protein gene (Prnp) is associated with susceptibility and species barrier to prion diseases. No natural and experimental prion diseases have been documented to date in Arctic fox. In the present study, coding region of Prnp from 135 Arctic foxes were cloned and screened for polymorphisms. Our results indicated that the Arctic fox Prnp open reading frame (ORF) contains 771 nucleotides encoding 257 amino acids. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (G312C, A337G, C541T, and A723G) were identified. SNPs G312C and A723G produced silent mutations, but SNPs A337G and C541T resulted in a M-V change at codon 113 and R-C at codon 181, respectively. The Arctic fox Prnp amino acid sequence was similar to that of the dog (XM 542906). In short, this study provides preliminary information about genotypes of Prnp in Arctic fox. 	Mol._Biol._Rep.

23647072	20130508	Exome sequencing reveals new causal mutations in children with epileptic encephalopathies.	The management of epilepsy in children is particularly challenging when seizures are resistant to antiepileptic medications, or undergo many changes in seizure type over time, or have comorbid cognitive, behavioral, or motor deficits. Despite efforts to classify such epilepsies based on clinical and electroencephalographic criteria, many children never receive a definitive etiologic diagnosis. Whole exome sequencing (WES) is proving to be a highly effective method for identifying de novo variants that cause neurologic disorders, especially those associated with abnormal brain development. Herein we explore the utility of WES for identifying candidate causal de novo variants in a cohort of children with heterogeneous sporadic epilepsies without etiologic diagnoses. We performed WES (mean coverage approximately 40×) on 10 trios comprised of unaffected parents and a child with sporadic epilepsy characterized by difficult-to-control seizures and some combination of developmental delay, epileptic encephalopathy, autistic features, cognitive impairment, or motor deficits. Sequence processing and variant calling were performed using standard bioinformatics tools. A custom filtering system was used to prioritize de novo variants of possible functional significance for validation by Sanger sequencing. In 9 of 10 probands, we identified one or more de novo variants predicted to alter protein function, for a total of 15. Four probands had de novo mutations in genes previously shown to harbor heterozygous mutations in patients with severe, early onset epilepsies (two in SCN1A, and one each in CDKL5 and EEF1A2). In three children, the de novo variants were in genes with functional roles that are plausibly relevant to epilepsy (KCNH5, CLCN4, and ARHGEF15). The variant in KCNH5 alters one of the highly conserved arginine residues of the voltage sensor of the encoded voltage-gated potassium channel. In vitro analyses using cell-based assays revealed that the CLCN4 mutation greatly impaired ion transport by the ClC-4 2Cl(-) /H(+) -exchanger and that the mutation in ARHGEF15 reduced GEF exchange activity of the gene product, Ephexin5, by about 50%. Of interest, these seven probands all presented with seizures within the first 6 months of life, and six of these have intractable seizures. The finding that 7 of 10 children carried de novo mutations in genes of known or plausible clinical significance to neuronal excitability suggests that WES will be of use for the molecular genetic diagnosis of sporadic epilepsies in children, especially when seizures are of early onset and difficult to control.

2401360	19900903	Cloning of cDNA and genomic DNA for human cytochrome P-45011 beta.	A full-length cDNA clone encoding steroid 11 beta-hydroxylase (P-45011 beta) has been isolated from a cDNA library derived from human adrenal tumor. The insert of the clone contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 503 amino acid residues together with a 4 bp 5'-untranslated region and a 576 bp 3'-untranslated region to which a poly(A) tract is attached. The promoter region of the P-450(11) beta gene has also been isolated from a genomic library derived from human pre-B cells. It contains a TATA box, a putative cAMP-responsive element, several repeated sequences and two sequence elements similar to the consensus sequence for binding of AP-1. A transient expression assay in Y-1 adrenal tumor cells demonstrates that the promoter activity is remarkably enhanced by treatment of the cells with cAMP. In addition, analysis using deletion mutants containing various lengths of the 5'-flanking region of the gene suggests that several cis-acting elements participate in transcriptional regulation of human P-450(11) beta gene.

11528398	20010831	The UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase gene is mutated in recessive hereditary inclusion body myopathy.	Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM; OMIM 600737) is a unique group of neuromuscular disorders characterized by adult onset, slowly progressive distal and proximal weakness and a typical muscle pathology including rimmed vacuoles and filamentous inclusions. The autosomal recessive form described in Jews of Persian descent is the HIBM prototype. This myopathy affects mainly leg muscles, but with an unusual distribution that spares the quadriceps. This particular pattern of weakness distribution, termed quadriceps-sparing myopathy (QSM), was later found in Jews originating from other Middle Eastern countries as well as in non-Jews. We previously localized the gene causing HIBM in Middle Eastern Jews on chromosome 9p12-13 (ref. 5) within a genomic interval of about 700 kb (ref. 6). Haplotype analysis around the HIBM gene region of 104 affected people from 47 Middle Eastern families indicates one unique ancestral founder chromosome in this community. By contrast, single non-Jewish families from India, Georgia (USA) and the Bahamas, with QSM and linkage to the same 9p12-13 region, show three distinct haplotypes. After excluding other potential candidate genes, we eventually identified mutations in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene in the HIBM families: all patients from Middle Eastern descent shared a single homozygous missense mutation, whereas distinct compound heterozygotes were identified in affected individuals of families of other ethnic origins. Our findings indicate that GNE is the gene responsible for recessive HIBM. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D013485
9150726	19970501	The pathogenicity of the Pro1148Ala substitution in the FBN1 gene: causing or predisposing to Marfan syndrome and aortic aneurysm, or clinically innocent?	In individuals with the Marfan syndrome (MFS), mutations have been identified in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) at 15q21.1. A proline-to-alanine change at position 1148 in exon 27 (Pro1148Ala) has been reported in probands with MFS, aortic aneurysm or Marfanoid-craniosynostosis. It was suggested that this mutation could be a risk factor for aortic dilatation, since it was rarely observed in control populations. To investigate further the pathogenicity of this substitution, we screened 416 unrelated control individuals by allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization. We found 16 individuals who carried the alanine allele (3.8%), 3 of whom were homozygous. Five were of Latin American and eight were of Asian extraction. We also screened 133 probands with MFS, aortic aneurysm or related connective tissue disorders and found 4 (3%) that were heterozygous for the 1148Ala allele. All positive results were confirmed by DNA sequencing. In 20 individuals with 1148Ala, we confirmed the association with the rarer A allele at the IVS27-5G--&gt;A polymorphism. Our results suggest that the Pro1148Ala change is a polymorphism of ancient evolutionary origin that is more prevalent in Asian and Latin American than in Caucasian or African populations.

20951040	20101019	Congenital fibre type disproportion associated with mutations in the tropomyosin 3 (TPM3) gene mimicking congenital myasthenia.	Congenital myopathy with fibre type disproportion (CFTD) has been associated with mutations in ACTA1, SEPN1, RYR1 and TPM3 genes. We report the clinico-pathological and electrophysiological features of 2 unrelated cases with heterozygous TPM3 mutation. Case 1 is a 19-year-old lady who presented with motor delay in infancy, respiratory failure in early teens requiring non-invasive ventilation despite being ambulant, ptosis, axial more than proximal weakness and scoliosis. Case 2 is a 7-year-old boy with hypotonia, feeding difficulties, motor delay and scoliosis, also requiring non-invasive ventilation while ambulant. Muscle biopsies in both cases showed fibre type disproportion. Muscle MRI (Case 1) showed mild uniformly increased interstitial tissue in and around the muscles. Sequencing of TPM3 in case 1 revealed a previously described heterozygous c.503G &gt; A(pArg168His) missense variant in exon 5 and a novel heterozygous missense mutation c.521A &gt; C(pGlu174Ala), also in exon 5, in case 2. A mild abnormality in the single fibre EMG was documented on electrophysiology in both cases. These cases highlight the neuromuscular transmission defect in CFTD secondary to TPM3 mutations.

9506756	19980320	Absence of germ-line mutations of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) gene in familial pituitary adenoma in contrast to MEN1 in Japanese.	Germ-line mutations of the MEN1 gene were analyzed in five cases of familial and four cases of sporadic multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1), six cases in three independent pedigrees of familial pituitary adenoma without MEN-1, and three cases of familial isolated primary hyperparathyroidism (FIHP) in Japanese. Eight different types of germ-line mutations in all nine cases of MEN-1 were distributed in exons 2, 3, 7, and 10 and intron 7 of the MEN1 gene. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on 11q13 was detected in all nine tumors of these cases with microsatellite analysis. No germ-line mutation of the MEN1 gene was detected in three pedigrees of familial pituitary adenoma and three cases of FIHP. LOH on 11q13 was detected in two cases in one pedigree of familial pituitary adenoma, and one of them showed a heterozygous somatic mutation of the MEN1 gene. No LOH on 11q13 was detected in three cases of FIHP. Based on these, we conclude that the loss of function of menin is etiological for familial or sporadic MEN-1, but not for FIHP or most familial pituitary adenoma without MEN-1.

9714833	19980826	Structure of the mouse osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor (OCIF) gene and its expression in embryogenesis.	Osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor (OCIF) is a novel soluble-form member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and is involved in the regulation of bone mass. Here we isolated genomic and cDNA clones for mouse OCIF and determined their structures. Mouse OCIF gene spans 29 kb and contains five exons of 270, 367, 192, 225 and 1765 bp long. Four cysteine-rich domains and two death domain homologous regions characterized in human OCIF are rigidly conserved in mouse OCIF. The onset of OCIF gene expression in mouse embryogenesis is at day 8.5. In a pregnant female mouse, OCIF gene is expressed in decidua, a maternal tissue surrounding each embryo, immediately after implantation. The isolation of mouse OCIF gene should facilitate studies on OCIF knock-out mice for a better understanding of the role of OCIF in vivo. 	Gene	D016428
9430220	19980116	Functionally and structurally distinct NK cell receptor repertoires in the peripheral blood of two human donors.	The expression of KIR and CD94:NKG2 receptors was determined for more than 100 natural killer (NK) cell clones obtained from two blood donors who differ in their HLA class I and KIR genes. More than 98% of the clones were inhibited by individual autologous class I allotypes, and every clone was inhibited by the combination of autologous allotypes. The patterns of inhibition correlate with expression of inhibitory receptors of defined specificity. One donor possesses three class I ligands for KIR, and a majority of NK cells use KIR as their inhibitory receptor; the second donor possesses only a single ligand for KIR, and a majority of NK cells use the more broadly reactive CD94:NKG2a as their inhibitory receptor. Because of these differences, the first donor has subpopulations of NK cells that kill cells of the second donor, whereas the NK cells of the second donor are universally tolerant of cells from the first donor.

3755136	19860705	Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones for the 35-kDa pulmonary surfactant-associated protein.	A group of 35,000-dalton sialoglycoproteins is the major non-serum protein component of pulmonary surfactant. Tryptic fragments of these proteins were sequenced, and oligonucleotide probes were synthesized based on the amino acid sequences. A human lung cDNA library was then screened using the oligonucleotide probes, and clones coding for these proteins were identified and characterized. By in vitro transcription-translation experiments we have associated individual clones with particular proteins. The data suggest that co-translational modifications of two primary translation products account for many of the isoforms observed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in the precursors of 35,000-dalton sialoglycoproteins.

10521424	19991016	Cloning and characterization of AOEB166, a novel mammalian antioxidant enzyme of the peroxiredoxin family.	Using two-dimensional electrophoresis, we have recently identified in human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid a novel protein, termed B166, with a molecular mass of 17 kDa. Here, we report the cloning of human and rat cDNAs encoding B166, which has been renamed AOEB166 for antioxidant enzyme B166. Indeed, the deduced amino acid sequence reveals that AOEB166 represents a new mammalian subfamily of AhpC/TSA peroxiredoxin antioxidant enzymes. Human AOEB166 shares 63% similarity with Escherichia coli AhpC22 alkyl hydroperoxide reductase and 66% similarity with a recently identified Saccharomyces cerevisiae alkyl hydroperoxide reductase/thioredoxin peroxidase. Moreover, recombinant AOEB166 expressed in E. coli exhibits a peroxidase activity, and an antioxidant activity comparable with that of catalase was demonstrated with the glutamine synthetase protection assay against dithiothreitol/Fe3+/O(2) oxidation. The analysis of AOEB166 mRNA distribution in 30 different human tissues and in 10 cell lines shows that the gene is widely expressed in the body. Of interest, the analysis of N- and C-terminal domains of both human and rat AOEB166 reveals amino acid sequences presenting features of mitochondrial and peroxisomal targeting sequences. Furthermore, human AOEB166 expressed as a fusion protein with GFP in HepG2 cell line is sorted to these organelles. Finally, acute inflammation induced in rat lung by lipopolysaccharide is associated with an increase of AOEB166 mRNA levels in lung, suggesting a protective role for AOEB166 in oxidative and inflammatory processes.

14962227	20040214	Prothrombin Shanghai: hypoprothrombinaemia caused by substitution of Gla29 by Gly.	Prothrombin deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. In this study, we reported a Chinese family with hereditary prothrombin deficiency. The proposita had a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT, 71.6 s) and prothrombin time (PT, 28.0 s). The coagulation factors activities were normal except that prothrombin coagulation activity was markedly reduced, and the prothrombin antigen level was moderately decreased. Nucleotide sequencing of amplified DNA revealed a novel mutation, Glu (GAG) to Gly (GGG) at residue 29, which normally undergoes gamma-carboxylation within the Gla domain of prothrombin. The proposita was identified as homozygous, while her father, mother and maternal grandmother were heterozygous for the mutation. Gla29 has been demonstrated as one of the key residue for Ca2+-binding, membrane interaction and biological activity of prothrombin. 	Haemophilia	D002363 D016428
9760196	19981006	Phenotypic variation in a family with mutations in two Hirschsprung-related genes (RET and endothelin receptor B).	Hirschsprung disease is a congenital malformation affecting 1 in 5000 live births. The absence of parasympathetic neuronal ganglia (Meissner, Auerbach) in the hindgut results in poor coordination of peristaltic movement, and a varying degree of constipation. Four different genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease: the RET tyrosine kinase receptor gene; one of its ligands, the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) gene; the endothelin receptor B (EDNRB) gene; and its ligand, endothelin-3 (EDN3). Recently, combinations of mutations in two of these genes (RET and GDNF) have been reported in Hirschsprung patients. We report a family with missense mutations in both the RET gene (R982C) and the EDNRB gene (G57S). In this family, three out of five members have the two mutations, but only one, a boy, has the Hirschsprung disease phenotype. This illustrates the complexity of the molecular background of Hirschsprung disease. 	Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
12446744	20021126	Uroplakin IIIb, a urothelial differentiation marker, dimerizes with uroplakin Ib as an early step of urothelial plaque assembly.	Urothelial plaques consist of four major uroplakins (Ia, Ib, II, and III) that form two-dimensional crystals covering the apical surface of urothelium, and provide unique opportunities for studying membrane protein assembly. Here, we describe a novel 35-kD urothelial plaque-associated glycoprotein that is closely related to uroplakin III: they have a similar overall type 1 transmembrane topology; their amino acid sequences are 34% identical; they share an extracellular juxtamembrane stretch of 19 amino acids; their exit from the ER requires their forming a heterodimer with uroplakin Ib, but not with any other uroplakins; and UPIII-knockout leads to p35 up-regulation, possibly as a compensatory mechanism. Interestingly, p35 contains a stretch of 80 amino acid residues homologous to a hypothetical human DNA mismatch repair enzyme-related protein. Human p35 gene is mapped to chromosome 7q11.23 near the telomeric duplicated region of Williams-Beuren syndrome, a developmental disorder affecting multiple organs including the urinary tract. These results indicate that p35 (uroplakin IIIb) is a urothelial differentiation product structurally and functionally related to uroplakin III, and that p35-UPIb interaction in the ER is an important early step in urothelial plaque assembly.

10952778	20000823	Identification of nucleolar protein No55 as a tumour-associated autoantigen in patients with prostate cancer.	Four different genes were identified by immunoscreening of a cDNA expression library from the human prostate cancer cell line DU145 with allogeneic sera from four prostate cancer patients. A cDNA encoding the nucleolar protein No55 was further analysed and shown to be expressed at the mRNA level in several normal tissues, including ovaries, pancreas and prostate and in human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3, PC-3m and LNCaP. By reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction, expression of No55 was several-fold higher in two out of nine prostate cancer primary tumours and two out of two metastatic lesions, compared to normal prostate tissue. Antibodies to No55 were detected in sera from seven out of 47 prostate cancer patients but not in sera from 20 healthy male controls. Sequence analysis of the No55 open reading frame from normal and tumour tissues revealed no tumour-specific mutations. The No55 gene was located to chromosome 17q21, a region reported to be partially deleted in prostate cancer. Considering the immunogenicity of the No55 protein in the tumour host, the expression profile and chromosomal localization of the corresponding gene, studies evaluating No55 as a potential antigen for immunological studies in prostate cancer may be warranted.

21901787	20110909	High prevalence of mutations in LCAT in patients with low HDL cholesterol levels in The Netherlands: identification and characterization of eight novel mutations.	Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is crucial to the maturation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Homozygosity for LCAT mutations underlies rare disorders characterized by HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c) deficiency while heterozygotes have half normal HDL-c levels. We studied the prevalence of LCAT mutations in referred patients with low HDL-c to better understand the molecular basis of low HDL-c in our patients. LCAT was sequenced in 98 patients referred for HDL-c &lt;5th percentile and in four patients referred for low HDL-c and corneal opacities. LCAT mutations were highly prevalent: in 28 of the 98 participants (29%), heterozygosity for nonsynonymous mutations was identified while 18 patients carried the same mutation (p.T147I). The four patients with corneal opacity were compound heterozygotes. All previously identified mutations are documented to cause loss of catalytic activity. Nine novel mutations-c.402G&gt;T (p.E134D), c.403T&gt;A (p.Y135N), c.964C&gt;T (p.R322C), c.296G&gt;C (p.W99S), c.736G&gt;T (p.V246F), c.802C&gt;T (p.R268C), c.945G&gt;A (p.W315X), c.1012C&gt;T (p.L338F), and c.1039C&gt;T (p.R347C)--were shown to be functional through in vitro characterization. The effect of several mutations on the core protein structure was studied by a three-dimensional (3D) model. Unlike previous reports, functional mutations in LCAT were found in 29% of patients with low HDL-c, thus constituting a common cause of low HDL-c in referred patients in The Netherlands. 	Hum._Mutat.

21658913	20110611	Q8IYL2 is a candidate gene for the familial epilepsy syndrome of Partial Epilepsy with Pericentral Spikes (PEPS).	Partial Epilepsy with Pericentral Spikes (PEPS) is a novel Mendelian idiopathic epilepsy with evidence of linkage to Chromosome 4p15. Our aim was to identify the causative mutation in this epilepsy syndrome. We re-annotated all 42 genes in the linked chromosomal region and sequenced all genes within the linked interval. All exons, intron-exon boundaries and untranslated regions were sequenced in the original pedigree, and novel changes segregating correctly were subjected to bioinformatic analysis. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to examine for potential copy number variation (CNV). 29 previously undescribed variants correctly segregating with the linked haplotype were identified. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that six variants were non-synonymous coding sequence polymorphisms, one of which, in Q8IYL2 (Gly400Ala), was found in neither Caucasian (n=243) and ancestry-matched Brazilian (n=180) control samples, nor subjects from the 1000 Genome Project. No gene duplications or deletions were identified in the linked region. We postulate that Q8IYL2 is a causative gene for PEPS, after exhaustive resequencing and bioinformatic analysis. The function of this gene is unknown, but it is expressed in brain tissue. 	Epilepsy_Res.	D016428 D013485
2579949	19850410	Isolation of cDNA and genomic clones encoding human pro-alpha 1 (III) collagen. Partial characterization of the 3' end region of the gene.	A cDNA library constructed from human fibroblast poly(A+) RNA was screened for the identification of chimeric molecules bearing collagen-specific sequences. Analysis of three of the resulting positive clones showed that they encoded for the COOH-terminal propeptide region of the human Type III collagen. In addition, three overlapping clones covering more than 21 kilobases of the Type III gene were isolated from Charon 4A libraries of human genomic fragments. Identity between these and the cDNA clones was obtained by direct DNA sequencing. Establishment of the exon/intron arrangement of the Type III gene was obtained by electron microscopic analysis in conjunction with sequencing of selected genomic regions. Sequence comparison with other collagen genes confirmed some evolutionary features of this important family of proteins. Finally, the collinearity of two mRNA transcripts with 3' noncoding region length polymorphism was established. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485 D013487
16222680	20051014	A 72-year-old Danish puzzle resolved--comparative analysis of phenotypes in families with different-sized HOXD13 polyalanine expansions.	A phenotype-genotype correlation was previously described for carriers of different sized of polyalanine expansions in HOXD13. We report on a detailed comparison of 55 members (approximately 220 limbs) from 4 Danish families with duplications of 21 or 27 bp, expanding the polyalanine repeat from 15 to 22 and 24 residues, respectively. Two of these were previously described by Danish pioneers of human genetics, Tage Kemp and Oluf Thomsen. A clinical score was assigned to each limb based on manifestations assumed to represent different degrees of a duplication defect in hand rays 3-4 and foot rays 4-5. The length of metacarpals and phalangeal bones in rays 1, 2, and 5 was measured on hand radiographs and converted to Z-scores. The relative difference between corresponding right and left bones and directional, total, and fluctuating asymmetry was calculated for each individual. All of these parameters were compared between carriers of the +9 alanine expansion, the +7 alanine expansion, and non-mutation carriers with affected parents from the two families. Upper limb scores and the rate of abnormal bones (&gt;2SD) were significantly higher in the first group than in the others. The first metacarpal and the middle phalanx of the little finger were significantly shorter, and the proximal phalanx of the index finger was significantly longer in this group than in the others. An increased level of total and fluctuating asymmetry was observed in long expansion carriers. Thus, our data have added evidence to the phenotype-genotype correlation previously reported, which was further extended to include lesser involvement of bones in ray 1, 2, and 5.

16258023	20051101	Genetic variants of the human dipeptide transporter PEPT1.	We tested whether genetic polymorphisms affect activity of the dipeptide transporter PEPT1, which mediates bioavailability of peptidomimetic drugs. All 23 exons and adjoining intronic sections of PEPT1 (SLC15A1) were sequenced in 247 individuals of various ethnic origins (Coriell collection). Of 38 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 21 occurred in intronic and noncoding regions and 17 in exonic coding region, of which nine were nonsynonymous. Eight nonsynonymous variants were cloned into expression vectors and functionally characterized after transient transfection into Cos7 and Chinese hamster ovary cells. None of the variants had altered transport activity for various ligands, supporting previous results, except for the new, low-frequency PEPT1-F28Y. This variant displayed significantly reduced cephalexin uptake attributable to increased K(m). Altered pH dependence of substrate transport suggested a role for F28Y in H(+)-driven translocation. Haplotype analysis revealed significant differences among ethnic populations. To search for cis-acting polymorphisms affecting transcription and mRNA processing, we measured allelic PEPT1 mRNA expression in human intestinal biopsy samples using a frequent-marker SNP in exon 17. Of 24 heterozygous samples, significant differences in allelic mRNA levels of 20 to 30% were observed in seven tissues. However, the small difference suggests that cis-acting regulatory factors have only limited effects on transporter activity. We also measured the relative formation of a splice variant (PEPT1-RF). PEPT1-RF mRNA levels ranged from 2 to 44% of total PEPT1-related mRNA, with potential consequences for drug absorption. Together with previous results, this study reveals a relatively low level of genetic variability in polymorphisms affecting both protein function and gene regulation. 	J._Pharmacol._Exp._Ther.

11162607	20010213	cDna cloning and expression of CYP4F12, a novel human cytochrome P450.	cDNA of a novel human cytochrome P450 was cloned from human liver by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and designated CYP4F12. The open reading frame coded for 524 amino acids, and the sequence could be aligned with 78-83% amino acid identity to the four human CYP4F enzymes (CYP4F2, CYP4F3, CYP4F8 and CYP4F11). Northern blot analysis suggested three major transcripts of CYP4F12, which were detected in liver, kidney, colon, small intestine and heart. The CYP4F12 gene contained 13 exons and was located at chromosome 19p13.1. CYP4F12, expressed in yeast, oxidized arachidonic acid to 18-hydroxyarachidonic acid, and the omega-side chain of two stable prostaglandin (PG) H(2) analogs (11,9-epoxymethano-PGH(2) and 9,11-diazo-15-deoxy-PGH(2)). CYP4F12 oxidized the omega-side chain of leukotriene B(4), PGE(2), PGF(2 alpha), PGH(2), and 9,11-epoxymethano-PGH(2) poorly. Several CYP4F enzymes are important omega 1- and omega 2-hydroxylases of eicosanoids. The physiological function of CYP4F12 merits further investigation. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.

17873122	20070918	Antenatal mitochondrial disease caused by mitochondrial ribosomal protein (MRPS22) mutation.	Three patients born to the same set of consanguineous parents presented with antenatal skin oedema, hypotonia, cardiomyopathy and tubulopathy. The enzymatic activities of multiple mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes were reduced in muscle. Marked reduction of 12s rRNA, the core of the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit, was found in fibroblasts. Homozygosity mapping led to the identification of a mutation in the MRPS22 gene, which encodes a mitochondrial ribosomal protein. Transfection of the patient cells with wild-type MRPS22 cDNA increased the 12s rRNA content and normalised the enzymatic activities. Quantification of mitochondrial transcripts is advisable in patients with multiple defects of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. 	J._Med._Genet.	D002363 D016428 D013485
8929530	19961115	Absence epilepsy in tottering mutant mice is associated with calcium channel defects.	Mutations at the mouse tottering (tg) locus cause a delayed-onset, recessive neurological disorder resulting in ataxia, motor seizures, and behavioral absence seizures resembling petit mal epilepsy in humans. A more severe allele, leaner (tg(la)), also shows a slow, selective degeneration of cerebellar neurons. By positional cloning, we have identified an alpha1A voltage-sensitive calcium channel gene that is mutated in tg and tg(la) mice. The alpha1A gene is widely expressed in the central nervous system with prominent, uniform expression in the cerebellum. alpha1A expression does not mirror the localized pattern of cerebellar degeneration observed in tg(la) mice, providing evidence for regional differences in biological function of alpha1A channels. These studies define the first mutations in a mammalian central nervous system-specific voltage-sensitive calcium channel and identify the first gene involved in absence epilepsy.

11298607	20010412	Lithuanian haemophilia A and B registry comprising phenotypic and genotypic data.	Haemophilia represents the most common hereditary severe bleeding disorder in humans. About 100 families with this condition live in Lithuania, one of the Baltic states with a population of 3.7 million. Haemophilia care and genetic counselling are still rendered difficult owing to limited availability of clotting factor concentrate and molecular genetic diagnosis. In the present study, a haemophilia registry, comprising phenotypic and genotypic data of the majority of Lithuanian haemophilia A and B patients, was established. The phenotype includes the degree of severity, factor VIII:C, factor VIII:Ag, factor IX:C, von Willebrand factor and antigen (VWF:RiCoF, vWF:Ag) and inhibitor status. Genotyping of the factor VIII and IX genes was performed using mutation screening methods and direct sequencing. In 61 out of 63 patients with haemophilia A (96.8%) and all eight patients with haemophilia B (100%), the causative mutations could be detected. Nineteen of the factor VIII gene defects and two of the factor IX gene mutations are reported for the first time. Identified mutations allowed direct carrier diagnosis in 83 female relatives revealing 44 carriers, 38 non-carriers and one somatic mosaicism. The information provided by this registry will be helpful for monitoring the treatment of Lithuanian haemophilia patients and also for reliable genetic counselling of the affected families in the future.

1695633	19900725	Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3. Organization of the human chromosomal gene and demonstration of promoter activity.	Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) can modulate the mitogenic and metabolic effects of the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). IGFBP-3 protein levels are developmentally regulated and influenced by a number of hormonal stimuli both in vitro and in vivo. As a first step toward understanding how hormonal and developmental factors regulate IGFBP-3 production, we are characterizing the human IGFBP-3 chromosomal gene and promoter. Southern analysis demonstrates a single copy of the IGFBP-3 gene in the human genome. This gene spans 8.9 kilobases; the protein-coding region is divided into four exons while a fifth exon contains the 3'-untranslated region. Primer extension studies locate the IGFBP-3 mRNA cap site 132 base pairs 5' to the ATG translation initiation codon. On the chromosomal gene, this cap site is located 30 base pairs 3' to the start of a TATA box and 97 base pairs 3' to a consensus GC upstream promoter element, an organization common to many eukaryotic promoters. When this potential IGFBP-3 promoter region is placed upstream to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, it directs high-level production of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in transfected COS-1 cells. These observations suggest an uncomplicated organization for the IGFBP-3 chromosomal gene and promoter in the human genome. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485 D013487
24183309	20131105	Assessment of interferon-related biomarkers in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome associated with mutations in TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, and ADAR: a case-control study.	Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is an inflammatory disorder caused by mutations in any of six genes (TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, and ADAR). The disease is severe and effective treatments are urgently needed. We investigated the status of interferon-related biomarkers in patients with AGS with a view to future use in diagnosis and clinical trials. In this case-control study, samples were collected prospectively from patients with mutation-proven AGS. The expression of six interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) was measured by quantitative PCR, and the median fold change, when compared with the median of healthy controls, was used to create an interferon score for each patient. Scores higher than the mean of controls plus two SD (&gt;2·466) were designated as positive. Additionally, we collated historical data for interferon activity, measured with a viral cytopathic assay, in CSF and serum from mutation-positive patients with AGS. We also undertook neutralisation assays of interferon activity in serum, and looked for the presence of autoantibodies against a panel of interferon proteins. 74 (90%) of 82 patients had a positive interferon score (median 12·90, IQR 6·14-20·41) compared with two (7%) of 29 controls (median 0·93, IQR 0·57-1·30). Of the eight patients with a negative interferon score, seven had mutations in RNASEH2B (seven [27%] of all 26 patients with mutations in this gene). Repeat sampling in 16 patients was consistent for the presence or absence of an interferon signature on 39 of 41 occasions. Interferon activity (tested in 147 patients) was negatively correlated with age (CSF, r=-0·604; serum, r=-0·289), and was higher in CSF than in serum in 104 of 136 paired samples. Neutralisation assays suggested that measurable antiviral activity was related to interferon ? production. We did not record significantly increased concentrations of autoantibodies to interferon subtypes in patients with AGS, or an association between the presence of autoantibodies and interferon score or serum interferon activity. AGS is consistently associated with an interferon signature, which is apparently sustained over time and can thus be used to differentiate patients with AGS from controls. If future studies show that interferon status is a reactive biomarker, the measurement of an interferon score might prove useful in the assessment of treatment efficacy in clinical trials.

12872252	20030723	Mutational analysis of the BRCA1-interacting genes ZNF350/ZBRK1 and BRIP1/BACH1 among BRCA1 and BRCA2-negative probands from breast-ovarian cancer families and among early-onset breast cancer cases and reference individuals.	Two potential breast cancer susceptibility genes, encoding the BRCA1-interacting proteins ZNF350 (or ZBRK1) and BRIP1 (or BACH1), have been identified in yeast two-hybrid screens. We sequenced these genes in probands from 21 families with potentially inherited breast/ovarian cancer, all of which were negative for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. Families had at least one case of male breast cancer, two cases of ovarian cancer, or three or more cases of breast and ovarian cancer. In addition, 58 early-onset (before age 35) breast cancer cases and 30 reference individuals were analyzed. Of 17 variants detected in ZBRK1, a missense mutation Val524Ile was identified in the proband of one high-risk family, but no other family members were available for testing. Of 25 variants identified in BRIP1, in addition to four common silent or missense mutations, we identified Gln540Leu, a non-conservative amino acid change, in a single familial proband with inflammatory breast cancer, but this mutation was not present in her three relatives with breast cancer. Haplotype analysis suggests that all ZBRK1 SNPs fall within a single block with two SNPs capturing 92% of the haplotype diversity, while the BRIP1 SNPs fall in two blocks, with five SNPs capturing 89% of the haplotype diversity. Based on sequencing of ZBRK1 and BRIP1 in 21 BRCA1/2-negative probands from inherited breast/ovarian cancer families, it appears unlikely that mutations in these genes account for a significant fraction of inherited breast cancer. Further analysis in unselected cases will be required to know whether the identified variants play a role in genetic predisposition to breast cancer in the general population.

11123350	20001221	Distinct T cell developmental consequences in humans and mice expressing identical mutations in the DLAARN motif of ZAP-70.	The protein tyrosine kinase, ZAP-70, is pivotally involved in transduction of Ag-binding signals from the TCR required for T cell activation and development. Defects in ZAP-70 result in SCID in humans and mice. We describe an infant with SCID due to a novel ZAP-70 mutation, comparable with that which arose spontaneously in an inbred mouse colony. The patient inherited a homozygous missense mutation within the highly conserved DLAARN motif in the ZAP-70 kinase domain. Although the mutation only modestly affected protein stability, catalytic function was absent. Despite identical changes in the amino acid sequence of ZAP-70, the peripheral T cell phenotypes of our patient and affected mice are distinct. ZAP-70 deficiency in this patient, as in other humans, is characterized by abundant nonfunctional CD4(+) T cells and absent CD8(+) T cells. In contrast, ZAP-70-deficient mice lack both major T cell subsets. Although levels of the ZAP-70-related protein tyrosine kinase, Syk, may be sufficiently increased in human thymocytes to rescue CD4 development, survival of ZAP-70-deficient T cells in the periphery does not appear to be dependent on persistent up-regulation of Syk expression.

11874711	20020305	Mutation analysis of thyroid peroxidase gene in Chinese patients with total iodide organification defect: identification of five novel mutations.	Total iodide organification defect (TIOD), where the iodide in the thyroid gland cannot be oxidized and/or bound to the protein, is caused by a defect in the thyroid peroxidase (TPO) gene. Single strand conformation polymorphism analysis was used to screen for mutations in the TPO gene from five unrelated TIOD patients in Taiwan, and five novel mutations were detected. Three of these were frameshift mutations: a single T insertion between nucleotide position 2268 and 2269 (c.2268-2269 insT) in exon 13 and two single C deletions at nucleotide positions 843 (c.843 delC) and 2413 (c.2413 delC) in exon 8 and 14 respectively. The other two were single nucleotide substitutions (c.G1477&gt;A and c.G2386&gt;T) located in exons 9 and 13 respectively. While the former would result in amino acid substitution (Gly493Ser) in the highly conserved region of the TPO polypeptide, the latter would result in either amino acid substitution (Asp796Tyr) or alternative splicing. Of those identified TPO mutations, c.2268-2269 insT was most prevalent and was detected as heterozygous in all but one TIOD patients. All five TIOD patients investigated in this study were compound heterozygous. The method presented in this study could be used for carrier assessment and mutation analysis of newly identified TIOD patients. 	J._Endocrinol.	D016428 D013485
9703981	19980815	A novel type of myosin encoded by the mouse deafness gene shaker-2.	The mouse recessive deafness mutation, shaker-2(sh-2), represents a plausible model for an autosomal recessive form of human non-syndromic genetic deafness, DFNB3. Here we report the use of a positional cloning approach to show that the gene mutated in sh-2 mice encodes a novel type of unconventional myosin. A G-to-A transition changing cysteine to tyrosine in the conserved actin binding domain is detected in sh-2 but absent in laboratory strains and wild mice belonging to different mouse subspecies and species. This suggests that the novel myosin gene is a strong candidate for DFNB3. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.	D016428 D013485
7913580	19940801	Mutational analysis of patients with neurofibromatosis 2.	Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple nervous-system tumors in young adulthood. The NF2 gene has recently been isolated and found to encode a new member of the protein 4.1 family of cytoskeletal associated proteins, which we have named merlin. To define the molecular basis of NF2 in affected individuals, we have used SSCP analysis to scan the exons of the NF2 gene from 33 unrelated patients with NF2. Twenty unique SSCP variants were seen in 21 patients; 10 of these individuals were known to be the only affected person in their kindred, while 7 had at least one other known affected relative. In all cases in which family members were available, the SSCP variant segregated with the disease; comparison of sporadic cases with their parents confirmed the de novo variants. DNA sequence analysis revealed that 19 of the 20 variants observed are predicted to lead to a truncated protein due to frameshift, creation of a stop codon, or interference with normal RNA splicing. A single patient carried a 3-bp deletion removing a phenylalanine residue. We conclude that the majority of NF2 patients carry an inactivating mutation of the NF2 gene and that neutral polymorphism in the gene is rare. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485 D013486 D013487
12891679	20030802	Tibial muscular dystrophy in a Belgian family.	We report a Belgian family with autosomal dominant, late-onset, distal myopathy with selective foot extensor muscle involvement of the lower legs. Linkage to the tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD) locus 2q31 was not evident at first because of incomplete disease penetrance in a 50-year-old asymptomatic family member. An abnormal tibialis anterior muscle biopsy established her subclinical status and linkage of the family to the TMD locus. Mutation analysis showed a disease-specific, heterozygous point mutation in the last exon, Mex6, of the titin gene. This is the third mutation found in TMD and the second European family with TMD outside the Finnish population, suggesting that titinopathies may occur in various populations. 	Ann._Neurol.

11179008	20010217	Tissue-specific expression of a splicing mutation in the IKBKAP gene causes familial dysautonomia.	Familial dysautonomia (FD; also known as &quot;Riley-Day syndrome&quot;), an Ashkenazi Jewish disorder, is the best known and most frequent of a group of congenital sensory neuropathies and is characterized by widespread sensory and variable autonomic dysfunction. Previously, we had mapped the FD gene, DYS, to a 0.5-cM region on chromosome 9q31 and had shown that the ethnic bias is due to a founder effect, with &gt;99.5% of disease alleles sharing a common ancestral haplotype. To investigate the molecular basis of FD, we sequenced the minimal candidate region and cloned and characterized its five genes. One of these, IKBKAP, harbors two mutations that can cause FD. The major haplotype mutation is located in the donor splice site of intron 20. This mutation can result in skipping of exon 20 in the mRNA of patients with FD, although they continue to express varying levels of wild-type message in a tissue-specific manner. RNA isolated from lymphoblasts of patients is primarily wild-type, whereas only the deleted message is seen in RNA isolated from brain. The mutation associated with the minor haplotype in four patients is a missense (R696P) mutation in exon 19, which is predicted to disrupt a potential phosphorylation site. Our findings indicate that almost all cases of FD are caused by an unusual splice defect that displays tissue-specific expression; and they also provide the basis for rapid carrier screening in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.

10655055	20000202	ARSACS, a spastic ataxia common in northeastern Québec, is caused by mutations in a new gene encoding an 11.5-kb ORF.	Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS or SACS) is an early onset neurodegenerative disease with high prevalence (carrier frequency 1/22) in the Charlevoix-Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (CSLSJ) region of Quebec. We previously mapped the gene responsible for ARSACS to chromosome 13q11 and identified two ancestral haplotypes. Here we report the cloning of this gene, SACS, which encodes the protein sacsin. The ORF of SACS is 11,487 bp and is encoded by a single gigantic exon spanning 12,794 bp. This exon is the largest to be identified in any vertebrate organism. The ORF is conserved in human and mouse. The putative protein contains three large segments with sequence similarity to each other and to the predicted protein of an Arabidopsis thaliana ORF. The presence of heat-shock domains suggests a function for sacsin in chaperone-mediated protein folding. SACS is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the central nervous system. We identified two SACSmutations in ARSACS families that lead to protein truncation, consistent with haplotype analysis. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D013485
15532022	20041109	Six novel alleles identified in Italian hereditary fructose intolerance patients enlarge the mutation spectrum of the aldolase B gene.	Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is a recessively inherited disorder of carbohydrate metabolism caused by impaired functioning of human liver aldolase (B isoform; ALDOB). To-date, 29 enzyme-impairing mutations have been identified in the aldolase B gene. Here we report six novel HFI single nucleotide changes identified by sequence analysis in the aldolase B gene. Three of these are missense mutations (g.6846T&gt;C, g.10236G&gt;T, g.10258T&gt;C), one is a nonsense mutation (g.8187C&gt;T) and two affect splicing sites (g.8180G&gt;C and g.10196A&gt;G).

10482952	19990914	Allelic heterogeneity of alkaptonuria in Central Europe.	Defects of the homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase (HGO; E.C. No. 1.13.11.5) have been identified as the molecular cause of alkaptonuria in humans (AKU) and the aku mouse. Here, we report on the genetic basis of 30 AKU patients from Central Europe. In addition to five mutations described previously, we have detected five novel HGO mutations. Recombinant expression of mutated HGO enzymes in E. coli demonstrates the inactivating effect of three of these mutations. A genetic epidemiologic study in Slovakia, the country with the highest incidence of alkaptonuria, demonstrates that two recurrent mutations (c.183-1G &gt; A and Glyl61Arg) are found on more than 50% of AKU chromosomes. An analysis of the allelic association with intragenic DNA markers and of the geographic origins of the AKU chromosomes suggests that several independent founders have contributed to the gene pool, and that subsequent genetic isolation is likely to be responsible for the high prevalence of alkaptonuria in Slovakia.

2172968	19901001	Cloning of the cDNA encoding an RNA regulatory protein--the human iron-responsive element-binding protein.	Iron-responsive elements (IREs) are stemloop structures found in the mRNAs encoding ferritin and the transferrin receptor. These elements participate in the iron-induced regulation of the translation of ferritin and the stability of the transferrin receptor mRNA. Regulation in both instances is mediated by binding of a cytosolic protein to the IREs. High-affinity binding is seen when cells are starved of iron and results in repression of ferritin translation and inhibition of transferrin receptor mRNA degradation. The IRE-binding protein (IRE-BP) has been identified as an approximately 90-kDa protein that has been purified by both affinity and conventional chromatography. In this report we use RNA affinity chromatography and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to isolate the IRE-BP for protein sequencing. A degenerate oligonucleotide probe derived from a single peptide sequence was used to isolate a cDNA clone that encodes a protein containing 13 other sequenced peptides obtained from the IRE-BP. Consistent with previous characterization of the IRE-BP, the cDNA encodes a protein of 87 kDa with a slightly acidic pI, and the corresponding mRNA of approximately 3.6 kilobases is found in a variety of cell types. The encoded protein contains a nucleotide-binding consensus sequence and regions of cysteine and histidine clusters. This mRNA is encoded by a single gene on human chromosome 9, a finding consistent with previous localization by functional mapping. The protein contains no previously defined consensus motifs for either RNA or DNA binding. The simultaneous cloning of a different, but highly homologous, cDNA suggests that the IRE-BP is a member of a distinct gene family. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D003160 D016428 D013485 D013487
12573262	20030208	Evolutionary constraints on the Disrupted in Schizophrenia locus.	The Disrupted in Schizophrenia (DISC) locus on human chromosome 1q42 has been strongly implicated by genetic studies as a susceptibility locus for major mental illnesses. In humans the locus is transcriptionally complex, with multiple alternate splicing events, antisense transcription, and intergenic splicing all evident. We have compared the genomic sequence and transcription maps of this locus between human, mouse, pufferfish (Fugu rubripes), and, in part, zebrafish (Danio rerio). The order and orientation of EGLN1, TSNAX, and DISC1 genes are conserved between mammals and F. rubripes. Intergenic splicing and short intergenic transcripts are not found to be conserved features. DISC2, a putative noncoding transcript partially antisense to DISC1, is not conserved in mouse or F. rubripes. Alternate splice forms of the protein-coding DISC1 gene are conserved even though the genomic structure is not. The amino acid sequence of DISC1 is diverging rapidly, although a putative nuclear localization signal and discrete blocks of coiled coil are specifically conserved features.

1939207	19911115	Isolation, molecular cloning, and partial characterization of a novel carboxypeptidase B from human plasma.	A novel plasminogen-binding protein has been isolated from human plasma utilizing plasminogen-Sepharose affinity chromatography. This protein copurified with alpha 2 antiplasmin when the plasminogen affinity column was eluted with high concentrations of epsilon-aminocaproic acid (greater than 20 mM). Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate suggests this protein has an apparent Mr of 60,000. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence showed no similarity to other protein sequences. Based on the amino-terminal amino acid sequence, oligonucleotide probes were designed for polymerase chain reaction primers, and an approximately 1,800 base pair cDNA was isolated that encodes this Mr 60,000 protein. The deduced amino acid sequence reveals a primary translation product of 423 amino acids that is very similar to carboxypeptidase A and B and consists of a 22-amino acid signal peptide, a 92-amino acid activation peptide, and a 309-amino acid catalytic domain. This protein shows 44 and 40% similarity to rat procarboxypeptidase B and human mast cell procarboxypeptidase A, respectively. The residues critical for catalysis and zinc and substrate binding of carboxypeptidase A and B are conserved in the Mr 60,000 plasminogen-binding protein. The presence of aspartic acid at position 257 of the catalytic domain suggests that this protein is a basic carboxypeptidase. When activated by trypsin, it hydrolyzes carboxypeptidase B substrates, hippuryl-Arg and hippuryl-Lys, but not carboxypeptidase A substrates, and it is inhibited by the specific carboxypeptidase B inhibitor (DL-5-guanidinoethyl)mercaptosuccinic acid. We propose that the Mr 60,000 plasminogen-binding protein isolated here is a novel human plasma carboxypeptidase B and that it be designated pCPB. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D003160 D016428
8530382	19951215	Molecular cloning, expression, and partial characterization of two novel members of the ovalbumin family of serine proteinase inhibitors.	A human placental lambda gt11 cDNA library was screened for sequences encoding proteins related to human proteinase inhibitor 6 (PI6), and two plaques were identified that displayed weak hybridization at high stringency. Isolation and characterization of the DNA inserts revealed two novel sequences encoding proteins composed of 376 and 374 amino acids with predicted molecular masses of approximately 42 kDa. The novel proteins displayed all of the structural features unique to the ovalbumin family of intracellular serpins including the apparent absence of a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence. The degree of amino acid sequence identity between the novel serpins and PI6 (63-68%) significantly exceeds that of any other combination of known intracellular serpins. The two novel serpins encoded by the two novel cDNA sequences have been designated as proteinase inhibitor 8 (PI8) and proteinase inhibitor 9 (PI9). The putative reactive center P1-P1' residues for PI8 and PI9 were identified as Arg339-Cys340 and Glu340-Cys341, respectively. PI9 appears to be unique in that it is the first human serpin identified with an acidic residue in the reactive center P1 position. In addition, the reactive center loop of PI9 exhibits 54% identity with residues found in the reactive center loop of the cowpox virus CrmA serpin. Two PI8 transcripts of 1.4 kilobases (kb) and 3.8 kb were detected by Northern analysis in equal and greatest abundance in liver and lung, while the 1.4-kb mRNA was in excess over the 3.8-kb mRNA in skeletal muscle and heart. Two PI9 transcripts of 3.4 and 4.4 kb were detected in equal and greatest abundance in lung and placenta and were weakly detected in all other tissues. PI8 and PI9 were expressed in baby hamster kidney and yeast cells, respectively. Immunoblot analyses using rabbit anti-PI6 IgG indicated the presence of PI8 in the cytosolic fraction of stably transfected cells that formed an SDS-stable 67-kDa complex with human thrombin. PI9 was purified to homogeneity from the yeast cell lysate by a combination of heparin-agarose chromatography and Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography and migrated as a single band in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa. Purified recombinant PI9 failed to inhibit the amidolytic activities of trypsin, papain, thrombin, or Staphylococcus aureus endoproteinase Glu-C and did not form an SDS-stable complex when incubated with thrombin. The cognate intracellular proteinases that interact with PI8 and PI9 are unknown. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D003160 D016428 D013485 D013487
12172908	20020813	Mutation and expression analysis of the KRIT1 gene associated with cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM1).	Cavernous malformations are vascular anomalies that can cause severe neurological deficits, seizures and hemorrhagic stroke if these lesions are located in the brain. In patients with cavernomas, constitutional mutations of the KRIT1 gene have been identified. The pathogenetic mechanisms leading to cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) development are poorly understood. CCM development might be induced in utero owing to the underlying KRIT1 defect, and is triggered by environmental factors. Another model suggests that CCM develop according to the two-hit model of tumorigenesis associated with biallelic inactivation of KRIT1. So far, CCM specimens themselves have not been subjected to mutation analysis. We identified two somatic mutations in the cavernoma of a sporadic case, suggesting that pathogenesis is associated with somatic KRIT1 alterations. To gain a better understanding of the role of KRIT1 during morphogenesis, the main goal of this study was to provide a detailed description of the spatio-temporal expression pattern of Krit1 and its interaction partner Rap1A during mouse embryogenesis. We did not observe enhanced expression of either gene in the heart or large vessels; however, their expression in the developing small vessels or capillaries could not be assessed by the methods applied. At early embryonic stages, Krit1 and, to a lesser extent, Rap1A are expressed in the developing nervous system. During later phases of fetal development, specific expression of both genes is observed in regions of ossification, the dermis, tendons and in the meninges. These findings provide evidence of differential Krit1 and Rap1A expression during mouse ontogenesis and suggest a more widespread functional significance of Krit1, not restricted to vascular endothelial cells.

1970634	19900501	A frequent tyrosinase gene mutation in classic, tyrosinase-negative (type IA) oculocutaneous albinism.	We have identified a tyrosinase gene mutation in several patients with classic, tyrosinase-negative (type IA) oculocutaneous albinism. This mutation, which results in a proline----leucine substitution at codon 81 of the tyrosinase polypeptide (EC 1.14.18.1), was observed in 20% (6 of 30) of oculocutaneous albinism alleles from independent probands, but it was not observed in any normal individuals. This mutation thus appears to be a frequent cause of tyrosinase-negative oculocutaneous albinism. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D002363 D016428 D013485 D013487
21802064	20110802	Why boys will be boys: two pathways of fetal testicular androgen biosynthesis are needed for male sexual differentiation.	Human sexual determination is initiated by a cascade of genes that lead to the development of the fetal gonad. Whereas development of the female external genitalia does not require fetal ovarian hormones, male genital development requires the action of testicular testosterone and its more potent derivative dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The &quot;classic&quot; biosynthetic pathway from cholesterol to testosterone in the testis and the subsequent conversion of testosterone to DHT in genital skin is well established. Recently, an alternative pathway leading to DHT has been described in marsupials, but its potential importance to human development is unclear. AKR1C2 is an enzyme that participates in the alternative but not the classic pathway. Using a candidate gene approach, we identified AKR1C2 mutations with sex-limited recessive inheritance in four 46,XY individuals with disordered sexual development (DSD). Analysis of the inheritance of microsatellite markers excluded other candidate loci. Affected individuals had moderate to severe undervirilization at birth; when recreated by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in bacteria, the mutant AKR1C2 had diminished but not absent catalytic activities. The 46,XY DSD individuals also carry a mutation causing aberrant splicing in AKR1C4, which encodes an enzyme with similar activity. This suggests a mode of inheritance where the severity of the developmental defect depends on the number of mutations in the two genes. An unrelated 46,XY DSD patient carried AKR1C2 mutations on both alleles, confirming the essential role of AKR1C2 and corroborating the hypothesis that both the classic and alternative pathways of testicular androgen biosynthesis are needed for normal human male sexual differentiation.

21551322	20110510	Sarcomere gene mutations in isolated left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy do not predict clinical phenotype.	Left ventricular noncompaction of the myocardium (LVNC) has been recognized as a cardiomyopathy with a genetic etiology. Mutations in genes encoding sarcomere proteins were shown to be associated with LVNC. We evaluated the potential clinical impact of genetic analysis of sarcomere genes in patients with LVNC. We identified 5 mutations in cardiac myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3) and 2 mutations in ?-tropomyosin (TPM1) in a cohort of unrelated adult probands with isolated LVNC. The mutations in MYBPC3 and TPM1 and in 6 other previously reported sarcomere genes in this cohort resulted in a total of 18 (29%) heterozygous mutations in 63 probands. ?-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) was the most prevalent disease gene and accounts for 13% of cases, followed by MYBPC3 (8%). Comparing sarcomere mutation-positive and mutation-negative LVNC probands showed no significant differences in terms of average age, myocardial function, and presence of heart failure or tachyarrhythmias at initial presentation or at follow-up. Familial disease was found in 16 probands of whom 8 were sarcomere mutation positive. Nonpenetrance was detected in 2 of 8 mutation-positive families with LVNC. Mutations in sarcomere genes account for a significant (29%) proportion of cases of isolated LVNC in this cohort. The distribution of disease genes confirms genetic heterogeneity and opens new perspectives in genetic testing in patients with LVNC and their relatives at high risk of inheriting the cardiomyopathy. The presence or absence of a sarcomere gene mutation in LVNC cannot be related to the clinical phenotype. 	Circ_Cardiovasc_Genet	D016428 D013485
8277847	19931101	Mitochondrial COII sequences and modern human origins.	The aim of this study is to measure human mitochondrial sequence variability in the relatively slowly evolving mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII) and to estimate when the human common ancestral mitochondrial type existed. New COII gene sequences were determined for five humans (Homo sapiens), including some of the most mitochondrially divergent humans known; for two pygmy chimpanzees (Pan paniscus); and for a common chimpanzee (P. troglodytes). COII sequences were analyzed with those from another relatively slowly evolving mitochondrial region (ND4-5). From class 1 (third codon position) sequence data, a relative divergence date for the human mitochondrial ancestor is estimated as 1/27 th of the human-chimpanzee divergence time. If it is assumed that humans and chimpanzees diverged 6 Mya, this places a human mitochondrial ancestor at 222,000 years, significantly different from 1 Myr (the presumed time of an H. erectus emergence from Africa). The mean coalescent time estimated from all 1,580 sites of combined mitochondrial data, when a 6-Mya human-chimpanzee divergence is assumed, is 298,000 years, with 95% confidence interval of 129,000-536,000 years. Neither estimate is compatible with a 1-Myr-old human mitochondrial ancestor. The mitochondrial DNA sequence data from COII and ND4-5 regions therefore do not support this multiregional hypothesis for the emergence of modern humans. 	Mol._Biol._Evol.	D003160 D016428 D013485
12659812	20030328	Cloning and characterization of human CADPS and CADPS2, new members of the Ca2+-dependent activator for secretion protein family.	The recent identification of some of the components involved in regulated and constitutive exocytotic pathways has yielded important insights into the mechanisms of membrane trafficking and vesicle secretion. To understand precisely the molecular events taking place during vesicle exocytosis, we must identify all of the proteins implicated in these pathways. In this paper we describe the full-length cloning and characterization of human CADPS and CADPS2, two new homologs of the mouse Cadps protein involved in large dense-core vesicle (LDCV)-regulated exocytosis. We show that these two genes have disparate RNA expression patterns, with CADPS restricted to neural and endocrine tissues and CADPS2 expressed ubiquitously. We also identify a C2 domain, a known protein motif involved in calcium and phospholipid interactions, in both CADPS and CADPS2. We propose that CADPS functions as a calcium sensor in regulated exocytosis, whereas CADPS2 acts as a calcium sensor in constitutive vesicle trafficking and secretion. CADPS and CADPS2 were determined to span 475 kb and 561 kb on human chromosomes 3p21.1 and 7q31.3, respectively. The q31-q34 of human chromosome 7 has recently been identified to contain a putative susceptibility locus for autism (AUTS1). The function, expression profile, and location of CADPS2 make it a candidate gene for autism, and thus we conducted mutation screening for all 28 exons in 90 unrelated autistic individuals. We identified several nucleotide substitutions, including only one that would affect the amino acid sequence. No disease-specific variants were identified. 	Genomics	D016428 D013485
15241801	20040709	USH2A mutation analysis in 70 Dutch families with Usher syndrome type II.	Usher syndrome type II (USH2) is characterised by moderate to severe high-frequency hearing impairment, progressive visual loss due to retinitis pigmentosa and intact vestibular responses. Three loci are known for USH2, however, only the gene for USH2a (USH2A) has been identified. Mutation analysis of USH2A was performed in 70 Dutch USH2 families. Ten mutations in USH2A were detected, of which three are novel, c.949C&gt;A, c.2242C&gt;T (p.Gln748X) and c.4405C&gt;T (p.Gln1468X). Including 9 previously published Dutch USH2a families, estimates of the prevalence of USH2a in the Dutch USH2 population were made. Mutations were identified in 62% of the families. In 28% both mutated alleles were identified, whereas in 34% the mutation in only one allele was found. It is estimated that about 28% of the Dutch USH2 families have a different causative gene. Analysis of deduced haplotypes suggests that c.1256G&gt;T (p.Cys419Phe) is a Dutch ancestral mutation, occurring in 16% of the alleles. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428 D013485 D013487

We report on a 2-year-old male child with both nemaline myopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Sequencing of the ACTA1 gene showed a &quot;de novo&quot; missense heterozygous mutation a&gt;g in exon 7 (Lys336Glu). Two-dimensional electrophoresis showed 28% mutant actin present in his muscle biopsy. Actin was isolated from the muscle biopsy and examined by in vitro motility assay. The sliding speed was 13+/-3% less than normal and the affinity of actin for the Z-line protein alpha-actinin was reduced 10 fold. This is the first report on a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with nemaline myopathy and an ACTA1 mutation. 	Neuromuscul._Disord.	D002363 D016428 D013485
15148642	20040519	Bioinformatic discovery and initial characterisation of nine novel antimicrobial peptide genes in the chicken.	Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are essential components of innate immunity in a range of species from Drosophila to humans and are generally thought to act by disrupting the membrane integrity of microbes. In order to discover novel AMPs in the chicken, we have implemented a bioinformatic approach that involves the clustering of more than 420,000 chicken expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Similarity searching of proteins-predicted to be encoded by these EST clusters-for homology to known AMPs has resulted in the in silico identification of full-length sequences for seven novel gallinacins (Gal-4 to Gal-10), a novel cathelicidin and a novel liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP-2) in the chicken. Differential gene expression of these novel genes has been demonstrated across a panel of chicken tissues. An evolutionary analysis of the gallinacin family has detected sites-primarily in the mature AMP-that are under positive selection in these molecules. The functional implications of these results are discussed. 	Immunogenetics	D016428 D013485
10699187	20000304	Spectrum of SPG4 mutations in autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia.	Autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia (AD-HSP) is a group of genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders characterized by pro- gressive spasticity of the lower limbs. Five AD-HSP loci have been mapped to chromosomes 14q, 2p, 15q, 8q and 12q. The SPG4 locus at 2p21-p22 has been shown to account for approximately 40% of all AD-HSP families. SPG4 encoding spastin, a putative nuclear AAA protein, has recently been identified. Here, sequence analysis of the 17 exons of SPG4 in 87 unrelated AD-HSP patients has resulted in the detection of 34 novel mutations. These SPG4 mutations are scattered along the coding region of the gene and include all types of DNA modification including missense (28%), nonsense (15%) and splice site point (26.5%) mutations as well as deletions (23%) and insertions (7.5%). The clinical analysis of the 238 mutation carriers revealed a high proportion of both asymptomatic carriers (14/238) and patients unaware of symptoms (45/238), and permitted the redefinition of this frequent form of AD-HSP.

20512146	20100601	Mutations in TMEM216 perturb ciliogenesis and cause Joubert, Meckel and related syndromes.	Joubert syndrome (JBTS), related disorders (JSRDs) and Meckel syndrome (MKS) are ciliopathies. We now report that MKS2 and CORS2 (JBTS2) loci are allelic and caused by mutations in TMEM216, which encodes an uncharacterized tetraspan transmembrane protein. Individuals with CORS2 frequently had nephronophthisis and polydactyly, and two affected individuals conformed to the oro-facio-digital type VI phenotype, whereas skeletal dysplasia was common in fetuses affected by MKS. A single G218T mutation (R73L in the protein) was identified in all cases of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (n=10). TMEM216 localized to the base of primary cilia, and loss of TMEM216 in mutant fibroblasts or after knockdown caused defective ciliogenesis and centrosomal docking, with concomitant hyperactivation of RhoA and Dishevelled. TMEM216 formed a complex with Meckelin, which is encoded by a gene also mutated in JSRDs and MKS. Disruption of tmem216 expression in zebrafish caused gastrulation defects similar to those in other ciliary morphants. These data implicate a new family of proteins in the ciliopathies and further support allelism between ciliopathy disorders. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013485
24951643	20140622	Agrin mutations lead to a congenital myasthenic syndrome with distal muscle weakness and atrophy.	Congenital myasthenic syndromes are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of rare diseases resulting from impaired neuromuscular transmission. Their clinical hallmark is fatigable muscle weakness associated with a decremental muscle response to repetitive nerve stimulation and frequently related to postsynaptic defects. Distal myopathies form another clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of primary muscle disorders where weakness and atrophy are restricted to distal muscles, at least initially. In both congenital myasthenic syndromes and distal myopathies, a significant number of patients remain genetically undiagnosed. Here, we report five patients from three unrelated families with a strikingly homogenous clinical entity combining congenital myasthenia with distal muscle weakness and atrophy reminiscent of a distal myopathy. MRI and neurophysiological studies were compatible with mild myopathy restricted to distal limb muscles, but decrement (up to 72%) in response to 3 Hz repetitive nerve stimulation pointed towards a neuromuscular transmission defect. Post-exercise increment (up to 285%) was observed in the distal limb muscles in all cases suggesting presynaptic congenital myasthenic syndrome. Immunofluorescence and ultrastructural analyses of muscle end-plate regions showed synaptic remodelling with denervation-reinnervation events. We performed whole-exome sequencing in two kinships and Sanger sequencing in one isolated case and identified five new recessive mutations in the gene encoding agrin. This synaptic proteoglycan with critical function at the neuromuscular junction was previously found mutated in more typical forms of congenital myasthenic syndrome. In our patients, we found two missense mutations residing in the N-terminal agrin domain, which reduced acetylcholine receptors clustering activity of agrin in vitro. Our findings expand the spectrum of congenital myasthenic syndromes due to agrin mutations and show an unexpected correlation between the mutated gene and the associated phenotype. This provides a good rationale for examining patients with apparent distal myopathy for a neuromuscular transmission disorder and agrin mutations. 	Brain	D002363 D016428 D013485
17379824	20070324	COL4A1 mutation in a patient with sporadic, recurrent intracerebral hemorrhage.	Recently COL4A1, a gene encoding the type IV collagen alpha1 chain, has been found to be involved in families with autosomal-dominant porencephaly and infantile hemiparesis. In addition to neonatal stroke, some family members had experienced, during adulthood, spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs) and leukoencephalopathy, suggestive of underlying small-vessel disease of the brain. We now report a patient with sporadic, recurrent ICHs and a novel COL4A1 mutation. We performed a clinical and genetic study of a 25-year-old-patient with an 8-year history of recurrent ICHs. This young, normotensive patient with a history of infantile hemiparesis had experienced, since the age of 17, recurrent, spontaneous, deep ICHs occurring during sports activities. He became severely disabled. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed ventricular enlargement, diffuse white-matter abnormalities, and newly appearing, deep, silent microbleeds. Extensive investigations found no cause. There was no family history of stroke or infantile hemiparesis. A novel COL4A1 mutation (G805R) was identified. The clinical spectrum of COL4A1 mutations includes recurrent ICHs in association with diffuse leukoencephalopathy in young adults, even in the absence of a family history of infantile hemiparesis or ICH. In addition to birth trauma, anticoagulant use, and head trauma previously reported, sports activities may be a precipitating factor of ICHs in persons with COL4A1 mutations. 	Stroke	D002363 D016428
12701758	20030419	Mutation of the EYA1 gene in patients with branchio-oto syndrome.	Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) and branchio-oto (BO) syndromes are autosomal dominant disorders, characterized by the presence of branchial, otic and renal anomalies of varying degrees of severity. We investigated the presence of EYA1 mutation in two unrelated patients with autosomal dominant hereditary deafness and congenital preauricular fistula. Case 1 had a mutation and polymorphisms, while Case 2 had polymorphisms with no mutations. In Case 1 we detected a heterozygous A--&gt;G mutation at nucleotide 625 resulting in a serine to glycine substitution at codon 189 (S189G). The S189G mutation was not detected in 54 controls (108 alleles). Pure-tone audiometry showed bilateral mixed hearing loss of mild to moderate severity in Case 1. Case 2 had suffered from bilateral hearing loss since the age of 5 years and pure-tone audiometry showed bilateral moderate mixed hearing loss. These results suggest that the S189G mutation is a candidate mutation for BOR/BO syndrome. 	Acta_Otolaryngol.	D002363 D016428

We report a novel mutation in a case of ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens that results in a threonine --&gt; proline substitution in a novel location, codon 485 in a highly conserved residue position of the IATYRKLLEGE consensus motif at the end of the 2B rod domain segment of the keratin 2e chain. The disease phenotype is consistent with the inappropriate substitution of a proline near the end of the rod domain, because it lies near the predicted molecular overlap region of coiled-coil molecules, which is critical for the maintenance of the structural integrity of keratin intermediate filaments.

7920660	19940701	MASA syndrome is due to mutations in the neural cell adhesion gene L1CAM.	MASA syndrome is a recessive X-linked disorder characterized by mental retardation, adducted thumbs, shuffling gait, aphasia and, in some cases, hydrocephalus. Since it has been shown that X-linked hydrocephalus can be caused by mutations in L1CAM, a neuronal cell adhesion molecule, we performed an L1CAM mutation analysis in eight unrelated patients with MASA syndrome. Three different L1CAM mutations were identified: a deletion removing part of the open reading frame and two point mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions. L1CAM, therefore, harbours mutations leading to either MASA syndrome or HSAS, and might be frequently implicated in X-linked mental retardation with or without hydrocephalus. 	Nat._Genet.

The protease responsible for the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and necessary for apoptosis has been purified and characterized. This enzyme, named apopain, is composed of two subunits of relative molecular mass (M(r)) 17K and 12K that are derived from a common proenzyme identified as CPP32. This proenzyme is related to interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme (ICE) and CED-3, the product of a gene required for programmed cell death in Caenorhabditis elegans. A potent peptide aldehyde inhibitor has been developed and shown to prevent apoptotic events in vitro, suggesting that apopain/CPP32 is important for the initiation of apoptotic cell death.

10931211	20000810	The amino-acid sequence of the abalone (Haliotis laevigata) nacre protein perlucin. Detection of a functional C-type lectin domain with galactose/mannose specificity.	Perlucin isolated from abalone nacre consists of 155 amino acids including a glycosylated asparagine. The sequence of the first 130 amino acids shows a high similarity to the C-type carbohydrate-recognition domains of asialoglycoprotein receptors and other members of the group of C-type lectins but also a weaker similarity to related proteins without carbohydrate-binding activity. This C-type module is followed by a short C-terminal domain containing two almost identical sequence repeats with a length of 10 amino acids. Solid phase assays show a divalent metal ion-dependent binding of perlucin to (neo)glycoproteins containing D-galactose or D-mannose/D-glucose indicating that perlucin is a functional C-type lectin with broad carbohydrate-binding specificity. Our results also indicate that it may be difficult to predict carbohydrate-binding specificity and the occurrence of alternative binding configurations by amino-acid sequence comparisons and homology modeling.

19429006	20090512	The interplay of two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CACNA1A gene may contribute to migraine susceptibility.	Migraine is a common disorder with a significant genetic component. Mutations in the CACNA1A gene are found in hemiplegic migraine (HM). Basilar-type (BM), another subtype of migraine with aura, differs from HM only by the absence of motor deficits. BM and HM may thus share common genetic features. In the present study, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the CACNA1A gene were characterized in a population of migraine patients and healthy controls. The polymorphisms, E918D, predicting a glutamic acid-to-aspartic acid substitution at codon 918 and E993V, predicting a glutamic acid-to-valine substitution at codon 993, were frequently detected among patients and controls. Seven BM, 10 SHM, 5 FHM, 57 migraine with typical aura, 32 migraine without aura patients and 107 healthy controls were screened. The E918D and E993V SNPs were found in 30/117 (25.6%) and 32/117 (27.3%) migraine patients, respectively. The prevalence of these SNPs taken separately was not significantly different from that of control subjects (n=28/107, 26.2% for E918D; n=29/107 for E993V, 27.1%) neither for the total migraine population nor for the various migraine subtypes. By contrast, coexistence of both SNPs was more frequent in migraineurs (25/117, 21%) than in healthy controls (12/107, 11%; p=0.048), a difference that was significant for every migraine subtype. This result suggests that the interplay of minor genetic variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms may influence the P/Q-type calcium channel function in several subtypes of migraine.

19765683	20090922	Heterozygous NTF4 mutations impairing neurotrophin-4 signaling in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma.	Glaucoma, a main cause of blindness in the developed world, is characterized by progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), resulting in irreversible loss of vision. Although members of the neurotrophin gene family in various species are known to support the survival of numerous neuronal populations, including RGCs, it is less clear whether they are also required for survival and maintenance of adult neurons in humans. Here, we report seven different heterozygous mutations in the Neurotrophin-4 (NTF4) gene accounting for about 1.7% of primary open-angle glaucoma patients of European origin. Molecular modeling predicted a decreased affinity of neurotrophin 4 protein (NT-4) mutants with its specific tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB). Expression of recombinant NT-4 carrying the most frequent mutation was demonstrated to lead to decreased activation of TrkB. These findings suggest a pathway in the pathophysiology of glaucoma through loss of neurotrophic function and may eventually open the possibility of using ligands activating TrkB to prevent the progression of the disease.

We performed a complex analysis of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene in Slovakia based on direct cDNA sequencing supplemented by multiple ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis. All 108 patients had café-au-lait spots, 85% had axilary and/or inguinal freckling, 61% neurofibromas, 36% Lisch nodules of the iris and 31% optic pathway glioma, 5% suffered from typical skeletal disorders, and 51% of patients had family members with NF1. In 78 of the 86 (90.7%) index patients our analysis revealed the presence of NF1 mutations, 68 of which were small changes (87.2%), including 39 (50%) novel. Among the identified mutations the most prevalent were small deletions and insertions causing frameshift (42.3%), followed by nonsense (14.1%), missense (12.8%), and typical splicing (11.5%) mutations. Type 1 NF1 deletions and intragenic deletions/duplication were identified in five cases each (6.4%). Interestingly, in five other cases nontypical splicing variants were found, whose real effect on NF1 transcript would have remained undetected if using a DNA-based method alone, thus underlying the advantage of using the cDNA-based sequencing. We show that Slovak NF1 patients have a similar repertoire of NF1 germline mutations compared to other populations, with some prevalence of small deletions/insertions and a decreased proportion of nonsense mutations.

14681881	20031219	Infantile spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1).	Autosomal recessive spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) is the second anterior horn cell disease in infants in which the genetic defect has been defined. SMARD1 results from mutations in the gene encoding the immunoglobulin micro-binding protein 2 (IGHMBP2) on chromosome 11q13. Our aim was to review the clinical features of 29 infants affected with SMARD1 and report on 26 novel IGHMBP2 mutations. Intrauterine growth retardation, weak cry, and foot deformities were the earliest symptoms of SMARD1. Most patients presented at the age of 1 to 6 months with respiratory distress due to diaphragmatic paralysis and progressive muscle weakness with predominantly distal lower limb muscle involvement. Sensory and autonomic nerves are also affected. Because of the poor prognosis, there is a demand for prenatal diagnosis, and clear diagnostic criteria for infantile SMARD1 are needed. The diagnosis of SMARD1 should be considered in infants with non-5q spinal muscular atrophy, neuropathy, and muscle weakness and/or respiratory distress of unclear cause. Furthermore, consanguineous parents of a child with sudden infant death syndrome should be examined for IGHMBP2 mutations. 	Ann._Neurol.	D016428 D013485
23878505	20130724	Novel mutations in RPE65 identified in consanguineous Pakistani families with retinal dystrophy.	To identify pathogenic mutations responsible for retinal dystrophy in three consanguineous Pakistani families. A thorough ophthalmic examination including fundus examination and electroretinography was performed, and blood samples were collected from all participating members. Genomic DNA was extracted, and genome-wide linkage and/or exclusion analyses were completed with fluorescently labeled short tandem repeat microsatellite markers. Two-point Lod scores were calculated, and coding exons along with exon-intron boundaries of RPE65 gene were sequenced, bidirectionally. Ophthalmic examinations of the patients affected in all three families suggested retinal dystrophy with an early, most probably congenital, onset. Genome-wide linkage and/or exclusion analyses localized the critical interval in all three families to chromosome 1p31 harboring RPE65. Bidirectional sequencing of RPE65 identified a splice acceptor site variation in intron 2: c.95-1G&gt;A, a single base substitution in exon 3: c.179T&gt;C, and a single base deletion in exon 5: c.361delT in the three families, respectively. All three variations segregated with the disease phenotype in their respective families and were absent from ethnically matched control chromosomes.

We investigated the prevalence of lamin A/C (LMNA) gene defects in familial and sporadic dilated cardiomyopathies (DCM) associated with atrioventricular block (AVB) or increased serum creatine-phosphokinase (sCPK), and the corresponding changes in myocardial and protein expression. It has been reported that familial DCM, associated with conduction disturbances or variable myopathies, is causally linked to LMNA gene defects. The LMNA gene and myocardial ultrastructural and immunochemical changes were analyzed in 73 cases of DCM (49 pure, 15 with AVB [seven familial, eight sporadic], 9 with increased sCPK), four cases of familial AVB and 19 non-DCM heart diseases. The normal controls included eight heart donor biopsies for tissue studies and 107 subjects for LMNA gene studies. Five novel LMNA mutations (K97E, E111X, R190W, E317K, four base pair insertion at 1,713 cDNA) were identified in five cases of familial autosomal dominant DCM with AVB (5/15: 33%). The LMNA expression of the myocyte nuclei was reduced or absent. Western blot protein analyses of three hearts with different mutations showed an additional 30-kDa band, suggesting a degrading effect of mutated on wild-type protein. Focal disruptions, bleb formation and nuclear pore clustering were documented by electron microscopy of the myocyte nuclear membranes. None of these changes and no mutations were found in the nine patients with DCM and increased sCPK or in the disease and normal controls. The LMNA gene mutations account for 33% of the DCMs with AVB, all familial autosomal dominant. Increased sCPK in patients with DCM without AVB is not a useful predictor of LMNA mutation.

8475492	19930201	Structural diversity in the HLA-A10 family of alleles: correlations with serology.	The HLA-A10 crossreacting group consists of the A25, A26, A34, A43 and A66 antigens. Here, we report allelic sequences for A43 and for 2 subtypes of both A26 and A34. Combining these results with previously determined sequences for A25, A26 and A66 enables molecular comparison of all the serologically defined A10 antigens. They form a closely related and well-defined group of alleles which may have originated with A*2601. Patterns of serological crossreactivity are correlated with sequence and a public epitope shared by A33 and members of the A10 family is localized to residues R62 and N63. The A*2501, A*4301 and A*6601 alleles appear to have derived from A*2601 by single gene conversion events with other HLA-A alleles. In the case of A*4301, the donor allele was probably an A29 allele as A*4301 has a small element of sequence in the alpha 1 helix (residues L62 and Q63) uniquely shared with A29. The chimaeric structure of A43 explains the reactivity of A43 molecules with both A10 and A29 alloantisera. The rare Oriental variant of A26 (A26v*) is encoded by an allele (A*2602) that differs from A*2601 by a unique nucleotide substitution which changes aspartate to asparagine at position 116 in the floor of the peptide binding groove. Thus A*2602 is a functionally distinct allele that originated by a point mutation. Alleles encoding A34 and A66 antigens are found to have very similar structures, explaining the difficulty in their serological definition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) 	Tissue_Antigens	D003160 D016428 D013485 D013487
10759707	20000412	Genetic studies of three Japanese patients with p22-phox-deficient chronic granulomatous disease: detection of a possible common mutant CYBA allele in Japan and a genotype-phenotype correlation in these patients.	Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a disorder caused by defects in the NADPH oxidase responsible for superoxide generation in phagocytes. Cytochrome b558, an essential component of this enzyme, is a heterodimer formed by a 91 kDa glycoprotein (gp91-phox) and a 22 kDa polypeptide (p22-phox). Mutations in the p22-phox gene (CYBA) locus in 16q24 result in one of the rare autosomal recessive forms of CGD. We performed mutation analysis in three female CGD patients suspected of having this form of the disease and found two novel mutations in CYBA. Whereas patient 1 with severe phenotype had a homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 1 (C-35 --&gt; T, Gln-3 --&gt; stop), patients 2 and 3 with mild phenotype shared the same homozygous missense mutation in exon 2 (G-98 --&gt; A, Gly-24 --&gt; Arg). None of the parents of patients 2 and 3 is related. Therefore, this mutation could be a hot-spot or a common mutation in the Japanese population. Patients 2 and 3, but not patient 1, were demonstrated to have detectable p22-phox expression and significant granulocyte respiratory burst (ROB) activity. In this study, we were able to demonstrate an excellent correlation between genotype, p22-phox expression, ROB activity and clinical phenotype in these patients. 	Br._J._Haematol.	D016428
11917274	20020328	A missense mutation in the LIM2 gene is associated with autosomal recessive presenile cataract in an inbred Iraqi Jewish family.	In an inbred Iraqi Jewish family, we have studied three siblings with presenile cataract first noticed between the ages of 20 and 51 years and segregating in an autosomal recessive mode. Using microsatellite repeat markers in close proximity to 25 genes and loci previously associated with congenital cataracts in humans and mice, we identified five markers on chromosome 19q that cosegregated with the disease. Sequencing of LIM2, one of two candidate genes in this region, revealed a homozygous T--&gt;G change resulting in a phenylalanine-to-valine substitution at position 105 of the protein. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first report, in humans, of cataract formation associated with a mutation in LIM2. Studies of late-onset single-gene cataracts may provide insight into the pathogenesis of the more common age-related cataracts. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
15772651	20050318	The DNA sequence of the human X chromosome.	The human X chromosome has a unique biology that was shaped by its evolution as the sex chromosome shared by males and females. We have determined 99.3% of the euchromatic sequence of the X chromosome. Our analysis illustrates the autosomal origin of the mammalian sex chromosomes, the stepwise process that led to the progressive loss of recombination between X and Y, and the extent of subsequent degradation of the Y chromosome. LINE1 repeat elements cover one-third of the X chromosome, with a distribution that is consistent with their proposed role as way stations in the process of X-chromosome inactivation. We found 1,098 genes in the sequence, of which 99 encode proteins expressed in testis and in various tumour types. A disproportionately high number of mendelian diseases are documented for the X chromosome. Of this number, 168 have been explained by mutations in 113 X-linked genes, which in many cases were characterized with the aid of the DNA sequence. 	Nature	D016428 D013485
8196184	19940401	[Structure and regulation of human thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) gene].	This article describes the structure of human thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) gene and the regulation of its expression. TSH is a heterodimer composed of common alpha subunit and unique beta subunit encoded by genes located on different chromosomes. It is known that the expression of these subunit genes is regulated in different mechanism by several extracellular factors. The DNA sequencing data of the gene demonstrated that these genes were regulated by interaction of several potential regulatory elements with transcription factors. This transcriptional regulation was analyzed by transient expression of chimeric gene fragments and DNA-protein binding assay, in vitro. To identify the essential DNA regulatory elements of the human TSH beta gene in vivo, we introduced 1.1 kbp of the 5' flanking region of the human TSH beta gene-simian virus 40 T-antigen (SVT) fusion gene into the mouse. This region could direct pituitary-specific expression of SVT and tumorigenesis in transgenic mice. 	Nippon_Rinsho	D004740 D016428 D016454
24073655	20131001	Homozygous variegate porphyria presenting with developmental and language delay in childhood.	Variegate porphyria is an autosomal dominant disorder that usually presents with photosensitivity and acute neurological crises in adulthood. It is caused by heterozygous mutations in the protoporphyrinogen oxidase gene (PPOX). A rarer variant, homozygous variegate porphyria (HVP), presents in childhood with recurrent skin blisters and scarring. More variable features of HVP are short stature, brachydactyly, nystagmus, epilepsy, developmental delay and mental retardation. We describe a child who presented with nystagmus, developmental delay and ataxia, combined with a photosensitive eruption. Analysis of porphyrins in plasma, urine and stool supported a clinical diagnosis of HVP. DNA from the patient showed that he is compound heterozygous for two novel missense mutations in the PPOX coding region: c.169G&gt;C (p.Gly57Arg) and c.1259C&gt;G (Pro420Arg). Interestingly, cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed an absence of myelin, a feature not previously reported in HVP, which expands the differential diagnosis of childhood hypomyelinating leucoencephalopathies.

17018572	20061005	RNA editing in Drosophila melanogaster: New targets and functional consequences.	Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA [adenosine deaminase, RNA specific (ADAR)] catalyze the site-specific conversion of adenosine to inosine in primary mRNA transcripts. These re-coding events affect coding potential, splice sites, and stability of mature mRNAs. ADAR is an essential gene, and studies in mouse, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila suggest that its primary function is to modify adult behavior by altering signaling components in the nervous system. By comparing the sequence of isogenic cDNAs to genomic DNA, we have identified and experimentally verified 27 new targets of Drosophila ADAR. Our analyses led us to identify new classes of genes whose transcripts are targets of ADAR, including components of the actin cytoskeleton and genes involved in ion homeostasis and signal transduction. Our results indicate that editing in Drosophila increases the diversity of the proteome, and does so in a manner that has direct functional consequences on protein function.

12529507	20030117	Identification of a gene causing human cytochrome c oxidase deficiency by integrative genomics.	Identifying the genes responsible for human diseases requires combining information about gene position with clues about biological function. The recent availability of whole-genome data sets of RNA and protein expression provides powerful new sources of functional insight. Here we illustrate how such data sets can expedite disease-gene discovery, by using them to identify the gene causing Leigh syndrome, French-Canadian type (LSFC, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man no. 220111), a human cytochrome c oxidase deficiency that maps to chromosome 2p16-21. Using four public RNA expression data sets, we assigned to all human genes a &quot;score&quot; reflecting their similarity in RNA-expression profiles to known mitochondrial genes. Using a large survey of organellar proteomics, we similarly classified human genes according to the likelihood of their protein product being associated with the mitochondrion. By intersecting this information with the relevant genomic region, we identified a single clear candidate gene, LRPPRC. Resequencing identified two mutations on two independent haplotypes, providing definitive genetic proof that LRPPRC indeed causes LSFC. LRPPRC encodes an mRNA-binding protein likely involved with mtDNA transcript processing, suggesting an additional mechanism of mitochondrial pathophysiology. Similar strategies to integrate diverse genomic information can be applied likewise to other disease pathways and will become increasingly powerful with the growing wealth of diverse, functional genomics data.

8875188	19960101	Fabry disease: fourteen alpha-galactosidase A mutations in unrelated families from the United Kingdom and other European countries.	The nature of the molecular lesions in the alpha-galactosidase A gene causing Fabry disease in 12 unrelated families from the United Kingdom and 4 from other European countries was determined in order to provide precise heterozygote detection and prenatal diagnosis for these families. The entire alpha-galactosidase A coding region and flanking intronic sequences were analyzed by amplification of genomic DNA and solid-phase direct sequencing or by SSCP analysis followed by solid-phase direct sequencing. Fourteen new mutations were identified including 10 missense mutations (M42V, R49S, C56Y, D92H, D93G, P205T, W236C, W287G, N298H, and W340R), 2 nonsense mutations (Q107X and Q119X) and 2 small deletions (257del18 and 1087del1). Together with the previously reported mutations, a total of 33 lesions in the alpha-galactosidase A gene have been identified in unrelated British families, further documenting the molecular genetic heterogeneity of this disease.

10429367	19990803	Isolation, tissue expression, and chromosomal assignment of a human LIM protein gene, showing homology to rat enigma homologue (ENH).	Rat ENH (Enigma homolog) is a LIM domain protein that associates with protein kinase C in an isoform-specific manner. We have identified a human cDNA which shares a significant sequence homology with rat ENH. The isolated cDNA clone, designated human ENH (hENH), was 3287 bp in length and encoded a predicted protein of 596 amino acids which had 88% overall identity to rat ENH protein. Northern blot analysis revealed that 1.9 kb of the hENH messenger RNA was predominantly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, while 5.6 kb of the hENH messenger RNA was ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues. The chromosomal location of the gene was determined on chromosome 4q22 region, between markers WI-2900 and WI-3273, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based analyses using both a human/rodent monochromosomal hybrid cell panel and a radiation hybrid mapping panel.

19533785	20090618	Identification of novel FBN1 and TGFBR2 mutations in 65 probands with Marfan syndrome or Marfan-like phenotypes.	Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder, and mutations in the FBN1 and TGFBR2 genes have been identified in probands with MFS and related phenotypes. Using DHPLC and sequencing, we studied the mutation spectrum in 65 probands with Marfan syndrome and related phenotypes. A total of 24 mutations in FBN1 were identified, of which 19 (nine missense, six frameshift, two nonsense and two affecting splice junctions) were novel. In the remaining 41 probands, six were identified to have novel TGFBR2 mutations (one frameshift and five missense mutations). All novel mutations found in this study were confirmed to be absent in 50 unrelated normal individuals of the same ethnic background. In probands who fulfilled the Ghent criteria (n = 16), mutations in FBN1 were found in 81% of cases. None of those with TGFBR2 mutations fulfilled the Ghent criteria. Novel missense mutations of unknown significance were classified according to the latest ACMG guidelines and their likelihood to be causative was evaluated. 	Am._J._Med._Genet._A	D016428 D013485
2904146	19881201	Cloning and nucleotide sequence of human gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase.	We have identified the gene for human gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT; glutamine:D-glutamyl-peptide 5-glutamyltransferase (also called gamma-glutamyltransferase), EC 2.3.2.2] in a BCR gene-related region located in band q11----qter of chromosome 22. Two cDNAs complementary to the GGT mRNA have been isolated from a human placental library constructed in phage lambda gt11. The largest cDNA has a size of 2535 base pairs (bp) and an open reading frame of 1707 nucleotides encoding 569 amino acids. By using a probe corresponding to this cDNA, a mRNA of approximately 2.4 kilobases was detected by RNA blot-hybridization analysis in mouse kidney RNA. The GGT precursor encoded by the coding sequence would have an estimated Mr of 61,400. We compared our nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences with the published results of rat kidney cDNAs. The human and rat amino acid sequences are similar; however, a considerable discrepancy in nucleotide sequence was found within a 180-bp fragment of the heavy chain, resulting in a completely different amino acid sequence for this region. In addition, the 5' untranslated sequence of the human cDNA (669 bp) is substantially larger than that determined in the rat cDNA (227 bp). Our results may be valuable for further studies on the protein structure of human GGT as well as studies on the regulation of the enzyme. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 D013487
11702217	20011110	Identification of ABCC6 pseudogenes on human chromosome 16p: implications for mutation detection in pseudoxanthoma elasticum.	Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), a heritable disorder affecting the skin, eyes, and the cardiovascular system, has recently been linked to mutations in the ABCC6 gene on chromosome 16p13.1. The original mutation detection strategy employed by us consisted of the amplification of each exon of the ABCC6 gene with primer pairs placed on the flanking introns, followed by heteroduplex scanning and direct nucleotide sequencing. However, this approach suggested the presence of multiple copies of the 5'-region of the gene when total genomic DNA was used as a template. In this study, we have identified two pseudogenes containing sequences highly homologous to the 5'-end of ABCC6. First, by the use of allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), two bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones containing a putative pseudogene of ABCC6, designated as ABCC6-psi 1, were isolated from the human BAC library. Sequence analysis of ABCC6-psi 1 revealed it to be a truncated copy of ABCC6, which contains the upstream region and exon 1 through intron 9 of the gene. Secondly, a homology search of a high-throughput sequence database revealed the presence of another truncated copy of ABCC6, which was designated as ABCC6-psi 2, and which was shown to harbor upstream sequences and a segment spanning exon 1 through intron 4 of ABCC6. In addition to several nucleotide differences in the flanking introns and the upstream region, both pseudogenes contain several nucleotide changes in the exonic sequences, including stop codon mutations, which complicate mutation analysis in patients with PXE. Nucleotide differences in flanking introns between these two pseudogenes and ABCC6 allowed us to design allele-specific primers that eliminated the amplification of both pseudogene sequences by PCR and provided reliable amplification of ABCC6-specific sequences only. The use of allele-specific PCR has revealed, thus far, two novel 5'-end PXE mutations, 179del9 and T364R in exons 2 and 9, respectively, and several polymorphisms within the upstream region and exons 1-9 of ABCC6. These strategies facilitate comprehensive analysis of ABCC6 for mutations in PXE. 	Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485 D013487
26355662	20150911	Expanding the clinical, allelic, and locus heterogeneity of retinal dystrophies.	Retinal dystrophies (RD) are heterogeneous hereditary disorders of the retina that are usually progressive in nature. The aim of this study was to clinically and molecularly characterize a large cohort of RD patients. We have developed a next-generation sequencing assay that allows known RD genes to be sequenced simultaneously. We also performed mapping studies and exome sequencing on familial and on syndromic RD patients who tested negative on the panel. Our panel identified the likely causal mutation in &gt;60% of the 292 RD families tested. Mapping studies on all 162 familial RD patients who tested negative on the panel identified two novel disease loci on Chr2:25,550,180-28,794,007 and Chr16:59,225,000-72,511,000. Whole-exome sequencing revealed the likely candidate as AGBL5 and CDH16, respectively. We also performed exome sequencing on negative syndromic RD cases and identified a novel homozygous truncating mutation in GNS in a family with the novel combination of mucopolysaccharidosis and RD. Moreover, we identified a homozygous truncating mutation in DNAJC17 in a family with an apparently novel syndrome of retinitis pigmentosa and hypogammaglobulinemia. Our study expands the clinical and allelic spectrum of known RD genes, and reveals AGBL5, CDH16, and DNAJC17 as novel disease candidates.Genet Med 18 6, 554-562. 	Genet._Med.	D016428 D013485
11748852	20011219	Nine novel mutations in NR0B1 (DAX1) causing adrenal hypoplasia congenita.	X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) is caused by mutations in the NR0B1 gene. This gene encodes an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, DAX1. Ongoing efforts in our laboratory have identified nine novel NR0B1 mutations in X-linked AHC patients (Y81X, 343delG, 457delT, 629delG, L295P, 926-927delTG, 1130delA, 1141-1155del15, and E428X). Two additional families segregate previously identified NR0B1 mutations (501delA and R425T).

10613647	19991229	Poor relationship between phenotypes of protein S deficiency and mutations in the protein S alpha gene.	By single strand conformational polymorphism, nucleotide sequencing and enzyme restriction, we analyzed the protein S alpha gene in 17 protein S-deficient probands and in their available family members. The relationship between genotype and phenotype was also evaluated. Twelve different sequence variations were identified in 17 probands. Ten were putative causal mutations distributed in 16 probands: 4 were nonsense, 5 missense and one a splice site mutation. In most families in which a mutation was identified, more than one phenotype of PS deficiency was present. The same splice site mutation (intron j G-A, exon 10+5) was associated with type I deficiency in one family and with type I/III in another unrelated family. A phenotypic discrepancy was also observed for the Arg474Pro, Gly597Asp and Arg410stop mutations. Glu26Ala, previously reported in kindreds with type I deficiencies, was found in association with I, II and III phenotypes in four unrelated kindreds. Phenotypic analysis of protein S deficiency is poorly related to the underlying genetic defect. 	Thromb._Haemost.	D016428 D013485
12721955	20030502	Mutations of the PAX6 gene detected in patients with a variety of optic-nerve malformations.	The PAX6 gene is involved in ocular morphogenesis and is expressed in the developing central nervous system and numerous ocular tissues during development. PAX6 mutations have been detected in various ocular anomalies, including aniridia, Peters anomaly, corneal dystrophy, congenital cataracts, and foveal hypoplasia. However, it has not been identified in patients with optic-nerve malformations. Here, we identified novel mutations in eight pedigrees with optic-nerve malformations, including coloboma, morning glory disc anomaly, optic-nerve hypoplasia/aplasia, and persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous. A functional assay demonstrated that each mutation decreased the transcriptional activation potential of PAX6 through the paired DNA-binding domain. PAX6 and PAX2 are each thought to downregulate the expression of the other. Four of the detected mutations affected PAX6-mediated transcriptional repression of the PAX2 promoter in a reporter assay. Because PAX2 gene mutations were detected in papillorenal syndrome, alternation of PAX2 function by PAX6 mutations may affect phenotypic manifestations of optic-nerve malformations.

To describe a new mutation of the trabecular meshwork-inducible glucocorticoid response protein (TIGR) gene in a Japanese patient with familial primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Standard ocular examinations were performed on the 44-year-old patient, his sister, and mother. DNA sequencing was used to identify the mutation. We also developed a DNA diagnostic method for detecting this missense mutation by polymerase chain reaction-induced mutation restriction analysis (PCR-IMRA). The patient, father, and sister had been diagnosed as having POAG. The patient and his sister had a Thr448Pro mutation (C--&gt;A transition at the nucleotide number 1419) in exon 3. This mutation has not been reported before.

9012408	19970201	Cloning of the human type XVII collagen gene (COL17A1), and detection of novel mutations in generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa.	Generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa (GABEB) is a nonlethal variant of junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB). Previous findings have suggested that type XVII collagen is the candidate gene for mutations in this disease. We now have cloned the entire human type XVII collagen gene (COL17A1) and have elucidated its intron-exon organization. The gene comprises 56 distinct exons, which span approximately 52 kb of the genome, on the long arm of chromosome 10. It encodes a polypeptide, the alpha1(XVII) chain, consisting of an intracellular globular domain, a transmembrane segment, and an extracellular domain that contains 15 separate collagenous subdomains, the largest consisting of 242 amino acids. We also have developed a strategy to identify mutations in COL17A1 by use of PCR amplification of genomic DNA, using primers placed on the flanking introns. The PCR products are scanned for sequence variants by heteroduplex analysis using conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis and then are subjected to direct automated sequencing. We have identified several intragenic polymorphisms in COL17A1, as well as mutations, in both alleles, in two Finnish families with GABEB. The probands in both families showed negative immunofluorescence staining with an anti-type XVII collagen antibody. In one family, the proband was homozygous for a 5-bp deletion, 2944del5, which resulted in frameshift and a premature termination codon of translation. The proband in the other family was a compound heterozygote, with one allele containing the 2944del5 mutation and the other containing a nonsense mutation, Q1023X. These results expand the mutation database in different variants of JEB, and they attest to the functional importance of type XVII collagen as a transmembrane component of the hemidesmosomes at the dermal/epidermal junction.

10232633	19990508	Biochemical but not clinical vitamin A deficiency results from mutations in the gene for retinol binding protein.	Two German sisters aged 14 and 17 y were admitted to the Tübingen eye hospital with a history of night blindness. In both siblings, plasma retinol binding protein (RBP) concentrations were below the limit of detection (&lt;0.6 micromol/L) and plasma retinol concentrations were extremely low (0.19 micromol/L). Interestingly, intestinal absorption of retinyl esters was normal. In addition, other factors associated with low retinol concentrations (eg, low plasma transthyretin or zinc concentrations or mutations in the transthyretin gene) were not present. Neither sibling had a history of systemic disease. Our aim was to investigate the cause of the retinol deficiency in these 2 siblings. The 2 siblings and their mother were examined clinically, including administration of the relative-dose-response test, DNA sequencing of the RBP gene, and routine laboratory testing. Genomic DNA sequence analysis revealed 2 point mutations in the RBP gene: a T-to-A substitution at nucleotide 1282 of exon 3 and a G-to-A substitution at nucleotide 1549 of exon 4. These mutations resulted in amino acid substitutions of asparagine for isoleucine at position 41 (Ile41--&gt;Asn) and of aspartate for glycine at position 74 (Gly74--&gt;Asp). Sequence analysis of cloned polymerase chain reaction products spanning exons 3 and 4 showed that these mutations were localized on different alleles. The genetic defect induced severe biochemical vitamin A deficiency but only mild clinical symptoms (night blindness and a modest retinal dystrophy without effects on growth). We conclude that the cellular supply of vitamin A to target tissues might be bypassed in these siblings via circulating retinyl esters, beta-carotene, or retinoic acid, thereby maintaining the health of peripheral tissues.

9554754	19980429	A new missense substitution at a mutational hot spot of the androgen receptor in siblings with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.	Several mutations have been described in the human androgen receptor gene including constitutional mutations in androgen insensitivity syndrome, somatic mutations in prostate cancer and triplet expansions in Kennedy's disease (Gottlieb et al. 1997). Here we report on two siblings with complete androgen insensitivity and a novel missense mutation, D695V, in their androgen receptor gene. The two XY females are siblings of German descent and presented at the ages of 23 and 19 years, respectively, with typical clinical features of complete androgen insensitivity. We found both siblings to be hemizygous for a new adenine to thymine transversion at the second nucleotide of codon 695 within the fourth exon of the human androgen receptor gene. The resulting missense mutation D695V is located at the amino-terminal border of the ligand-binding domain of the androgen receptor. The aspartic acid residue at this position is highly conserved in the steroid binding domains of other members of the nuclear receptor family and has already been found to be the site of two other missense mutations associated with androgen insensitivity syndrome (Ris Stalpers et al. 1991, Hiort et al. 1996). Three of four reported subjects showed the complete androgen insensitivity phenotype, in accordance with the two siblings in our study. We suggest that the existence of three pathological amino acid substitutions for aspartic acid 695 most likely reflects the essential role of this residue for normal androgen receptor function in male sexual differentiation.

11858487	20020223	Non-inversion factor VIII mutations in 80 hemophilia A families including 24 with alloimmune responses.	Heteroduplex screening identified 74 small mutations in the factor VIII genes of 72 families with hemophilia A. In addition, patients from 3 families with high titer inhibitors had partial gene deletions and 5 unrelated families that were negative for heteroduplex formation had a mutation on direct sequencing. The latter had mild hemophilia A with an inhibitor, and sequencing their exon 23 fragments found a transition predicting a recurrent Arg2150 to His. Of 69 distinct mutations (including the 3 partial gene deletions), 47 are novel. Of small mutations, 51 were missense (one possibly a normal variant and two that could also alter splicing) at 39 sites, 13 were small deletions or insertions (3 inframe and one a normal variant in an intron), 13 were nonsense at 12 sites and 2 altered intron splice junctions. In 24 families, at least one affected member had evidence for an alloimmune response to factor VIII: of these, 11 were associated with missense mutations. In 14 families, de novo origin was demonstrated. 	Thromb._Haemost.	D016428 D013485
17435248	20070417	The genetic architecture of shoot branching in Arabidopsis thaliana: a comparative assessment of candidate gene associations vs. quantitative trait locus mapping.	Association mapping focused on 36 genes involved in branch development was used to identify candidate genes for variation in shoot branching in Arabidopsis thaliana. The associations between four branching traits and moderate-frequency haplogroups at the studied genes were tested in a panel of 96 accessions from a restricted geographic range in Central Europe. Using a mixed-model association-mapping method, we identified three loci--MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 2 (MAX2), MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 3 (MAX3), and SUPERSHOOT 1 (SPS1)--that were significantly associated with branching variation. On the basis of a more extensive examination of the MAX2 and MAX3 genomic regions, we find that linkage disequilibrium in these regions decays within approximately 10 kb and trait associations localize to the candidate genes in these regions. When the significant associations are compared to relevant quantitative trait loci (QTL) from previous Ler x Col and Cvi x Ler recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping studies, no additive QTL overlapping these candidate genes are observed, although epistatic QTL for branching, including one that spans the SPS1, are found. These results suggest that epistasis is prevalent in determining branching variation in A. thaliana and may need to be considered in linkage disequilibrium mapping studies of genetically diverse accessions.

11326279	20010428	The gene defective in leukocyte adhesion deficiency II encodes a putative GDP-fucose transporter.	Leukocyte adhesion deficiency II (LAD II) is characterized by the lack of fucosylated glycoconjugates, including selectin ligands, causing immunodeficiency and severe mental and growth retardation. No deficiency in fucosyltransferase activities or in the activities of enzymes involved in GDP-fucose biosynthesis has been found. Instead, the transport of GDP-fucose into isolated Golgi vesicles of LAD II cells appeared to be reduced. To identify the gene mutated in LAD II, we cloned 12 cDNAs from Caenorhabditis elegans, encoding multi-spanning transmembrane proteins with homology to known nucleotide sugar transporters, and transfected them into fibroblasts from an LAD II patient. One of these clones re-established expression of fucosylated glycoconjugates with high efficiency and allowed us to identify a human homolog with 55% identity, which also directed re-expression of fucosylated glycoconjugates. Both proteins were localized to the Golgi. The corresponding endogenous protein in LAD II cells had an R147C amino acid change in the conserved fourth transmembrane region. Overexpression of this mutant protein in cells from a patient with LAD II did not rescue fucosylation, demonstrating that the point mutation affected the activity of the protein. Thus, we have identified the first putative GDP-fucose transporter, which has been highly conserved throughout evolution. A point mutation in its gene is responsible for the disease in this patient with LAD II. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D013485
12009425	20020516	Novel ABCA1 compound variant associated with HDL cholesterol deficiency.	The recent discovery of an ATP-binding cassette transporter, ABCA1, as an important regulator of high density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport has facilitated the identification of novel variants associated with HDL cholesterol deficiency states. We identified a subject with HDL cholesterol deficiency (4 mg/dl) who developed and died of complications related to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The proband had a compound heterozygous mutation. One mutation was a G3295T substitution with conversion of asparagine to tyrosine (D1099Y) in ABCA1. The single-base substitution at codon 1099 resulted in the abolition of an RsaI cleavage site. The proband and affected individuals having another mutation were heterozygotes for T5966C with phenylalanine converted to serine (F2009S). The presence of the T5966C mutation was detected by restriction digestion with HinfI. These variants were not identified in over 400 chromosomes of healthy subjects. In the kindred, family members heterozygous for the ABCA1 variant exhibited low levels of HDL cholesterol. Direct sequencing of all coding regions and splice site junctions of other HDL candidate genes revealed no additional mutations, indicating that combined defective ABCA1 alleles may result in familial HDL deficiency.

3004571	19851231	Nucleotide sequence of cloned cDNA for human pancreatic kallikrein.	Cloned cDNA sequences for human pancreatic kallikrein have been isolated and determined by molecular cloning and sequence analysis. The identity between human pancreatic and urinary kallikreins is indicated by the complete coincidence between the amino acid sequence deduced from the cloned cDNA sequence and that reported partially for urinary kallikrein. The active enzyme form of the human pancreatic kallikrein consists of 238 amino acids and is preceded by a signal peptide and a profragment of 24 amino acids. A sequence comparison of this with other mammalian kallikreins indicates that key amino acid residues required for both serine protease activity and kallikrein-like cleavage specificity are retained in the human sequence, and residues corresponding to some external loops of the kallikrein diverge from other kallikreins. Analyses by RNA blot hybridization, primer extension, and S1 nuclease mapping indicate that the pancreatic kallikrein mRNA is also expressed in the kidney and sublingual gland, suggesting the active synthesis of urinary kallikrein in these tissues. Furthermore, the tissue-specific regulation of the expression of the members of the human kallikrein gene family has been discussed. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485
11875050	20020305	Mutations in the inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 gene (IMPDH1) cause the RP10 form of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.	Autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) is a heterogeneous set of progressive retinopathies caused by several distinct genes. One locus, the RP10 form of adRP, maps to human chromosome 7q31.1 and may account for 5-10% of adRP cases among Americans and Europeans. We identified two American families with the RP10 form of adRP by linkage mapping and used these families to reduce the linkage interval to 3.45 Mb between the flanking markers D7S686 and RP-STR8. Sequence and transcript analysis identified 54 independent genes within this region, at least 10 of which are retinal-expressed and thus candidates for the RP10 gene. A screen of retinal transcripts comparing retinas from normal mice to retinas from crx-/crx- knockout mice (with poorly differentiated photoreceptors) demonstrated a 6-fold reduction in one candidate, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 (IMPDH1; EC 1.1.1.205). Since many of the genes known to cause retinitis pigmentosa are under CRX control in photoreceptors, IMPDH1 became a high-priority candidate for mutation screening. DNA sequencing of affected individuals from the two American RP10 families revealed a GAC--&gt;AAC transition in codon 226 substituting an asparagine for an aspartic acid in both families. The identical mutation was also found in a British RP10 family. The Asp226Asn missense mutation is present in all affected individuals tested and absent from unaffected controls. The aspartic acid at codon 226 is conserved in all IMPDH genes, in all species examined, including bacteria, suggesting that this mutation is highly deleterious. Subsequent screening of probands from 60 other adRP families revealed an additional family with this mutation, confirming its association with retinitis pigmentosa and the relatively high frequency of this mutation. Another IMPDH1 substitution, Val268Ile, was also observed in this cohort of patients but not in controls. IMPDH1 is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme, functioning as a homotetramer, which catalyzed the rate-limiting step in de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides. As such, it plays an important role in cyclic nucleoside metabolism within photoreceptors. Several classes of drugs are known to affect IMPDH isoenzymes, including nucleotide and NAD analogs, suggesting that small-molecule therapy may be available, one day, for RP10 patients.

11748489	20011219	A new mutation of the arginine vasopressin-neurophysin II gene in a family with autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus.	Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI) is an autosomally dominant inherited disorder with a typical onset at one to six years of age. The genetic locus of FNDI is the arginine vasopressin-neurophysin II (AVP-NPII) gene. The gene encoding the precursor hormone (prepro-AVP-neurophysin II) is located in the chromosomal region 20p13 and contains three exons. Mutations that cause FNDI have been found to occur within the signal peptide of the prepro-AVP-neurophysin II precursor, within the coding sequence for neurophysin II and the vasopressin-coding sequence. A family (four members with FNDI, two without FNDI) in three consecutive generations was investigated. Index case was a now 22-year old man with a history of severe polyuria (18 L/day) and polydipsia first recognized at about 4-5 months of age. The arginine vasopressin-neurophysin II gene was investigated by direct sequencing of PCR products amplified from each exon. Subsequently, a restriction analysis was performed to verify the sequencing results. The affected individuals were found to have a missense mutation in exon 2 at nucleotide position 1887 (G to C) of the AVP-NPII gene. Using both restriction enzyme digestion and sequence analysis, the mutation was found in all affected family members, but not in the unaffected members studied. This mutation (1887 G to C) represents a novel mutation of the AVP-NPII gene. 	Exp._Clin._Endocrinol._Diabetes	D002363 D016428
20022194	20091222	Mutations in alpha-actinin-2 cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a genome-wide analysis.	This study describes a genome-wide linkage analysis of a large family with clinically heterogeneous hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Familial HCM is a disorder characterized by genetic heterogeneity. In as many as 50% of HCM cases, the genetic cause remains unknown, suggesting that other genes may be involved. Clinical evaluation, including clinical history, physical examination, electrocardiography, and 2-dimensional echocardiography, was performed, and blood was collected from family members (n = 23) for deoxyribonucleic acid analysis. The family was genotyped with markers from the 10-cM AB PRISM Human Linkage mapping set (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California), and 2-point linkage analysis was performed. Affected family members showed marked clinical diversity, ranging from asymptomatic individuals to those with syncope, heart failure, and premature sudden death. The disease locus for this family was mapped to chromosome 1q42.2-q43, near the marker D1S2850 (logarithm of odds ratio = 2.82, theta = 0). A missense mutation, Ala119Thr, in the alpha-actinin-2 (ACTN2) gene was identified that segregated with disease in the family. An additional 297 HCM probands were screened for mutations in the ACTN2 gene using high-resolution melt analysis. Three causative ACTN2 mutations, Thr495Met, Glu583Ala, and Glu628Gly, were identified in an additional 4 families (total 1.7%) with HCM. This is the first genome-wide linkage analysis that shows mutations in ACTN2 cause HCM. Mutations in genes encoding Z-disk proteins account for a small but significant proportion of genotyped HCM families. 	J._Am._Coll._Cardiol.	D016428 D013485
4063071	19850801	The primary structure of hemoglobins from the domestic cat (Felis catus, Felidae).	The complete primary structure of the two hemoglobin components of the domestic cat (Felis catus) is presented. The major component (A) accounts for 60-70% whereas the minor component (B) constitutes 30-40% of the total hemoglobin. Separation of the polypeptides was carried out in buffers containing 8M urea on CM-Cellulose. The sequence was studied by Edman degradation of tryptic and cyanogen bromide cleavage products in a liquid phase sequencer. The sequence is compared for homology with human hemoglobin. The beta-chain of the minor components (beta B) has a blocked N-terminal residue identified as acetylserine whereas that of the major component (beta A) is free glycine. The two hemoglobins have identical alpha-chains and differ with respect to their beta-chains at the following positions (beta B/beta A): beta NA1 Ac-Ser/Gly, beta A1 Ser/Thr, beta H17 Ser/Asn and beta HC1 Arg/Lys. The structural and functional aspects of these exchanges are discussed. 	Biol._Chem._Hoppe-Seyler	D016428 D013485
26220823	20150730	Matching two independent cohorts validates DPH1 as a gene responsible for autosomal recessive intellectual disability with short stature, craniofacial, and ectodermal anomalies.	Recently, Alazami et al. (2015) identified 33 putative candidate disease genes for neurogenetic disorders. One such gene was DPH1, in which a homozygous missense mutation was associated with a 3C syndrome-like phenotype in four patients from a single extended family. Here, we report a second homozygous missense variant in DPH1, seen in four members of a founder population, and associated with a phenotype initially reminiscent of Sensenbrenner syndrome. This postpublication &quot;match&quot; validates DPH1 as a gene underlying syndromic intellectual disability with short stature and craniofacial and ectodermal anomalies, reminiscent of, but distinct from, 3C and Sensenbrenner syndromes. This validation took several years after the independent discoveries due to the absence of effective methods for sharing both candidate phenotype and genotype data between investigators. Sharing of data via Web-based anonymous data exchange servers will play an increasingly important role toward more efficient identification of the molecular basis for rare Mendelian disorders.

9374458	19971231	IRAK (Pelle) family member IRAK-2 and MyD88 as proximal mediators of IL-1 signaling.	The interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling pathway leads to nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation in mammals and is similar to the Toll pathway in Drosophila: the IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK) is homologous to Pelle. Two additional proximal mediators were identified that are required for IL-1R-induced NF-kappaB activation: IRAK-2, a Pelle family member, and MyD88, a death domain-containing adapter molecule. Both associate with the IL-1R signaling complex. Dominant negative forms of either attenuate IL-1R-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Therefore, IRAK-2 and MyD88 may provide additional therapeutic targets for inhibiting IL-1-induced inflammation. 	Science	D016428
12819961	20030624	Cloning, expression, and mutation analysis of NOR1, a novel human gene down-regulated in HNE1 nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line.	To investigate cloning, expression, and mutation analysis of the putative candidate tumor suppressor gene related with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We studied the expression profiles in the NPC cell line HNE(1) with the normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cell as control by using cDNA array representing 11,000 cDNA clusters. EST W95442 was found down-regulated in HNE(1). Subsequently, the corresponding gene sequence including this EST was established by cDNA cloning and the RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA end) procedure. The expression pattern of this gene was examined by using Northern blot analysis in various human tissues. Furthermore, we screened the mutations of the coding sequence of the gene using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphisms (RT-PCR-SSCP) as well as direct sequencing analysis. A novel gene (GenBank accession No. AF462348) was cloned and named NOR(1) standing for oxidored-nitro domain-containing protein 1 (Human Gene Nomenclature Committee-approved symbol). Northern blot analysis revealed that the NOR(1) gene had two transcripts (1.2 kb, 1.6 kb), and expressed ubiquitously in human tissues. Moreover, a Glu58Gly mutation in the exon 1 of NOR(1) was detected in two of 25 NPC biopsies. We cloned a novel gene NOR(1), and the Glu58Gly polymorphism of NOR(1) may be involved in the development and/or progression of NPC suggesting that NOR(1) could be a candidate tumor repressor gene related with NPC.

8620346	19960201	Two novel molecular defects in the LCAT gene are associated with fish eye disease.	A 53-year-old man with a severely reduced HDL cholesterol level, dense corneal opacities, normal renal function, and premature coronary artery disease was investigated together with 16 members of his family. The proband was diagnosed with fish eye disease. As in previously reported patients with fish eye disease, the endogenous plasma cholesterol esterification rate was near normal, yet lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity was almost absent when measured with exogenous HDL analogues used as substrate. Direct sequencing of the LCAT gene revealed two novel missense mutations in exon 1 and exon 4, resulting in the substitution of Pro10 with Gln (P10Q) and Arg135 with Gln (R135Q), respectively. Both missense mutations were located on different alleles. Genetic analysis by polymerase chain reaction revealed 4 carriers of the P10Q and 3 carriers of the R135Q defect. Functional assessment of both missense mutations revealed that when exogenous HDL analogues were used as substrate, the specific activity of rLCAT p10Q was 18% of wild type (WT); however, when LDL was used as substrate, the activity was 146% of WT. By contrast, rLCATR135Q was inactive against both substrates. Thus, we conclude that the LCATR135D mutation is causative for complete LCAT deficiency and that the clinical phenotype of fish eye disease seen in this patient is due to the Pro10 mutation. The presence of premature coronary artery disease in the absence of other risk factors in this new case of fish eye disease raises questions regarding the risk of atherosclerosis, which has previously been reported to be nonexistent.

11153919	20010112	The human dynein intermediate chain 2 gene (DNAI2): cloning, mapping, expression pattern, and evaluation as a candidate for primary ciliary dyskinesia.	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by chronic sinusitis and bronchiectasis, and usually associated with hypofertility. Half of the patients present a situs inversus, defining the Kartagener's syndrome. This phenotype results from axonemal abnormalities of respiratory cilia and sperm flagella, i.e., mainly an absence of dynein arms. Recently, a candidate-gene approach, based on documented abnormalities of immotile strains of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, allowed us to identify the first gene involved in PCD. Following the same strategy, we have characterized DNAI2, a human gene related to Chlamzydomonas IC69, and evaluated its possible involvement in a PCD population characterized by an absence of outer dynein arms. DNAI2, which is composed of 14 exons located at 17q25, is highly expressed in trachea and testis. No mutation was found in the DNAI2 coding sequence of the twelve patients investigated. However, ten intragenic polymorphic sites and an EcoRI RFLP have been identified, allowing the exclusion of DNAI2 in three consanguineous families. 	Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
11161814	20010213	Cloning and characterization of three novel genes, ALS2CR1, ALS2CR2, and ALS2CR3, in the juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS2) critical region at chromosome 2q33-q34: candidate genes for ALS2.	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that manifests as selective upper and lower motor neuron degeneration. The autosomal recessive form of juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS2) has previously been mapped to the 1.7-cM interval flanked by D2S116 and D2S2237 on human chromosome 2q33-q34. We identified three novel full-length transcripts encoded by three distinct genes (HGMW-approved symbols ALS2CR1, ALS2CR2, and ALS2CR3) within the ALS2 critical region. The intron-exon organizations of these genes as well as those of CFLAR, CASP10, and CASP8, which were previously mapped to this region, were defined. These genes were evaluated for mutations in ALS2 patients, and no disease-associated sequence alterations in either exons or intron-exon boundaries were observed. Sequence analysis of overlapping RT-PCR products covering the whole coding sequence for each transcript revealed no aberrant mRNA sequences. These data strongly indicate that ALS2CR1, ALS2CR2, ALS2CR3, CFLAR, CASP10, and CASP8 are not causative genes for ALS2. 	Genomics	D016428 D013485
2847925	19881101	cDNA cloning and functional expression in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae of beta-naphthoflavone-induced rabbit liver P-450 LM4 and LM6.	A cDNA library was constructed from liver mRNA of a beta-naphthoflavone-induced rabbit. Two clones pLM4-1 and pLM6-1 containing 2.2-kbp inserts that hybridized at low stringincy with a mouse P1 P-450 probe were selected. The clone pLM4-1 was fully sequenced and found to contain a full-length cDNA coding for cytochrome P-450 LM4. Partial sequence and restriction mapping made it possible to identify pLM6-1 as coding for the major part of cytochrome P-450 LM6. Cloned LM4-1 cDNA was reformed by deletion of the 5' and 3' non-coding regions before insertion into yeast expression vectors PYe DP1/10. A similar operation was performed on pLM6-1 cDNA after replacement of the missing N-terminus-coding sequences by homologous sequences form the pLM4-1 clone resulting in a chimeric cytochrome P-450 coding sequence. Expression of cloned rabbit cytochrome P-450 into transformed yeast was optimized by studying the effect of the nature of the DNA sequence just preceding the initiation codon on the level of cytochrome P-450 production. Yeast synthesized cytochromes P-450 were characterized by immunoblotting, spectra and catalytic activity determinations. Cloned cytochrome P-450 LM4 was found by all criteria to be identical to the authentic rabbit one. The chimeric cytochrome P-450 that contains the 143 N-terminal amino acids of cytochrome P-450 LM4 and the remaining 375 amino acids of cytochrome P-450 LM6 was found to exhibit most of the authentic cytochrome P-450 LM6 catalytic properties. Enzymatic and evolutionary implications of these results are discussed. 	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 D013485
11854508	20020221	Discovery of five conserved beta -defensin gene clusters using a computational search strategy.	The innate immune system includes antimicrobial peptides that protect multicellular organisms from a diverse spectrum of microorganisms. beta-Defensins comprise one important family of mammalian antimicrobial peptides. The annotation of the human genome fails to reveal the expected diversity, and a recent query of the draft sequence with the blast search engine found only one new beta-defensin gene (DEFB3). To define better the beta-defensin gene family, we adopted a genomics approach that uses hmmer, a computational search tool based on hidden Markov models, in combination with blast. This strategy identified 28 new human and 43 new mouse beta-defensin genes in five syntenic chromosomal regions. Within each syntenic cluster, the gene sequences and organization were similar, suggesting each cluster pair arose from a common ancestor and was retained because of conserved functions. Preliminary analysis indicates that at least 26 of the predicted genes are transcribed. These results demonstrate the value of a genomewide search strategy to identify genes with conserved structural motifs. Discovery of these genes represents a new starting point for exploring the role of beta-defensins in innate immunity. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 D013485 D013487
12446846	20021126	NOSTRIN: a protein modulating nitric oxide release and subcellular distribution of endothelial nitric oxide synthase.	Activity and localization of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is regulated in a remarkably complex fashion, yet the complex molecular machinery mastering stimulus-induced eNOS translocation and trafficking is poorly understood. In a search by the yeast two-hybrid system using the eNOS oxygenase domain as bait, we have identified a previously uncharacterized eNOS-interacting protein, dubbed NOSTRIN (for eNOS traffic inducer). NOSTRIN contains a single polypeptide chain of 506-aa residues of 58 kDa with an N-terminal cdc15 domain and a C-terminal SH3 domain. NOSTRIN mRNA is abundant in highly vascularized tissues such as placenta, kidney, lung, and heart, and NOSTRIN protein is expressed in vascular endothelial cells. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the eNOS-NOSTRIN interaction in vitro and in vivo, and NOSTRIN's SH3 domain was essential and sufficient for eNOS binding. NOSTRIN colocalized extensively with eNOS at the plasma membrane of confluent human umbilical venous endothelial cells and in punctate cytosolic structures of CHO-eNOS cells. NOSTRIN overexpression induced a profound redistribution of eNOS from the plasma membrane to vesicle-like structures matching the NOSTRIN pattern and at the same time led to a significant inhibition of NO release. We conclude that NOSTRIN contributes to the intricate protein network controlling activity, trafficking, and targeting of eNOS. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 D013485
7683951	19930101	A missense mutation in the proteolipid protein gene responsible for Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease in a Japanese family.	We investigated the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene of two boys in a Japanese family with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD), an X-linked neurologic disorder characterized by dysmyelination in the central nervous system (CNS). The patients showed similar clinical signs from birth and autopsy on the elder brother confirmed a connatal type of PMD. Direct sequencing of the PLP gene and PLP mRNAs from the brain of the PMD patient revealed a G to T transition in exon V of the PLP gene, which leads to a glycine to cysteine substitution at residue 220. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization revealed that this mutation was also present in his brother, but was absent in 100 X chromosomes of normal Japanese individuals. Northern blot analysis showed that the mRNA levels of PLP and myelin basic protein, two major myelin proteins produced by oligodendrocytes, were much reduced in the PMD brain, hence, there was a specific loss of oligodendrocytes. It seems likely that the substitution is responsible for PMD (connatal type) in this particular family and causes oligodendrocytes death in the CNS. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D002363 D016428
10523339	19991016	Mutants of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-HSD2) with partial activity: improved correlations between genotype and biochemical phenotype in apparent mineralocorticoid excess.	Mutations in the kidney isozyme of human 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-HSD2) cause apparent mineralocorticoid excess, an autosomal recessive form of familial hypertension. We studied 4 patients with AME, identifying 4 novel and 3 previously reported mutations in the HSD11B2 (HSD11K) gene. Point mutations causing amino acid substitutions were introduced into a pCMV5/11HSD2 expression construct and expressed in mammalian CHOP cells. Mutations L179R and R208H abolished activity in whole cells. Mutants S180F, A237V, and A328V had 19%, 72%, and 25%, respectively, of the activity of the wild-type enzyme in whole cells when cortisol was used as the substrate and 80%, 140%, and 55%, respectively, of wild-type activity when corticosterone was used as the substrate. However, these mutant proteins were only 0.6% to 5.7% as active as the wild-type enzyme in cell lysates, suggesting that these mutations alter stability of the enzyme. In regression analyses of all AME patients with published genotypes, several biochemical and clinical parameters were highly correlated with mutant enzymatic activity, demonstrated in whole cells, when cortisol was used as the substrate. These included the ratio of urinary cortisone to cortisol metabolites (R(2)=0.648, P&lt;0.0001), age at presentation (R(2)=0.614, P&lt;0.0001), and birth weight (R(2)=0.576, P=0.0004). Approximately 5% conversion of cortisol to cortisone is predicted in subjects with mutations that completely inactivate HSD11B2, suggesting that a low level of enzymatic activity is mediated by another enzyme, possibly 11-HSD1.

8317503	19930701	Tandem duplication within a neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene exon in a family with features of Watson syndrome and Noonan syndrome.	Type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1), Watson syndrome (WS), and Noonan syndrome (NS) show some overlap in clinical manifestations. In addition, WS has been shown to be linked to markers flanking the NF1 locus and a deletion at the NF1 locus demonstrated in a WS patient. This suggests either that WS and NF1 are allelic or that phenotypes arise from mutations in very closely linked genes. Here we provide evidence for the former by demonstrating a mutation in the NF1 gene in a family with features of both WS and NS. The mutation is an almost perfect in-frame tandem duplication of 42 bases in exon 28 of the NF1 gene. Unlike the mutations previously described in classical NF1, which show a preponderance of null alleles, the mutation in this family would be expected to result in a mutant neurofibromin product.

In approximately 50% of patients, mutations have been described in the genes encoding the complement regulators factor H, MCP, and factor I or the activator factor B. We report here mutations in the central component of the complement cascade, C3, in association with aHUS. We describe 9 novel C3 mutations in 14 aHUS patients with a persistently low serum C3 level. We have demonstrated that 5 of these mutations are gain-of-function and 2 are inactivating. This establishes C3 as a susceptibility factor for aHUS. 	Blood	D016428 D052061 D013485
11443223	20010710	A novel melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene mutation associated with morbid obesity.	Mutations in the melanocortin 4 receptor gene (MC4R) are the most common cause of monogenic human obesity. As part of our ongoing project entitled 'Turkish Obesity Genome Study' we determined the nucleotide sequence of the entire coding region of the MC4R gene in 40 morbidly obese subjects from independent families. Here we report a novel heterozygous mutation (N274S) in an adult female obese individual (age: 52 yrs, BMI 41.7 kg/m(2), height 158 cm, weight: 104 Kg). The sister of the index case (age: 55 yrs, height: 160 cm, weight: 110 Kg, BMI: 43 kg/m(2)) also carries the same mutation. Although both sisters were morbidly obese and hypertensive the index case had normal plasma insulin and fasting blood glucose levels whereas her sister had type 2 diabetes mellitus. No abnormalities of the reproductive function were present. Despite marked hyperphagia in childhood both sisters had a history of relatively diminished intensity of appetite after the age of 20. Of notice, index case was diagnosed to have cyclothymia whereas her sister was being treated for bipolar affective disorder. Detailed clinical evaluation revealed normal bone mineral density and serum calcium parameters as well as intact thyroid axis and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in both patients. The human MC4-R deficient phenotype resembles the murine deficient state with regard to preserved reproductive function although hyperphagia, increased linear growth and absence of diabetes in mice are not observed in humans. Affected individuals have hyperphagia in childhood, which looses intensity later in life, and they also present with normal height and diabetes mellitus. Accumulating evidence indicate that melanocortin endocrine system or defective melanocortin signaling has inherently different characteristics in mice and humans resembling the variation observed with regard to leptin deficiency in both species.

26371980	20150916	A novel AMT gene mutation in a newborn with nonketotic hyperglycinemia and early myoclonic encephalopathy.	Early myoclonic encephalopathy (EME) presents in neonatal period with erratic or fragmentary myoclonus and a burst-suppression electroencephalography (EEG) pattern. Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) is the most common metabolic cause of EME and genetic testing confirms the diagnosis of NKH in around 75% of the patients with a clinical diagnosis of NKH. Three genes are known to cause NKH. Here we describe a case of EME caused by NKH in which a new mutation in aminomethyltransferase (AMT) gene has been detected. 	Eur._J._Paediatr._Neurol.

12453919	20021128	PPARG F388L, a transactivation-deficient mutant, in familial partial lipodystrophy.	Autosomal dominant familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD) due to mutant LMNA encoding nuclear lamin A/C is characterized by adipose tissue repartitioning together with multiple metabolic disturbances, including insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. There is emerging evidence that some rare mutations in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), encoded by PPARG, might be associated with human lipodystrophy. We report a three-generation Canadian kindred ascertained based upon partial lipodystrophy, with a normal LMNA gene sequence. Candidate gene sequencing showed that all four affected subjects were heterozygous for a novel T--&gt;A mutation at PPARG nucleotide 1164 in exon 5 that predicted substitution of phenylalanine at codon 388 by leucine (F388L). The mutation was absent from normal family members and normal unrelated subjects, and altered a highly conserved residue within helix 8 of the predicted ligand-binding pocket of PPAR-gamma. The mutant receptor had significantly decreased basal transcriptional activity and impaired stimulation by a synthetic ligand. The germline transmission of a transactivation-deficient mutation in PPARG suggests that autosomal dominant partial lipodystrophy is genetically heterogeneous. Our findings are consistent with the idea that mutant PPARG can underlie the partial lipodystrophy phenotype. 	Diabetes	D002363 D016428 D013485
14647275	20031203	Mutations in HFE2 cause iron overload in chromosome 1q-linked juvenile hemochromatosis.	Juvenile hemochromatosis is an early-onset autosomal recessive disorder of iron overload resulting in cardiomyopathy, diabetes and hypogonadism that presents in the teens and early 20s (refs. 1,2). Juvenile hemochromatosis has previously been linked to the centromeric region of chromosome 1q (refs. 3-6), a region that is incomplete in the human genome assembly. Here we report the positional cloning of the locus associated with juvenile hemochromatosis and the identification of a new gene crucial to iron metabolism. We finely mapped the recombinant interval in families of Greek descent and identified multiple deleterious mutations in a transcription unit of previously unknown function (LOC148738), now called HFE2, whose protein product we call hemojuvelin. Analysis of Greek, Canadian and French families indicated that one mutation, the amino acid substitution G320V, was observed in all three populations and accounted for two-thirds of the mutations found. HFE2 transcript expression was restricted to liver, heart and skeletal muscle, similar to that of hepcidin, a key protein implicated in iron metabolism. Urinary hepcidin levels were depressed in individuals with juvenile hemochromatosis, suggesting that hemojuvelin is probably not the hepcidin receptor. Rather, HFE2 seems to modulate hepcidin expression. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D013485
9714779	19980826	Isolation and characterization of cDNAs encoding PDE5A, a human cGMP-binding, cGMP-specific 3',5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase.	Human cGMP-binding, cGMP-specific 3',5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE5A) cDNAs were isolated. A 3.1-kb composite DNA sequence assembled from overlapping cDNAs encodes an 875-amino-acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 100012 Da (PDE5A1). Extracts prepared from yeast expressing human PDE5A1 hydrolyzed cGMP. This activity was inhibited by the selective PDE5 inhibitors zaprinast and DMPPO. PDE5A mRNA is expressed in aortic smooth muscle cells, heart, placenta, skeletal muscle and pancreas and, to a much lesser extent, in brain, liver and lung. A 5'-splice variant, PDE5A2, encodes an 833-amino-acid protein with eight unique amino acids at the amino terminus. PDE5A maps to chromosome 4q 25-27. 	Gene	D003160 D016428 D013487
16899492	20060811	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel human beta1,3-glucosyltransferase, which is localized at the endoplasmic reticulum and glucosylates O-linked fucosylglycan on thrombospondin type 1 repeat domain.	Protein O-linked fucosylation is an unusual glycosylation associated with many important biological functions such as Notch signaling. Two fucosylation pathways synthesizing O-fucosylglycans have been reported on cystein-knotted proteins, that is, on epidermal growth factor-like (EGF-like) domains and on thrombospondin Type 1 repeat (TSR) domains. We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel beta1,3-glucosyltransferase (beta3Glc-T) that synthesizes a Glcbeta1,3Fucalpha- structure on the TSR domain. We found a novel glycosyltransferase gene with beta1,3-glycosyltransferase (beta3GT) motifs in databases. The recombinant enzyme expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells exhibited glucosyltransferase activity toward fucose-alpha-para-nitrophenyl (Fucalpha-pNp). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis revealed that the product of the recombinant enzyme migrated to the same position as did the product of endogenous beta3Glc-T of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The two products could be digested by beta-glucosidase from almond and by exo-1,3-beta-glucanase from Trichoderma sp. These results strongly suggested that the product has the structure of Glcbeta1-3Fuc. Therefore, we named this novel enzyme beta3Glc-T. Immunostaining revealed that FLAG-tagged beta3Glc-T is an enzyme residing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via retention signal, &quot;REEL,&quot; which is a KDEL-like sequence, at the C-terminus. The TSR domain expressed in Escherichia coli was first fucosylated by the recombinant protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2), after which it became an acceptor substrate for the recombinant beta3Glc-T, which could apparently transfer Glc to the fucosylated TSR domain. Our results suggest that a novel glycosyltransferase, beta3Glc-T, contributes to the elongation of O-fucosylglycan and that this occurs specifically on TSR domains. 	Glycobiology	D016428 D013485
14630615	20031125	Investigation of the possible role of a novel gene, DPCD, in primary ciliary dyskinesia.	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations that affect the proper function of cilia. Recently, deletion of DNA polymerase lambda (Poll) in mice produced a phenotype characteristic of PCD (Kobayashi et al., 2002, Mol. Cell. Biol. 22:2769-2776). Because it is unclear how a mutation in a DNA polymerase would result in a specific defect in axonemes, the targeting construct was examined further. Analysis of the genomic region surrounding the Poll gene revealed an uncharacterized gene, named Dpcd, that is predicted to be transcribed from the opposite strand relative to Poll. The deletion of Poll would also remove the first exon of Dpcd. Because it is possible that the PCD phenotype observed is due to the absence of either gene, the expression of these genes during ciliogenesis of human airway epithelial cells was examined. Northern analysis demonstrated that DPCD expression increases during ciliated cell differentiation; the expression of POLL decreases. To examine directly whether DPCD is mutated in cases of human PCD, the complete coding sequence of DPCD was sequenced from 51 unrelated PCD patients. No disease-causing mutations were confirmed; however, one variant could not be excluded. Therefore, DPCD remains a novel candidate gene for PCD. 	Am._J._Respir._Cell_Mol._Biol.

8037761	19940715	Cloning and analysis of MAGE-1-related genes.	The spectrum of MAGE gene expression in the human melanoma cell line DM150 was examined using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and cDNA cloning. We have isolated five full-length cDNAs from DM150 which were identified as MAGE-1, MAGE-3, MAGE-12 and two previously undescribed MAGE genes, MAGE-3b and MAGE-X2. DNA sequence analysis of the coding regions of the MAGE-3b and MAGE-X2 genes revealed 83% and 88% identity with MAGE-1, while MAGE-3b was 98% homologous with the full length MAGE-3 clone. The predicted amino acid sequences of MAGE-X2 and MAGE-3b contain consensus HLA-A1 peptide binding motifs, suggesting that, like MAGE-1, they may code for tumor-associated antigens. In addition, a nonamer peptide encoded by both the MAGE-3 and MAGE-12 genes was shown by direct binding studies to contain an aggretope for HLA-A2. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.	D003160 D016428
12953260	20030904	The role of pathogenic DJ-1 mutations in Parkinson's disease.	Mutations in DJ-1 (PARK7) have been reported in two consanguineous families with young-onset Parkinson's disease (YOPD). This study aims to confirm the presence of pathogenic DJ-1 mutations and determine their contribution in young-onset and more typical later onset Parkinson's disease (PD). The entire open reading frame of the DJ-1 gene was screened by direct sequencing in 185 unrelated YOPD patients and a separate cohort of 190 pathologically proven cases of PD. Ethnically matched controls were screened for all mutations identified. We report a low frequency of pathogenic DJ-1 mutations in our cohort of patients. One homozygous missense mutation and one heterozygous mutation were found in two YOPD samples. In addition, several variants were found in the coding sequence of the gene, which are likely to represent polymorphisms. In one case, the polymorphism was population specific. The reported 14Kbp deletion was not found in any of our samples or controls. We confirm the presence of pathogenic DJ-1 mutations in YOPD and estimate their frequency at approximately 1%. No mutations were found in our cohort of later onset sporadic pathologically confirmed cases, suggesting that DJ-1 mutations may only rarely contribute to the cause of this more typical sporadic form of the disease.

10545605	19991105	Genetic epidemiology of the carnitine transporter OCTN2 gene in a Japanese population and phenotypic characterization in Japanese pedigrees with primary systemic carnitine deficiency.	Serum free-carnitine levels were determined in 973 unrelated white collar workers in Akita, Japan. Fourteen of these participants consistently had serum free-carnitine levels below the fifth percentile (28 microM for females and 38 microM for males). The OCTN2 (organic cation transporter) gene was sequenced for these 14 subjects, for 22 subjects whose carnitine levels were below the fifth percentile in the first screening but were normal in the second measurement and in 69 individuals with normal carnitine levels for two separate measurements. Polymorphic sequences defined three major haplotypes with equal frequency. Mutations were identified in nine subjects with low carnitine levels: Trp132X (three individuals), Ser467Cys (four), Trp283Cys (one) and Met179Leu (one). In vitro expression studies in HEK cells indicated that Ser467Cys and Trp283Cys, but not Met179Leu, significantly reduced L-carnitine uptake relative to the normal control. Trp132X and Ser467Cys were associated with specific haplotypes, suggesting a founder effect. A conservative estimate of the overall prevalence of heterozygotes was 1.01% in the Akita prefecture, Japan, giving an estimated incidence of primary systemic carnitine deficiency (MIM 212140) as 1 in 40 000 births. An echocardiographic study of the families of patients with primary carnitine deficiency revealed that the heterozygotes for OCTN2 mutations were predisposed to late onset benign cardiac hypertrophy (odds ratio 15.1, 95% CI 1.39-164) compared with the wild-types. Sequencing of DNA isolated from three deceased siblings (1.5-8 years) in two families retrospectively confirmed that all three deceased subjects were homozygous for the OCTN2 mutations.

8391647	19930715	Molecular basis of the little mouse phenotype and implications for cell type-specific growth.	The molecular basis for the little (lit) mouse phenotype, characterized by a hypoplastic anterior pituitary gland, is the mutation of a single nucleotide that alters Asp 60 to Gly in the growth hormone releasing factor receptor. Detailed analysis of the lit mouse anterior pituitary reveals spatially distinct proliferative zones of growth hormone-producing stem cells and mature somatotrophs, each regulated by a different trophic factor. This sequential growth factor requirement for a specific cell type may exemplify a common strategy for regulating cellular proliferation in other mammalian organs. 	Nature	D016428 D013485 D013487
9195887	19970515	Two crystal structures of pectin lyase A from Aspergillus reveal a pH driven conformational change and striking divergence in the substrate-binding clefts of pectin and pectate lyases.	Microbial pectin and pectate lyases are virulence factors that degrade the pectic components of the plant cell wall. The homogalacturan backbone of pectin varies in its degree of methylation from the highly methylated and relatively hydrophobic form known as pectin, to the fully demethylated and highly charged form known as pectate. Methylated and demethylated regions of pectin are cleaved by pectin lyase and calcium-dependent pectate lyases, respectively. Protein engineering of lyases specific for particular patterns of methylation, will yield modified pectins of high value to the food and pharmaceutical industries. The crystal structures of pectin lyase A from two strains of Aspergillus niger, N400 and 4M-147, have been determined at pH 6.5 (2.4 A resolution) and pH 8.5 (1.93 A resolution), respectively. The structures were determined by a combination of molecular replacement, multiple isomorphous replacement and intercrystal averaging. Pectin lyase A folds into a parallel beta helix and shares many of the structural features of pectate lyases, despite no more than 17% sequence identity after pairwise structure-based alignment. These shared structural features include amino acid stacks and the asparagine ladder. However, the differences in the substrate-binding clefts of these two enzymes are striking. In pectin lyase A, the cleft is dominated by aromatic residues and is enveloped by negative electrostatic potential. In pectate lyases, this cleft is rich in charged residues and contains an elongated ribbon of positive potential when Ca2+ is bound. The major difference between the two pectin lyase A structures from the two strains is in the conformation of the loop formed by residues 182-187. These observed differences are due to the different pH values of crystallization. The substrate-binding clefts and catalytic machinery of pectin and pectate lyases have diverged significantly. Specificity is dictated by both the nature of the protein-carbohydrate interaction and long-range electrostatic forces. Three potential catalytic residues have been identified in pectin lyase, two of these are common to pectate lyases. Pectin lyase A does not bind Ca2+ but an arginine residue is found in an equivalent position to the Ca2+ ion in pectate lyase, suggesting a similar role in catalysis. The activity of pectin lyase A is pH -dependent with an optimum activity at pH 5.5. The activity drops above pH 7.0 due to a conformational change at the binding cleft, triggered by the proximity of two buried aspartate residues. 	Structure	D003160 D016428 D013485
8354390	19930823	Cloning of a human liver UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase cDNA by complementation of the bacterial galU mutation.	A human liver cDNA clone which encodes the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase was isolated by complementation of a bacterial galU mutant. The deduced amino acid sequence of the human enzyme comprised 508 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 56,950. The human enzyme significantly resembles those of potato tuber and slime mold with a homology of 46.6% and 43.2%, respectively, in amino acid sequence. No homology was found between the eukaryotic and the prokaryotic enzymes. Northern blotting analysis revealed that the gene was expressed at the highest level in skeletal muscle, followed by liver, heart and kidney. 	FEBS_Lett.	D003160 D016428 D013485
7981676	19940701	A de novo 13 nt deletion, a newly identified C647W missense mutation and a deletion of exon 18 in infantile onset glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII).	We identified the presumably rare event of de novo mutation in an autosomal recessive disorder, glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII). GSDII results from inherited deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase) and both the expressed and structural gene (designated GAA) have been isolated. The mutation was a deletion of 13 nt of coding sequence (delta nt 1456-1468) on the paternally derived allele of the proband. The delta nt 1456-1468 results in a reading frameshift and a premature termination signal upstream of the enzyme catalytic site. Paternity was confirmed by presence of two downstream, uncommon amino acid substitutions (E689K, W746C) in both proband and father and by comparison of nine short tandem repeats. The maternal allele carried a newly identified deleterious C647W missense mutation in a highly conserved area of the protein. The C647W mutation was also found in a second unrelated proband, heteroallelic with a deletion extending from IVS17 to IVS18. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D002363 D016428 D013485
14625278	20031120	Novel nuclear shuttle proteins, HDBP1 and HDBP2, bind to neuronal cell-specific cis-regulatory element in the promoter for the human Huntington's disease gene.	Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the HD gene, and the expression level of either normal or mutant huntingtin is implicated in the pathogenesis of HD. However, a molecular base of the HD gene transcription has not been elucidated as yet. In this study, we identified two proteins, HDBP1 and HDBP2, which bind to the promoter region for the HD gene using a yeast one-hybrid system. Amino acid sequence analysis of the proteins deduced the presence of nuclear localization signal, nuclear export signal, zinc finger, serine/proline-rich region, and highly conserved C-terminal region. In vitro DNA binding assay indicated that the C-terminal conserved regions of the proteins were responsible for binding to the unique promoter DNA sequences of the HD gene. The DNA sequence protected from DNase I digestion was a 7-bp consensus sequence (GCCGGCG), which resides in triplicate at intervals of 13 bp within and proximal to the 20-bp direct repeat sequences of the HD promoter region. The mutation of 7-bp consensus sequence abolishes the HD promoter function in a neuronal cell line (IMR32). In human cultured cells, ectopically expressed green fluorescent protein-fused HDBP1 and HDBP2 localized in the cytoplasm, but both proteins totally shift from cytoplasm to nucleus by the treatment with an inhibitor of the nuclear export, leptomycin B, and mutagenesis of the putative nuclear export signals. Taken together, HDBP1 and HDBP2 are novel transcription factors shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm and bind to the specific GCCGGCG, which is an essential cis-element for HD gene expression in neuronal cells.

17273165	20070203	Mutation in Mpzl3, a novel [corrected] gene encoding a predicted [corrected] adhesion protein, in the rough coat (rc) mice with severe skin and hair abnormalities.	The rough coat (rc), an autosomal-recessive mutation, arose spontaneously in C57BL/6J mice. Homozygous rc mice develop severe skin and hair abnormalities, including cyclic and progressive hair loss and sebaceous gland hypertrophy. The rc locus was previously mapped to Chromosome 9. To elucidate the genetic basis underlying the rc phenotype development, we carried out positional cloning, and mapped the rc locus to a 246-kb interval. We identified a missense mutation within a novel open reading frame in the rc/rc mice, which is predicted to encode a cell adhesion molecule with the highest homology to myelin protein zero (MPZ) and myelin protein zero-like 2 (MPZL2, also called epithelial V-like antigen). We therefore named this gene Mpzl3 (myelin protein zero-like 3). The mutation in the rc/rc mice occurred at a highly conserved residue within the conserved Ig-like V-type domain, thus likely altering the MPZL3 protein function. Reverse transcriptase-PCR and Western blot analyses revealed expression of the Mpzl3 gene in various adult organs, including the skin. Using indirect immunofluorescence, we detected MPZL3 protein in the keratinocytes and sebocytes in the skin. Results from this study identified a novel gene encoding a predicted adhesion protein whose mutation in the rc/rc mice likely caused the rc phenotype. 	J._Invest._Dermatol.	D016428 D052061 D013485
21623745	20110601	Two novel recessive mutations in KRT14 identified in a cohort of 21 Spanish families with epidermolysis bullosa simplex.	Basal epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is a group of blistering genodermatoses mostly caused by mutations in the keratin genes, KRT5 and KRT14. Recessive mutations represent about 5% of all EBS mutations, being common and specific in populations with high consanguinity, where affected patients show severe phenotypes. To accomplish the first mutational analysis in patients of Spanish origin with EBS and to delineate a comprehensive genotype-phenotype correlation. Twenty-one EBS families were analysed. Immunofluorescence mapping at the dermoepidermal junction level was performed on skin biopsies from patients. Mutation screening of the entire coding sequences of KRT5 and KRT14 in genomic DNA was assessed by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. KRT5 or KRT14 causative mutations were identified in 18 of the 21 EBS families. A total of 14 different mutations were disclosed, of which 12 were dominant missense mutations and two truncating recessive mutations. Five of the 14 mutations were novel including three dominant in KRT5 (p.V186E, p.T321P and p.A428T) and two recessive in KRT14 (p.K116X and p.K250RfsX8). The two patients with EBS carrying homozygous recessive mutations were affected by severe phenotypes and belonged to consanguineous families. All five families with the EBS Dowling-Meara subtype carried recurrent mutations affecting the highly conserved ends of the ?-helical rod domain of K5 and K14. The seven mutations associated with the localized EBS subtype were widely distributed along the KRT5 and KRT14 genes. Two families with mottled pigmentation carried the P25L mutation in KRT5, commonly associated with this subtype. This study further confirms the genotype-phenotype correlation established for EBS in other ethnic groups, and is the first in a Mediterranean country (excluding Israel). This study adds two novel recessive mutations to the worldwide record to date, which includes a total of 14 mutations. As in previous reports, the recessive mutations resulted in a lack of keratin K14, giving rise to a generalized and severe presentation. 	Br._J._Dermatol.	D016428 D013485
14769911	20040211	Prion protein gene polymorphisms in healthy and scrapie-affected sheep in Greece.	A total of 216 local crossbred sheep from 16 scrapie-affected Greek flocks and 210 purebred sheep of the milk breeds Chios and Karagouniko from healthy flocks were analysed for scrapie-linked polymorphisms in the prion protein (PrP) gene. Of the 216 sheep in this case-control study, 96 sheep were clinical cases, 25 subclinical cases (asymptomatic at the moment of euthanasia but positive by histopathology and/or ELISA detecting proteinase-resistant PrP) and 95 healthy controls (negative by all evaluations). Polymorphisms at codons 136, 154 and 171 were determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, followed by RFLP and sequencing. Scrapie, both clinical and subclinical, was associated with the genotypes ARQ/ARQ (88 of 110 sheep of that genotype), ARQ/TRQ (9 of 13), ARQ/AHQ (15 of 38) and VRQ/VRQ (9 of 17). Histopathological lesions were more severe in the clinical cases. Genotypes ARQ/ARR (26 sheep), ARQ/ARK (seven sheep), AHQ/ARR (one sheep), ARH/ARH (one sheep) and ARR/ARH (three sheep) were detected exclusively in healthy control sheep. In the purebred survey, four genotypes were present in the Chios sheep (ARQ/ARQ, ARQ/TRQ, ARQ/AHQ and ARQ/ARR) and four in the Karagouniko sheep (ARQ/ARQ, ARQ/AHQ, ARQ/ARR and ARQ/ARH).

19944405	20091201	Loss-of-function mutations in the human ortholog of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ODA7 disrupt dynein arm assembly and cause primary ciliary dyskinesia.	Cilia and flagella are evolutionarily conserved structures that play various physiological roles in diverse cell types. Defects in motile cilia result in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), the most prominent ciliopathy, characterized by the association of respiratory symptoms, male infertility, and, in nearly 50% of cases, situs inversus. So far, most identified disease-causing mutations involve genes encoding various ciliary components, such those belonging to the dynein arms that are essential for ciliary motion. Following a candidate-gene approach based on data from a mutant strain of the biflagellated alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii carrying an ODA7 defect, we identified four families with a PCD phenotype characterized by the absence of both dynein arms and loss-of-function mutations in the human orthologous gene called LRRC50. Functional analyses performed in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and in another flagellated protist, Trypanosoma brucei, support a key role for LRRC50, a member of the leucine-rich-repeat superfamily, in cytoplasmic preassembly of dynein arms.

7604019	19950703	Construction of a 2.8-megabase yeast artificial chromosome contig and cloning of the human methylthioadenosine phosphorylase gene from the tumor suppressor region on 9p21.	Many human malignant cells lack methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) enzyme activity. The gene (MTAP) encoding this enzyme was previously mapped to the short arm of chromosome 9, band p21-22, a region that is frequently deleted in multiple tumor types. To clone candidate tumor suppressor genes from the deleted region on 9p21-22, we have constructed a long-range physical map of 2.8 megabases for 9p21 by using overlapping yeast artificial chromosome and cosmid clones. This map includes the type IIFN gene cluster, the recently identified candidate tumor suppressor genes CDKN2 (p16INK4A) and CDKN2B (p15INK4B), and several CpG islands. In addition, we have identified other transcription units within the yeast artificial chromosome contig. Sequence analysis of a 2.5-kb cDNA clone isolated from a CpG island that maps between the IFN genes and CDKN2 reveals a predicted open reading frame of 283 amino acids followed by 1302 nucleotides of 3' untranslated sequence. This gene is evolutionarily conserved and shows significant amino acid homologies to mouse and human purine nucleoside phosphorylases and to a hypothetical 25.8-kDa protein in the pet gene (coding for cytochrome bc1 complex) region of Rhodospirillum rubrum. The location, expression pattern, and nucleotide sequence of this gene suggest that it codes for the MTAP enzyme. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D003160 D016428 D013485 D013486 D013487
11062471	20001104	Mutations in NYX, encoding the leucine-rich proteoglycan nyctalopin, cause X-linked complete congenital stationary night blindness.	During development, visual photoreceptors, bipolar cells and other neurons establish connections within the retina enabling the eye to process visual images over approximately 7 log units of illumination. Within the retina, cells that respond to light increment and light decrement are separated into ON- and OFF-pathways. Hereditary diseases are known to disturb these retinal pathways, causing either progressive degeneration or stationary deficits. Congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) is a group of stable retinal disorders that are characterized by abnormal night vision. Genetic subtypes of CSNB have been defined and different disease actions have been postulated. The molecular bases have been elucidated in several subtypes, providing a better understanding of the disease mechanisms and developmental retinal neurobiology. Here we have studied 22 families with 'complete' X-linked CSNB (CSNB1; MIM 310500; ref. 4) in which affected males have night blindness, some photopic vision loss and a defect of the ON-pathway. We have found 14 different mutations, including 1 founder mutation in 7 families from the United States, in a novel candidate gene, NYX. NYX, which encodes a glycosylphosphatidyl (GPI)-anchored protein called nyctalopin, is a new and unique member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family. The role of other SLRP proteins suggests that mutant nyctalopin disrupts developing retinal interconnections involving the ON-bipolar cells, leading to the visual losses seen in patients with complete CSNB.

8481514	19930501	Double heterozygosity for mutations in the platelet glycoprotein IX gene in three siblings with Bernard-Soulier syndrome.	Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) giant platelets have defective and/or deficient glycoprotein (GP) Ib/IX complexes, causing absent ristocetin-induced aggregation, defective interaction with von Willebrand factor, morphologic abnormality, and a clinical bleeding tendency. Recently several mutations have been described in the platelet GPIb alpha gene in individuals exhibiting the BSS phenotype. We have studied a family with classical BSS, and have excluded lesions at the GPIb alpha locus by restriction fragment length polymorphism linkage analysis. Analysis of the genes for two other components of the platelet GPIb:IX complex, namely GPIb beta and GPIX, showed two different missense mutations in the coding region of the GPIX gene: an A--&gt;G transition in codon 21 results in conversion of an aspartic acid to glycine and an A--&gt;G change in codon 45 converts an asparagine residue to serine. Three affected individuals are doubly heterozygous for these mutations, which alter conserved residues in or flanking the GPIX leucine-rich glycoprotein motif. Both mutations create new recognition sites for the enzyme Fnu 4H1; therefore, this enzyme was used to screen 60 normal subjects (120 alleles). Neither mutation was detected in any subject other than direct relatives of the affected individuals. Although low levels of GPIb were demonstrable by both flow cytometry and immunoblot analysis in an affected individual's platelets, there was no evidence of GPIX immunoreactivity. We propose that expression of abnormal GPIX prevents stable assembly of the GPIb/IX complex, causing BSS in the doubly heterozygous individuals in this family. 	Blood	D002363 D016428 D013485
1339145	19921001	Genomic organization of a cDNA (QM) demonstrating an altered mRNA level in nontumorigenic Wilms' microcell hybrid cells and its localization to Xq28.	Using a cosmid clone derived from human Xq28 as a probe which shows cross-species homology, we isolated cDNA clones and the nucleotide sequence analysis of the cDNA revealed that the cDNA is identical to QM cDNA. The QM cDNA has recently been reported as a cDNA with down-regulation in tumorigenic Wilms' tumor microcell hybrid. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the cDNA with those of the genomic DNA allowed us to determine the genomic organization of the QM gene. The QM gene consists of at least 7 exons and is located at Xq28. Southern blot analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel indicates that the QM genes are scattered at least to chromosome 2, 3, 6, 14, 16, and possibly to other chromosomes. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the QM gene is expressed in all the examined adult human tissues as well as cell lines including HeLa cells, fibroblasts, and somatic cell hybrids with increased expression in liver, spleen, testis, and adrenal gland. The results suggest that the QM gene belongs to a new multi-gene family with yet undetermined function. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D013485
18372902	20080401	TARDBP mutations in individuals with sporadic and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Recently, TDP-43 was identified as a key component of ubiquitinated aggregates in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an adult-onset neurological disorder that leads to the degeneration of motor neurons. Here we report eight missense mutations in nine individuals--six from individuals with sporadic ALS (SALS) and three from those with familial ALS (FALS)--and a concurring increase of a smaller TDP-43 product. These findings further corroborate that TDP-43 is involved in ALS pathogenesis. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D013485
12056806	20020612	ARHGAP10, a novel human gene coding for a potentially cytoskeletal Rho-GTPase activating protein.	Rho-GTPase activating proteins (Rho-GAPs) are negative regulators of Rho-GTPase signaling pathways related to actin cytoskeleton dynamics, cell proliferation, and differentiation. We have identified a novel human gene, termed ARHGAP10, that codes for a 1957-aminoacid Rho-GAP, containing a PDZ, a PH, and a Rho-GAP domain. The cDNA is 7118 bp long and has an open reading frame of 5874 bp. A computational analysis located this gene on chromosome 10 band 10p12.32 suggesting that it is composed of 25 exons. Northern analysis revealed that it is widely expressed, with high levels in brain and muscle. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis confirmed an increase in ARHGAP10 expression during differentiation of HL-60 cells with all-trans-retinoic acid and hematopoietic stem cells with erythropoietin, suggesting that this gene could play a role in normal hematopoiesis. The fact that this gene is highly expressed in muscle and brain, which are highly differentiated tissues, further supports the hypothesis that ARHGAP10 is important for cell differentiation.

1904318	19910614	A novel arachidonic acid-selective cytosolic PLA2 contains a Ca(2+)-dependent translocation domain with homology to PKC and GAP.	We report the cloning and expression of a cDNA encoding a high molecular weight (85.2 kd) cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) that has no detectable sequence homology with the secreted forms of PLA2. We show that cPLA2 selectively cleaves arachidonic acid from natural membrane vesicles and demonstrate that cPLA2 translocates to membrane vesicles in response to physiologically relevant changes in free calcium. Moreover, we demonstrate that an amino-terminal 140 amino acid fragment of cPLA2 translocates to natural membrane vesicles in a Ca(2+)-dependent fashion. Interestingly, we note that this 140 amino acid domain of cPLA2 contains a 45 amino acid region with homology to PKC, p65, GAP, and PLC. We suggest that this homology delineates a Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid-binding motif, providing a mechanism for the second messenger Ca2+ to translocate and activate cytosolic proteins.

11756660	20020105	Dysadherin, a cancer-associated cell membrane glycoprotein, down-regulates E-cadherin and promotes metastasis.	We report the cloning and characterization of a cancer-associated cell membrane glycoprotein recognized by mAb NCC-3G10. The antibody showed strong reactivity to a wide variety of cancer cells, but only to a limited number of normal cells including lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and basal cells of stratified squamous epithelium. The cDNA for the antigen encodes 178 aa, which includes a putative signal sequence, a potential O-glycosylated extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. Transfection of the cDNA into PLC/PRF/5 liver cancer cells resulted in reduced cell-cell adhesiveness, based on both morphology and results of Ca(2+)-dependent cell aggregation assay. In transfected cells, E-cadherin was markedly decreased at the protein level in inverse proportion to the expression level of the antigen recognized by NCC-3G10, but not at the mRNA level. Aggregation of the antigen by NCC-3G10-coated beads triggered accumulation of actin, suggesting some interplay between this antigen and E-cadherin through actin. When metastatic ability was examined in severe combined immunodeficient mice by injecting PLC/PRF/5 cells into the spleen, the transfectants formed a markedly higher number of metastatic nodules in comparison with controls. We have named this cell membrane glycoprotein, which down-regulates E-cadherin and promotes metastasis, dysadherin. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 D013485
7897344	19950301	Identification of five allelic variants of the sheep PrP gene and their association with natural scrapie.	Scrapie is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of sheep that belongs to the group of prion diseases found in humans and animals. The host encoded prion protein (PrP) plays a central role in the disease process. In the PrP genes of man, mice and sheep, polymorphisms have been found that are associated with disease susceptibility and pathogenesis. We have used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to detect polymorphisms in the sheep PrP gene. In addition to the already described polymorphisms at codons 136, 154 and 171, we identified a hitherto unknown G --&gt; T transition at codon 171. This transition is responsible for a glutamine to histidine substitution. An arginine to glutamine substitution at this position has been described previously. DGGE allowed us to identify five different combinations of these polymorphisms within the PrP gene representing five allelic variants, which were cloned and sequenced. Based on the triplet sequences present at codons 136, 154 and 171 these allelic variants were designated PrPVRQ, PrPARR, PrPARQ, PrPARH and PrPAHQ. To determine the association of these allelic variants with natural scrapie, we screened 34 scrapie affected and 91 healthy control sheep of the Texel breed for the presence of these allelic variants. In these two groups, the five variants gave rise to 13 different genotypes. The distribution of the allelic variants among both groups showed marked differences. The PrPVRQ variant was present with high frequency in scrapie affected sheep, whereas the PrPARR variant was almost exclusively present in the healthy group. Two other variants, PrPARQ and PrPARH, were found in both groups with equal frequencies. The data obtained suggest modulation of disease susceptibility in these Texel sheep by at least five different PrP allelic variants, with the PrPVRQ and PrPARR alleles acting in a dominant, but opposite fashion over the PrPARQ and PrPARH alleles. The frequency of the PrPAHQ variant was too low to draw any conclusions. 	J._Gen._Virol.	D016428
22504945	20120417	A novel mutation in YARS2 causes myopathy with lactic acidosis and sideroblastic anemia.	Mutations in the mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are associated with a strikingly broad range of clinical phenotypes, the molecular basis for which remains obscure. Here, we report a novel missense mutation (c.137G&gt;A, p.Gly46Asp) in the catalytic domain of YARS2, which codes for the mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, in a subject with myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia (MLASA). YARS2 was undetectable by immunoblot analysis in subject myoblasts, resulting in a generalized mitochondrial translation defect. Retroviral expression of a wild-type YARS2 complementary DNA completely rescued the translation defect. We previously demonstrated that the respiratory chain defect in this subject was only present in fully differentiated muscle, and we show here that this likely reflects an increased requirement for YARS2 as muscle cells differentiate. An additional, heterozygous mutation was detected in TRMU/MTU1, a gene encoding the mitochondrial 2-thiouridylase. Although subject myoblasts and myotubes contained half the normal levels of TRMU, thiolation of mitochondrial tRNAs was normal. YARS2 eluted as part of high-molecular-weight complexes of ?250 kDa and 1 MDa by gel filtration. This study confirms mutations in YARS2 as a cause of MLASA and shows that, like some of the cytoplasmic ARSs, mitochondrial ARSs occur in high-molecular-weight complexes. 	Hum._Mutat.

15316025	20040819	Direct association with inner centromere protein (INCENP) activates the novel chromosomal passenger protein, Aurora-C.	A family of serine/threonine kinase Aurora constitutes a key regulator in the orchestration of mitotic events. The human Aurora paralogues Aurora-A, Aurora-B, and Aurora-C have a highly conserved catalytic domain. Extensive studies on the role of Aurora-A and Aurora-B have revealed distinct localizations and functions in regulating mitotic processes, whereas little is known about Aurora-C. The present study shows that human Aurora-C is a chromosomal passenger protein that forms complexes with Aurora-B and inner centromere protein (INCENP), which are known passenger proteins. We show that INCENP binds and activates Aurora-C in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, Aurora-C co-expressed with INCENP elicits the phosphorylation of endogenous histone H3 in mammalian cells, even though this phosphorylation is not sufficient to establish chromosome condensation in interphase cells. We therefore suggest that Aurora-C is a novel chromosomal passenger protein that cooperates with Aurora-B to regulate mitotic chromosome dynamics in mammalian cells. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
1337937	19921201	A complementary DNA for human choline acetyltransferase induces two forms of enzyme with different molecular weights in cultured cells.	Complementary DNA (cDNA) clones containing the entire coding region of human choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) were isolated from cDNA libraries prepared from the autopsied spinal cord. In the human cDNA, the ATG codon assigned to the putative initiation codon for pig, rat and mouse ChAT cDNAs was replaced by ACG. The human cDNA contained an in-frame ATG codon 324 nucleotides upstream of the ACG codon. Therefore, human ChAT cDNA should code for a 748 amino acid polypeptide of 82.6 kDa. This deduced molecular weight was larger than that of ChAT protein purified from the human brain and placenta (64-70 kDa). The human ChAT cDNA containing the entire coding region was ligated to an expression vector and introduced into African green monkey kidney (COS) cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The cells expressed high ChAT activity and produced two protein bands immunostained with an antibody to monkey ChAT. The molecular weight of the proteins was estimated to be approximately 70 and 80 kDa by polyacrylamide-SDS gel electrophoresis. When partial cDNAs that lacked the first ATG but contained the replaced ACG codon were introduced into COS cells, the cells expressed moderate ChAT activity and an immunoreactive protein band of 70 kDa. These results indicate that translation of human ChAT mRNA starts at two sites and produces two enzyme proteins with different molecular weights. It might be that the larger form of ChAT molecule is an enzyme precursor for processing or that the N-terminal extrapeptide is needed for subcellular localization of the enzyme.

11110709	20001209	BAL is a novel risk-related gene in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas that enhances cellular migration.	Clinical risk factor models such as the International Prognostic Index are used to identify diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLB-CL) patients with different risks of death from their diseases. To elucidate the molecular bases for these observed clinical differences in outcome, differential display was used to identify a novel gene, termed BAL (B-aggressive lymphoma), which is expressed at significantly higher levels in fatal high-risk DLB-CLs than in cured low-risk tumors. The major BAL complementary DNA encodes a previously uncharacterized 88-kd nuclear protein with a duplicated N-terminal domain homologous to the nonhistone portion of histone-macroH2A and a C-terminal alpha-helical region with 2 short coiled-coil domains. Of note, the BAL N-terminus and secondary structure resemble those of a recently identified human protein, KIAA1268. In addition, both BAL and KIAA1268 map to chromosome 3q21, further suggesting that these genes belong to a newly identified family. BAL is expressed at increased levels in DLB-CL cell lines with an activated peripheral B cell, rather than a germinal center B cell, phenotype. This observation and the characteristic dissemination of high risk DLB-CLs prompted studies regarding the role of BAL in B-cell migration. In classical transwell assays, stable BAL-overexpressing B-cell lymphoma transfectants had significantly higher rates of migration than vector-only transfectants, indicating that the risk-related BAL gene promotes malignant B-cell migration.

10192393	19990407	A common human skin tumour is caused by activating mutations in beta-catenin.	WNT signalling orchestrates a number of developmental programs. In response to this stimulus, cytoplasmic beta-catenin (encoded by CTNNB1) is stabilized, enabling downstream transcriptional activation by members of the LEF/TCF family. One of the target genes for beta-catenin/TCF encodes c-MYC, explaining why constitutive activation of the WNT pathway can lead to cancer, particularly in the colon. Most colon cancers arise from mutations in the gene encoding adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a protein required for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of beta-catenin, but a small percentage of colon and some other cancers harbour beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations. Recently, we discovered that transgenic mice expressing an activated beta-catenin are predisposed to developing skin tumours resembling pilomatricomas. Given that the skin of these adult mice also exhibits signs of de novo hair-follicle morphogenesis, we wondered whether human pilomatricomas might originate from hair matrix cells and whether they might possess beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations. Here, we explore the cell origin and aetiology of this common human skin tumour. We found nuclear LEF-1 in the dividing tumour cells, providing biochemical evidence that pilomatricomas are derived from hair matrix cells. At least 75% of these tumours possess mutations affecting the amino-terminal segment, normally involved in phosphorylation-dependent, ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the protein. This percentage of CTNNB1 mutations is greater than in all other human tumours examined thus far, and directly implicates beta-catenin/LEF misregulation as the major cause of hair matrix cell tumorigenesis in humans.

8777804	19950701	[A case of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type I with a new type of peripheral myelin protein (PMP)-22 mutation].	A 16-year-old school boy suffered from an insidious foot deformity. Slight degrees of symmetrical muscular weakness of the distal lower limb muscles were observed. In addition, slight degrees of atrophy of the anterior tibial muscles with moderate degrees of pes cavus deformity and flexion contracture of the toes of both feet were observed. In the upper and lower limbs muscle stretch reflexes were decreased and absent, respectively. Vibratory and touch sensations were moderately and slightly decreased, respectively, in the toes. The median and ulnar motor conduction velocities (m/sec) were 21.1 and 13.2, respectively, with markedly prolonged distal latencies. The median and ulnar sensory conduction velocities (m/sec) were 21.5 and 10.1, respectively. No M-waves were recorded by stimulation of the tibial and peroneal nerves. Also no nerve action potential was elicited by stimulation of the sural nerve. A fascicular biopsy of the sural nerve was performed. The myelinated fibers showing segmental de- and re-myelination were frequently found in teased fiber preparations. The density of myelinated fibers was markedly decreased, and both demyelinated axons and onion-bulbs were also observed by light and electron microscopy in the Epon-embedded sections. Based on the neurological examination and nerve conduction studies, although other family members were not examined, a diagnosis of HMSN type I was made. To clarify the genetic abnormality, a systematic study of the genomic DNA was made. A DNA duplication in the chromosome 17p11.2-12 was not observed. The single-strand conformational polymorphism method showed an abnormal extra band in the exon 3 encoding peripheral myelin protein (PMP)-22 gene of the patient compared with the control. The direct sequencing analysis of the exon 3 revealed a guanine to cytosine substitution that caused a substitution of arginine for glycine at amino acid position 93 of PMP-22. The digestion of the exon 3 with Sty I showed the presence of a mutant and normal allele of the PMP-22 gene indicating autosomal dominant heredity. This type of PMP-22 gene mutation is different from any type of PMP-22 mutations reported in the literature. The mutation is located in the intracellular domain of PMP-22. The mechanism by which the mutation induce demyelination of the peripheral myelin remains to be elucidated. Reports of patients with a point mutation of amino acids of PMP-22 are rare in the literature. This is the first Japanese patient with a new type of mutation of the PMP-22 gene.

19863551	20091030	Role of genetic testing in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia.	In a cohort of patients with confirmed or suspected arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D), genetic testing is useful in confirming the diagnosis, particularly in individuals who do not completely fulfil Task Force criteria for the disease, thereby also enabling the adoption of preventive measures in family members. Due to the high percentage of novel mutations that are expected to be identified in ARVC/D, the use of genetic screening technology based on the identification of known mutations seems to have very restricted value. Our results support that the presence of certain genetic variations could play a role in the final phenotype of patients with ARVC/D, where single and compound mutation carriers would have more symptomatic forms of the disease and the polymorphism P366L could be associated to a more benign phenotype.

18313022	20080304	Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy type 5 is a fully penetrant, lethal arrhythmic disorder caused by a missense mutation in the TMEM43 gene.	Autosomal-dominant arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) causes sudden cardiac death and is characterized by clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Fifteen unrelated ARVC families with a disease-associated haplotype on chromosome 3p (ARVD5) were ascertained from a genetically isolated population. Identification of key recombination events reduced the disease region to a 2.36 Mb interval containing 20 annotated genes. Bidirectional resequencing showed one rare variant in transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43 1073C--&gt;T, S358L), was carried on all recombinant ARVD5 ancestral haplotypes from affected subjects and not found in population controls. The mutation occurs in a highly conserved transmembrane domain of TMEM43 and is predicted to be deleterious. Clinical outcomes in 257 affected and 151 unaffected subjects were compared, and penetrance was determined. We concluded that ARVC at locus ARVD5 is a lethal, fully penetrant, sex-influenced morbid disorder. Median life expectancy was 41 years in affected males compared to 71 years in affected females (relative risk 6.8, 95% CI 1.3-10.9). Heart failure was a late manifestation in survivors. Although little is known about the function of the TMEM43 gene, it contains a response element for PPAR gamma (an adipogenic transcription factor), which may explain the fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium, a characteristic pathological finding in ARVC.

1317572	19920601	Zinc finger point mutations within the WT1 gene in Wilms tumor patients.	A proposed Wilms tumor gene, WT1, which encodes a zinc finger protein, has previously been isolated from human chromosome 11p13. Chemical mismatch cleavage analysis was used to identify point mutations in the zinc finger region of this gene in a series of 32 Wilms tumors. Two exonic single base changes were detected. In zinc finger 3 of a bilateral Wilms tumor patient, a constitutional de novo C----T base change was found changing an arginine to a stop codon. One tumor from this patient showed allele loss leading to 11p hemizygosity of the abnormal allele. In zinc finger 2 of a sporadic Wilms tumor patient, a C----T base change resulted in an arginine to cysteine amino acid change. To our knowledge, a WT1 gene missense mutation has not been detected previously in a Wilms tumor. By comparison with a recent NMR and x-ray crystallographic analysis of an analogous zinc finger gene, early growth response gene 1 (EGR1), this amino acid change in WT1 occurs at a residue predicted to be critical for DNA binding capacity and site specificity. The detection of one nonsense point mutation and one missense WT1 gene point mutation adds to the accumulating evidence implicating this gene in a proportion of Wilms tumor patients.

18614772	20080711	Nephrin mutations can cause childhood-onset steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome.	Classically, infants with mutations in NPHS1, which encodes nephrin, present with nephrotic syndrome within the first 3 mo of life (congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish-type), and children with mutations in NPHS2, which encodes podocin, present later with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Recently, however, NPHS2 mutations have been identified in children with congenital nephrotic syndrome. Whether NPHS1 mutations similarly account for some cases of childhood steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome is unknown. In this study, 160 patients who belonged to 142 unrelated families and presented with nephrotic syndrome at least 3 mo after birth were screened for NPHS1 variants once mutations in NPHS2 had been excluded. Compound heterozygous NPHS1 mutations were identified in one familial case and nine sporadic cases. Mutations included protein-truncating nonsense and frameshift mutations, as well as splice-site and missense variants. Mutations were classified as &quot;severe&quot; or &quot;mild&quot; using prediction algorithms and functional assays. Most missense variants trafficked normally to the plasma membrane and maintained the ability to form nephrin homodimers and to heterodimerize with NEPH1, suggesting retained function. The presence of at least one &quot;mild&quot; mutation in these patients likely explains the later onset and milder course of disease. These results broaden the spectrum of renal disease related to nephrin mutations. 	J._Am._Soc._Nephrol.	D016428 D052061 D013485
18474783	20080514	Identification of mutations in the SLC4A11 gene in patients with recessive congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy.	To identify Solute Carrier family 4 (sodium borate cotransporter) member 11 (SLC4A11) gene mutations associated with autosomal recessive congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED2). DNA extraction from blood, polymerase chain reaction amplification, and direct sequencing of all the exons of the SLC4A11 gene were performed for 26 affected members of 20 unrelated families with CHED2. Of 10 mutations observed, 6 were novel, 1 of which involves a complete deletion of exon 6, identified for the first time, to our knowledge, in SLC4A11. The mutations cosegregated with the disease phenotype and were absent in 200 ethnically matched control chromosomes analyzed. This study increases the number of SLC4A11 gene mutations and confirms the role of this gene in causing CHED2. Clinical examination did not reveal any considerable variability in disease expressivity in patients carrying SLC4A11 mutations. Extensive linkage analysis may reveal the modifier genes involved in causing CHED2 in the SLC4A11 mutations unidentified in 9 families. In India, there is a high frequency of CHED2, possibly related to consanguineous marriages. Counseling could be provided to explain the drawbacks of consanguineous marriages to assist in reducing this devastating disorder. 	Arch._Ophthalmol.	D016428 D013485
11017100	20010323	A transmembrane CXC chemokine is a ligand for HIV-coreceptor Bonzo.	We describe a protein with the hallmarks of a chemokine, designated CXCL16, that is made by dendritic cells (DCs) in lymphoid organ T cell zones and by cells in the splenic red pulp. CXCL16 contains a transmembrane domain and both membrane-bound and soluble forms are produced. Naïve CD8 T cells, natural killer T cells and a subset of memory CD4 T cells bind CXCL16, and activated T cells migrated chemotactically to the soluble chemokine. By expression cloning, Bonzo (also known as STRL33 and TYMSTR) was identified as a CXCL16 receptor. CXCL16 may function in promoting interactions between DCs and CD8 T cells and in guiding T cell movements in the splenic red pulp. CXCL16 was also found in the thymic medulla and in some nonlymphoid tissues, indicating roles in thymocyte development and effector T cell trafficking. 	Nat._Immunol.	D016428 D013485 D013487
14678285	20031218	The first homozygous mutation (S226I) in the highly-conserved WSXWS-like motif of the GH receptor causing Laron syndrome: supression of GH secretion by GnRH analogue therapy not restored by dihydrotestosterone administration.	The study describes for the first time, a homozygous mutation in the WSXWS-like motif of the human GH receptor (GHR) in a patient with Laron syndrome and describe laboratory data during treatment with GnRHa to suppress puberty and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). A 16-year-old boy at Tanner puberty stage 2 with Laron syndrome was born SGA to consanguineous parents, presented severe growth retardation, obesity and micropenis. GHR coding region was sequenced. GH, GHBP, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were determined before, during and after GnRHa and DHT treatment. A homozygous mutation in exon 7, replacing serine by isoleucine in codon 226 was identified. S226 is the last serine belonging to the WSXWS-like motif in GHR. No specific effect of S226I mutation in heterozygous state was observed. Laboratory data at the prepubertal age showed markedly high GH, low GHBP, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels. Re-evaluation at pubertal age showed normal basal serum IGFBP-3 levels and low but near normal IGF-I levels. We also noticed a sustained decrease in GH, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels after blocking puberty, which was not affected by short- and long-term DHT treatment. Pubertal hormonal profile was re-established after the GnRHa therapy was discontinued to allow the reactivation of the gonadal axis. The homozygous mutation S226I in WSXWS-like motif of GHR causes GH insensitivity. The decrease in IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels after GnRHa therapy, which was not reversed with DHT administration, suggests that sex steroids have, through oestradiol, a GH-independent action on IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels. A direct effect of GnRHa on GH secretion cannot be excluded. 	Clin._Endocrinol._(Oxf)	D002363 D016428 D013485
10232400	19990508	A mutation detection strategy for the human keratin 6A gene and novel missense mutations in two cases of pachyonychia congenita type 1.	Pachyonychia congenita type 1 (PC-1) is an autosomal dominant ectodermal dysplasia characterized by hypertrophic nail dystrophy, focal non-epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma and variable features of oral leukokeratosis and follicular keratosis. Previously, we have shown that this disease can be caused by mutations in type I keratin K16 and one mutation has been reported in its type II keratin expression partner, K6a. Mutation analysis for K6a has been hampered by the presence of multiple copies of the K6 gene in the human genome, of which some are expressed and others are pseudogenes. Here, we describe a mutation detection strategy where the entire KRT6A gene, approximately 7 kb, is specifically amplified by long-range PCR. Using this technique, we have detected two novel mutations in the 1A domain of the K6a polypeptide, N171K and F174S. Mutations were confirmed in the affected individuals and were excluded from 50 unaffected unrelated individuals by restriction enzyme analysis of KRT6A PCR products. Additionally, mutation N171K was confirmed by RT-PCR in mRNA derived from lesional palmoplantar epidermis of an affected individual, confirming the specificity of the genomic PCR for the functional K6a gene. This, together with a similar strategy which we have developed for the K16 gene, provide a robust system for mutation detection and prenatal diagnosis for patients with PC-1. 	Exp._Dermatol.

7906588	19931201	Missense mutations in the arylsulphatase A genes of metachromatic leukodystrophy patients.	Novel predicted disease-causing mutations have been defined in three patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). The first new mutation is a C--&gt;A change at base 884 in exon 5 of the arylsulphatase A (ASA) gene causing a serine to tyrosine substitution at position 295 of the protein (S295Y). A late-infantile MLD patient was found to be homozygous for this mutation. The second mutation is a G--&gt;A substitution at nucleotide 1144 in exon 7, that causes a glutamic acid to lysine substitution at amino acid 382 (E382K). A juvenile MLD patients was found to be homozygous for this mutation. Finally an adult MLD patient has been shown to be heterozygous for two novel point mutations in exon 3. These are both C--&gt;T changes at position 635 and 671 that result in alanine to valine substitutions at amino acids 212 (A212V) and 224 (A224V) of the ASA protein. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.

9653160	19980708	Identification of genes expressed in human CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells by expressed sequence tags and efficient full-length cDNA cloning.	Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) possess the potentials of self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation toward different lineages of blood cells. These cells not only play a primordial role in hematopoietic development but also have important clinical application. Characterization of the gene expression profile in CD34(+) HSPCs may lead to a better understanding of the regulation of normal and pathological hematopoiesis. In the present work, genes expressed in human umbilical cord blood CD34(+) cells were catalogued by partially sequencing a large amount of cDNA clones [or expressed sequence tags (ESTs)] and analyzing these sequences with the tools of bioinformatics. Among 9,866 ESTs thus obtained, 4,697 (47.6%) showed identity to known genes in the GenBank database, 2, 603 (26.4%) matched to the ESTs previously deposited in a public domain database, 1,415 (14.3%) were previously undescribed ESTs, and the remaining 1,151 (11.7%) were mitochondrial DNA, ribosomal RNA, or repetitive (Alu or L1) sequences. Integration of ESTs of known genes generated a profile including 855 genes that could be divided into different categories according to their functions. Some (8.2%) of the genes in this profile were considered related to early hematopoiesis. The possible function of ESTs corresponding to so far unknown genes were approached by means of homology and functional motif searches. Moreover, attempts were made to generate libraries enriched for full-length cDNAs, to better explore the genes in HSPCs. Nearly 60% of the cDNA clones of mRNA under 2 kb in our libraries had 5' ends upstream of the first ATG codon of the ORF. With this satisfactory result, we have developed an efficient working system that allowed fast sequencing of 32 full-length cDNAs, 16 of them being mapped to the chromosomes with radiation hybrid panels. This work may lay a basis for the further research on the molecular network of hematopoietic regulation. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 D013485
19290556	20090318	Identification of the variant Ala335Val of MED25 as responsible for CMT2B2: molecular data, functional studies of the SH3 recognition motif and correlation between wild-type MED25 and PMP22 RNA levels in CMT1A animal models.	Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. All mendelian patterns of inheritance have been described. We identified a homozygous p.A335V mutation in the MED25 gene in an extended Costa Rican family with autosomal recessively inherited Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy linked to the CMT2B2 locus in chromosome 19q13.3. MED25, also known as ARC92 and ACID1, is a subunit of the human activator-recruited cofactor (ARC), a family of large transcriptional coactivator complexes related to the yeast Mediator. MED25 was identified by virtue of functional association with the activator domains of multiple cellular and viral transcriptional activators. Its exact physiological function in transcriptional regulation remains obscure. The CMT2B2-associated missense amino acid substitution p.A335V is located in a proline-rich region with high affinity for SH3 domains of the Abelson type. The mutation causes a decrease in binding specificity leading to the recognition of a broader range of SH3 domain proteins. Furthermore, Med25 is coordinately expressed with Pmp22 gene dosage and expression in transgenic mice and rats. These results suggest a potential role of this protein in the molecular etiology of CMT2B2 and suggest a potential, more general role of MED25 in gene dosage sensitive peripheral neuropathy pathogenesis.

21763483	20110719	A mutation in VPS35, encoding a subunit of the retromer complex, causes late-onset Parkinson disease.	To identify rare causal variants in late-onset Parkinson disease (PD), we investigated an Austrian family with 16 affected individuals by exome sequencing. We found a missense mutation, c.1858G&gt;A (p.Asp620Asn), in the VPS35 gene in all seven affected family members who are alive. By screening additional PD cases, we saw the same variant cosegregating with the disease in an autosomal-dominant mode with high but incomplete penetrance in two further families with five and ten affected members, respectively. The mean age of onset in the affected individuals was 53 years. Genotyping showed that the shared haplotype extends across 65 kilobases around VPS35. Screening the entire VPS35 coding sequence in an additional 860 cases and 1014 controls revealed six further nonsynonymous missense variants. Three were only present in cases, two were only present in controls, and one was present in cases and controls. The familial mutation p.Asp620Asn and a further variant, c.1570C&gt;T (p.Arg524Trp), detected in a sporadic PD case were predicted to be damaging by sequence-based and molecular-dynamics analyses. VPS35 is a component of the retromer complex and mediates retrograde transport between endosomes and the trans-Golgi network, and it has recently been found to be involved in Alzheimer disease.

7717396	19950401	Mutations in the gene for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy in patients with different clinical phenotypes.	Recently, the gene for the most common peroxisomal disorder, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), has been described encoding a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein. We analyzed the entire protein-coding sequence of this gene by reverse-transcription PCR, SSCP, and DNA sequencing in five patients with different clinical expression of X-ALD and in their female relatives; these clinical expressions were cerebral childhood ALD, adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), and &quot;Addison disease only&quot; (ADO) phenotype. In the three patients exhibiting the classical picture of severe childhood ALD we identified in the 5' portion of the X-ALD gene a 38-bp deletion that causes a frameshift mutation, a 3-bp deletion leading to a deletion of an amino acid in the ATP-binding domain of the ALD protein, and a missense mutation. In the patient with the clinical phenotype of AMN, a nonsense mutation in codon 212, along with a second site mutation at codon 178, was observed. Analysis of the patient with the ADO phenotype revealed a further missense mutation at a highly conserved position in the ALDP/PMP70 comparison. The disruptive nature of two mutations (i.e., the frameshift and the nonsense mutation) in patients with biochemically proved childhood ALD and AMN further strongly supports the hypothesis that alterations in this gene play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of X-ALD. Since the current biochemical techniques for X-ALD carrier detection in affected families lack sufficient reliability, our procedure described for systematic mutation scanning is also capable of improving genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.

21358633	20110302	Mutations in ORC1, encoding the largest subunit of the origin recognition complex, cause microcephalic primordial dwarfism resembling Meier-Gorlin syndrome.	Studies into disorders of extreme growth failure (for example, Seckel syndrome and Majewski osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II) have implicated fundamental cellular processes of DNA damage response signaling and centrosome function in the regulation of human growth. Here we report that mutations in ORC1, encoding a subunit of the origin recognition complex, cause microcephalic primordial dwarfism resembling Meier-Gorlin syndrome. We establish that these mutations disrupt known ORC1 functions including pre-replicative complex formation and origin activation. ORC1 deficiency perturbs S-phase entry and S-phase progression. Additionally, we show that Orc1 depletion in zebrafish is sufficient to markedly reduce body size during rapid embryonic growth. Our data suggest a model in which ORC1 mutations impair replication licensing, slowing cell cycle progression and consequently impeding growth during development, particularly at times of rapid proliferation. These findings establish a novel mechanism for the pathogenesis of microcephalic dwarfism and show a surprising but important developmental impact of impaired origin licensing. 	Nat._Genet.

12567415	20030205	X-linked recessive chondrodysplasia punctata: spectrum of arylsulfatase E gene mutations and expanded clinical variability.	X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata (CDPX1), due to mutations of the arylsulfatase E (ARSE) gene, is a congenital disorder characterized by abnormalities in cartilage and bone development. We performed mutational analysis of the ARSE gene in a series of 16 male patients, and we found mutations in 12 subjects. Clinical variability was observed among the patients, including severe presentations with early lethality in one of them, and symptoms such as cataract and respiratory distress. This indicates that the clinical spectrum of CDPX1, commonly considered a relatively mild form of chondrodysplasia punctata, is wider than previously reported. Different types of mutations were found among the patients examined. Three missense mutations (I80N, T481M, P578S) were expressed in Cos7 cells to study the effects on arylsulfatase E catalytic activity. These mutations caused impaired enzymatic activity suggesting that they are responsible for the disease. Two nonsense mutations, W581X in four patients and R540X in one, were found. One patient showed an insertion (T616ins). In three patients we found deletions of the ARSE gene: in one the deletion involved only the 3' end of the gene, while in two the ARSE gene was completely deleted.

8244391	19930901	A leucine-to-proline substitution causes a defective alpha 1-antichymotrypsin allele associated with familial obstructive lung disease.	Using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing of amplified genomic DNA, we have identified two defective mutants of the human alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) gene associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A leucine 55-to-proline substitution causing a defective ACT allele (Bochum-1) was observed in a family with COPD in three subsequent generations. Another mutation, proline 229-to-alanine (Bonn-1), was associated with ACT serum deficiency in four patients with a positive family history. These mutations were not detected among 100 healthy control subjects, suggesting a possible pathogenetic role of ACT gene defects in a subset of patients with COPD. 	Genomics	D016428 D013485
11955434	20020417	P-Rex1, a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3- and Gbetagamma-regulated guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Rac.	Rac, a member of the Rho family of monomeric GTPases, is an integrator of intracellular signaling in a wide range of cellular processes. We have purified a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-sensitive activator of Rac from neutrophil cytosol. It is an abundant, 185 kDa guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which we cloned and named P-Rex1. The recombinant enzyme has Rac-GEF activity that is directly, substantially, and synergistically activated by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and Gbetagammas both in vitro and in vivo. P-Rex1 antisense oligonucleotides reduced endogenous P-Rex1 expression and C5a-stimulated reactive oxygen species formation in a neutrophil-like cell line. P-Rex1 appears to be a coincidence detector in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and Gbetagamma signaling pathways that is particularly adapted to function downstream of heterotrimeric G proteins in neutrophils.

7951233	19940601	TXK, a novel human tyrosine kinase expressed in T cells shares sequence identity with Tec family kinases and maps to 4p12.	A gene for a novel, putative cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, TXK has been isolated from a human peripheral blood cDNA library. The complete nucleotide sequence of the cDNA indicates that it is related most closely to EMT, a tyrosine kinase of T cells and to the B-cell tyrosine kinase Btk, which is mutated in X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) in humans and X-linked immunodeficiency disease (XID) in mouse. TXK, like BTK, is a member of the Tec sub-family of Src-type (non-receptor) tyrosine kinases. Like similar Tec sub-family members, and unlike the other Src kinases, TXK lacks both the N-terminal myristylation signal and the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine. TXK expression is detected primarily in T cells and some myeloid cell lines but not in a number of other cell types. TXK shares 60% amino acid homology with EMT and 57% with BTK over the SH3, SH2 (Src-homology) and catalytic domains but unlike BTK, EMT and tec, it lacks Gap 1 homology and steroid hormone receptor homology in the N-terminal region. Genomic clones containing TXK have been isolated and hybridize to chromosome position 4p12. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D003160 D016428 D013485 D013487
3401326	19880401	The primary structure of the mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx, Primates) hemoglobin.	The complete primary structure of the hemoglobin from the Mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx, Primates) is presented. This hemoglobin comprises two components in approximately equal amounts (HB I and Hb II). The alpha-chains differ in positions 5 (A3) and 9 (A7) having Ala and Asn in the alpha I-chains and Asp and His in the alpha II-chains. The beta-chains are identical. The components could be separated by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. The globin chains were obtained by carboxymethylcellulose chromatography or high-performance liquid chromatography. The sequences were established by automatic liquid or gas phase Edman degradation of the chains and their tryptic peptides. The alpha-chains show 9 and 11 and the beta-chains 8 exchanges compared with the corresponding human chains, respectively. In the beta-chains one alpha 1/beta 1- and one alpha 1/beta 2-contact is substituted. A comparison of the primary structures of the Mandrill hemoglobin chains with those of other species of the Cercopithecidae family shows that Mandrillus sphinx should be placed between Cercopithecus and Macaca on one side and Papio, Theropithecus and Cercocebus on the other.

7566127	19951005	A transcriptional co-repressor that interacts with nuclear hormone receptors.	Transcriptional silencing mediated by nuclear receptors is important in development, differentiation and oncogenesis. The mechanism underlying this effect is unknown but is one key to understanding the molecular basis of hormone action. Here we identify a receptor-interacting factor, SMRT, as a silencing mediator (co-repressor) for retinoid and thyroid-hormone receptors. SMRT is a previously undiscovered protein whose association with receptors both in solution and bound to DNA-response elements is destabilized by ligand. The interaction with mutant receptors correlates with their transcriptional silencing activities. In vivo, SMRT functions as a potent co-repressor, and a GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusion of SMRT behaves as a frank repressor of a GAL4-dependent reporter. Together, our results identify a new class of cofactors which may be important mediators of hormone action. 	Nature	D016428 D013485 D013487
10548741	19991105	Human phosphoribosylformylglycineamide amidotransferase (FGARAT): regional mapping, complete coding sequence, isolation of a functional genomic clone, and DNA sequence analysis.	Purines play essential roles in many cellular functions, including DNA replication, transcription, intra- and extra-cellular signaling, energy metabolism, and as coenzymes for many biochemical reactions. The de-novo synthesis of purines requires 10 enzymatic steps for the production of inosine monophosphate (IMP). Defects in purine metabolism are associated with human diseases. Further, many anticancer agents function as inhibitors of the de-novo biosynthetic pathway. Genes or cDNAs for most of the enzymes comprising this pathway have been isolated from humans or other mammals. One notable exception is the phosphoribosylformylglycineamide amidotransferase (FGARAT) gene, which encodes the fourth step of this pathway. This gene has been cloned from numerous microorganisms and from Drosophila melanogaster and C. elegans. We report here the identification of a human cDNA containing the coding region of the FGARAT mRNA and the isolation of a P1 clone that contains an intact human FGARAT gene. The P1 clone corrects the purine auxotrophy and protein deficiency of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutants (AdeB) deficient in both the activity and the protein for FGARAT. The P1 clone was used to regionally map the FGARAT gene to chromosome region 17p13, a location consistent with our prior assignment of this gene to chromosome 17. A comparison of the DNA sequence of the human FGARAT and FGARAT DNA sequence from 17 other organisms is reported. The isolation of this gene means that DNA clones for all the 10 steps of IMP synthesis have been isolated from humans or other mammals. 	Gene	D016428 D013485 D013487
1552943	19920319	Trembler mouse carries a point mutation in a myelin gene.	The autosomal dominant trembler mutation (Tr), maps to mouse chromosome 11 (ref. 2) and manifests as a Schwann-cell defect characterized by severe hypomyelination and continuing Schwann-cell proliferation throughout life. Affected animals move clumsily and develop tremor and transient seizures at a young age. We have recently described a potentially growth-regulating myelin protein, peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP-22; refs 7, 8), which is expressed by Schwann cells and found in peripheral myelin. We now report the assignment of the gene for PMP-22 to mouse chromosome 11. Cloning and sequencing of PMP-22 complementary DNAs from inbred Tr mice reveals a point mutation that substitutes an aspartic acid residue for a glycine in a putative membrane-associated domain of the PMP-22 protein. Our results identify the PMP-22 gene as a likely candidate for the mouse trembler locus and will encourage the search for mutations in the corresponding human gene in pedigrees with hypertrophic neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth and Dejerine-Sottas diseases (hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies I and III).

23424103	20130221	Mutations in the autoregulatory domain of ?-tubulin 4a cause hereditary dystonia.	Dystonia type 4 (DYT4) was first described in a large family from Heacham in Norfolk with an autosomal dominantly inherited whispering dysphonia, generalized dystonia, and a characteristic hobby horse ataxic gait. We carried out a genetic linkage analysis in the extended DYT4 family that spanned 7 generations from England and Australia, revealing a single LOD score peak of 6.33 on chromosome 19p13.12-13. Exome sequencing in 2 cousins identified a single cosegregating mutation (p.R2G) in the ?-tubulin 4a (TUBB4a) gene that was absent in a large number of controls. The mutation is highly conserved in the ?-tubulin autoregulatory MREI (methionine-arginine-glutamic acid-isoleucine) domain, highly expressed in the central nervous system, and extensive in vitro work has previously demonstrated that substitutions at residue 2, specifically R2G, disrupt the autoregulatory capability of the wild-type ?-tubulin peptide, affirming the role of the cytoskeleton in dystonia pathogenesis.

15952988	20050615	Mutation analysis of Wilson disease in the Spanish population -- identification of a prevalent substitution and eight novel mutations in the ATP7B gene.	Wilson disease (WD) is a copper metabolism disorder characterized by hepatic and/or neurological damage. More than 200 mutations in the ATP7B gene causing this autosomal recessive defect have been reported. In certain populations, a high prevalence of particular mutations allows rapid screening and diagnosis of the disease. We identified the ATP7B alterations in Spanish patients with WD. Mutations in the ATP7B gene were analysed in a total of 64 individuals from 40 different WD families by PCR amplification, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and sequencing. Twenty-one different ATP7B gene mutations were identified, eight of which were novel. 74% of the disease alleles were characterized among the 40 unrelated probands. We identified a prevalent mutation in our population (Met645Arg), present in 55% of this 40 patients. The frequency of the remaining ATP7B alterations was low. In addition, 17 different polymorphic variants were found. There is remarkable allele heterogeneity in WD in the Spanish population. Nevertheless, SSCP screening for the most frequent mutations in our population is feasible and leads to the detection of about 74% of the mutated chromosomes. Molecular diagnosis of WD is very useful in clinical practice to confirm or support clinical suspicion. 	Clin._Genet.	D016428 D013485
11514542	20010822	Interferon-kappa, a novel type I interferon expressed in human keratinocytes.	High throughput cDNA sequencing has led to the identification of interferon-kappa, a novel subclass of type I interferon that displays approximately 30% homology to other family members. Interferon-kappa consists of 207 amino acids, including a 27-amino acid signal peptide and a series of cysteines conserved in type I interferons. The gene encoding interferon-kappa is located on the short arm of chromosome 9 adjacent to the type I interferon gene cluster and is selectively expressed in epidermal keratinocytes. Expression of interferon-kappa is significantly enhanced in keratinocytes upon viral infection, upon exposure to double-stranded RNA, or upon treatment with either interferon-gamma or interferon-beta. Administration of interferon-kappa recombinant protein imparts cellular protection against viral infection in a species-specific manner. Interferon-kappa activates the interferon-stimulated response element signaling pathway and a panel of genes similar to those regulated by other type I interferons including anti-viral mediators and transcriptional regulators. An antibody that neutralizes the type I interferon receptor completely blocks interferon-kappa signaling, demonstrating that interferon-kappa utilizes the same receptor as other type I interferons. Interferon-kappa therefore defines a novel subclass of type I interferon that is expressed in keratinocytes and expands the repertoire of known proteins mediating host defense. 	J._Biol._Chem.

7482398	19950501	Identification of eight point mutations in protein S deficiency type I--analysis of 15 pedigrees.	We described molecular genetic studies of 15 patients with protein S deficiency type I (i.e. reduced total protein S antigen). All the exons of the PROS 1 gene were analyzed both by PCR and direct sequencing in all 15 probands. This analysis led to the identification of point mutations affecting eight individuals. One of these mutations (codon-25, insertion of T) has been described previously in a Dutch pedigree. The other mutations are novel and all are located in exons that code for the protein S domain that is homologous to the steroid hormone binding globulins. They include two amino acid replacements (one individual with 340 Gly--&gt; Val, and two individuals with 467 Val --&gt; Gly), and four frameshift mutations due to either one bp deletions (in codon 261 deletion of T and in codon 267 deletion of G) or insertions (in codon 565 insertion T and after codon 578 insertions of C). Studies performed in six families (totalling 43 subjects) showed cosegregation of the genetic abnormality with reduced plasma protein S levels, and provided genetic evidence for a heterozygous protein S deficiency in 25 of them. The yield of mutations in this study (53%) confirms that the percentage of protein S deficient cases in which a point mutation is found remains low. 	Thromb._Haemost.	D003160 D016428 D013485
12189494	20020822	SOX10 mutations in chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction suggest a complex physiopathological mechanism.	The type IV Waardenburg syndrome (WS4), also referred to as Shah-Waardenburg syndrome or Waardenburg-Hirschsprung disease, is characterised by the association of Waardenburg features (WS, depigmentation and deafness) and the absence of enteric ganglia in the distal part of the intestine (Hirschsprung disease). Mutations in the EDN3, EDNRB, and SOX10 genes have been reported in this syndrome. Recently, a new SOX10 mutation was observed in a girl with a neural crest disorder without evidence of depigmentation, but with severe constipation due to a chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and persistence of enteric ganglia. To refine the nosology of WS, we studied patients with typical WS4 (including Hirschsprung disease) or with WS and intestinal pseudo-obstruction. We found three SOX10 mutations, one EDNRB and one EDN3 mutations in patients presenting with the classical form of WS4, and two SOX10 mutations in patients displaying chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and WS features. These results show that chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction may be a manifestation associated with WS, and indicate that aganglionosis is not the only mechanism underlying the intestinal dysfunction of patients with SOX10 mutations.

10651487	20000129	Identification and molecular characterization of the new alpha-1-antitrypsin deficient allele PI Y barcelona (Asp256--&gt;Val and Pro391--&gt;His). Mutations in brief no. 174. Online.	To characterize the molecular basis of the &quot;new&quot; alpha1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT) deficient variant, PI Y barcelona, DNA sequence analysis of the coding exons of the alpha1AT gene was carried out using an amplification DNA technique and direct sequencing. The PI Y barcelona allele differs from the normal M1(Val213) allele sequence by two point substitutions: a transversion of GAT TO GTT in exon III in the codon for residue 256, resulting in the amino acid change of Asp256 to Val256, and a transversion of CCC to CAC in exon V in the codon for residue 391, resulting in the amino acid substitution of Pro391 to His391. On isoelectric focusing analysis these substitutions result in a cathodal migration of the &quot;new&quot; variant close to the PI Z. The index case, diagnosed with severe obstructive pulmonary disease, initially phenotyped a PI ZZ, was homozygous for PI Y barcelona. The patient's serum alpha1AT level was 16 mg/dL (normal values 115-220 mg/dL). Inheritance of the PI Y barcelona was confirmed by family study. Amino acid substitution in postion 391 occurs in the C-terminal peptide region, which shows a high degree of homology with the family of serpins. Pro391 is considered to have special relevance in the secretion of alpha1AT. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428
1570328	19920501	Enzymatic defect in &quot;X-linked&quot; sideroblastic anemia: molecular evidence for erythroid delta-aminolevulinate synthase deficiency.	Recently, the human gene encoding erythroid-specific delta-aminolevulinate synthase was localized to the chromosomal region Xp21-Xq21, identifying this gene as the logical candidate for the enzymatic defect causing &quot;X-linked&quot; sideroblastic anemia. To investigate this hypothesis, the 11 exonic coding regions of the delta-aminolevulinate synthase gene were amplified and sequenced from a 30-year-old Chinese male with a pyridoxine-responsive form of X-linked sideroblastic anemia. A single T----A transition was found in codon 471 in a highly conserved region of exon 9, resulting in an Ile----Asn substitution. This mutation interrupted contiguous hydrophobic residues and was predicted to transform a region of beta-sheet structure to a random-coil structure. Prokaryotic expression of the normal and mutant cDNAs revealed that the mutant construct expressed low levels of enzymatic activity that required higher concentrations of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to achieve maximal activation than did the normal enzyme. The amino acid substitution occurred in the exon containing the putative pyridoxal 5'-phosphate binding site and may account for the reduced ability of the cofactor to catalyze the formation of delta-aminolevulinic acid.

11705868	20011114	Altered subcellular localization of suppressin, a novel inhibitor of cell-cycle entry, is an independent prognostic factor in colorectal adenocarcinomas.	Suppressin (SPN), a novel inhibitor of the entry into the cell cycle, has properties of a tumor suppressor gene; however, its role in the development and progression of a human malignancy is not studied. Therefore, we evaluated the status of spn and its prognostic value in human colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC). Inhibition of cell proliferation by exogenous/extracellular SPN was assessed by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. The genetic status of spn in two colon cancer cell lines (LS180 and WiDr) and in a human CRC was determined using direct cDNA sequencing techniques. Phenotypic expression of SPN was evaluated in 105 CRC archival tissues using immunohistochemical methods. Univariate Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the prognostic significance of SPN expression. Exogenous SPN inhibited the proliferation of the LS180 cell line, which also has a mutation in one allele of the spn gene. The spn gene was also mutated in the primary CRC. Expression of SPN was primarily cytoplasmic in nonmucinous CRCs and nuclear in mucinous CRCs. However, the evaluation of 85 nonmucinous CRCs demonstrated that nuclear localization of SPN, nuclear accumulation of p53, and nodal status were independent prognostic indicators with hazard ratios of 2.34, 2.33, and 3.04, respectively. Nuclear localization of SPN plus nuclear accumulation of p53 formed a stronger prognostic indicator (hazard ratios = 5.45) than local nodal status. This is the first report of genetic alterations in the spn gene in a human malignancy and suggests that genetic alterations in spn and the resulting immunohistochemical phenotypes based on SPN subcellular localization in CRCs may be useful in determining prognosis of patients with subtypes of CRC.

9285413	19970801	TECK: a novel CC chemokine specifically expressed by thymic dendritic cells and potentially involved in T cell development.	A novel CC chemokine was identified in the thymus of mouse and human and was designated TECK (thymus-expressed chemokine). TECK has weak homology to other CC chemokines and maps to mouse chromosome 8. Besides the thymus, mRNA encoding TECK was detected at substantial levels in the small intestine and at low levels in the liver. The source of TECK in the thymus was determined to be thymic dendritic cells; in contrast, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells do not express TECK. The murine TECK recombinant protein showed chemotactic activity for activated macrophages, dendritic cells, and thymocytes. We conclude that TECK represents a novel thymic dendritic cell-specific CC chemokine that is possibly involved in T cell development. 	Immunity	D016428 D013485
11939812	20020410	Is the loose anagen hair syndrome a keratin disorder? A clinical and molecular study.	To report the clinical features of the loose anagen hair syndrome and to test the hypothesis that the typical gap between the hair and the inner root sheath may result from hereditary defects in the inner root sheath or the apposed companion layer. Case series. A pediatric dermatology unit (referral center). A consecutive sample of 17 children (13 girls). For 9 of them and their first-degree relatives, molecular analyses were performed in the K6HF gene with 50 appropriate controls. Minoxidil therapy (5% lotion) in 11 patients for 1 to 12 months. Clinical and follow-up features and determination of mutations in the K6HF gene. Most patients had easily pluckable hair with no sign of scalp inflammation or scarring. Ten patients seldom cut their hair, and 4 had unmanageable hair. One patient had hypodontia. Two patients had an additional clinical phenotype of diffuse partial woolly hair. The family history was positive for loose anagen hair syndrome in 5 patients. Marked improvement was noted after treatment with 5% minoxidil lotion in 7 of the 11 patients treated. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the gene segments encoding the alpha-helical 1A and 2B subdomains of K6hf, the type II cytokeratin exclusively expressed in the companion layer, was performed in 9 families. In 3 of these 9 families, a heterozygous glutamic acid and lysine mutation, E337K, was identified in the L2 linker region of K6HF. Diffuse partial woolly hair can be associated with loose anagen hair syndrome. A keratin mutation, E337K in K6HF, was possibly causative in 3 of the 9 families studied. Another keratin, and possibly the type I partner of K6hf, could be responsible for loose anagen hair syndrome in other patients, or the gene involved may be a minor gene. 	Arch_Dermatol	D016428
10208579	19990420	Early-onset Alzheimer's disease caused by a novel mutation at codon 219 of the presenilin-1 gene.	Mutations in the presenilin 1 (PS1) gene are responsible for approximately 50% of early onset autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease cases. A PCR based mutation detection method, chemical cleavage of mismatch, was used to detect a novel PS1 mutation in the coding sequence of the PS1 gene. Sequencing confirmed a T to C transition altering a leucine to proline at codon 219 of the PS1 gene. This is a novel mutation in exon 7 of the PS1 gene occurring outside the transmembrane regions of IV and V. 	Neuroreport	D002363 D016428
3828072	19861201	Human Ile-Ser-bradykinin, identical with rat T-kinin, is a major permeability factor in ovarian carcinoma ascites.	Ascites from patients with metastatic ovarian carcinoma contains high amounts of an activity that increases vascular permeability, as easily detected by a rat skin test. Ascites was fractionated by gel permeation and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographies. The fractions were analysed for permeability-increasing activity. In this way a peptide was isolated and identified as Ile-Ser-bradykinin by sequence and amino-acid analyses. It is identical with T-kinin which has previously been detected as a product of an acute-phase protein, T-kininogen, in rats but never in human material. The so far identified human kininogens, i.e. high- and low-molecular mass kininogens, can only release Met-Lys-bradykinin or its degradations products, as Ile-Ser-bradykinin is not a part of their structure. However, the present results provide evidence that the permeability factor Ile-Ser-bradykinin under certain conditions can be produced in considerable amounts also by human tissues.

8781426	19960901	Molecular basis of protein S deficiency in three families also showing independent inheritance of factor V leiden.	The molecular basis of type I or III Protein S deficiency has been investigated in three kindred also showing independent inheritance of factor V (FV) Leiden. A T to C transition in codon 570 (Met--&gt;Thr) was identified in the propositi and shown to segregate with protein S deficiency in all but one of the affected members of two kindred. This individual was heterozygous for a second transition (C to T) causing substitution of serine 624 by leucine. A second member of the same family, with markedly reduced free protein S levels when compared with affected relatives, was heterozygous for both mutations. Haplotype analysis of individuals with the mutated ATG570ACG allele in the two kindred suggested they may have been related by a common ancestor. A G to A transition resulting in substitution of cysteine 145 by tyrosine was detected in the third kindred. All mutations are believed to interfere with protein S binding to C4b-binding protein resulting in reduced free protein S levels. Of the five individuals studied who had experienced thrombotic events, three had combined protein S deficiency and FV Leiden reemphasising the importance of FV Leiden as an additional risk factor for thrombosis in protein S deficiency.

11145836	20010109	IL-1H, an interleukin 1-related protein that binds IL-18 receptor/IL-1Rrp.	IL-18, or IGIF (interferon-gamma inducing factor), is an IL-1-related, pro-inflammatory cytokine, which plays a pivotal role in systemic and local inflammation. We have identified and characterized IL-1H, a novel IL-1-related molecule. IL-1H appears to be expressed in most tissues with relatively high levels in testis, thymus and uterus. The IL-1H transcripts were stimulated by phorbol ester (PMA) in human cell lines (A431, THP-1 and KG-1) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (HPBMC) and dendritic cells (NHDC). The protein sequence of IL-1H is mostly related to IL-1ra with a similarity of 36%. A short form of IL-1H was identified, and lacks a 40-amino acid segment in the amino-terminal region of the protein. When expressed in mammalian cells, two secreted polypeptides of IL-1H were identified: an uncleaved and a cleaved form starting with amino acid Val-46. Furthermore, IL-1H binds the IL-18 receptor, but not the IL-1 receptor. These findings suggest that IL-1H may be another ligand for the IL-18 receptor and a new player in the inflammatory and immune responses mediated by the IL-18/IL-18R axis. 	Cytokine	D016428 D013487
15229130	20040702	The influence of genetic and cardiovascular risk factors on the CADASIL phenotype.	The clinical phenotype in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL), an autosomal dominant cerebral arteriopathy, is variable, but the reasons for this remain uncertain. Possible factors include the mutation site and the influence of additional modulating factors, which could include both epistatic interactions and interactions with cardiovascular risk factors known to cause sporadic small vessel disease. In a large prospectively recruited cohort of CADASIL subjects we determined relationships between phenotype and mutation site, the apoE genotype and cardiovascular risk factors. In addition to clinical features, disease severity was assessed by MRI lesion volume, measured both semiquantitatively (Scheltens scale) and quantitatively. One hundred and twenty-seven CADASIL cases from 65 families with 17 different mutations were studied. Site of mutation was not associated with the presence or age of onset of stroke, migraine, dementia, dependency or MRI lesion load. There was no evidence of intrafamilial clustering of particular phenotypes. Amongst subjects with stroke/transient ischaemic attack, smoking at the time of the event was independently associated with earlier age of onset (P = 0.01). There were no associations between age of onset or presence of stroke and other cardiovascular risk factors, including homocysteine. Homocysteine levels were higher in migraineurs [mean (SD) 12.8 (5.6) versus 9.8 (3.4) micromol/l, P = 0.02)] and elevated homocysteine was independently associated with an earlier age of onset of migraine (P = 0.01). No relationship was found between MRI lesion volume and risk factors, or between apoE genotype and phenotype. Our results show no notch 3 genotype-phenotype correlations. This implies that modulating factors influence phenotype. Smoking appears to increase the risk of stroke, while high homocysteine levels are associated with an increased risk of migraine.

7726158	19950501	Seven novel mutations in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene and genotype/phenotype correlations in severe methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency.	5-Methyltetrahydrofolate, the major form of folate in plasma, is a carbon donor for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. This form of folate is generated from 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate through the action of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a cytosolic flavoprotein. Patients with an autosomal recessive severe deficiency of MTHFR have homocystinuria and a wide range of neurological and vascular disturbances. We have recently described the isolation of a cDNA for MTHFR and the identification of two mutations in patients with severe MTHFR deficiency. We report here the characterization of seven novel mutations in this gene: six missense mutations and a 5' splice-site defect that activates a cryptic splice site in the coding sequence. We also present a preliminary analysis of the relationship between genotype and phenotype for all nine mutations identified thus far in this gene. A nonsense mutation and two missense mutations (proline to leucine and threonine to methionine) in the homozygous state are associated with extremely low activity (0%-3%) and onset of symptoms within the 1st year of age. Other missense mutations (arginine to cysteine and arginine to glutamine) are associated with higher enzyme activity and later onset of symptoms. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D003160 D016428 D013485
10899166	20000719	Identification and characterization of two neuromedin U receptors differentially expressed in peripheral tissues and the central nervous system.	Two structurally related, G-protein-coupled receptors were identified as receptors for the neuropeptide, neuromedin U. This peptide is found in highest levels in the gut and genitourinary system where it potently contracts smooth muscle but is also expressed in the spinal cord and discrete regions of the brain. Binding sites for neuromedin U have been characterized in rat uterus, however, little is known about the activity of this peptide in the regions of the central nervous system where it is expressed. The receptors characterized in this report are activated by neuromedin U at nanomolar potency in heterologous expression systems and bind radiolabeled neuromedin U with high affinity. Localization of the receptor RNA by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in a variety of human tissues shows distinct expression patterns for the two receptors. NMU1 is expressed predominantly in peripheral tissues, whereas NMU2 is more highly expressed in the central nervous system. Identification of neuromedin U receptor subtypes will greatly aid in the determination of the physiological roles of this peptide. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428
11452359	20010714	Two genes that map to the STSL locus cause sitosterolemia: genomic structure and spectrum of mutations involving sterolin-1 and sterolin-2, encoded by ABCG5 and ABCG8, respectively.	Sitosterolemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by (a) intestinal hyperabsorption of all sterols, including cholesterol and plant and shellfish sterols, and (b) impaired ability to excrete sterols into bile. Patients with this disease have expanded body pools of cholesterol and very elevated plasma plant-sterol species and frequently develop tendon and tuberous xanthomas, accelerated atherosclerosis, and premature coronary artery disease. In previous studies, we have mapped the STSL locus to human chromosome 2p21. Recently, we reported that a novel member of the ABC-transporter family, named &quot;sterolin-1&quot; and encoded by ABCG5, is mutated in 9 unrelated families with sitosterolemia; in the remaining 25 families, no mutations in sterolin-1 could be identified. We identified another ABC transporter, located &lt;400 bp upstream of sterolin-1, in the opposite orientation. Mutational analyses revealed that this highly homologous protein, termed &quot;sterolin-2&quot; and encoded by ABCG8, is mutated in the remaining pedigrees. Thus, two highly homologous genes, located in a head-to-head configuration on chromosome 2p21, are involved as causes of sitosterolemia. These studies indicate that both sterolin-1 and sterolin-2 are indispensable for the regulation of sterol absorption and excretion. Identification of sterolin-1 and sterolin-2 as critical players in the regulation of dietary-sterol absorption and excretion identifies a new pathway of sterol transport. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.

9174053	19970508	ALK, the chromosome 2 gene locus altered by the t(2;5) in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, encodes a novel neural receptor tyrosine kinase that is highly related to leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK)	Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) was originally identified as a member of the insulin receptor subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases that acquires transforming capability when truncated and fused to nucleophosmin (NPM) in the t(2;5) chromosomal rearrangement associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but further insights into its normal structure and function are lacking. Here, we characterize a full-length normal human ALK cDNA and its product, and determine the pattern of expression of its murine homologue in embryonic and adult tissues as a first step toward the functional assessment of the receptor. Analysis of the 6226 bp ALK cDNA identified an open reading frame encoding a 1620-amino acid (aa) protein of predicted mass approximately 177 kDa that is most closely related to leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK), the two exhibiting 57% aa identity and 71% similarity over their region of overlap. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the approximately 177 kDa ALK polypeptide core undergoes co-translational N-linked glycosylation, emerging in its mature form as a 200 kDa single chain receptor. Surface labeling studies indicated that the 200 kDa glycoprotein is exposed at the cell membrane, consistent with the prediction that ALK serves as the receptor for an unidentified ligand(s). In situ hybridization studies revealed Alk expression beginning on embryonic day 11 and persisting into the neonatal and adult periods of development. Alk transcripts were confined to the nervous system and included several thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei; the trigeminal, facial, and acoustic cranial ganglia; the anterior horns of the spinal cord in the region of the developing motor neurons; the sympathetic chain; and the ganglion cells of the gut. Thus, ALK is a novel orphan receptor tyrosine kinase that appears to play an important role in the normal development and function of the nervous system. 	Oncogene	D016428 D013485 D013487
20727516	20100824	Recessive mutations in the gene encoding the tight junction protein occludin cause band-like calcification with simplified gyration and polymicrogyria.	Band-like calcification with simplified gyration and polymicrogyria (BLC-PMG) is a rare autosomal-recessive neurological disorder showing highly characteristic clinical and neuroradiological features. Affected individuals demonstrate early-onset seizures, severe microcephaly, and developmental arrest with bilateral, symmetrical polymicrogyria (PMG) and a band of gray matter calcification on brain imaging; as such, the disorder can be considered as a &quot;pseudo-TORCH&quot; syndrome. By using autozygosity mapping and copy number analysis we identified intragenic deletions and mutations in OCLN in nine patients from six families with BLC-PMG. The OCLN gene encodes occludin, an integral component of tight junctions. Neuropathological analysis of an affected individual showed similarity to the mouse model of occludin deficiency with calcification predominantly associated with blood vessels. Both intracranial calcification and PMG are heterogeneous in etiology. Neuropathological and clinical studies of PMG have suggested that in utero ischemic or vascular insults may contribute to this common cortical abnormality. Tight junctions are functional in cerebral blood vessels early in fetal development and continue to play a vital role in maintenance of the blood-brain barrier during postnatal life. We provide evidence that the tight junction protein occludin (encoded by the OCLN gene) is involved in the pathogenesis of malformations of cortical development. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
21237447	20110118	De novo SYNGAP1 mutations in nonsyndromic intellectual disability and autism.	Little is known about the genetics of nonsyndromic intellectual disability (NSID). Recently, we reported de novo truncating mutations in the SYNGAP1 gene of 3 of 94 NSID cases, suggesting that its disruption represents a common cause of autosomal dominant NSID. To further explore the involvement of SYNGAP1 in NSID, we sequenced its exons and intronic boundaries in 60 additional sporadic cases of NSID, including 30 patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 9 with epilepsy, and in 380 control individuals. We identified de novo out-of-frame deletions in two patients with NSID and mild generalized epilepsy (c.2677delC/p.Q893RfsX184 and c.321_324delGAAG/p. K108VfsX25) and a de novo splicing mutation (c.2294 + 1G&gt;A), which results in the creation of a premature stop codon, in a patient with NSID and autism. No splicing or truncating mutations were found in control subjects. We provide evidence that truncating mutations in SYNGAP1 are common in NSID and can be also associated with autism.

22004070	20111019	Phenotypic and mutation spectrums of Thai patients with isovaleric acidemia.	Isovaleric acidemia (IVA) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD). Clinical features include vomiting, lethargy, metabolic acidosis, and &quot;sweaty feet&quot; odor. The pathognomonic metabolite, isovalerylglycine, is detected on urine organic acid analysis. Clinical diagnosis of IVA can be confirmed on mutation analysis of the IVD gene. The cases of five unrelated Thai patients with IVA, identified on urine organic acid analysis, are described. Mutation analysis of the IVD gene was performed using polymerase chain reaction sequencing of the entire coding regions. Four out of the five IVA patients had an acute neonatal form. The hematologic abnormalities were common and thus could be presenting symptoms in the absence of metabolic acidosis. As for the neurological outcome, only one patient had normal intelligence. Mutation analysis of the IVD gene identified the mutations c.457-3_2CA&gt;GG, c.1199A&gt;G (p.Y371C), c.281C&gt;G (p.A65G), c.358G&gt;A (p.G91R), and c.827T&gt;C (p.L247P). The poor outcome in most patients might be explained by the delayed diagnosis and initial unavailability of the metabolic formulas and medications in Thailand. The c.457-3_2CA&gt;GG mutation was identified in all of the present patients. This suggests that it is the most common mutation in the Thai population. Therefore, it could be a founder mutation in Thai subjects. One of the present Thai IVA patients also had the p.Y371C mutation, which is common in Han Chinese subjects. In addition, two novel mutations, p.A65G and p.L247P, were identified. The present study provides additional knowledge on the genotype-phenotype of IVA, suggesting that IVD mutations in Asian populations are distinct from these in Western populations.

9159737	19970501	6-Pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase deficiency with generalized dystonia and diurnal fluctuation of symptoms: a clinical and molecular study.	We report the case of a 44-year-old woman with a partial 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase (6-PTS) deficiency, whose predominant clinical symptom was generalized dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation. Dystonia was present in the eyelids, oromandibular region, trunk, and extremities (Meige syndrome plus double hemiplegia-like dystonia). A marked and sustained positive response to levodopa was observed. A molecular genetic study revealed a homozygous mutation (I114V) in the 6-PTS gene. This study indicates that genetic abnormality in the 6-PTS gene may be a hereditary dystonia disorder. We speculate that our patient has residual 6-PTS activity in the central nervous system, such as in the liver, and we suggest that residual, but insufficient production of tetrahydrobiopterin may play an important role in causing diurnal fluctuation of symptoms.

10909849	20000726	Identification of novel USH2A mutations: implications for the structure of USH2A protein.	Usher syndrome type II is an autosomal recessive disorder, characterised by stable hearing impairment from childhood and progressive retinitis pigmentosa from the late teens. Mutations in the USH2A gene, located on 1q41, were recently shown to be responsible for Usher syndrome type IIa. We have investigated the molecular pathology of Usher type II by screening the USH2A gene for mutations in 31 unrelated patients from Denmark and Norway. Besides the frequent 2299delG mutation, which accounted for 44% of the disease alleles, a heterogeneous spectrum of mutations was identified. Sixteen new, putative disease-causing mutations were detected, of which 12 were private and four were shared by unrelated patients. The disease-causing mutations were scattered throughout the gene and included six nonsense and seven missense mutations, two deletions and one small insertion. In addition, six non-pathogenic polymorphisms were identified. All missense mutations resulted in major amino acid side-chain alterations. Four missense mutations affected the N-terminal part of USH2A, whereas three missense mutations affected the laminin-type epidermal growth factor-like (LE) domain. The structural consequences of the mutations affecting the LE domain are discussed in relation to the three-dimensional structure of a LE-module of the mouse laminin gamma1 chain.

1502149	19920815	Apolipoprotein AI mutation Arg-60 causes autosomal dominant amyloidosis.	A mutation in the gene for apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) was identified in an English family with autosomal dominant non-neuropathic systemic amyloidosis. The plasma of all affected individuals contained a variant apoAI with one additional charge, as well as normal apoAI. The propositus was heterozygous; the coding region of his apoAI gene contained both the normal sequence and a single-base substitution changing the codon for residue 60 of the mature protein from CTG (leucine) to CGG (arginine). Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization showed that the other affected individuals were also heterozygotes and that there was concordance of the mutant allele with the presence of variant plasma apoAI. Amyloid fibrils isolated from the spleen of the propositus consisted of proteins that ran as a doublet with an apparent mass of approximately 10 kDa in SDS/PAGE and a trace band at 28 kDa. Electrospray mass spectrometry of the purified 10-kDa material revealed components with mass corresponding to the N-terminal 88, 92, 93, and 94 residues of apoAI each with substitution of arginine for leucine. These observations were confirmed by direct protein sequencing and laser desorption time-of-flight mass analysis. No material with the normal apoAI sequence was detected. The trace band at 28 kDa yielded the N-terminal sequence of mature apoAI, indicating that intact or minimally degraded apoAI was also present in the fibril preparation. Discovery of this mutation and the detailed characterization of the apoAI fragments that form the amyloid fibrils open additional avenues for investigation of amyloidogenesis.

20647552	20100722	Identification of an unusual variant peroxisome biogenesis disorder caused by mutations in the PEX16 gene.	Zellweger syndrome spectrum disorders are caused by mutations in any of at least 12 different PEX genes. This includes PEX16, which encodes an integral peroxisomal membrane protein involved in peroxisomal membrane assembly. PEX16-defective patients have been reported to have a severe clinical presentation. Fibroblasts from these patients displayed a defect in the import of peroxisomal matrix and membrane proteins, resulting in a total absence of peroxisomal remnants. To report on six patients with an unexpected mild variant peroxisome biogenesis disorder due to mutations in the PEX16 gene. Patients presented in the preschool years with progressive spastic paraparesis and ataxia (with a characteristic pattern of progressive leucodystrophy and brain atrophy on MRI scan) and later developed cataracts and peripheral neuropathy. Surprisingly, their fibroblasts showed enlarged, import-competent peroxisomes. Plasma analysis revealed biochemical abnormalities suggesting a peroxisomal disorder. Biochemical variables in fibroblasts were only mildly abnormal or within the normal range. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed the presence of import-competent peroxisomes, which were increased in size but reduced in number. Subsequent sequencing of all known PEX genes revealed five novel apparent homozygous mutations in the PEX16 gene. An unusual variant peroxisome biogenesis disorder caused by mutations in the PEX16 gene, with a relatively mild clinical phenotype and an unexpected phenotype in fibroblasts, was identified. Although PEX16 is involved in peroxisomal membrane assembly, PEX16 defects can present with enlarged import-competent peroxisomes in fibroblasts. This is important for future diagnostics of patients with a peroxisomal disorder. 	J._Med._Genet.	D002363 D016428 D013485
12111371	20020712	Clinical variant of Tangier disease in Japan: mutation of the ABCA1 gene in hypoalphalipoproteinemia with corneal lipidosis.	Despite progress in molecular characterization, specific diagnoses of disorders belonging to a group of inherited hypoalphalipoproteinemias, i.e., apolipoprotein AI deficiency, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency, Tangier disease (TD), and familial high-density lipoprotein (HDL) deficiency, remain difficult on a purely clinical basis. Several TD patients were recently found to be homozygous for mutations in the ABCA1 gene. We have documented here a clinical variant of TD in a Japanese patient who manifested corneal lipidosis and premature coronary artery disease as well as an almost complete absence of HDL-cholesterol, by identifying a novel homozygous ABCA1 mutation (R1680W). We propose that patients with apparently isolated HDL deficiency who are found to carry ABCA1 mutations may in fact belong to a category of TD patients whose phenotypic features are only partially expressed, and that a number of hidden clinical variants of TD might exist among other HDL deficiency patients who have escaped correct clinical diagnosis.

15474306	20041012	Human transcription factor Sp3: genomic structure, identification of a processed pseudogene, and transcript analysis.	The human transcription factor Sp3 has been widely studied at the translational level and has been described as a regulatory factor for a number of genes. Sp3 is currently characterized as a bifunctional transcription factor having the ability to behave as both an activator and/or a repressor in various promoter regions. Previous translational studies have attempted to determine the basis for these diverse functions with mostly contradictory evidence to date. Little data are available, however, concerning genomic structure, full-length cDNA, potential transcript variants, or location of translation initiation sites for the large isoform of the Sp3 gene. In this study, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequencing, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), genomic PCR, and database mining indicate that the Sp3 gene encompasses seven exons spanning more than 55 kb of genomic DNA on Chromosome 2. The 5' end of this sequence contains a large CpG island. This work also detected a processed pseudogene, psiSp3, located on Chromosome 13, spanning approximately 4.0 kb. Northern blot analysis detected three predominant transcripts at 4.0, 6.0 and 2.5 kb. Sequence analysis indicated that alternative splicing of exon 3 allows for multiple transcripts of Sp3. Each sequenced transcript possesses three to five potential translation initiation sites. This diversity at the level of gene expression will likely be key to understanding the diverse functions of Sp3. 	Gene	D016428 D013485 D013487
18175805	20080108	Murine and human autotaxin alpha, beta, and gamma isoforms: gene organization, tissue distribution, and biochemical characterization.	Autotaxin is a type II ectonucleotide pyrophosphate phosphodiesterase enzyme. It has been recently discovered that it also has a lysophospholipase D activity. This enzyme probably provides most of the extracellular lysophosphatidic acid from lysophosphatidylcholine. The cloning and tissue distribution of the three isoforms (imaginatively called alpha, beta, and gamma) from human and mouse are reported in this study, as well as their tissue distribution by PCR in the human and mouse. The fate of the alpha isoform from human was also studied after purification and using mass spectrometry. Indeed, this particular isoform expresses the intron 12 in which a cleavage site is present, leading to a rapid catabolism of the isoform. For the human isoform gamma and the total autotaxin mRNA expression, quantitative PCR is presented in 21 tissues. The isoforms were expressed in two different hosts, insect cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells, and were highly purified. The characteristics of the six purified isoforms (pH and temperature dependence, K(m) and V(max) values, and their dependence on metal ions) are presented in this study.

10634633	20000114	A new Leu253Arg mutation in the RP2 gene in a Japanese family with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa.	To identify the clinical findings in a Japanese family with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa associated with mutation in codon 253 (Leu253Arg) in the RP2 gene. Case reports included clinical features and results of fluorescein angiography, electroretinogram, kinetic visual field testing, and DNA analysis. Two affected hemizygotes with retinitis pigmentosa associated with transversion mutations in codon 253 (Leu253Arg) of the RP2 gene and the obligate carriers were examined. A novel Leu253Arg mutation of the RP2 gene was found to cosegregate with retinal degeneration in two affected males and two carriers in female heterozygote in a Japanese family. The ophthalmic findings in hemizygote showed severe retinal degeneration. In the obligate carrier, mild chorioretinal degeneration was observed in both eyes but a tapetal-like reflex of the fundus was not apparent. The mutation at codon 253 of the RP2 gene is the first mutation reported in a Japanese family. It is concluded that the mutation of the RP2 gene also causes the X-linked retinitis pigmentosa in Japanese patients. 	Invest._Ophthalmol._Vis._Sci.	D002363 D016428 D013485
20529581	20100610	A novel point mutation in CD18 causing leukocyte adhesion deficiency in a Chinese patient.	Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 (LAD-1) is a rare, autosomal recessive inherited immunodeficiency disease characterized by recurrent severe bacterial infection, impaired pus formation, poor wound healing, associated with the mutation in the CD18 gene responsible for the ability of the leucocytes to migrate from the blood stream towards the site of inflammation. Correct and early diagnosis of LAD-1 is vital to the success of treatment and prevention of aggressive infections. The purpose of this study was to collect the clinical findings of the disease and to identify the genetic entity. CD18 expression in the peripheral blood leukocytes from the patient, his parents and normal control was measured with flow cytometry. The entire coding regions of the CD18 gene were screened with direct sequencing genomic DNA. CD18 expression level on this patient's leukocyte surface was significantly decreased, with normal level in control group, his father and mother. Gene analysis revealed that this patient had a homozygous c.899A &gt; T missense mutation in exon 8 of CD18 gene, causing the substitution of Asp to Val at the 300 amino acid. His parents were both heterozygous carriers while no such mutation was found in 50 normal controls. This study disclosed a novel point mutation Asp 300 Val located in a highly conserved region (HCR) of CD18 and confirmed the heterogeneity of the mutations causing LAD-1, indicating it was quite beneficial to establish correct and early diagnosis in children with severe LAD-1.

15319474	20040821	Polymorphisms of cardiac presynaptic alpha2C adrenergic receptors: Diverse intragenic variability with haplotype-specific functional effects.	The presynaptic alpha2C adrenergic receptors (AR) act to inhibit norepinephrine release in cardiac and other presynaptic nerves. We have recently shown that a genetic variant in the alpha2CAR coding region (Del322-325), which renders the receptor partially uncoupled from Gi, is a risk factor for heart failure. However, variability of heart failure phenotypes and a dominance of Del322-325 in those of African descent led us to hypothesize that other regions of this gene have functional polymorphisms. In a multiethnic population, we found 20 polymorphisms within 4,625 bp of contiguous sequence of this intronless gene encompassing the promoter, 5' UTR, coding, and 3' UTR. These polymorphisms occur in 24 distinct haplotypes with complex organizations, including multiple 5'-upstream polymorphisms in regions known to direct expression, a 3' UTR substitution polymorphism within an insertion/deletion sequence, and the radical coding polymorphism that deletes four amino acids. Relatively low linkage disequilibrium between many polymorphisms, few cosmopolitan haplotypes, prevalent ethnic-specific haplotypes, and substantial genetic divergence among haplotypes was noted. The dysfunctional Del322-325 allele was partitioned into multiple haplotypes, with frequencies of 48% to 2%. The functional implications of the haplotypes were ascertained by whole-gene transfections of human neuronal cells, where haplotype was significantly related (P &lt; 0.001) to expression levels of receptor transcript and protein. Expression varied by as much as approximately 50% by haplotype, and such studies enabled haplotype clustering by phenotypic, rather than genotypic, similarities. Thus, depending on phenotype, expression-specific haplotypes may amplify, attenuate, or dominate the cardiomyopathic effect attributed to the alpha2CDel322-325 marker. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.

10875937	20000706	Interleukin (IL)-22, a novel human cytokine that signals through the interferon receptor-related proteins CRF2-4 and IL-22R.	We report the identification of a novel human cytokine, distantly related to interleukin (IL)-10, which we term IL-22. IL-22 is produced by activated T cells. IL-22 is a ligand for CRF2-4, a member of the class II cytokine receptor family. No high affinity ligand has yet been reported for this receptor, although it has been reported to serve as a second component in IL-10 signaling. A new member of the interferon receptor family, which we term IL-22R, functions as a second component together with CRF2-4 to enable IL-22 signaling. IL-22 does not bind the IL-10R. Cell lines were identified that respond to IL-22 by activation of STATs 1, 3, and 5, but were unresponsive to IL-10. In contrast to IL-10, IL-22 does not inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines by monocytes in response to LPS nor does it impact IL-10 function on monocytes, but it has modest inhibitory effects on IL-4 production from Th2 T cells.

8533800	19950828	Mutations in PAX3 that cause Waardenburg syndrome type I: ten new mutations and review of the literature.	Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, dystopia canthorum, and pigmentary disturbances, and it represents the most common form of inherited deafness in infants. WS type I is characterized by the presence of dystopia canthorum, while individuals with WS type II have normally-located canthi. WS type III is similar to WS type I but is also characterized by musculoskeletal abnormalities. Defects in the PAX3 gene, a transcription factor expressed during embryonic development, have been shown to cause WS types I and III in several families. In contrast, mutations in PAX3 do not cause WS type II, and linkage of the disease to other chromosomal regions has been demonstrated. We describe 10 additional mutations in the PAX3 gene in families with WS type I. Eight of these mutations are in the region of PAX3, where only one mutation has been previously described. These mutations, together with those previously reported, cover essentially the entire PAX3 gene and represent a wide spectrum of mutations that can cause WS type I. Thus far, all but one of the mutations are private; only one mutation has been reported in two apparently unrelated families. Our analysis thus far demonstrates little correlation between genotype and phenotype; deletions of the entire PAX3 gene result in phenotypes indistinguishable from those associated with single-base substitutions in the paired domain or homeodomain of PAX3. Moreover, two similar mutations in close proximity can result in significantly different phenotypes, WS type I in one family and WS type III in another. 	Am._J._Med._Genet.	D016428 D013487 D016454
16401742	20060113	Association of novel POLG mutations and multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions with variable clinical phenotypes in a Spanish population.	Both dominant and recessive mutations were reported in the gene encoding the mitochondrial (mt) DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) in patients with progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). Phenotypes other than PEO were recently documented in patients with mutations in the POLG gene. To screen patients with mitochondrial disease and multiple mtDNA deletions in muscle for mutations in the coding regions of the POLG, PEO1, and SLC25A4 genes. To identify the underlying molecular defect in a group of patients with multiple mtDNA deletions comparing their molecular genetic findings with those of healthy controls. Twenty-four patients (16 men and 8 women) diagnosed with mitochondrial disease and having multiple mtDNA deletions in muscle by Southern blot analysis. Thirteen patients had PEO; 2 had PEO alone, 4 had PEO and myopathy, and 5 had PEO and multisystem involvement. Four patients had multisystem disease without PEO. The remaining 9 patients had isolated myopathy. DNA from 100 healthy individuals was also studied. No mutation was identified in the PEO1 or SLC25A4 genes. Nine POLG mutations were observed in 6 of 24 patients. Four novel mutations were detected and mapped in the linker region (M603L) and in the pol domain of the enzyme (R853W; D1184N; R1146C). Five patients with PEO had mutations: 2 were compound heterozygotes, 1 was homozygous, and another showed a mutation in a single allele. The remaining patient also showed a sole mutation and had an unusual phenotype lacking ocular involvement. POLG molecular defects were found in 25% of our patients with multiple mtDNA deletions and mitochondrial disease. The uncommon phenotype found in 1 of these patients stresses the clinical variability of patients harboring POLG mutations. Molecular studies in the POLG gene should be addressed in patients with mitochondrial disease, particularly in those with PEO, and multiple mtDNA deletions. 	Arch._Neurol.	D003160 D016428 D013485
8504306	19930401	Mutations in the X-linked E1 alpha subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase leading to deficiency of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.	Human PDH complex deficiency is an extremely heterogeneous disease in its presentation and clinical course. In an investigation at the level of the gene into ten cases of PDH complex (E1) deficiency, we found that all had mutations in the coding sequence of the X-linked E1 alpha gene while the E1 beta coding sequence was normal. Six of these patients (three males, three females) had missense mutations resulting in a changed amino acid residue in the E1 alpha subunit at positions amino acid 148 (in two siblings), 170, 202, 234 and 263 of the mature protein. Two of the females had one normal E1 alpha gene and one with a deletion at the sites of tandem repeats of AGTAAGA and TAT respectively. The two remaining females also had one normal E1 alpha gene and one with an insertion. Both insertions, one of 2 bp and one of 4 bp, occurred in DNA hotspots normally associated with deletions. Only two of these ten mutations have been reported in other patients previously. In the five cases (including the two siblings) where parent DNA was available, only in one case could the same mutation be found in the patient as well as the maternal genomic DNA. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.

23582646	20130416	A de novo mutation in the ?-tubulin gene TUBB4A results in the leukoencephalopathy hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum.	Hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (H-ABC) is a rare hereditary leukoencephalopathy that was originally identified by MRI pattern analysis, and it has thus far defied all attempts at identifying the causal mutation. Only 22 cases are published in the literature to date. We performed exome sequencing on five family trios, two family quartets, and three single probands, which revealed that all eleven H-ABC-diagnosed individuals carry the same de novo single-nucleotide TUBB4A mutation resulting in nonsynonymous change p.Asp249Asn. Detailed investigation of one of the family quartets with the singular finding of an H-ABC-affected sibling pair revealed maternal mosaicism for the mutation, suggesting that rare de novo mutations that are initially phenotypically neutral in a mosaic individual can be disease causing in the subsequent generation. Modeling of TUBB4A shows that the mutation creates a nonsynonymous change at a highly conserved asparagine that sits at the intradimer interface of ?-tubulin and ?-tubulin, and this change might affect tubulin dimerization, microtubule polymerization, or microtubule stability. Consistent with H-ABC's clinical presentation, TUBB4A is highly expressed in neurons, and a recent report has shown that an N-terminal alteration is associated with a heritable dystonia. Together, these data demonstrate that a single de novo mutation in TUBB4A results in H-ABC. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D052061 D052060 D013485
3814146	19870130	Primary structure of human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) deduced from cDNA sequence.	The cDNAs corresponding to the mRNA encoding a polypeptide which is immunoreactive with the antisera specific to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (1) are cloned. The amino acid sequences deduced from the nucleotide sequences of the cDNAs show that it is synthesized as a precursor with a signal peptide followed by 668 amino acids of the putative mature CEA peptide, whose N-terminal 24 amino acids and amino acids 286 to 295 exactly coincide with those known for N-terminal sequences of CEA (2) and NFA-1 (3), respectively. The first 108 N-terminal residues are followed by three very homologous repetitive domains of 178 residues each and then by 26 mostly hydrophobic residues which probably comprise a membrane anchor. Each repetitive domains contains 4 cysteines at precisely the same positions and as many as 28 possible N-glycosylation sites are found in the CEA peptide region agreeing with high carbohydrate content of purified CEA.

9590180	19980520	Nibrin, a novel DNA double-strand break repair protein, is mutated in Nijmegen breakage syndrome.	Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is an autosomal recessive chromosomal instability syndrome characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation, immunodeficiency, and cancer predisposition. Cells from NBS patients are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation with cytogenetic features indistinguishable from ataxia telangiectasia. We describe the positional cloning of a gene encoding a novel protein, nibrin. It contains two modules found in cell cycle checkpoint proteins, a forkhead-associated domain adjacent to a breast cancer carboxy-terminal domain. A truncating 5 bp deletion was identified in the majority of NBS patients, carrying a conserved marker haplotype. Five further truncating mutations were identified in patients with other distinct haplotypes. The domains found in nibrin and the NBS phenotype suggest that this disorder is caused by defective responses to DNA double-strand breaks. 	Cell	D016428 D013485 D013487
11744994	20011218	Characterization of a novel receptor mutation A--&gt;T at exon 4 in complete androgen insensitivity syndrome and a carrier sibling via bidirectional polymorphism sequence analysis.	The complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a sub-type of X-linked male pseudohermaphroditism resulting from total dysfunction of the androgen receptor. Affected patients are phenotypically female despite a 46,XY genotype; gonadal tissue displays a classic Sertoli cell-only pattern on microscopic examination. We describe the diagnosis and management of a 19(1/2)-year-old patient who presented for primary amenorrhea and absent cervix, identified incidentally during a routine Pap test. Serum total testosterone was elevated (725 ng/dl) and the karyotype was 46,XY. Molecular investigation for specific gene defect(s) causing disruption and functional incapacity of the androgen receptor was undertaken for the proband and her only sibling. From this we discovered a previously unknown hemizygous mutation (A--&gt;T) in exon 4 of the androgen receptor gene, associated with replacement of asparagine (AAT) with tyrosine (TAT) in the resultant androgen receptor protein [N705Y]. Bidirectional, non-isotopic sequence analysis of exon 4 was next undertaken for the proband's sister who was found to be heterozygous for this mutation. Psychological and genetic counseling was provided to both individuals; the patient underwent an outpatient laparoscopic orchiectomy without complication. She continues to receive oral hormone replacement therapy following an oral contraceptive model. In this report, the clinical approach to AIS is outlined from a reproductive endocrinology perspective with special emphasis on psychological counseling and laboratory methods employed to confirm the diagnosis at the molecular level. We also outline other recently described mutations of the androgen receptor gene (Xq11-12) which have been associated with AIS. 	Int._J._Mol._Med.	D002363 D016428

9671272	19980722	Arginine 302 mutations in the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1alpha subunit gene: identification of further patients and in vitro demonstration of pathogenicity.	Three further patients with mutations in the codon for arginine 302 of the E1alpha subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex have been identified. Mutations in this codon have now been found in nine patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency in seven unrelated families, in sharp contrast to the great majority of other PDH E1alpha mutations which have been described in single individuals only. Because of the relatively high frequency of this mutation and because very few PDH E1alpha mutations have been demonstrated to be causative, we have established a system for analysing the consequences of defined mutations using transfection of normal and mutant PDH E1alpha cDNA into transformed human fibroblasts which have no endogenous E1alpha mRNA or protein. Using this test system, we have demonstrated that the R302C mutation results in the production of PDH E1alpha protein which is devoid of enzymic activity. 	Hum._Mutat.	D002363 D016428 D013485
10196478	19990410	Molecular cloning and characterization of two sets of alpha-theta genes in the rat alpha-like globin gene cluster.	The highly heterogeneous rat hemoglobin system was investigated at the gene level. Two regions of the alpha-like globin gene cluster from a Wistar rat were isolated. Four lambda Dash recombinant clones carrying rat alpha-like globin genes were localized on two distinct gene regions. A region of approximately 16kb was found to contain the 5'-IIalpha1-psi theta 1-3' loci, and another of approximately 24kb the 5'-IIalpha2-psi theta2-psiI alpha3-3' loci. Both IIalpha1 and IIalpha2 are considered to be active, coding the IIalpha-globin chain. The nt sequences of IIalpha1 and IIalpha2 are identical except for six nt in the non-coding region. The psiI alpha3 locus is a truncated pseudogene. The putative promoter region of an alpha-like globin gene is joined directly to the third exon, homologous to that of Ialpha-globin cDNA. psi theta1 and psi theta2 are also pseudogenes, as evidenced by several deletions located in the protein-coding regions of these loci. The psi theta1 and psi theta2 loci exhibit extensive homology, but the restriction maps of these genes and their flanking regions differ considerably. Genomic Southern blot analyses of the total liver DNA from six rats showed the existence of three theta-globin-related genes, including psi theta1 and psi theta2. These results indicate that the two gene regions investigated are not allelic variants, but may be generated by block duplication. This is the first report of the existence of rodent theta-globin genes. 	Gene	D016428 D013485

9833759	19981202	Excess of hMLH1 germline mutations in Swiss families with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer.	Lynch syndrome, or hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), is a consequence of a dominantly inherited susceptibility to accumulate somatic mutations. The disorder is manifested as a familial aggregation of colorectal cancers diagnosed at an early age and, to a lesser degree, of cancers of the endometrium, ovary, urinary tract, and organs of the gastrointestinal tract other than the colon. In more than half of the HNPCC families investigated, the cancer predisposition has been linked to germline mutations in one of the 2 genes hMLHI or hMSH2, involved in post-replicative DNA-mismatch repair. Twenty-four Swiss families affected with colorectal cancer were screened for germline mutations in these 2 genes, and pathogenic mutations were identified in over 70% of the families fulfilling the Amsterdam criteria (AC), but in only 10% of the families not completely fulfilling these criteria. One of the reported mutations, discovered in an extended HNPCC kindred from the Swiss Alps, is shown to be a founding mutation. Unexpectedly, all the mutations identified are in the hMLHI gene, where all but one are novel sequence alterations. Our data suggest that an unusually high proportion of Swiss HNPCC patients may harbour a germline mutation in the hMLHI gene. 	Int._J._Cancer	D016428 D013485
1628625	19920701	Primary structure and binding activity of the hnRNP U protein: binding RNA through RGG box.	Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are thought to influence the structure of hnRNA and participate in the processing of hnRNA to mRNA. The hnRNP U protein is an abundant nucleoplasmic phosphoprotein that is the largest of the major hnRNP proteins (120 kDa by SDS-PAGE). HnRNP U binds pre-mRNA in vivo and binds both RNA and ssDNA in vitro. Here we describe the cloning and sequencing of a cDNA encoding the hnRNP U protein, the determination of its amino acid sequence and the delineation of a region in this protein that confers RNA binding. The predicted amino acid sequence of hnRNP U contains 806 amino acids (88,939 Daltons), and shows no extensive homology to any known proteins. The N-terminus is rich in acidic residues and the C-terminus is glycine-rich. In addition, a glutamine-rich stretch, a putative NTP binding site and a putative nuclear localization signal are present. It could not be defined from the sequence what segment of the protein confers its RNA binding activity. We identified an RNA binding activity within the C-terminal glycine-rich 112 amino acids. This region, designated U protein glycine-rich RNA binding region (U-gly), can by itself bind RNA. Furthermore, fusion of U-gly to a heterologous bacterial protein (maltose binding protein) converts this fusion protein into an RNA binding protein. A 26 amino acid peptide within U-gly is necessary for the RNA binding activity of the U protein. Interestingly, this peptide contains a cluster of RGG repeats with characteristic spacing and this motif is found also in several other RNA binding proteins. We have termed this region the RGG box and propose that it is an RNA binding motif and a predictor of RNA binding activity. 	EMBO_J.	D016428 D013485 D013487
1409606	19921001	Precursor structure, expression, and tissue distribution of human guanylin.	Heat-stable enterotoxins (STa) are small, cysteine-rich peptides secreted by Escherichia coli that are able to induce diarrhea through the stimulation of an intestine-specific receptor-guanylyl cyclase known as STaR. A 15-amino acid peptide, guanylin, was recently purified from rat jejunum and proposed to be a potential endogenous activator of this receptor. We describe here the cloning and characterization of human and mouse cDNAs encoding precursor proteins of 115 and 116 amino acids, respectively, having guanylin present at their C termini. Expression of the human cDNA in mammalian cells leads to the secretion of proguanylin, an inactive 94-amino acid protein. Guanylin generated by either trypsin or acid treatment of proguanylin was purified and found to bind to, and activate, STaR. Northern blot and in situ hybridization show high-level expression of guanylin mRNA restricted to the intestine, with localization to Paneth cells at the base of the small intestinal crypts. These results demonstrate that guanylin is an endogenous activator of STaR. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D003160 D016428 D013485
19854834	20091027	Transcriptional regulation of membrane lipid homeostasis in Escherichia coli.	The biophysical properties of membrane phospholipids are controlled by the composition of their constituent fatty acids and are tightly regulated in Escherichia coli. The FabR (fatty acid biosynthesis repressor) transcriptional repressor controls the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in the membrane by regulating the expression of the fabB (beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I) and fabA (beta-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP dehydratase/isomerase) genes. FabR binding to a DNA palindrome located within the promoters of the fabB and fabA genes required the presence of an unsaturated acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) or acyl-CoA and was antagonized by saturated acyl-ACP or acyl-CoA. The FabR-dependent repression of fabB and fabA by exogenous unsaturated fatty acids confirmed the role for FabR in responding to the acyl-CoA pool composition, and the perturbation of the unsaturated:saturated acyl-ACP ratio using a specific inhibitor of lipid A formation verified FabR-dependent regulation of fabB by the acyl-ACP composition in vivo. Thus, FabR plays a key role in controlling the membrane biophysical properties by regulating gene expression in response to the composition of the long-chain acyl-thioester pool. This mechanism ensures that a balanced composition of fatty acids is available for incorporation into the membrane via the PlsB/PlsC acyltransferases. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D052061 D013485
8863157	19960801	PAX genes and human neural tube defects: an amino acid substitution in PAX1 in a patient with spina bifida.	From studies in the mouse and from the clinical and molecular analysis of patients with type 1 Waardenburg syndrome, particular members of the PAX gene family are suspected factors in the aetiology of human neural tube defects (NTD). To investigate the role of PAX1, PAX3, PAX7, and PAX9, allelic association studies were performed in 79 sporadic and 38 familial NTD patients from the Dutch population. Sequence variation was studied by SSC analysis of the paired domain regions of the PAX1, PAX7, and PAX9 genes and of the complete PAX3 gene. In one patient with spina bifida, a mutation in the PAX1 gene was detected changing the conserved amino acid Gln to His at position 42 in the paired domain of the protein. The mutation was inherited through the maternal line from the unaffected grandmother and was not detected in 300 controls. In the PAX3 gene, variation was detected at several sites including a Thr/Lys amino acid substitution in exon 6. All alleles were present among patients and controls in about the same frequencies. However, an increased frequency of the rare allele of a silent polymorphism in exon 2 was found in NTD patients, but no significant association was observed (p = 0.06). No sequence variation was observed in the paired domain of the PAX7 and PAX9 genes. Our findings so far do not support a major role of the PAX genes examined in the aetiology of NTD. However, the detection of a mutation in PAX1 suggests that, in principle, this gene can act as a risk factor for human NTD. 	J._Med._Genet.	D016428 D013485 D013487
1707164	19910211	Human tenascin: primary structure, pre-mRNA splicing patterns and localization of the epitopes recognized by two monoclonal antibodies.	By sequencing cDNA clones which cover the complete coding region of human tenascin (TN), we have established its primary structure. This confirms that, as in the case of chicken, TN is mainly made up of three groups of sequences with a high homology to Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) fibronectin (FN) type III repeat and fibrinogen. Furthermore, we have determined the amino-terminal sequence of the mature peptide directly on purified TN. The main differences with respect to the chicken TN molecule are that in the human there are 14 and half EGF-like repeats compared to 13 and half in the chicken and that, as previously reported, there are 15 FN-like repeats compared to 11 in the chicken. By Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification we have also studied the different splicing patterns of the TN pre-mRNA in cultured cells. The results show the presence of at least four different isoforms containing different numbers of FN-like type III repeats. Using purified human TN as immunogen, we have obtained numerous monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) to TN. By screening a human melanoma cDNA library in the expression vector lambda gt11 with these Mabs and subsequently sequencing the insert of the positive clones, we have been able to localize, within the TN molecule, the epitopes recognized by two of these Mabs: BC-4, which recognizes an epitope within the EGF-like sequence and BC-2 which recognizes an epitope within the FN like type III repeats whose expression is regulated by alternative splicing of the TN pre-mRNA. Thus, while the Mab BC-4 may be useful in studies on TN distribution (since it recognizes all different TN isoforms) BC-2 may be useful in the study of the expression of particular TN isoforms generated by the alternative splicing of the TN primary transcript.

14970684	20040219	Identification of a novel ovine PrP polymorphism and scrapie-resistant genotypes for St. Croix White and a related composite breed.	Susceptibility to scrapie is primarily controlled by polymorphisms in the ovine prion protein gene (PRNP). Here, we report a novel ovine exon three PRNP polymorphism (SNP G346C; P116), its association with the ovine ARQ allele (P116A136R154Q171), and two new genotypes (PARQ/ARR; PARQ/ARQ) for the St. Croix White (SCW) breed and a related composite (CMP) breed developed for meat production. The (P116) polymorphism occurs between the N-terminal cleavage site and the hydrophobic region of the ovine prion protein, a region which exhibits extreme conservation across mammalian taxa. The relatively high frequency (0.75) of resistant ARR alleles and the absence of ARQ alleles for the SCW ewes used as breeding stock for CMP resulted in significant genic differentiation (P = 0.0123; S.E. = 0.00113). Additionally, the majority of the SCW (66.7%) and CMP (65.4%) sampled possessed genotypes considered resistant or nearly resistant to scrapie and experimental BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

Waardenburg syndrome (WS; deafness with pigmentary abnormalities) and Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR; aganglionic megacolon) are congenital disorders caused by defective function of the embryonic neural crest. WS and HSCR are associated in patients with Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (WS4), whose symptoms are reminiscent of the white coat-spotting and aganglionic megacolon displayed by the mouse mutants Dom (Dominant megacolon), piebald-lethal (sl) and lethal spotting (ls). The sl and ls phenotypes are caused by mutations in the genes encoding the Endothelin-B receptor (Ednrb) and Endothelin 3 (Edn3), respectively. The identification of Sox10 as the gene mutated in Dom mice (B.H. et al., manuscript submitted) prompted us to analyse the role of its human homologue SOX10 in neural crest defects. Here we show that patients from four families with WS4 have mutations in SOX10, whereas no mutation could be detected in patients with HSCR alone. These mutations are likely to result in haploinsufficiency of the SOX10 product. Our findings further define the locus heterogeneity of Waardenburg-Hirschsprung syndromes, and point to an essential role of SOX10 in the development of two neural crest-derived human cell lineages.

12270937	20020925	Role of TRAF3 and -6 in the activation of the NF-kappa B and JNK pathways by X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor.	X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor (XEDAR) is a recently isolated member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family that has been shown to be highly expressed in ectodermal derivatives during embryonic development and binds to ectodysplasin-A2 (EDA-A2). By using a subclone of 293F cells with stable expression of XEDAR, we report that XEDAR activates the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways in an EDA-A2-dependent fashion. Treatment with EDA-A2 leads to the recruitment of TRAF3 and -6 to the aggregated XEDAR complex, suggesting a central role of these adaptors in the proximal aspect of XEDAR signaling. Whereas TRAF3 and -6, IKK1/IKKalpha, IKK2/IKKbeta, and NEMO/IKKgamma are involved in XEDAR-induced NF-kappaB activation, XEDAR-induced JNK activation seems to be mediated via a pathway dependent on TRAF3, TRAF6, and ASK1. Deletion and point mutagenesis studies delineate two distinct regions in the cytoplasmic domain of XEDAR, which are involved in binding to TRAF3 and -6, respectively, and play a major role in the activation of the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways. Taken together, our results establish a major role of TRAF3 and -6 in XEDAR signaling and in the process of ectodermal differentiation. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485 D013486 D013487
26493561	20151024	Identification of novel mutations by targeted exome sequencing and the genotype-phenotype assessment of patients with achromatopsia.	Achromatopsia (ACHM) is a severe congenital autosomal recessive retinal disorder caused by loss of cone photoreceptors. Here, we aimed to determine the underlying genetic lesions and phenotypic correlations in two Chinese families with ACHM. Medical history and clinical evaluation were obtained from both families. Targeted exome sequencing (TES) was performed on 201 disease-causing genes of inherited retinal dystrophies to screen for ACHM causative mutations in the two probands. The compound heterozygous mutations in CNGA3 (c.1074G &gt; A, p.W358X; c.1706G &gt; A, p.R569H) were identified in the first proband, and a novel homozygous mutation (c.968C &gt; A, p.A323D) was detected in the other pedigree. The proposed topological model of the CNGA3 polypeptide suggested that the missense mutations primarily affected the transmembrane helix 5 and the cGMP-binding domain, respectively. Crystal structure modeling of the cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel ?-3 (CNGA3) protein encoded by the CNGA3 gene revealed an abnormal combined structure generated by R569H. We firstly used the TES approach to identify genetic alterations in patients with ACHM. We uncovered three mutations in CNGA3, including one novel mutation. Our results not only expand the genotypic spectrum for CNGA3 mutations, but also demonstrate that the TES approach is a valuable tool for molecular diagnosis. 	J_Transl_Med	D016428 D013485
9603735	19980620	Correction of deafness in shaker-2 mice by an unconventional myosin in a BAC transgene.	The shaker-2 mouse mutation, the homolog of human DFNB3, causes deafness and circling behavior. A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene from the shaker-2 critical region corrected the vestibular defects, deafness, and inner ear morphology of shaker-2 mice. An unconventional myosin gene, Myo15, was discovered by DNA sequencing of this BAC. Shaker-2 mice were found to have an amino acid substitution at a highly conserved position within the motor domain of this myosin. Auditory hair cells of shaker-2 mice have very short stereocilia and a long actin-containing protrusion extending from their basal end. This histopathology suggests that Myo15 is necessary for actin organization in the hair cells of the cochlea. 	Science	D016428 D013487
22190405	20111223	Germline mutations in the oncogene EZH2 cause Weaver syndrome and increased human height.	The biological processes controlling human growth are diverse, complex and poorly understood. Genetic factors are important and human height has been shown to be a highly polygenic trait to which common and rare genetic variation contributes. Weaver syndrome is a human overgrowth condition characterised by tall stature, dysmorphic facial features, learning disability and variable additional features. We performed exome sequencing in four individuals with Weaver syndrome, identifying a mutation in the histone methyltransferase, EZH2, in each case. Sequencing of EZH2 in additional individuals with overgrowth identified a further 15 mutations. The EZH2 mutation spectrum in Weaver syndrome shows considerable overlap with the inactivating somatic EZH2 mutations recently reported in myeloid malignancies. Our data establish EZH2 mutations as the cause of Weaver syndrome and provide further links between histone modifications and regulation of human growth. 	Oncotarget	D016428 D013485
21835308	20110813	Exome sequencing reveals a homozygous SYT14 mutation in adult-onset, autosomal-recessive spinocerebellar ataxia with psychomotor retardation.	Autosomal-recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCAs) are clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders associated with diverse neurological and nonneurological features that occur before the age of 20. Currently, mutations in more than 20 genes have been identified, but approximately half of the ARCA patients remain genetically unresolved. In this report, we describe a Japanese family in which two siblings have slow progression of a type of ARCA with psychomotor retardation. Using whole-exome sequencing combined with homozygosity mapping, we identified a homozygous missense mutation in SYT14, encoding synaptotagmin XIV (SYT14). Expression analysis of the mRNA of SYT14 by a TaqMan assay confirmed that SYT14 mRNA was highly expressed in human fetal and adult brain tissue as well as in the mouse brain (especially in the cerebellum). In an in vitro overexpression system, the mutant SYT14 showed intracellular localization different from that of the wild-type. An immunohistochemical analysis clearly showed that SYT14 is specifically localized to Purkinje cells of the cerebellum in humans and mice. Synaptotagmins are associated with exocytosis of secretory vesicles (including synaptic vesicles), indicating that the alteration of the membrane-trafficking machinery by the SYT14 mutation may represent a distinct pathomechanism associated with human neurodegenerative disorders.

14566338	20031021	Positional cloning of a novel gene influencing asthma from chromosome 2q14.	Asthma is a common disease in children and young adults. Four separate reports have linked asthma and related phenotypes to an ill-defined interval between 2q14 and 2q32 (refs. 1-4), and two mouse genome screens have linked bronchial hyper-responsiveness to the region homologous to 2q14 (refs. 5,6). We found and replicated association between asthma and the D2S308 microsatellite, 800 kb distal to the IL1 cluster on 2q14. We sequenced the surrounding region and constructed a comprehensive, high-density, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) linkage disequilibrium (LD) map. SNP association was limited to the initial exons of a solitary gene of 3.6 kb (DPP10), which extends over 1 Mb of genomic DNA. DPP10 encodes a homolog of dipeptidyl peptidases (DPPs) that cleave terminal dipeptides from cytokines and chemokines, and it presents a potential new target for asthma therapy. 	Nat._Genet.

9856504	19981218	Functional characterisation of mutations in the ligand-binding domain of the androgen receptor gene in patients with androgen insensitivity syndrome.	Five mutations in the ligand-binding domain of the androgen receptor gene were identified in patients with complete (A765T, C784Y, R831X and M895T) or partial (R840G) androgen insensitivity. A765T and R831X have been reported previously whereas the other three mutations are novel. Receptors carrying these mutations were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells, and androgen binding and capacity to transactivate an androgen-responsive reporter gene were assayed. C784Y led to abolished androgen binding and transactivating capacity, R840G and M895T showed reduced specific binding and partial transactivation. The in vitro functions of the R840G and M895T mutants were improved with supraphysiological concentrations of steroid. 	Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
11967008	20020423	A complete mutation screen of the ADPKD genes by DHPLC.	Genetic analysis is a useful diagnostic tool in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), especially when imaging results are equivocal. However, molecular diagnostics by direct mutation screening has proved difficult in this disorder due to genetic and allelic heterogeneity and complexity of the major locus, PKD1. A protocol was developed to specifically amplify the exons of PKD1 and PKD2 from genomic DNA as 150 to 450 bp amplicons. These fragments were analyzed by the technique of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) using a Wave Fragment Analysis System (Transgenomics) to detect base-pair changes throughout both genes. DHPLC-detected changes were characterized by sequencing. Cost effective and sensitive mutation screening of the entire coding regions of PKD1 and PKD2 by DHPLC was optimized. All base-pair mutations to these genes that we previously characterized were detected as an altered DHPLC profile. To assess this method for routine diagnostic use, samples from a cohort of 45 genetically uncharacterized ADPKD patients were analyzed. Twenty-nine definite mutations were detected, 26 PKD1, 3 PKD2 and a further five possible missense mutations were characterized leading to a maximal detection rate of 76%. A high level of polymorphism of PKD1 also was detected, with 71 different changes defined. The reproducibility of the DHPLC profile enabled the recognition of many common polymorphisms without the necessity for re-sequencing. DHPLC has been demonstrated to be an efficient and effective means for gene-based molecular diagnosis of ADPKD. Differentiating missense mutations and polymorphisms remains a challenge, but family-based segregation analysis is helpful. 	Kidney_Int.	D016428 D013485 D013487
9734640	19980912	Double heterozygosity of the GPIIb gene in a Swiss patient with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia.	Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (GT) results from a qualitative or quantitative defect of GPIIb-IIIa complexes (integrin alphaIIbbeta3). the fibrinogen receptor on platelets. This integrin plays a critical role in platelet aggregation. In this report we describe the molecular abnormalities of a patient with clinical and laboratory findings typical of type I Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. SDS-PAGE with Western blotting revealed an absence of GPIIb but small amounts of normally migrating GPIIIa in his platelets. A non-radioactive PCR-SSCP procedure and direct sequence analysis of PCR-amplified DNA fragments showed the patient to be a compound heterozygote for mutations in the GPIIb gene. A single point mutation (G to A) at nucleotide 1064 of the cDNA derived from the mother's allele led to a Glu324 to Lys amino acid substitution in GPIIb. It was responsible for a MscI restriction site in exon 12 of the GPIIb gene. This amino acid substitution changes the electric charge between the second and third Ca++-binding domains of GPIIb. The second mutation was inherited from his father and is in exon 18 of the GPIIb gene. It was a T --&gt; C base transition at position 1787 of GPIIb cDNA and results in a Ile565 to Thr substitution. The two GPIIb mutations identified in this study will provide new information on GPIIb-IIIa structure and biosynthesis. 	Br._J._Haematol.	D002363 D016428 D013485
1718978	19911115	Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome). An intermediate clinical phenotype caused by substitution of valine for glycine at position 137 of arylsulfatase B.	The Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type VI) is a lysosomal storage disease with autosomal recessive inheritance caused by deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase B. Severe, intermediate, and mild forms of the disease have been described. The molecular correlate of the clinical heterogeneity is not known at present. To identify the molecular defect in a patient with the intermediate form of the disease, arylsulfatase B mRNA from his fibroblasts was reverse-transcribed, amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, and subcloned. Three point mutations were detected by DNA sequence analysis, two of which, a silent A to G transition at nucleotide 1191 and a G to A transition at nucleotide 1126 resulting in a methionine for valine 376 substitution, were polymorphisms. A G to T transversion at nucleotide 410 causing a valine for glycine 137 substitution (G137V) was identified as the mutation underlying the Maroteaux-Lamy phenotype of the patient, who was homozygous for the allele. The kinetic parameters of the mutant arylsulfatase B enzyme toward a radiolabeled trisaccharide substrate were normal excluding an alteration of the active site. The G137V mutation did not affect the synthesis but severely reduced the stability of the arylsulfatase B precursor. While the wild type precursor is converted by limited proteolysis in late endosomes or lysosomes to a mature form, the majority of the mutant precursor was degraded presumably in a compartment proximal to the trans Golgi network and only a small amount escaped to the lysosomes accounting for the low residual enzyme activity in fibroblasts of a patient with the juvenile form of the disease.

7989588	19941201	The characterization of gene mutations for human glucose phosphate isomerase deficiency associated with chronic hemolytic anemia.	DNA was isolated from four unrelated glucose phosphate isomerase-deficient patients. Seven new mutations in the coding region were found: 247 C--&gt;T, 671 C--&gt;T, 818 G--&gt;A, 833 C--&gt;T, 1039 C--&gt;T, 1459 C--&gt;T, and 1483 G--&gt;A. Three patients were compound heterozygotes, and one patient was a homozygote of 247 C--&gt;T/247 C--&gt;T. Six mutations were found to involve highly conserved amino acids of glucose phosphate isomerase, suggesting that these residues are crucial for the maintenance of biological activity. Two polymorphic sites were also identified, 489 A--&gt;G and 1356 G--&gt;C, which do not produce a change in the amino acid sequence. 	J._Clin._Invest.	D002363 D003160 D016428 D013485 D013487
9829912	19981126	Germline mutation profile of the VHL gene in von Hippel-Lindau disease and in sporadic hemangioblastoma.	von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a dominantly inherited disorder predisposing those afflicted to hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system and the retina, renal cell carcinomas, pheochromocytomas, and pancreatic tumors. The disease has been associated with mutations of the VHL gene. The screening of 92 unrelated patients with VHL disease for point mutations in this gene revealed 61 DNA variants. In addition, a search for EcoR1 rearrangements revealed germline anomalies in 5 patients. The 61 variants could be subdivided in 20 mutations predicted to alter the open reading frame (8 nonsense mutations, 8 frame shift mutations, and 4 mutations in consensus splicing sites) and 43 DNA sequence variants of a priori unknown biological consequence (4 in-frame insertions or deletions, 36 missense mutations, and 3 apparently silent variations). The 3' end of the coding sequence of the VHL gene, which encodes the Elongin binding domain was the site of 5 of 20 truncating mutations (25%) and of 18 of 41 DNA variants (44%) causing uncertain functional impairment. A similar screening in 18 patients with sporadic hemangioblastoma revealed 2 missense DNA variants. In order to corroborate this latter observation, a systematic screening for germline alteration of the VHL gene might be performed in a larger series of sporadic hemangioblastoma. If this preliminary result is confirmed, more than 10% of sporadic hemangioblastoma might be related to a mild VHL disease, thus a follow-up program similar to that recommended in cases of VHL disease should probably be discussed in the corresponding families.

10649492	20000129	Sequence variants of DLC1 in colorectal and ovarian tumours.	Loss of heterozygosity occurs frequently on the short arm of chromosome 8 in many neoplasms, including colorectal and ovarian cancer. Monochromosome transfer experiments into colorectal tumour cell lines have provided functional evidence for a tumour suppressor gene located at 8p22-23. One of the genes from this region that is expressed by our suppressed hybrids is a candidate tumour suppressor gene, DLC1 (deleted in liver cancer), which has homology to rat RhoGAP. We have delineated the structure of the DLC1 gene and used single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP) to look for sequence variants in 126 colorectal and 33 ovarian primary tumours and cell lines. One exonic missense mutation and three intronic insertions/deletions were identified in primary colorectal tumours, as well as many polymorphisms present in germline DNAs. The rarity of exonic missense mutations, and the absence of protein-truncating mutations, indicates that DLC1 is not the target of 8p LOH in colorectal or ovarian tumours. The delineation of the gene structure allows mutation analysis of DLC1 in other tumour types for which it remains a candidate tumour suppressor gene based on its location and homology to rhoGAP.

12915468	20030814	Digenic inheritance of mutations in HAMP and HFE results in different types of haemochromatosis.	Haemochromatosis (HH) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease caused by inappropriate iron absorption. Most HH patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. However, penetrance of the C282Y mutation is incomplete, and other genetic factors may well affect the HH phenotype. Ferroportin and TFR2 mutations also cause HH, and two HAMP mutations have recently been reported that causes juvenile haemochromatosis (JH) in the homozygous state. Here, we report evidence for digenic inheritance of HH. We have detected two new HAMP mutations in two different families, in which there is concordance between severity of iron overload and heterozygosity for HAMP mutations when present with the HFE C282Y mutation. In family A, the proband has a JH phenotype and is heterozygous for C282Y and a novel HAMP mutation Met50del IVS2+1(-G). This is a four nucleotide ATGG deletion which causes a frameshift. The proband's unaffected mother is also heterozygous for Met50del IVS2+1(-G), but lacks the C282Y mutation and is heterozygous for the HFE H63D mutation. Met50del IVS2+1(-G) was absent from 642 control chromosomes. In family B, a second novel, less severe HAMP mutation, G71D, was identified. This was detected in the general population at an allele frequency of 0.3%. We propose that the phenotype of C282Y heterozygotes and homozygotes may be modified by heterozygosity for mutations which disrupt the function of hepcidin in iron homeostasis, with the severity of iron overload corresponding to the severity of the HAMP mutation.

12187427	20020821	Infantile and childhood retinal blindness: a molecular perspective (The Franceschetti Lecture).	Much progress has been made in the past five years in the understanding of Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and allied early-onset retinal dystrophies, various forms of stationary sensory retinal blindness, and genes that are involved in the development of the retina. Uncomplicated Leber congenital amaurosis has been associated with mutations of six genes: GUCY2D (encoding RetGC-1) at 17p13.1, RPE65 at 1q31, CRX at 19q13.3, AIPLI at 17p13.1, CRB1 at 1q31-3, and RPGRIP at 14q11. A similar early-onset severe retinal degeneration phenotype has been associated with mutation of TULP1 at 6p21.3. Leber appreciated that the condition he described merged with the phenotypes of early childhood-onset severe retinal degenerations. This insight has been confirmed at the molecular level for mutations of GUCY2D, RPE65, CRX, AIPL1, and CRB1, which cause not only LCA, but also early-childhood and even adult-onset retinal degenerations. This paper reviews the new finding of LCA from mutations of CRB1 and discusses the molecular basis of X-linked blue monochromacy, autosomal recessive congenital achromatopsia from mutations of the genes for ACHM2 (CNGA3) and ACHM3 (CNGB3), X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) from mutations of CACNA1F (incomplete CSNB) and NYX (complete CSNB), and the enhanced S-cone syndrome from mutation of the developmental gene, NR2E3 at 15q23, which appears to regulate the development of M- and L-cones from S-cones. These discoveries have opened new areas of cellular and developmental biology for future research into the causes of retinal blindness. 	Ophthalmic_Genet.	D019531 D013485
11479737	20010802	Chimpanzee apolipoprotein H (beta2-glycoprotein I): report on the gene structure, a common polymorphism, and a high prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies.	Apolipoprotein H (apoH, protein; APOH, gene) is a 50-kDa glycoprotein that binds to negatively charged substrates, including phospholipids. ApoH is a main target antigen for the binding of antiphospholipid antibodies that are associated with thrombotic events. We have previously characterized the structural organization of the human APOH gene. Because of the significant structural homology between the human and chimpanzee genomes, we have employed oligonucleotides from the human APOH gene sequence to amplify chimpanzee DNA covering the entire transcribed region together with flanking sequence in the 5' region. As in humans, the chimpanzee APOH gene consists of eight exons and seven introns and encodes for a 326-amino-acid protein. The deduced amino acid and nucleotide sequence show 99.4% and 99.6% similarity between human and chimpanzee APOH, respectively. Using isoelectric focusing (IEF) and immunoblotting, we screened 155 chimpanzees (128 unrelated captured parents and 27 captive-born offspring) for the apoH protein polymorphism. The most common IEF pattern in chimpanzees was identical to a previously described APOH*3 allele in humans. In addition, an anodally shifted pattern was observed in chimpanzees with an allele frequency of 0.168, and the corresponding allele was designated as APOH*4. DNA sequencing of APOH*4 carriers revealed a missense mutation in exon 6 (A--&gt;G) at codon 210, which replaces the amino acid lysine by glutamic acid. This mutation does not affect the binding of apoH to cardiolipin as revealed by cardiolipin/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We also evaluated the prevalence of anti-apoH antibodies in chimpanzee plasma by using human-apoH-based ELISA and the association of the Lys210Glu mutation with the occurrence of anti-apoH antibodies. The prevalence of anti-apoH antibodies in chimpanzees (64%) was found to be unusually high compared with that found in humans. However, the Lys210Glu mutation showed no association with the occurrence of anti-apoH antibodies. The prevalence of anti-apoH antibodies in chimpanzees may serve as a useful animal model for the human antiphospholipid syndrome, where these antibodies are associated with clinical manifestations.

12207932	20020905	Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy: clinical phenotypes of four novel mutations in the MPZ and Cx 32 genes.	Charcot-Marie-Tooth Hereditary Neuropathy is a heterogeneous syndrome associated with mutations in several different genes including peripheral myelin protein 22, myelin P0, connexin 32, and early growth response 2. There is considerable variability in the phenotypic expression of this syndrome and the relationship of this variability to mutation genotypes requires extensive analysis. Here we describe the phenotypes and genotypes of four new mutations underlying the Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome and document segregation with disease. Four families with Charcot-Marie-Tooth were ascertained, examined, and evaluated electrophysiologically. Each family had peripheral blood DNA screened for mutations in myelin protein 22, myelin P0, and connexin 32. Two families were found with new mutations in the myelin P0 gene: S140T in the extracellular domain and K236del in the cytoplasmic domain. All families showed segregation of the mutations with the Charcot-Marie-Tooth phenotype as did a new family with the rare G163R mutation in the membrane domain. A 49-year-old man with the S140T mutation demonstrated conduction block on electrophysiological testing. A family with a novel S49P mutation in the connexin 32 gene had a neuropathy with very slow nerve conduction. These new mutations in the myelin P0 and connexin 32 genes help to clarify the pathophysiology of the clinical Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome. The S140T mutation in myelin P0 can be associated with conduction block and Charcot-Marie-Tooth should be part of the differential diagnosis of that phenomenon. Mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of myelin P0 can cause clinical neuropathy. The S49P mutation in the connexin 32 gene can produce aspects of a demyelinating type of X-linked hereditary neuropathy. 	Neuromuscul._Disord.	D016428 D013485
7604047	19950703	The GA5 locus of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a multifunctional gibberellin 20-oxidase: molecular cloning and functional expression.	The biosynthesis of gibberellins (GAs) after GA12-aldehyde involves a series of oxidative steps that lead to the formation of bioactive GAs. Previously, a cDNA clone encoding a GA 20-oxidase [gibberellin, 2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (20-hydroxylating, oxidizing), EC 1.14.11.-] was isolated by immunoscreening a cDNA library from liquid endosperm of pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima L.) with antibodies against partially purified GA 20-oxidase. Here, we report isolation of a genomic clone for GA 20-oxidase from a genomic library of the long-day species Arabidopsis thaliana Heynh., strain Columbia, by using the pumpkin cDNA clone as a heterologous probe. This genomic clone contains a GA 20-oxidase gene that consists of three exons and two introns. The three exons are 1131-bp long and encode 377 amino acid residues. A cDNA clone corresponding to the putative GA 20-oxidase genomic sequence was constructed with the reverse transcription-PCR method, and the identity of the cDNA clone was confirmed by analyzing the capability of the fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli to convert GA53 to GA44 and GA19 to GA20. The Arabidopsis GA 20-oxidase shares 55% identity and &gt; 80% similarity with the pumpkin GA 20-oxidase at the derived amino acid level. Both GA 20-oxidases share high homology with other 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2-ODDs), but the highest homology was found between the two GA 20-oxidases. Mapping results indicated tight linkage between the cloned GA 20-oxidase and the GA5 locus of Arabidopsis. The ga5 semidwarf mutant contains a G--&gt;A point mutation that inserts a translational stop codon in the protein-coding sequence, thus confirming that the GA5 locus encodes GA 20-oxidase. Expression of the GA5 gene in Ara-bidopsis leaves was enhanced after plants were transferred from short to long days; it was reduced by GA4 treatment, suggesting end-product repression in the GA biosynthetic pathway.

21976959	20111007	Mutational screening of VSX1, SPARC, SOD1, LOX, and TIMP3 in keratoconus.	To evaluate the involvement of Visual System Homeobox 1 (VSX1), Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC), Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1), Lysyl Oxidase (LOX), and Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) in sporadic and familial keratoconus. Mutational analysis of the five genes was performed by sequencing and fragment analysis in a large cohort of 302 Italian patients, with a diagnosis of keratoconus based on clinical examination and corneal topography. The variants identified in VSX1 and SPARC were also assessed in the available relatives of the probands. A novel mutation p.G239R and previously reported mutations were found in VSX1. Novel and already reported variants were identified in SPARC and SOD1, whose pathogenic significance has not been established. No pathogenic variants have been identified in LOX and TIMP3. Molecular analysis of the five genes in a cohort of 225 sporadic and 77 familial keratoconus cases confirms the possible pathogenic role of VSX1 though in a small number of patients; a possible involvement of LOX and TIMP3 could be excluded; and the role played by SOD1 and SPARC in determining the disease as not been definitively clarified. Further studies are required to identify other important genetic factors involved in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease that in the authors' opinion, and according with several authors, should be considered as a complex disease.

10835640	20000603	Mutations in the gene encoding the serine protease inhibitor, Kazal type 1 are associated with chronic pancreatitis.	Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a continuing or relapsing inflammatory disease of the pancreas. In approximately one-third of all cases, no aetiological factor can be found, and these patients are classified as having idiopathic disease. Pathophysiologically, autodigestion and inflammation may be caused by either increased proteolytic activity or decreased protease inhibition. Several studies have demonstrated mutations in the cationic trypsinogen gene (PRSS1) in patients with hereditary or idiopathic CP. It is thought that these mutations result in increased trypsin activity within the pancreatic parenchyma. Most patients with idiopathic or hereditary CP, however, do not have mutations in PRSS1 (ref. 4). Here we analysed 96 unrelated children and adolescents with CP for mutations in the gene encoding the serine protease inhibitor, Kazal type 1 (SPINK1), a pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. We found mutations in 23% of the patients. In 18 patients, 6 of whom were homozygous, we detected a missense mutation of codon 34 (N34S). We also found four other sequence variants. Our results indicate that mutations in SPINK1 are associated with chronic pancreatitis. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428
11150885	20010111	A novel arginine vasopressin-neurophysin II mutation causes autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus and morphologic pituitary changes.	To determine the genetic basis of autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (ADNDI) in a Cypriot family, we ascertained and studied a large, four-generation kindred in which all participating family members had arginine vasopressin-neurophysin II (AVP-NP-II) gene analyses done. A G to A transition was found by DNA sequence analysis at position 1773 (G1773A) of the AVP-NPII gene which is predicted to encode a substitution of tyrosine for cysteine in codon 59 (CYS59TYR). The mutation was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis of PCR amplification products that contain the corresponding segment of the AVP-NPII gene. To clarify the morphologic status of the pituitaries of family members, 12 affected and 3 nonaffected members had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. The bright spot of the posterior pituitary lobe was completely absent in 75% and faintly identified in 25% of the affected members who were examined with MRI. We conclude that (1) a novel G1773A transition in exon 2 of the AVP-NPII gene causes ADNDI in the large Cypriot kindred studied, (2) this mutation is predicted to encode a CYS59TYR substitution in NPII, and (3) MRI studies of the posterior pituitary lobes of affected family members show either a decreased intensity or a complete absence of the bright spot in all cases studied.

9073515	19970315	Human mitochondrial enoyl-CoA hydratase gene (ECHS1): structural organization and assignment to chromosome 10q26.2-q26.3.	The second step in mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation is catalyzed by short chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECHS1; EC 4.2.1.17). Inherited disorders of this pathway of energy metabolism present clinical and laboratory features resembling sudden infant death syndrome and Reye-like syndrome. To investigate the role of ECHS1 further, the gene structure was analyzed and its chromosomal locus determined. A fragment of rat liver ECHS1 cDNA was employed for isolation and characterization of two overlapping genomic clones encompassing the entire human ECHS1 gene. The gene, approximately 11 kb, is composed of eight exons, with exons I and VIII containing the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions, respectively. Two major transcription start sites, located 62 and 63 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon, were mapped by primer extension analysis. The immediate 5'-flanking region of the ECHS1 gene is GC-rich and contains several copies of the SP1 binding motive but no typical TATA or CAAT boxes are apparent. Alu repeat elements have been identified within the region -1052/-770 relative to the cap site and in intron 7. The human ECHS1 gene locus was assigned to chromosome 10q26.2-q26.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. 	Genomics	D016428 D013485 D013487
2783133	19890929	cDNA cloning demonstrates the expression of pregnancy-specific glycoprotein genes, a subgroup of the carcinoembryonic antigen gene family, in fetal liver.	The pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) genes constitute a subgroup of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family. Here we report the cloning of four cDNAs coding for different members of the PSG family from a human fetal liver cDNA library. They are derived from three closely related genes (PSG1, PSG4 and PSG6). Two of the cDNA clones represent splice variants of PSG1 (PSG1a, PSG1d) differing in their C-terminal domain and 3'-untranslated regions. All encoded proteins show the same domain arrangement (N-RA1-RA2-RB2-C). Transcripts of the genes PSG1 and PSG4 could be detected in placenta by hybridization with gene-specific oligonucleotides. Expression of cDNA in a mouse and monkey cell line shows that the glycosylated PSG1a protein has a Mr of 65-66 kD and is released from the transfected cells. Sequence comparisons in the C-terminal domain and the 3'-untranslated regions of CEA/PSG-like genes suggests a complex splicing pattern to exist for various gene family members and a common evolutionary origin of these regions.

9010228	19970109	Differential subcellular localization, expression and biological toxicity of BRCA1 and the splice variant BRCA1-delta11b.	The mechanism of BRCA1 tumor suppression in human breast and ovarian cells is the focus of intense investigation. In this report, full length BRCA1 (230 kDa) introduced into cells with CMV promoter constructs was nuclear when transgene expression was low whereas high expression resulted in cytoplasmic accumulation, aberrant nuclear and cell morphology. A nuclear localization signal (NLS) was mapped to BRCA1 amino acid positions 262-570. We describe a splice variant, BRCA1-delta11b, missing the majority of exon 11 including the NLS. Exogenous BRCA1-delta11b (110 kDa) was cytoplasmic and, unlike the full-length protein, overexpression of the protein encoded by the variant did not appear to be toxic. RNA probe titrations and RT-PCR demonstrated that BRCA1 and delta11b transcripts are coexpressed in a wide variety of cells and tissues. Interestingly, BRCA1-delta11b message was greatly reduced or absent in several breast and ovarian tumor lines relative to exon 11 transcripts and a delta9,10 splice variant. Taken together our results suggest that full-length BRCA1 and BRCA1-delta11b may have distinct roles in cell growth regulation and tumorigenesis. 	Oncogene	D016428 D013485 D013487
15290238	20040804	Genomic rearrangements at the IGHMBP2 gene locus in two patients with SMARD1.	Autosomal recessive spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) is caused by mutations in the immunoglobulin mu-binding protein 2 (IGHMBP2) gene. Patients affected by the infantile form of SMARD1 present with early onset respiratory distress. So far, patients with neither juvenile onset nor with larger deletions/rearrangements in IGHMBP2 have been reported. In this study, we investigated one patient with infantile (4 months) and another with juvenile (4.3 years) onset of respiratory distress. Direct sequencing of all exons and flanking intron sequences in both patients revealed a mutation on only one allele. In both patients, we identified genomic rearrangements of the other allele of IGHMBP2 by means of Southern blotting. Putative breakpoints were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction on genomic and cDNA. The patient with juvenile onset had an Alu/Alu mediated rearrangement, which resulted in the loss of aproximately 18.5 kb genomic DNA. At the mRNA level, this caused an in-frame deletion of exons 3-7. The patient with infantile onset had a complex rearrangement with two deletions and an inversion between intron 10 and 14. This rearrangement led to a frameshift at the mRNA level. Our results show that SMARD1 can be caused by genomic rearrangements at the IGHMBP2 gene locus. This may be missed by mere sequence analysis. Additionally, we demonstrate that juvenile onset SMARD1 may also be caused by mutations of IGHMBP2. The complex nature of the genomic rearrangement in the patient with infantile SMARD1 is discussed and a deletion mechanism is proposed. 	Hum._Genet.	D002363 D003160 D016428 D013485
9799604	19981104	Two isoforms of a human intersectin (ITSN) protein are produced by brain-specific alternative splicing in a stop codon.	Using selected trapped exons with homology to specific protein domains, we identified a new full-length cDNA encoding a protein containing many motifs for protein-protein interactions. There are two major mRNA transcripts, a ubiquitously expressed mRNA of 5.3 kb and a brain-specific transcript of approximately 15 kb, encoding proteins of 1220 and 1721 amino acids, respectively. The stop codon of the ORF of the shorter transcript is split between adjacent exons. In brain tissues the last exon of the short transcript is skipped, and an alternative downstream exon, the first of several additional, is used to produce the 15-kb mRNA. The putative human protein is highly homologous to Xenopus intersectin (81% identical) and to Drosophila dynamin-associated protein, Dap160 (31% identical) and was termed intersectin (ITSN). Both human proteins contain five SH3 (Src homology 3) domains, two EH (Eps15 homology) domains, and an alpha-helix-forming region. The brain-specific long transcript encodes for three additional domains: a GEF (guanine-nucleotide exchange factors), a PH (pleckstrin homology), and a C2 domain. The Drosophila homologue is associated with dynamin, a protein family involved in the endocytic pathway and/or synaptic vesicle recycling. The structure of the human ITSN protein is consistent with its involvement in membrane-associated molecular trafficking and signal transduction pathways. The human ITSN gene has been mapped to 21q22. 1-q22.2 between markers D21S319 and D21S65, and its importance in Down syndrome and monogenic disorders is currently unknown.

25808063	20150327	Mutations in LONP1, a mitochondrial matrix protease, cause CODAS syndrome.	Cerebral, ocular, dental, auricular, skeletal anomalies (CODAS) syndrome (MIM 600373) was first described and named by Shehib et al, in 1991 in a single patient. The anomalies referred to in the acronym are as follows: cerebral-developmental delay, ocular-cataracts, dental-aberrant cusp morphology and delayed eruption, auricular-malformations of the external ear, and skeletal-spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia. This distinctive constellation of anatomical findings should allow easy recognition but despite this only four apparently sporadic patients have been reported in the last 20 years indicating that the full phenotype is indeed very rare with perhaps milder or a typical presentations that are allelic but without sufficient phenotypic resemblance to permit clinical diagnosis. We performed exome sequencing in three patients (an isolated case and a brother and sister sib pair) with classical features of CODAS. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm results as well as for mutation discovery in a further four unrelated patients ascertained via their skeletal features. Compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations in LONP1 were found in all (8 separate mutations; 6 missense, 1 nonsense, 1 small in-frame deletion) thus establishing the genetic basis of CODAS and the pattern of inheritance (autosomal recessive). LONP1 encodes an enzyme of bacterial ancestry that participates in protein turnover within the mitochondrial matrix. The mutations cluster at the ATP-binding and proteolytic domains of the enzyme. Biallelic inheritance and clustering of mutations confirm dysfunction of LONP1 activity as the molecular basis of CODAS but the pathogenesis remains to be explored.

14974083	20040220	APECED-causing mutations in AIRE reveal the functional domains of the protein.	A defective form of the AIRE protein causes autoimmune destruction of target organs by disturbing the immunological tolerance of patients with a rare monogenic disease, autoimmune polyendocrinopathy (APE)-candidiasis (C)-ectodermal dystrophy (ED), APECED. Recently, experiments on knockout mice revealed that AIRE controls autoimmunity by regulating the transcription of peripheral tissue-restricted antigens in thymic medullary epithelial cells. Thus, AIRE provides a unique model for molecular studies of organ-specific autoimmunity. In order to analyze the molecular and cellular consequences of 16 disease-causing mutations in vitro, we studied the subcellular localization, transactivation capacity, homomultimerization, and complex formation of several mutant AIRE polypeptides. Most of the mutations altered the nucleus-cytoplasm distribution of AIRE and disturbed its association with nuclear dots and cytoplasmic filaments. While the PHD zinc fingers were necessary for the transactivation capacity of AIRE, other regions of AIRE also modulated this function. Consequently, most of the mutations decreased transactivation. The HSR domain was responsible for the homomultimerization activity of AIRE; all the missense mutations of the HSR and the SAND domains decreased this activity, but those in other domains did not. The AIRE protein was present in soluble high-molecular-weight complexes. Mutations in the HSR domain and deletion of PHD zinc fingers disturbed the formation of these complexes. In conclusion, we propose an in vitro model in which AIRE transactivates transcription through heteromeric molecular interactions that are regulated by homomultimerization and conditional localization of AIRE in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm.

12095985	20020704	Molecular cloning and characterization of STAMP1, a highly prostate-specific six transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in prostate cancer.	We have identified a novel gene, six transmembrane protein of prostate 1 (STAMP1), which is largely specific to prostate for expression and is predicted to code for a 490-amino acid six transmembrane protein. Using a form of STAMP1 labeled with green fluorescent protein in quantitative time-lapse and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, we show that STAMP1 is localized to the Golgi complex, predominantly to the trans-Golgi network, and to the plasma membrane. STAMP1 also localizes to vesicular tubular structures in the cytosol and colocalizes with the early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1), suggesting that it may be involved in the secretory/endocytic pathways. STAMP1 is highly expressed in the androgen-sensitive, androgen receptor-positive prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, but not in androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU145. Furthermore, STAMP1 expression is significantly lower in the androgen-dependent human prostate xenograft CWR22 compared with the relapsed derivative CWR22R, suggesting that its expression may be deregulated during prostate cancer progression. Consistent with this notion, in situ analysis of human prostate cancer specimens indicated that STAMP1 is expressed exclusively in the epithelial cells of the prostate and its expression is significantly increased in prostate tumors compared with normal glands. Taken together, these data suggest that STAMP1 may have an important role in the normal prostate cell as well as in prostate cancer progression. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
10206230	19990417	Association analysis between a Cys23Ser substitution polymorphism of the human 5-HT2c receptor gene and neuronal hyperexcitability.	Transgenic mice lacking a functional 5-HT2c receptor gene are extremely susceptible to audiogenic seizures, suggesting that 5-HT2c receptors mediate inhibition of neuronal network excitability. The present association study tested the hypothesis that a Cys23Ser substitution polymorphism within the human 5-HT2c receptor gene modulates neuronal excitability. Genotypes of the Cys23Ser polymorphism were assessed in 454 subjects of German descent, comprising: 1) 93 severely affected alcohol-dependent males with a history of alcohol withdrawal seizure or delirium, 2) 119 patients affected by an idiopathic generalized epilepsy, and 3) 242 controls. Both sexes were analyzed separately because of the X-chromosomal location of the 5-HT2c receptor gene. The allele frequencies of the Cys23Ser variants did not differ significantly between the controls and either the severely affected alcohol-dependent males (P = 0.34), or patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (P &gt; 0.57). Our results suggest that the common Cys23Ser substitution polymorphism of the human 5-HT2c receptor gene does not confer susceptibility to neuronal hyperexcitability in either idiopathic generalized epilepsy or alcohol withdrawal seizure or delirium.

19451530	20090520	SEPT9 gene sequencing analysis reveals recurrent mutations in hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy.	Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy (HNA) is an autosomal dominant disorder that manifests as recurrent, episodic, painful brachial neuropathies. A gene for HNA maps to chromosome 17q25.3 where mutations in SEPT9, encoding the septin-9 protein, have been identified. To determine the frequency and type of mutations in the SEPT9 gene in a new cohort of 42 unrelated HNA pedigrees. DNA sequencing of all exons and intron-exon boundaries for SEPT9 was carried out in an affected individual in each pedigree from our HNA cohort. Genotyping using microsatellite markers spanning the SEPT9 gene was also used to identify pedigrees with a previously reported founder haplotype. Two missense mutations were found: c.262C&gt;T (p.Arg88Trp) in seven HNA pedigrees and c.278C&gt;T (p.Ser93Phe) in one HNA pedigree. Sequencing of other known exons in SEPT9 detected no additional disease-associated mutations. A founder haplotype, without defined mutations in SEPT9, was present in seven pedigrees. We provide further evidence that mutation of the SEPT9 gene is the molecular basis of some cases of hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy (HNA). DNA sequencing of SEPT9 demonstrates a restricted set of mutations in this cohort of HNA pedigrees. Nonetheless, sequence analysis will have an important role in mutation detection in HNA. Additional techniques will be required to find SEPT9 mutations in an HNA founder haplotype and other pedigrees. 	Neurology	D016428 D052061 D013485
1826708	19910501	Cloning of the 1.4-kb mRNA species of human complement factor H reveals a novel member of the short consensus repeat family related to the carboxy terminal of the classical 150-kDa molecule.	Three factor H mRNA species of 4.3 kb, 1.8 kb, and 1.4 kb are constitutively expressed in human liver. Having previously characterized full-length cDNA clones derived from the 4.3-kb and 1.8-kb factor mRNA, we report here the isolation and eucaryotic expression of full-length cDNA clones coding for the 1.4-kb mRNA species. The 1266-bp cDNA codes for a polypeptide of 330 amino acids and contains two polyadenylation signals and a short poly(A)+tail. The protein is composed of a leader peptide followed by five short consensus repeat domains. It shows a hybrid structure with the last three domains being almost identical to the carboxy-terminal of the classical 150-kDa factor H molecule and the two first domains representing unique short consensus repeat structures. Eucaryotic expression in COS7 cells revealed two polypeptides derived from one cDNA clone that are also found in human serum. Differences between the cDNA clones within the last three domains indicate two distinct, possibly allelic sequences that, in addition, differ from the authentic 150-kDa factor H sequence. Southern blot results support the notion that the 4.3-kb factor H and the 1.4-kb factor H-related mRNA are transcribed from two separate but highly homologous genes. 	J._Immunol.	D016428 D013485
22634751	20120529	Mutations in the PCNA-binding domain of CDKN1C cause IMAGe syndrome.	IMAGe syndrome (intrauterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, adrenal hypoplasia congenita and genital anomalies) is an undergrowth developmental disorder with life-threatening consequences. An identity-by-descent analysis in a family with IMAGe syndrome identified a 17.2-Mb locus on chromosome 11p15 that segregated in the affected family members. Targeted exon array capture of the disease locus, followed by high-throughput genomic sequencing and validation by dideoxy sequencing, identified missense mutations in the imprinted gene CDKN1C (also known as P57KIP2) in two familial and four unrelated patients. A familial analysis showed an imprinted mode of inheritance in which only maternal transmission of the mutation resulted in IMAGe syndrome. CDKN1C inhibits cell-cycle progression, and we found that targeted expression of IMAGe-associated CDKN1C mutations in Drosophila caused severe eye growth defects compared to wild-type CDKN1C, suggesting a gain-of-function mechanism. All IMAGe-associated mutations clustered in the PCNA-binding domain of CDKN1C and resulted in loss of PCNA binding, distinguishing them from the mutations of CDKN1C that cause Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, an overgrowth syndrome.

13679851	20030919	Comparative studies of a new subfamily of human Ste20-like kinases: homodimerization, subcellular localization, and selective activation of MKK3 and p38.	The Sterile-20 or Ste20 family of serine/threonine kinases is a group of signaling molecules whose physiological roles within mammalian cells are just starting to be elucidated. Here, in this report we present the characterization of three human Ste20-like kinases with greater than 90% similarity within their catalytic domains that define a novel subfamily of Ste20s. Members of this kinase family include rat thousand and one (TAO1) and chicken KFC (kinase from chicken). For the lack of a consensus nomenclature in the literature, in this report, we shall call this family hKFC (for their homology to chicken KFC) and the three members hKFC-A, hKFC-B, and hKFC-C, respectively. These kinases have many similarities including an aminoterminal kinase domain, a serine-rich region, and a coiled-coil configuration within the C-terminus. All three kinases are able to activate the p38 MAP kinase pathway through the specific activation of the upstream MKK3 kinase. We also offer evidence, both theoretical and biochemical, showing that these kinases can undergo self-association. Despite these similarities, these kinases differ in tissue distribution, apparent subcellular localization, and feature structural differences largely within the carboxyl-terminal sequence.

21447600	20110331	Copy number variations on chromosome 12q14 in patients with normal tension glaucoma.	We report identification of a novel genetic locus (GLC1P) for normal tension glaucoma (NTG) on chromosome 12q14 using linkage studies of an African-American pedigree (maximum non-parametric linkage score = 19.7, max LOD score = 2.7). Subsequent comparative genomic hybridization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments identified a 780 kbp duplication within the GLC1P locus that is co-inherited with NTG in the pedigree. Real-time PCR studies showed that the genes within this duplication [TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1), XPOT, RASSF3 and GNS] are all expressed in the human retina. Cohorts of 478 glaucoma patients (including 152 NTG patients), 100 normal control subjects and 400 age-related macular degeneration patients were subsequently tested for copy number variation in GLC1P. Overlapping duplications were detected in 2 (1.3%) of the 152 NTG subjects, one of which had a strong family history of glaucoma. These duplications defined a 300 kbp critical region of GLC1P that spans two genes (TBK1 and XPOT). Microarray expression experiments and northern blot analysis using RNA obtained from human skin fibroblast cells showed that duplication of chromosome 12q14 results in increased TBK1 and GNS transcription. Finally, immunohistochemistry studies showed that TBK1 is expressed in the ganglion cells, nerve fiber layer and microvasculature of the human retina. Together, these data link the duplication of genes on chromosome 12q14 with familial NTG and suggest that an extra copy of the encompassed TBK1 gene is likely responsible for these cases of glaucoma. However, animal studies will be necessary to rule out a role for the other duplicated or neighboring genes. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013485
11007980	20000929	MECP2 mutation in male patients with non-specific X-linked mental retardation.	In contrast to the preponderance of affected males in families with X-linked mental retardation, Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurological disorder occurring almost exclusively in females. The near complete absence of affected males in RTT families has been explained by the lethal effect of an X-linked gene mutation in hemizygous affected males. We report here on a novel mutation (A140V) in the MECP2 gene detected in one female with mild mental retardation. In a family study, the A140V mutation was found to segregate in the affected daughter and in four adult sons with severe mental retardation. These results indicate that MECP2 mutations are not necessarily lethal in males and that they can be causative of non-specific X-linked mental retardation. 	FEBS_Lett.	D002363 D016428 D013485
20142353	20100210	Functional properties of RYR1 mutations identified in Swedish patients with malignant hyperthermia and central core disease.	A diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility by in vitro contraction testing can often only be performed at specialized laboratories far away from where patients live. Therefore, we have designed a protocol for genetic screening of the RYR1-cDNA and for functional testing of newly identified ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) gene variants in B lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood samples drawn at local primary care centers. B lymphocytes were isolated for the extraction of RYR1-mRNA and genomic DNA and for establishment of lymphoblastoid B cell lines in 5 patients carrying yet unclassified mutations in the RYR1. The B lymphoblastoid cell lines were used to study resting cytoplasmic calcium concentration, the peak calcium transient induced by the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin, and the dose-dependent calcium release induced by the ryanodine receptor agonist 4-chloro-m-cresol. It was possible to extract mRNA for cDNA synthesis and to create B lymphocyte clones from all samples. All B lymphoblastoid cell lines carrying RYR1 candidate mutations showed significantly increased resting cytoplasmic calcium levels as well as a shift to lower concentrations of 4-chloro-m-cresol inducing calcium release compared with controls. Peripheral blood samples are stable regarding RNA and DNA extraction and establishment of lymphoblastoid B cell lines after transportation at ambient temperature over large distances by ordinary mail. Functional tests on B cells harboring the newly identified amino acid substitutions indicate that they alter intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and are most likely causative of malignant hyperthermia.

11350124	20010515	A gene cluster encoding human epidermis-type lipoxygenases at chromosome 17p13.1: cloning, physical mapping, and expression.	Epidermis-type lipoxygenases, a distinct subclass within the multigene family of mammalian lipoxygenases (LOX), comprise recently discovered novel isoenzymes isolated from human and mouse skin including human 15-LOX-2, human and mouse 12R-LOX, mouse 8S-LOX, and mouse e-LOX-3. We have isolated the human homologue of mouse e-LOX-3. The cDNA of 3362 bp encodes a 711-amino-acid protein displaying 89% sequence identity with the mouse protein and exhibiting the same unusual structural feature, i.e., an extra segment of 41 amino acids, which can be located beyond the N-terminal beta-barrel domain at the surface of the C-terminal catalytic domain. The gene encoding e-LOX-3, ALOXE3, was found to be part of a gene cluster of approximately 100 kb on human chromosome 17p13.1 containing in addition the 12R-LOX gene, ALOX12B, the 15-LOX-2 gene, ALOX15B, and a novel 15-LOX pseudogene, ALOX15P. ALOXE3 and ALOX12B are arranged in a head-to-tail fashion separated by 8.5 kb. The genes are split into 15 exons and 14 introns spanning 22 and 15 kb, respectively. ALOX15P was found on the opposite DNA strand directly adjacent to the 3'-untranslated region of ALOX12B. ALOX15B is located in the same orientation 25 kb downstream of ALOX12B, and is composed of 14 exons and 13 introns spanning a total of 9.7 kb of genomic sequence. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated a predominant expression of ALOXE3, ALOX12B, and ALOX15B in skin. 	Genomics	D016428
21158681	20101217	Mutations in the CHD7 gene: the experience of a commercial laboratory.	CHARGE syndrome is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder caused by mutation in the CHD7 gene, encoding chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7. Molecular diagnostic testing for CHD7 mutation has been available in a clinical setting since 2005. We report here the results from the first 642 unrelated proband samples submitted for testing. Thirty-two percent (n = 203) of patient samples had a heterozygous pathogenic variant identified. The lower mutation rate than that published for well-characterized clinical samples is likely due to referral bias, as samples submitted for clinical testing may be for &quot;rule-out&quot; diagnoses, rather than solely to confirm clinical suspicion. We identified 159 unique pathogenic mutations, and of these, 134 mutations were each seen in a single individual and 25 mutations were found in two to five individuals (n =69). Of the 203 mutations, only 9 were missense, with 107 nonsense, 69 frameshift, and 15 splice-site mutations likely leading to haploinsufficiency at the cellular level. An additional 72 variations identified in the 642 tested samples (11%) were considered to have unknown clinical significance. Copy number changes (deletion/duplication of the entire gene or one/several exons) were found to account for a very small number of cases (n = 3). This cohort represents the largest CHARGE syndrome sample size to date and is intended to serve as a resource for clinicians, genetic counselors, researchers, and other diagnostic laboratories.

12860809	20030716	Mutations in the myocilin gene in families with primary open-angle glaucoma and juvenile open-angle glaucoma.	To investigate the prevalence of myocilin (MYOC) mutations in Italian families with glaucoma and to determine the relationship of these mutations to primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), juvenile open-angle glaucoma (JOAG), and pigmentary dispersion glaucoma. Twenty-six patients with POAG were selected based on a positive family history of glaucoma. All patients and 210 relatives had an accurate clinical characterization. Each index patient was screened by single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis for mutations in the MYOC gene. A MYOC gene mutation was found in 2 families. In one family, a previously reported p.K423E mutation was transmitted from the index patient with POAG to the 2 sons with JOAG. In the second family, a p.C25R change, affecting the signal peptide, was transmitted from the index patient with POAG to the son with JOAG, but not to the son with pigmentary dispersion glaucoma. Clinical characterization of 2 families with MYOC gene mutations indicates that POAG and JOAG are the 2 sides of a continuum phenotypical spectrum due to a common molecular defect. On the other hand, our results confirm the different origin of pigmentary dispersion glaucoma. Because MYOC gene mutations may be responsible for a fraction (2 [8%] of 26) of families with POAG/JOAG, a molecular genetic diagnosis should be included in the management of patients with glaucoma.

19617566	20090721	Inactivating germ-line and somatic mutations in polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 12 in human colon cancers.	Aberrant glycosylation is a pathological alteration that is widespread in colon cancer, and usually accompanies the onset and progression of the disease. To date, the molecular mechanisms underlying aberrant glycosylation remain largely unknown. In this study, we identify somatic and germ-line mutations in the gene encoding for polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 12 (GALNT12) in individuals with colon cancer. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that each of the 8 GALNT12 mutations identified inactivates the normal function of the GALNT enzyme in initiating mucin type O-linked protein glycosylation. Two of these inactivating GALNT12 mutations were identified as acquired somatic mutations in a set of 30 microsatellite stable colon tumors. Relative to background gene mutation rates, finding these somatic GALNT12 mutations was statistically significant at P &lt; 0.001. Six additional inactivating GALNT12 mutations were detected as germ-line changes carried by patients with colon cancer; however, no inactivating variants were detected among cancer-free controls (P = 0.005). Notably, in 3 of the 6 individuals harboring inactivating germ-line GALNT12 mutations, both a colon cancer and a second independent epithelial cancer had developed. These findings suggest that genetic defects in the O-glycosylation pathway in part underlie aberrant glycosylation in colon cancers, and they contribute to the development of a subset of these malignancies.

11726218	20011201	Analysis of SWAP-70 as a candidate gene for non-X-linked hyper IgM syndrome and common variable immunodeficiency.	SWAP-70 is a recently identified protein that functions as the only B cell-specific component of an isotype switch recombination complex called SWAP. The SWAP complex has specificity for the switch regions upstream of the constant region immunoglobulin genes and it facilitates the transfer of DNA between switch regions. These features suggested that mutations in the gene encoding SWAP-70 might result in humoral immunodeficiency. To test this hypothesis we determined the genomic structure of this gene and used single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis to screen DNA from 38 patients with either non-X-linked hyper IgM syndrome or common variable immunodeficiency. The results demonstrated that SWAP-70 consists of 12 exons spread over 89 kb at chromosome 11p15.2. SSCP analysis of the patient population revealed five polymorphic variants in the gene, one of which (Q505E) is an amino acid substitution in the putative nuclear export signal of SWAP-70. However, none of the alterations appeared to be associated with disease in the patients screened. 	Clin._Immunol.	D016428 D013485 D013487
27616480	20160913	Mutations in MBOAT7, Encoding Lysophosphatidylinositol Acyltransferase I, Lead to Intellectual Disability Accompanied by Epilepsy and Autistic Features.	The risk of epilepsy among individuals with intellectual disability (ID) is approximately ten times that of the general population. From a cohort of &gt;5,000 families affected by neurodevelopmental disorders, we identified six consanguineous families harboring homozygous inactivating variants in MBOAT7, encoding lysophosphatidylinositol acyltransferase (LPIAT1). Subjects presented with ID frequently accompanied by epilepsy and autistic features. LPIAT1 is a membrane-bound phospholipid-remodeling enzyme that transfers arachidonic acid (AA) to lysophosphatidylinositol to produce AA-containing phosphatidylinositol. This study suggests a role for AA-containing phosphatidylinositols in the development of ID accompanied by epilepsy and autistic features. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428
9629852	19980618	Tau is a candidate gene for chromosome 17 frontotemporal dementia.	Frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism, chromosome 17 type (FTDP-17), a recently defined disease entity, is clinically characterized by personality changes sometimes associated with psychosis, hyperorality, and diminished speech output, disturbed executive function and nonfluent aphasia, bradykinesia, and rigidity. Neuropathological changes include frontotemporal atrophy often associated with atrophy of the basal ganglia, substantia nigra, and amygdala. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are seen in some but not all families. Inheritance is autosomal dominant and the gene has been regionally localized to 17q21-22 in a 2- to 4-centimorgan (cM) region flanked by markers D17S800 and D17S791. The gene for tau, the primary component of NFTs, is located in the same region of chromosome 17. Tau was evaluated as a candidate gene. Physical mapping studies place tau within 2 megabases or less of D17S791, but it is probably outside the D17S800-D17S791 FTDP-17 interval. DNA sequence analysis of tau coding regions in affected subjects from two FTDP-17 families revealed nine DNA sequence variants, eight of which were also identified in controls and are thus polymorphisms. A ninth variant (Val279Met) was found in one FTDP-17 family but not in the second FTDP-17 family. Three lines of evidence indicate that the Val279Met change is an FTDP-17 causative mutation. First, the mutation site is highly conserved, and a normal valine is found at this position in all three tau interrepeat sequences and in other microtubule associated protein tau homologues. Second, the mutation co-segregates with the disease in family A. Third, the mutation is not found in normal controls. 	Ann._Neurol.	D016428 D013487
9049783	19970101	Maternal mosaicism for a novel interleukin-2 receptor gamma-chain mutation causing X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency in a Navajo kindred.	X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) results from mutations of IL2RG, the gene encoding the interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain, also known as the common gamma chain (gamma c). A distinct form of autosomal recessive SCID occurs at an increased frequency among the Navajo Native American population. The disease gene responsible for autosomal Navajo SCID remains to be determined. We report the occurrence of X-linked SCID in a Navajo Native American kindred with two affected brothers. X-linked SCID was suggested by the presence of circulating B cells and the absence of surface gamma c expression in a cell line derived from an affected male. A C-to-T transition was demonstrated in exon 5 of the IL2RG gene, resulting in the substitution of tryptophan for arginine at position 224. This change was not present in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of the mother, thus proving the occurrence of a new mutation in the maternal germline. This report underscores the importance of establishing a specific genetic diagnosis for SCID cases and illustrates the inherent difficulties in providing genetic counseling in cases involving mosaicism.

11050005	20001026	A novel gene, MEL1, mapped to 1p36.3 is highly homologous to the MDS1/EVI1 gene and is transcriptionally activated in t(1;3)(p36;q21)-positive leukemia cells.	The reciprocal translocation t(1;3)(p36;q21) occurs in a subset of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is frequently characterized by trilineage dysplasia, in particular dysmegakaryocytopoiesis, and poor prognosis. Previously, the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) at 3q21 was identified within a 60-kilobase (kb) region centromeric to the BCR of 3q21q26 syndrome and that at 1p36.3 within a 90-kb region. In this study, genes were searched near the breakpoints at 1p36.3, and a novel gene was isolated that encoded a zinc finger protein with a PR domain, which is highly homologous to the MDS1/EVI1 gene. The novel gene, designated as MEL1 (MDS1/EVI1-like gene 1), with 1257 amino acid residues is 64% similar in nucleotide and 63% similar in amino acid sequences to MDS1/EVI1 with the same domain structure. The MEL1 gene is expressed in leukemia cells with t(1;3) but not in other cell lines or bone marrow, spleen, and fetal liver, suggesting that MEL1 is specifically in the t(1;3)(p36;q21)-positive MDS/AML. On the basis of the positional relationship between the EVI1 and MEL1 genes in each translocation, it was suggested that both genes are transcriptionally activated by the translocation of the 3q21 region with the Ribophorin I gene. Because of the transcriptional activation of the EVI1 family genes in both t(1;3)(p36;q21)-positive MDS/AML and 3q21q26 syndrome, it is suggested that they share a common molecular mechanism for the leukemogenic transformation of the cells.

22301465	20120204	Missense mutations in the DNA-binding/dimerization domain of NFIX cause Sotos-like features.	Sotos syndrome is characterized by prenatal and postnatal overgrowth, characteristic craniofacial features and mental retardation. Haploinsufficiency of NSD1 causes Sotos syndrome. Recently, two microdeletions encompassing Nuclear Factor I-X (NFIX) and a nonsense mutation in NFIX have been found in three individuals with Sotos-like overgrowth features, suggesting possible involvements of NFIX abnormalities in Sotos-like features. Interestingly, seven frameshift and two splice site mutations in NFIX have also been found in nine individuals with Marshall-Smith syndrome. In this study, 48 individuals who were suspected as Sotos syndrome but showing no NSD1 abnormalities were examined for NFIX mutations by high-resolution melt analysis. We identified two heterozygous missense mutations in the DNA-binding/dimerization domain of the NFIX protein. Both mutations occurred at evolutionally conserved amino acids. The c.179T&gt;C (p.Leu60Pro) mutation occurred de novo and the c.362G&gt;C (p.Arg121Pro) mutation was inherited from possibly affected mother. Both mutations were absent in 250 healthy Japanese controls. Our study revealed that missense mutations in NFIX were able to cause Sotos-like features. Mutations in DNA-binding/dimerization domain of NFIX protein also suggest that the transcriptional regulation is abnormally fluctuated because of NFIX abnormalities. In individuals with Sotos-like features unrelated to NSD1 changes, genetic testing of NFIX should be considered. 	J._Hum._Genet.	D002363 D016428 D013485
19409524	20090505	Frontorhiny, a distinctive presentation of frontonasal dysplasia caused by recessive mutations in the ALX3 homeobox gene.	We describe a recessively inherited frontonasal malformation characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, with hypertelorism, wide nasal bridge, short nasal ridge, bifid nasal tip, broad columella, widely separated slit-like nares, long philtrum with prominent bilateral swellings, and midline notch in the upper lip and alveolus. Additional recurrent features present in a minority of individuals have been upper eyelid ptosis and midline dermoid cysts of craniofacial structures. Assuming recessive inheritance, we mapped the locus in three families to chromosome 1 and identified mutations in ALX3, which is located at band 1p13.3 and encodes the aristaless-related ALX homeobox 3 transcription factor. In total, we identified seven different homozygous pathogenic mutations in seven families. These mutations comprise missense substitutions at critical positions within the conserved homeodomain as well as nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations, all predicting severe or complete loss of function. Our findings contrast with previous studies of the orthologous murine gene, which showed no phenotype in Alx3(-/-) homozygotes, apparently as a result of functional redundancy with the paralogous Alx4 gene. We conclude that ALX3 is essential for normal facial development in humans and that deficiency causes a clinically recognizable phenotype, which we term frontorhiny. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.

3285291	19880201	bcr genes and transcripts.	Human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a clonal hematologic disorder. CML is characterized by the t(9:22) chromosome translocation which results in translocation of the oncogene abl from chromosome 9 into the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) gene on chromosome 22. We cloned and characterized the cDNA of the normal bcr gene. The bcr gene codes for a protein of 1271 amino acids. The open reading frame is preceded by a region high in GC. At the 5' of this region we identified several GC motifs which are probably involved in the initiation of bcr transcription. bcr transcripts of 7.0 and 4.5 kb are expressed in all cell types examined. These transcripts share all cDNA sequences analysed, including the 5' untranslated region. The latter as well as 902 or 927 amino acids are included within the CML-specific bcr-abl mRNA transcribed from the chimeric bcr-abl gene on chromosome 22. In addition to the complete bcr gene, the human genome contains 3 bcr-related genes containing the last seven exons of the intact bcr gene. One of these genes was analysed in detail and showed high sequence homology with the latter. The three bcr-related genes were probably derived from the intact gene by subsequent steps of duplication. 	Oncogene	D016428 D013485 D013486 D013487
10583218	19991203	A novel missense mutation in the human plasmin inhibitor (alpha2-antiplasmin) gene associated with a bleeding tendency.	Heterozygosity for a G --&gt; A mutation converting Val384(GTG) to Met(ATG) associated with plasmin inhibitor (alpha2-antiplasmin) deficiency was identified in three family members with bleeding tendency. The proband had traumatic breast haematoma and per-/postoperative bleeds. An affected daughter required a blood transfusion after a normal delivery and a son had prolonged bleeding after tooth extraction. The plasma plasmin inhibitor activities of the affected family members were reduced to 49-66% of normal. The antigenic concentrations determined by electroimmunoassay were reduced to 57-68% of normal. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis of plasma from the proband showed a normal pattern. The amino acid Val384 is located eight residues C-terminal (P8') of the P1 residue (Arg376) in the reactive site. The P8' residues of bovine and mouse plasmin inhibitor are both Val. Among other serpins the P8' residue is unconserved. The mutation was not present in the non-affected family member or 30 blood donors. In addition to the Val384Met mutation two new polymorphisms Ala-26(GCG)/Val(GTG) and Arg407(AGG)/Lys(AAG) and one previously reported polymorphism Arg6(CGG)/Trp(TGG) were identified in the plasmin inhibitor gene of the family. The allelic frequencies among 30 blood donors with normal values of plasma plasmin inhibitor (functional) were 0.84/0.16 for C/T in codon -26, 0.81/0.19 for C/T in codon 6 and 0.83/0.17 for G/A in codon 407.

11133745	20010103	V(D)J recombination defects in lymphocytes due to RAG mutations: severe immunodeficiency with a spectrum of clinical presentations.	Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) comprises a heterogeneous group of primary immunodeficiencies, a proportion of which are due to mutations in either of the 2 recombination activating genes (RAG)-1 and -2, which mediate the process of V(D)J recombination leading to the assembly of antigen receptor genes. It is reported here that the clinical and immunologic phenotypes of patients bearing mutations in RAGs are more diverse than previously thought and that this variability is related, in part, to the specific type of RAG mutation. By analyzing 44 such patients from 41 families, the following conclusions were reached: (1) null mutations on both alleles lead to the T-B-SCID phenotype; (2) patients manifesting classic Omenn syndrome (OS) have missense mutations on at least one allele and maintain partial V(D)J recombination activity, which accounts for the generation of residual, oligoclonal T-lymphocytes; (3) in a third group of patients, findings were only partially compatible with OS, and these patients, who also carried at least one missense mutation, may be considered to have atypical SCID/OS; (4) patients with engraftment of maternal T cells as a complication of a transplacental transfusion represented a fourth group, and these patients, who often presented with a clinical phenotype mimicking OS, may be observed regardless of the type of RAG gene mutation. Analysis of the RAG genes by direct sequencing is an effective way to provide accurate diagnosis of RAG-deficient as opposed to RAG-independent V(D)J recombination defects, a distinction that cannot be made based on clinical and immunologic phenotype alone.

11442002	20010710	Novel inactivating missense mutations in the thyrotropin receptor gene in Japanese children with resistance to thyrotropin.	We describe Japanese siblings with resistance to thyrotropin (TSH) who are compound heterozygotes for two novel mutations in the TSH receptor gene. The affected siblings had increased serum TSH, normal serum thyroid hormones, and normal positioned but slightly hypoplastic thyroid glands. The mutated paternal allele has the substitution of His (CAC) in place of Arg (CGC) at codon 450 (R450H) of the TSH receptor. The mutated maternal allele has the substitution of Ser (AGT) in place of Gly (GGT) at codon 498 (G498S) of the TSH receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the R450H mutant exhibited a slightly decreased TSH binding and a slightly decreased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response to TSH, whereas cells transfected with the G498S mutant exhibited a markedly decreased TSH binding and a markedly decreased cAMP response to TSH. Flow immunocytofluorometry analysis demonstrated that the G498S mutant resulted in extremely low expression at the cell surface as compared with the wild type receptor and the R450H mutant, in spite of a normal intracellular synthesis. The present cases are the first Japanese patients with TSH resistance in whom mutations in the TSH receptor gene have been identified. These novel mutations may contribute to understanding of the struc-ture-function relationship of the TSH receptor. 	Thyroid	D002363 D016428 D013485
9664034	19980717	Advillin (p92): a new member of the gelsolin/villin family of actin regulatory proteins.	A new member of the gelsolin/villin family of actin regulatory proteins was initially identified by screening an adult murine brain cDNA library with a probe for bovine adseverin. The predicted amino acid sequence of the 92 kDa murine protein p92 (advillin) is 75% homologous to villin and 65% homologous to gelsolin and adseverin. It shares a six domain structure with other gelsolin family members and has a carboxy-terminal headpiece, similar to, yet distinct from, villin. Northern blot analysis shows a high level of mRNA expression in murine uterus and human intestine. In situ mRNA analysis of adult murine tissues demonstrates that the message is most highly expressed in the endometrium of the uterus, the intestinal lining, and at the surface of the tongue. In murine embryonic development, strong expression of the message is observed by day 14.5 in dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal ganglia. Expression is also noted at day 16.5 in cerebral cortex. We propose that p92 (advillin) has unique functions in the morphogenesis of neuronal cells which form ganglia, and that it may compensate to explain the near normal phenotype observed in villin-deficient mice.

8497277	19930601	Disruption of largest subunit RNA polymerase II genes in Trypanosoma brucei.	Two types of largest subunit RNA polymerase II (pol II) genes (pol IIA and pol IIB), differing in 3 amino acid substitutions, are encoded in the Trypanosoma brucei (stock 427-60) genome. As a result, the alpha-amanitin-resistant transcription of the procyclic acidic repetitive protein (PARP) and variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes was proposed to involve a modified, alpha-amanitin-resistant form of the largest subunit of pol II. Alternatively, pol I could transcribe the PARP and VSG genes. To discriminate between these two models, we deleted the N-terminal domain (about one-third of the polypeptide), which encodes the amino acid substitutions which discriminated the pol IIA and pol IIB genes, at both pol IIB alleles. The pol IIB- trypanosomes still transcribe the PARP genes and the VSG gene promoter region in insect-form trypanosomes by alpha-amanitin-resistant RNA polymerases, while control housekeeping genes are transcribed in an alpha-amanitin-sensitive manner, presumably by pol IIA. We conclude that the alpha-amanitin-resistant transcription of protein coding genes in T. brucei is not mediated by a diverged form of the largest subunit of pol II and that the presence of both the pol IIA and pol IIB genes is not essential for trypanosome viability. This conclusion was further supported by the finding that individual trypanosome variants exhibited allelic heterogeneity for the previously identified amino acid substitutions and that various permutations of the polymorphic amino acids generate at least four different types of largest subunit pol II genes. The expression of the PARP genes and the VSG gene promoter region by alpha-amanitin-resistant RNA polymerases in the pol IIB- trypanosomes provides evidence for transcription of these genes by pol I.

23887765	20130727	Contribution of SNRNP200 sequence variations to retinitis pigmentosa.	Mutations in the SNRNP200 gene have been reported to cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP). In this study, we evaluate the mutation profile of SNRNP200 in a cohort of southern Chinese RP patients. Twenty adRP patients from 11 families and 165 index patients with non-syndromic RP with mixed inheritance patterns were screened for mutations in the mutation hotspots of SNRNP200. These included exons 12-16, 22-32, and 38-45, which covered the two helicase ATP-binding domains in DEAD-box and two sec-63 domains. The targeted regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed by direct DNA sequencing, followed by in silico analyses. Totally 26 variants were identified, 18 of which were novel. Three non-synonymous variants (p.C502R, p.R1779H and p.I698V) were found exclusively in patients. Two of them, p.C502R and p.R1779H, were each identified in one simplex RP patient, whereas p.I698V occurred in one patient with unknown inheritance pattern. All three residues are highly conserved in SNRNP200 orthologs. Nevertheless, only p.C502R and p.R1779H were predicted to affect protein function by in silico analyses, suggesting these two variants are likely to be disease-causing mutations. Notably, all mutations previously identified in other study populations were not detected in this study. Our results reveal a distinct mutation profile of the SNRNP200 gene in a southern Chinese cohort of RP patients. The identification of two novel candidate mutations in two respective patients affirmed that SNRNP200 contributes to a proportion of overall RP. 	Eye_(Lond)	D016428 D013485
9545398	19980523	Mutations in btk in patients with presumed X-linked agammaglobulinemia.	In 1993, two groups showed that X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) was due to mutations in a tyrosine kinase now called Btk. Most laboratories have been able to detect mutations in Btk in 80%-90% of males with presumed XLA. The remaining patients may have mutations in Btk that are difficult to identify, or they may have defects that are phenotypically similar to XLA but genotypically different. We analyzed 101 families in which affected males were diagnosed as having XLA. Mutations in Btk were identified in 38 of 40 families with more than one affected family member and in 56 of 61 families with sporadic disease. Excluding the patients in whom the marked decrease in B cell numbers characteristic of XLA could not be confirmed by immunofluorescence studies, mutations in Btk were identified in 43 of 46 patients with presumed sporadic XLA. Two of the three remaining patients had defects in other genes required for normal B cell development, and the third patient was unlikely to have XLA, on the basis of results of extensive Btk analysis. Our techniques were unable to identify a mutation in Btk in one male with both a family history and laboratory findings suggestive of XLA. DNA samples from 41 of 49 of the mothers of males with sporadic disease and proven mutations in Btk were positive for the mutation found in their son. In the other 8 families, the mutation appeared to arise in the maternal germ line. In 20 families, haplotype analysis showed that the new mutation originated in the maternal grandfather or great-grandfather. These studies indicate that 90%-95% of males with presumed XLA have mutations in Btk. The other patients are likely to have defects in other genes. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485 D013487
12694230	20030416	Two novel mutations in the alpha-galactosidase A gene in Chinese patients with Fabry disease.	Fabry disease is an X-linked disorder caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A [EC 3.2.1.22]. The molecular diagnosis of Fabry disease is important for genotype/phenotype correlation, pre-natal or early diagnosis, and detection of carrier status. Although more than 200 genotypes of the alpha-galactosidase A gene have been identified, mutation data on the Chinese population is sparse. We recently identified two unrelated Chinese families with Fabry disease. Mutation analysis was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing of the seven exons and adjacent introns of the alpha-galactosidase A gene. Two novel mutations were identified: in family I, a C-to-A transversion resulted in an early termination at amino acid 222 (Y222X), while in family II, an A-to-G transition resulted in a substitution of alanine for threonine at amino acid 410 (T410A). Carrier status was identified in all four females in the two families. The genotype Y222X is associated with classic Fabry disease, with unexpectedly rapid deterioration of visual acuity, while T410A is associated with a milder Fabry disease, with ventricular hypertrophy and neuropathic pain.

6687691	19830301	Structure of a cDNA for the pro alpha 2 chain of human type I procollagen. Comparison with chick cDNA for pro alpha 2(I) identifies structurally conserved features of the protein and the gene.	Nucleotide sequences were determined for cloned cDNAs encoding for more than half of the pro alpha 2 chain of type I procollagen from man. Comparisons with previously published data on homologous cDNAs from chick embryos made it possible to examine evolution of the gene in two species which have diverged for 250-300 million years. The amino acid sequence of the alpha-chain domain supported previous indications that there is a strong selective pressure to maintain glycine as every third amino acid and to maintain a prescribed distribution of charged amino acids. However, there is little apparent selective pressure on other amino acids. The amino acid sequence of the C-propeptide domain showed less divergence than the alpha-chain domain. The 5' end or N terminus of the human C-propeptide, however, contained an insert of 12 bases coding for 4 amino acids not found in the chick C-propeptide. About 100 amino acid residues from the N terminus, two residues found in the chick sequence were missing from the human. In the second half of the C-propeptide, there was complete conservation of a 37 amino acid sequence and conservation of 50 out of 51 amino acids in the same region, an observation which suggested that the region serves some special purpose such as directing the association of one pro alpha 2(I) C-propeptide with two pro alpha 1(I) C-propeptides so as to produce the heteropolymeric structure of type I procollagen. In addition, comparison of human and chick DNAs for pro alpha 2(I) revealed three different classes of conservation of nucleotide sequence which have no apparent effect on the structure of the protein: a preference for U on the third base position of codons for glycine, proline, and alanine; a high degree of nucleotide conservation in the 51 amino acid highly conserved region of the C-propeptide; a high degree of nucleotide conservation in the 3'-noncoding region. These three classes of nucleotide conservation may reflect unusual features of collagen genes, such as their high GC content or their highly repetitive coding sequences.

26456858	20151013	Novel mutation in NIPAL4 in a Romanian family with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis.	Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI), a severe and highly clinically heterogeneous group of mendelian disorders of cornification, is the result of mutations in at least nine genes regulating the epidermal barrier functionality. NIPAL4 is the second most frequently mutated ARCI gene. We report two adult patients from a nonconsanguineous family of Romanian origin, who had lamellar ichthyosis. A positive in situ transglutaminase 1 activity assay excluded a putative TGM1 mutation. NIPAL4 sequencing revealed in both patients a new homozygous missense mutation, c.403A&gt;C, affecting a highly conserved amino acid (p. Ser135Arg) and predicted to be deleterious according to in silico analysis. In addition to the ARCI features, the patients had caries and partial edentation. Although delay in dental treatment led to caries progression and extraction of secondary teeth, this finding raises the possibility of a deficiency in enamel mineralization due to NIPAL4 dysfunction as an Mg(2+) transporter. Evaluating new patients with ARCI provides fruitful clinical and molecular findings. 	Clin._Exp._Dermatol.	D002363 D016428
17054399	20061024	Kallmann syndrome: mutations in the genes encoding prokineticin-2 and prokineticin receptor-2.	Kallmann syndrome combines anosmia, related to defective olfactory bulb morphogenesis, and hypogonadism due to gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency. Loss-of-function mutations in KAL1 and FGFR1 underlie the X chromosome-linked form and an autosomal dominant form of the disease, respectively. Mutations in these genes, however, only account for approximately 20% of all Kallmann syndrome cases. In a cohort of 192 patients we took a candidate gene strategy and identified ten and four different point mutations in the genes encoding the G protein-coupled prokineticin receptor-2 (PROKR2) and one of its ligands, prokineticin-2 (PROK2), respectively. The mutations in PROK2 were detected in the heterozygous state, whereas PROKR2 mutations were found in the heterozygous, homozygous, or compound heterozygous state. In addition, one of the patients heterozygous for a PROKR2 mutation was also carrying a missense mutation in KAL1, thus indicating a possible digenic inheritance of the disease in this individual. These findings reveal that insufficient prokineticin-signaling through PROKR2 leads to abnormal development of the olfactory system and reproductive axis in man. They also shed new light on the complex genetic transmission of Kallmann syndrome. 	PLoS_Genet.	D016428 D013485
10944848	20000817	Structural and functional study of K453E mutant protective protein/cathepsin A causing the late infantile form of galactosialidosis.	To clarify the molecular basis of the late infantile form of galactosialidosis, we characterized a defective protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA) gene product with the K453E mutation newly found in an Arabic patient with this disease. Immunocytochemical, expression, and metabolic studies revealed that the precursor PPCA was synthesized but not processed to the mature form, and it was degraded in the mutant. A structural model of the mutant PPCA was constructed by amino acid substitution of 453glutamic acid for lysine in the crystal structure of the wild type PPCA precursor reported. The results show that the K453E mutation is located at the dimer interface of the PPCA and reduces the hydrogen bond formation in the dimer. This structural change may cause instability of the PPCA dimer. 	J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485

The 2 736 bp clone contains one 1 344 bp open reading frame extending from 412 to 1 755. We named it NELIN (nexilin-like protein) because it shares high similarity with the rat nexilin. NELIN was expression-restricted in heart, skeletalmuscle, artery and vein by Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses, and mapped to chromosome 1p31-1p32 by database analyses. Based on domain structure, NELIN could regulate the formations of stress fibers,focal adhesion and its signaling complex, and even participates in the signal transduction in FAs(focal adhesions).

11216660	20010224	Novel mutations in the duplicated region of the polycystic kidney disease 1 (PKD1) gene provides supporting evidence for gene conversion.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common human single-gene disorders, and is the most common inherited form of cystic kidney disease. It is estimated that approximately 85% of ADPKD is due to mutations in the PKD1 gene, which is located on chromosome 16p13.3. Mutation analysis in this gene is difficult, because more than two-thirds of reiterated several times at 16p13.1. In this study, mutation screening in 90 ADPKD patients was carried out on exons in the duplicated region of the PKD1 gene (23-34), using genomic long-range PCR followed by nested PCR and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), and finally cycle sequencing. Two nonconservative missense mutations were detected in exons 25 and 31, and two conservative mutations were found in exons 24 and 29. A novel splicing mutation, which is expected to cause skipping of exon 30, was detected in one case. Moreover, six intronic variants, three silent variants, and one polymorphic variant were detected in this study. Comparison between some of these changes and published sequences from the homologous genes on 16p13.1, revealed supporting evidence for the gene conversion theory as a mechanism responsible for some of the mutations in the PKD1 gene. Factors likely to facilitate gene conversion in this region of the PKD1 gene are discussed. 	Genet._Test.	D016428
20117752	20100202	Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus: novel SCN1A mutation.	Genetic generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) is an idiopathic generalized epileptic syndrome of heterogeneous phenotype. The cases described here are of two brothers, one with severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (Dravet syndrome) and the other myoclonic-astatic epilepsy. Their father experienced one simple febrile seizure in infancy and two generalized tonic-clonic seizures after head trauma in adulthood, and had generalized epileptiform activity in the electroencephalogram. He died in a severe sport accident before genetic testing could be performed. In both siblings, but not in their healthy mother, DNA analysis identified an unreported point mutation (c.3925 C&gt;T) in exon 20 of the SCN1A gene. The missense mutation was therefore assumed to be inherited from the father, who had a very mild clinical picture, with a single febrile seizure and only occasional generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The offspring have GEFS+ phenotypes with opposite severity, an illustration of the broad intrafamilial variability of SCN1A gene mutations. 	Pediatr._Neurol.	D002363 D016428
16257123	20051101	Analysis of the PINK1 gene in a cohort of patients with sporadic early-onset parkinsonism in Taiwan.	Mutations in the PINK1 gene have been shown to cause autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PD) and/or early onset sporadic PD in Italy, Spain, North America, Ireland, and Asia. However, there are limited data on PINK1 mutations in sporadic early onset Asian PD patients. To determine the prevalence of PINK1 mutation in Taiwanese population, we conducted genetic analysis of PINK1 mutation in 73 early onset sporadic PD and 94 normal control subjects. We only identified a novel single heterozygous mutation R 407Q mutation in exon 6 of this gene in one patient at the age onset of 54. Overall, these data indicate that PINK1 mutations are rare in our population. Based on our results, unless common mutational hotspots are identified, routine testing for this mutation at least in our population may not be cost-effective. 	Neurosci._Lett.	D003160 D016428
1424986	19921001	A cDNA clone for a novel nuclear protein with DNA binding activity.	In an effort to identify trans-acting factors regulating specific genes, we cloned a novel human gene, DBP-5. The cDNA clone contains a predicted open reading frame coding for a potential 1,179 amino acid protein. The mRNA corresponding to DBP-5 is ubiquitously distributed, and the gene is phylogenetically conserved. Immunofluorescence analyses with several cell lines indicate that the protein is localized to the nucleus. Sequence analysis revealed unusual features of the predicted protein structure, including four completely conserved repeats. The phylogenetic conservation of DBP-5, the ubiquity of its expression, its nuclear localization, and its ability to bind DNA sequences, raise the possibility that DBP-5 may play a role in the organization of interphase chromatin and/or in transcriptional regulation.

10827258	20000529	The low-frequency MNS blood group antigens Ny(a) (MNS18) and Os(a) (MNS38) are associated with GPA amino acid substitutions.	Antigens of the MNS blood group system are located on two sialoglycoproteins, GPA and GPB, encoded by GYPA and GYPB. The molecular backgrounds of the low-frequency antigens Ny(a) and Os(a) are not known. Immunoblotting and a monoclonal antibody-specific immobilization of erythrocyte antigens (MAIEA) assay were used to analyze Os(a). PCR-amplified products of the coding exons of GYPA were studied by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and exon 3 was sequenced. Synthetic peptides were used in hemagglutination-inhibition tests. Sequencing of GYPA exon 3 of two unrelated Ny(a+) persons revealed heterozygosity for a T194A base change encoding an Asp27Glu substitution. Immunoblotting with anti-Os(a) and an MAIEA assay with MoAbs to GPA showed that Os(a) is on GPA. Sequencing exon 3 of an Os(a+) person from the only family with Os(a) revealed heterozygosity for a C273T base change encoding a Pro54Ser substitution. A synthetic peptide representing part of GPA with the Os(a) mutation (VRTVYPSEEETGE) completely inhibited anti-Os(a), whereas the control peptide (VRTVYPPEEETGE) did not inhibit anti-Os(a). Ny(a) and Os(a) are low-frequency antigens of the MNS blood group system that represent Asp27Glu and Pro54Ser substitutions in GPA, respectively. 	Transfusion	D016428
10599883	19991222	Corneodesmosin gene polymorphism demonstrates strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA and association with psoriasis vulgaris.	Corneodesmosin (CD) is thought to play a key role in corneocyte cohesion, and its proteolysis appears to be a major event in the process of desquamation. Recently it was shown that CD is encoded by the S-gene, which is located approximately 160 kb telomeric of HLA-C. In the present study, the role of CD in the genetics of psoriasis vulgaris was studied in greater detail. The second exon of the CD gene was sequenced in 86 HLA-typed individuals from 13 psoriasis multiplex families. A total of 11 silent dimorphisms and 7 variants resulting in amino acid substitutions were found. Pedigree analysis showed that these variants could be grouped into 7 alleles, encoding 6 different amino acid sequences. These alleles are in strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B and -C, indicating that the polymorphism of the CD gene is ancient and well conserved rather than sporadic. One allele at the CD locus, designated CD2, displayed strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA-Cw6, the HLA allele most prominently associated with psoriasis. CD2 demonstrated a greater relative risk than Cw6 (3.4 vs. 2.5, not significant) and higher significant transmission disequilibrium with psoriasis than any of the investigated HLA-alleles. Due to its biologic function, cellular location and disease association, the CD gene appears to be an excellent candidate gene for PSORS1, the HLA-linked determinant of psoriasis vulgaris.

11866271	20020228	Mutational screening of patients with nonalcoholic chronic pancreatitis: identification of further trypsinogen variants.	Mutations of the cationic trypsinogen (CT) and the serine protease inhibitor, Kazal type 1 (SPINK 1) are associated with chronic pancreatitis. After mutational screening of a cohort of patients with nonalcoholic chronic pancreatitis, we report three novel variants of the trypsinogen molecule and the clinical characteristics of the carriers. The coding region of the exon 2 and 3 of the CT gene of 523 patients with chronic nonalcoholic pancreatitis (108 patients with suspected hereditary pancreatitis (HP) and 415 patients with &quot;idio pathic&quot; pancreatitis [IP]) and 82 controls was analyzed after polymerase chain reaction amplification. Clinical characteristics were obtained by questioning the patients and their relatives and physicians. HP was suspected when two members of a family had chronic pancreatitis. A restriction digestion was used to analyze the N34S mutation SPINK1. The mutation R122H of the cationic trypsinogen was found in 21 index patients, N291 in six index patients, and A16V and D22G in one index patient, all from HP families. The N34S mutation of SPINK1 was found in two index patients with a family history of HP. In three patients, the novel point mutations L104P, R116C, and C139F of the cationic trypsinogen were found. A clear autosomally dominant inheritance of chronic pancreatitis was not present in these families. In 75 index patients from HP families (69.4%), no mutation could be found. The SPINK 1-mutation N34S was detected in only one patient carrying a CT mutation, and was found in 68 (16.4%) of patients with IP. The R122H and N291 mutations of CT are the most common disease-associated mutations in HP; the N34S mutation of SPINK I is the most frequent genetic risk factor associated with IP. The CT gene carries several variations that could be associated with chronic pancreatitis. To avoid overestimating the pathogenetic impact of novel trypsinogen variants, a detailed clinical characterization of all patients with early onset chronic pancreatitis is mandatory.

8188292	19940201	Correction of the metabolic defect in propionic acidemia fibroblasts by microinjection of a full-length cDNA or RNA transcript encoding the propionyl-CoA carboxylase beta subunit.	Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) is a mitochondrial, biotin-dependent enzyme, composed of an equal number of alpha and beta subunits, that functions in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids and other metabolites. Mutations of the PCCA (alpha subunit) or PCCB (beta subunit) gene cause the inherited metabolic disease, propionic acidemia. We report the cloning of a full-length cDNA encoding the beta subunit of human PCC. The open reading frame encodes a pre-beta polypeptide of 539 amino acids (58,205 Da). The cDNA was introduced into the expression vector, pRc/CMV, and microinjected into the nucleus or, as ribotranscripts, into the cytoplasm of fibroblast lines from patients with defects of the beta subunit. The restoration of function was monitored by autoradiography of PCC-dependent [14C]-propionate incorporation into cellular protein. These results confirm the completeness of the clone and demonstrate the capacity for beta subunits derived from the microinjected cDNA or RNA to be transported into mitochondria and assembled with endogenously derived alpha subunits to form functional PCC.

10196713	19990410	Mutation in the zonadhesin-like domain of alpha-tectorin associated with autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss.	A gene responsible for autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing impairment in two families (DFNA8 and DFNA12) has recently been identified as TECTA encoding alpha-tectorin, a major component of the tectorial membrane. In these families, missense mutations within the zona pellucida domain of alpha-tectorin were associated with stable severe mid-frequency hearing loss. The present study reports linkage to DFNA12 in a new family with autosomal dominant high frequency hearing loss progressing from mild to moderate severity. The candidate region refined to 3.8 cM still contained the TECTA gene. A missense mutation (C1619S) was identified in the zonadhesin-like domain. This mutation abolishes the first of the vicinal cysteines (1619Cys-Gly-Leu- 1622Cys) present in the D4 von Willebrand factor (vWf) type D repeat. These results further support the involvement of TECTA mutations in autosomal dominant hearing impairment, and suggest that vicinal cysteines are involved in tectorial membrane matrix assembly.

9817918	19981118	LIS1 and XLIS (DCX) mutations cause most classical lissencephaly, but different patterns of malformation.	Classical lissencephaly (LIS) is a neuronal migration disorder resulting in brain malformation, epilepsy and mental retardation. Deletions or mutations of LIS1 on 17p13.3 and mutations in XLIS ( DCX ) on Xq22.3-q23 produce LIS. Direct DNA sequencing of LIS1 and XLIS was performed in 25 children with sporadic LIS and no deletion of LIS1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Mutations of LIS1 were found by sequencing ( n = 8) and Southern blot ( n = 2) in a total of 10 patients (40%) of both sexes and mutations of XLIS in five males (20%). Combined with previous data, deletions or mutations of these two genes account for approximately 76% of isolated LIS. These data demonstrate that LIS1 and XLIS mutations cause the majority of, though not all, human LIS. The mutations in LIS1 were predicted to result in protein truncation in six of eight patients and splice site mutations in two, all of which disrupt one or more of the seven WD40 repeats contained in the LIS1 protein. Point mutations in XLIS identified the C-terminal serine/proline-rich region as potentially important for protein function. The patients with mutations were included in a genotype-phenotype analysis of 32 subjects with deletions or other mutations of these two genes. Whereas the brain malformation due to LIS1 mutations was more severe over the parietal and occipital regions, XLIS mutations produced the reverse gradient, which was more severe over the frontal cortex. The distinct LIS patterns suggest that LIS1 and XLIS may be part of overlapping, but distinct, signaling pathways that promote neuronal migration. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D013485 D013487
19144319	20090116	The phagosomal proteome in interferon-gamma-activated macrophages.	The ability of macrophages to clear pathogens and elicit a sustained immune response is regulated by various cytokines, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). To investigate the molecular mechanisms by which IFN-gamma modulates phagosome functions, we profiled the changes in composition, abundance, and phosphorylation of phagosome proteins in resting and activated macrophages by using quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics approaches. We identified 2415 phagosome proteins together with 2975 unique phosphorylation sites with a high level of sensitivity. Using network analyses, we determined that IFN-gamma delays phagosomal acquisition of lysosomal hydrolases and peptidases for the gain of antigen presentation. Furthermore, this gain in antigen presentation is dependent on phagosomal networks of the actin cytoskeleton and vesicle-trafficking proteins, as well as Src kinases and calpain proteases. Major histocompatibility complex class I antigen-presentation assays validated the molecular participation of these networks in the enhanced capacity of IFN-gamma-activated macrophages to crosspresent exogenous antigens to CD8(+) T cells.

24776970	20140430	Gain-of-function mutations in sodium channel Na(v)1.9 in painful neuropathy.	Sodium channel Nav1.9 is expressed in peripheral nociceptive neurons, as well as visceral afferents, and has been shown to act as a threshold channel. Painful peripheral neuropathy represents a significant public health challenge and may involve gain-of-function variants in sodium channels that are preferentially expressed in peripheral sensory neurons. Although gain-of-function variants of peripheral sodium channels Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 have recently been found in painful small fibre neuropathy, the aetiology of peripheral neuropathy in many cases remains unknown. We evaluated 459 patients who were referred for possible painful peripheral neuropathy, and confirmed the diagnosis of small fibre neuropathy in a cohort of 393 patients (369 patients with pure small fibre neuropathy, and small fibre neuropathy together with large fibre involvement in an additional 24 patients). From this cohort of 393 patients with peripheral neuropathy, we sequenced SCN11A in 345 patients without mutations in SCN9A and SCN10A, and found eight variants in 12 patients. Functional profiling by electrophysiological recordings showed that these Nav1.9 mutations confer gain-of-function attributes to the channel, depolarize resting membrane potential of dorsal root ganglion neurons, enhance spontaneous firing, and increase evoked firing of these neurons. Our data show, for the first time, missense mutations of Nav1.9 in individuals with painful peripheral neuropathy. These genetic and functional observations identify missense mutations of Nav1.9 as a cause of painful peripheral neuropathy. 	Brain	D016428 D013485
22883145	20120814	TCTN3 mutations cause Mohr-Majewski syndrome.	Orofaciodigital syndromes (OFDSs) consist of a group of heterogeneous disorders characterized by abnormalities in the oral cavity, face, and digits and associated phenotypic abnormalities that lead to the delineation of 13 OFDS subtypes. Here, by a combined approach of homozygozity mapping and exome ciliary sequencing, we identified truncating TCTN3 mutations as the cause of an extreme form of OFD associated with bone dysplasia, tibial defect, cystic kidneys, and brain anomalies (OFD IV, Mohr-Majewski syndrome). Analysis of 184 individuals with various ciliopathies (OFD, Meckel, Joubert, and short rib polydactyly syndromes) led us to identify four additional truncating TCTN3 mutations in unrelated fetal cases with overlapping Meckel and OFD IV syndromes and one homozygous missense mutation in a family with Joubert syndrome. By exploring roles of TCTN3 in human ciliary related functions, we found that TCTN3 is necessary for transduction of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, as revealed by abnormal processing of GLI3 in patient cells. These results are consistent with the suggested role of its murine ortholog, which forms a complex at the ciliary transition zone with TCTN1 and TCTN2, both of which are also implicated in the transduction of SHH signaling. Overall, our data show the involvement of the transition zone protein TCTN3 in the regulation of the key SHH signaling pathway and that its disruption causes a severe form of ciliopathy, combining features of Meckel and OFD IV syndromes.

27479907	20160802	Distinct genetic architectures for syndromic and nonsyndromic congenital heart defects identified by exome sequencing.	Congenital heart defects (CHDs) have a neonatal incidence of 0.8-1% (refs. 1,2). Despite abundant examples of monogenic CHD in humans and mice, CHD has a low absolute sibling recurrence risk (?2.7%), suggesting a considerable role for de novo mutations (DNMs) and/or incomplete penetrance. De novo protein-truncating variants (PTVs) have been shown to be enriched among the 10% of 'syndromic' patients with extra-cardiac manifestations. We exome sequenced 1,891 probands, including both syndromic CHD (S-CHD, n = 610) and nonsyndromic CHD (NS-CHD, n = 1,281). In S-CHD, we confirmed a significant enrichment of de novo PTVs but not inherited PTVs in known CHD-associated genes, consistent with recent findings. Conversely, in NS-CHD we observed significant enrichment of PTVs inherited from unaffected parents in CHD-associated genes. We identified three genome-wide significant S-CHD disorders caused by DNMs in CHD4, CDK13 and PRKD1. Our study finds evidence for distinct genetic architectures underlying the low sibling recurrence risk in S-CHD and NS-CHD. 	Nat._Genet.	D003160 D016428 D013485
17264802	20070201	Mutations and polymorphisms in the bile salt export pump and the multidrug resistance protein 3 associated with drug-induced liver injury.	Increasing evidence suggests that a genetically determined functional impairment of the hepatocellular efflux transporters bile salt export pump (BSEP, ABCB11) and multidrug resistance protein 3 (MDR3, ABCB4) play a pathophysiological role in the development of drug-induced liver injury. The aim of this study was therefore to describe the extent of genetic variability in ABCB11 and ABCB4 in patients with drug-induced liver injury and to in vitro functionally characterize newly detected ABCB11 mutations and polymorphisms. ABCB11 and ABCB4 were sequenced in 23 patients with drug-induced cholestasis and 13 patients with drug-induced hepatocellular injury. Ninety-five healthy Caucasians served as the control group. Reference and mutant BSEP were expressed in Sf9 cells and ATP-dependent transport of [H]-taurocholate was measured in a rapid filtration assay. Four highly conserved nonsynonymous mutations were specific for drug-induced liver injury [ABCB11: D676Y (drug-induced cholestasis) and G855R (drug-induced cholestasis); ABCB4: I764L (drug-induced cholestasis) and L1082Q (drug-induced hepatocellular injury)]. Furthermore, a polymorphism in exon 13 of ABCB11 (V444A), which is associated with decreased hepatic BSEP expression was significantly more frequent in drug-induced cholestasis patients than in drug-induced hepatocellular injury patients and healthy controls (76 versus 50 and 59% in drug-induced cholestasis patients, drug-induced hepatocellular injury patients and healthy controls, respectively; P&lt;0.05). The in-vitro transport activity of the V444A and the D676Y BSEP constructs was similar, whereas the G855R mutation was nonfunctional. In summary, our data support a role of ABCB11 and ABCB4 mutations and polymorphisms in drug-induced cholestasis. Genotyping of selected patients with acquired cholestasis might help to identify individuals with a genetic predisposition. 	Pharmacogenet._Genomics	D003160 D016428 D013485
21643693	20110607	Novel missense mutation in the TMPRSS6 gene in a Japanese female with iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia.	Iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) is a rare autosomal-recessive disorder hallmarked by hypochromic microcytic anemia, low transferrin saturation, and unresponsiveness to oral iron with partial recovery after parenteral iron administration. The disease is caused by mutations in TMPRSS6 (transmembrane protease serine 6) that prevent inactivation of membrane-bound hemojuvelin, an activator of hepcidin transcription. To date, 38 cases have been characterized and reported in European countries and the United States. In this paper, we describe the first case of a Japanese female with IRIDA, who carried a novel mutation (K253E) in the CUB (complement factor C1r/C1s, urchin embryonic growth factor and bone morphogenetic protein 1) domain of the TMPRSS6 gene.

11175783	20010215	The putative forkhead transcription factor FOXL2 is mutated in blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome.	In type I blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), eyelid abnormalities are associated with ovarian failure. Type II BPES shows only the eyelid defects, but both types map to chromosome 3q23. We have positionally cloned a novel, putative winged helix/forkhead transcription factor gene, FOXL2, that is mutated to produce truncated proteins in type I families and larger proteins in type II. Consistent with an involvement in those tissues, FOXL2 is selectively expressed in the mesenchyme of developing mouse eyelids and in adult ovarian follicles; in adult humans, it appears predominantly in the ovary. FOXL2 represents a candidate gene for the polled/intersex syndrome XX sex-reversal goat. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D013485
7557990	19950520	Isolation and fine mapping of 16 novel human zinc finger-encoding cDNAs identify putative candidate genes for developmental and malignant disorders.	We have isolated and chromosomally fine-mapped 16 novel genes belonging to the human zinc finger Krüppel family (ZNF131-140, 142, 143, 148, 151, 154, and 155), including 1 of the GLI type (ZNF143) and 3 containing a KRAB (Krüppel-associated box) segment (ZNF133, 136, and 140). Based on their map position, several of these ZNF genes are putative candidate genes for both developmental and malignant disorders: ZNF138, ZNF139, and ZNF143 were localized to 7q11.2, 7q21.3-q22.1, and 11p15.3-p15.4, regions involved in deletions and/or translocations associated with Williams syndrome, split hand and foot disease (SHFD1), and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, respectively. ZNF133 was localized to 20p11.2, close to, but probably distinct from, the region deleted in Alagille syndrome. Zinc finger genes mapping to regions commonly deleted in solid tumors included ZNF132, 134, 135, 137, 154, and 155, all located on 19q13 (thyroid adenoma), and ZNF151, at 1p36.1-p36.2 (neuroblastoma, colon cancer, and other tumors). In addition, several of the ZNFs mapped to regions implicated in recurrent chromosomal rearrangements in hematological malignancies (ZNF139, 7q21.3-q22.1; ZNF148, 3q21-q22; ZNF151, 1p36.1-p36.2). The study indicates that the number of ZNF genes in human is large and that systematic isolation and mapping of ZNF genes is a straightforward approach for the identification of novel candidate disease genes.

9765564	19981010	Identification of Candida albicans ALS2 and ALS4 and localization of als proteins to the fungal cell surface.	Additional genes in the growing ALS family of Candida albicans were isolated by PCR screening of a genomic fosmid library with primers designed from the consensus tandem-repeat sequence of ALS1. This procedure yielded fosmids encoding ALS2 and ALS4. ALS2 and ALS4 conformed to the three-domain structure of ALS genes, which consists of a central domain of tandemly repeated copies of a 108-bp motif, an upstream domain of highly conserved sequences, and a domain of divergent sequences 3' of the tandem repeats. Alignment of five predicted Als protein sequences indicated conservation of N- and C-terminal hydrophobic regions which have the hallmarks of secretory signal sequences and glycosylphosphatidylinositol addition sites, respectively. Heterologous expression of an N-terminal fragment of Als1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated function of the putative signal sequence with cleavage following Ala17. This signal sequence cleavage site was conserved in the four other Als proteins analyzed, suggesting identical processing of each protein. Primary-structure features of the five Als proteins suggested a cell-surface localization, which was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence with an anti-Als antiserum. Staining was observed on mother yeasts and germ tubes, although the intensity of staining on the mother yeast decreased with elongation of the germ tube. Similar to other ALS genes, ALS2 and ALS4 were differentially regulated. ALS4 expression was correlated with the growth phase of the culture; ALS2 expression was not observed under many different in vitro growth conditions. The data presented here demonstrate that ALS genes encode cell-surface proteins and support the conclusion that the size and number of Als proteins on the C. albicans cell surface vary with strain and growth conditions.

11178737	20010215	High-resolution genetic mapping of the saccharin preference locus (Sac) and the putative sweet taste receptor (T1R1) gene (Gpr70) to mouse distal Chromosome 4.	The Sac (saccharin preference) locus affecting mouse behavioral and neural responsiveness to sweeteners has been mapped to distal Chr 4. A putative sweet taste receptor, T1R1, has been recently cloned, and the gene encoding it, Gpr70, has also been mapped to mouse distal Chr 4. To assess Gpr70 as a candidate gene for Sac, we compared the Gpr70 sequences of C57BL/6ByJ and 129P3/J mouse strains with different alleles of Sac. Using Gpr70 sequence variation between the C57BL/6ByJ and 129P3/J strains, we conducted a high-resolution analysis of the chromosomal localization of the Gpr70 and Sac loci in the F2 hybrids and 129.B6-Sac partially congenic mice originating from these two strains. The Gpr70 gene maps proximal to Sac, which demonstrates that they are different loci. 	Mamm._Genome	D016428 D013487
15215320	20040625	Molecular evolution and population genetics of duplicated accessory gland protein genes in Drosophila.	To investigate the potential importance of gene duplication in D. melanogaster accessory gland protein (Acp) gene evolution we carried out a computational analysis comparing annotated D. melanogaster Acp genes to the entire D. melanogaster genome. We found that two known Acp genes are actually members of small multigene families. Polymorphism and divergence data from these duplicated genes suggest that in at least four cases, protein divergence between D. melanogaster and D. simulans is a result of directional selection. One putative Acp revealed by our computational analysis shows evidence of a recent selective sweep in a non-African population (but not in an African population). These data support the idea that selection on reproduction-related genes may drive divergence of populations within species, and strengthen the conclusion that Acps may often be under directional selection in Drosophila.

2901990	19881010	Complete amino acid sequence of human intestinal aminopeptidase N as deduced from cloned cDNA.	The complete primary structure (967 amino acids) of an intestinal human aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2) was deduced from the sequence of a cDNA clone. Aminopeptidase N is anchored to the microvillar membrane via an uncleaved signal for membrane insertion. A domain constituting amino acid 250-555 positioned within the catalytic domain shows very clear homology to E. coli aminopeptidase N and contains Zn2+ ligands. Therefore these residues are part of the active site. However, no homology of the anchor/junctional peptide domain is found suggesting that the juxta- and intra-membraneous parts of the molecule have been added/preserved during development. It is speculated that this part carries the apical address. 	FEBS_Lett.	D016428 D013485
18622393	20080716	Hypomethylation of multiple imprinted loci in individuals with transient neonatal diabetes is associated with mutations in ZFP57.	We have previously described individuals presenting with transient neonatal diabetes and showing a variable pattern of DNA hypomethylation at imprinted loci throughout the genome. We now report mutations in ZFP57, which encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor expressed in early development, in seven pedigrees with a shared pattern of mosaic hypomethylation and a conserved range of clinical features. This is the first description of a heritable global imprinting disorder that is compatible with life. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D013485

The histone H1 fraction from gastrula of the sea urchin Parechinus angulosus consists of a multitude of polypeptides with different electrophoretic mobilities. The synthesis of these proteins is programmed. Amino acid composition, electrophoretic properties and sequence homologies identify these as isohistones H1. One of these isohistones atypically binds the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100. 	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D003160 D016428 D013485
16679074	20060509	A family with osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome due to compound heterozygosity of two novel mutations in the LRP5 gene.	Osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome (OPPG) is an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) gene. Here, we report two novel missense mutations found in a southern Chinese family of a non-consanguineous marriage. Three out of four children had blindness, low bone mineral density (BMD) and multiple fractures in their childhood. Genotyping by DNA sequencing demonstrated 2 new mutations in exon 7 of the LRP5 gene. Tryptophans at amino acid residue positions 478 and 504 were replaced by arginine (W478R) and cysteine (W504C), respectively. While the parents that possessed either heterozygous W478R or W504C were apparently normal, all affected subjects were compound heterozygotes for the W478R and W504C mutations in the LRP5 gene. W478R is located immediately C-terminal to the third YWTD repeat of the second YWTD/EGF domain in LRP5, while W504C is located between the third and the fourth YWTD repeats of the second YWTD/EGF domain in LRP5. Using LRP5-related proteins, such as the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and nidogen as reference models, a homology model of LRP5 suggested that the observed mutations may affect the molecular interactions of LRP5 and so lead to the observed OPPG phenotypes.

12592226	20030220	Evaluation of the ELOVL4 gene in patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa and Leber congenital amaurosis.	To determine whether pathogenic mutations exist in the ELOVL4 gene in patients with inherited retinal degenerations other than Stargardt-like macular dystrophy or other hereditary macular degenerations. All six exons comprising the open reading frame of the ELOVL4 gene were evaluated by single-strand conformation analysis, direct nucleotide sequencing, or both methods. No pathogenic mutations were found among 84 patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa or among 51 patients with Leber congenital amaurosis (congenital retinal blindness). These data support the conclusion that recessive retinitis pigmentosa and Leber congenital amaurosis are rarely if ever associated with changes in the ELOVL4 gene. 	Mol._Vis.	D016428 D013485 D013487
9157966	19970501	A novel mosaic protein containing LDL receptor elements is highly conserved in humans and chickens.	Certain receptors belonging to the LDL receptor (LDLR) gene family appear to constitute a newly identified branch whose members are expressed in brain, in addition to other tissues. In support of this concept, we have now discovered the expression and delineated the molecular structures of a representative of this emerging branch from two such diverse species as human and chicken. This membrane receptor, called LR11 and thus far only known to exist in the rabbit, is a complex seven-domain mosaic protein containing, among other structural elements, a cluster of 11 LDLR ligand-binding repeats and a domain with homology to VPS10, a yeast receptor for vacuolar protein sorting. Cytoplasmic signature sequences define the receptor as competent for endocytosis. The most striking properties of LR11s are their (1) high degree of structural conservation (&gt;80% identity among mammals and birds), with 100% identity in the membrane-spanning and cytoplasmic domains of rabbit and human; (2) lack of regulation by cholesterol and estrogen; and (3) expression in brain. The features of LR11 suggest important roles in intercellular and intracellular ligand transport processes, some of which it may share with other brain-specific LDLR family members.

10631141	20000113	High prevalence of pathogenic mutations in patients with early-onset dementia detected by sequence analyses of four different genes.	Clinical differential diagnosis of early-onset dementia (EOD) includes familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) and hereditary prion disease. In both disease entities, postmortem brain histopathological examination is essential for unambiguous diagnosis. Mutations in the genes encoding the presenilins (PS1 and PS2) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) are associated with FAD, whereas mutations in the prion protein (PrP) gene are associated with prion disease. To investigate the proportion of EOD attributable to known genes, we prospectively (i.e., antemortem) screened these four genes for mutations by sequencing genomic PCR products from patients with EOD before age 60 years. Family history for dementia was positive (PFH) in 16 patients, negative (NFH) in 17 patients, and unknown (UFH) in 3 patients. In 12 patients, we found five novel mutations (in PS1, F105L; in PS2, T122P and M239I; and in PrP, Q160X and T188K) and five previously reported mutations (in APP, in three patients who were most likely unrelated, V717I; in PS1, A79V and M139V; and in PrP, P102L and T183A) that are all considered to be disease causing. Of these 12 patients, 9 had PFH. This indicates a detection rate of 56% (9/16) in patients with PFH. We found two mutations (APP V717I) in two of the three UFH patients, and only one mutation (PrP T188K) in 1 of the 17 patients with NFH. We conclude that because of the lack of specific antemortem diagnostic markers for FAD and hereditary prion disease, all four genes should be included in a molecular diagnostic program in patients with EOD who had PFH.

2060627	19910617	Mutation in the sphingolipid activator protein 2 in a patient with a variant of Gaucher disease.	The lysosomal degradation of glucosylceramide requires the hydrolase, glucosylceramide-beta-glucosidase and a sphingolipid activator protein (Gaucher factor, SAP-2, saposin C). Genetic defects in either of these lysosomal proteins cause phenotypically similar disorders in man, the Gaucher disease. SAP-2 originates from a gene which generates a mRNA that codes for four homologous proteins. In a patient with an immunologically proven SAP-2 deficiency a G1154----T transversion (counted from A of the initiation codon ATG) was found in the mRNA of the SAP-2 precursor which results in the substitution of Phe for Cys385 in the mature SAP-2. The rest of the coding sequence remained entirely normal. 	FEBS_Lett.	D002363 D016428 D013485
11890704	20020314	Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I is induced in endothelial cells by LPS and regulates expression of COX-2.	Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induce expression of multiple genes in endothelial cells, which are critical cellular effectors in various pathologic syndromes. Using subtractive hybridization to identify genes that are differentially induced in human endothelial cells treated with LPS, we found that retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is induced in endothelial cells stimulated with LPS. RIG-I encodes a protein belonging to the DExH-box family which has diverse roles in regulation of gene expression and cellular functions. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is also induced in endothelial cells by LPS. Overexpression of RIG-I selectively upregulated expression of COX-2 and also induced COX-2 promoter activity. RIG-I is an inducible gene in stimulated endothelial cells that may have important roles in vascular pathology by virtue of its ability to regulate expression of the COX-2 gene product.

9299468	19970923	Molecular cloning of human MUC3 cDNA reveals a novel 59 amino acid tandem repeat region.	The human MUC3 gene is highly expressed in small intestine and gallbladder. Thus far only 646 basepairs of its cDNA encoding 17 amino acid repeats have been cloned. In order to further clone the human MUC3 cDNA, a human small intestinal cDNA library was constructed and screened with a cDNA probe encompassing the 17 amino acid tandem repeat region of human MUC3. In two subsequent screenings of the library resulting positive clones were used as probes. In total, 27 partial MUC3 cDNA clones were isolated and sequenced that define a semi-unique region and a novel 177 nucleotide tandem repeat region, located upstream of the region encoding the 17 amino acid tandem repeats. The 177 nucleotide repeat region is at least 5 kb in length and encodes 59 amino acid repetitive peptides with a consensus sequence of VSTTPVASSEASTLSTTPVDTSTPVTTSTQASSSPTTAEGTSMPTSTPSEGSTPLTSMP, that is notably different from the 17 amino acid repeat of MUC3 or any other known mucin repeat.

21120950	20101202	Molecular defects in human carbamoy phosphate synthetase I: mutational spectrum, diagnostic and protein structure considerations.	Deficiency of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI) results in hyperammonemia ranging from neonatally lethal to environmentally induced adult-onset disease. Over 24 years, analysis of tissue and DNA samples from 205 unrelated individuals diagnosed with CPSI deficiency (CPSID) detected 192 unique CPS1 gene changes, of which 130 are reported here for the first time. Pooled with the already reported mutations, they constitute a total of 222 changes, including 136 missense, 15 nonsense, 50 changes of other types resulting in enzyme truncation, and 21 other changes causing in-frame alterations. Only ?10% of the mutations recur in unrelated families, predominantly affecting CpG dinucleotides, further complicating the diagnosis because of the &quot;private&quot; nature of such mutations. Missense changes are unevenly distributed along the gene, highlighting the existence of CPSI regions having greater functional importance than other regions. We exploit the crystal structure of the CPSI allosteric domain to rationalize the effects of mutations affecting it. Comparative modeling is used to create a structural model for the remainder of the enzyme. Missense changes are found to directly correlate, respectively, with the one-residue evolutionary importance and inversely correlate with solvent accessibility of the mutated residue. This is the first large-scale report of CPS1 mutations spanning a wide variety of molecular defects highlighting important regions in this protein. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428 D052061 D013485
10220430	19990429	Conservation of sequence and structure flanking the mouse and human beta-globin loci: the beta-globin genes are embedded within an array of odorant receptor genes.	In mouse and human, the beta-globin genes reside in a linear array that is associated with a positive regulatory element located 5' to the genes known as the locus control region (LCR). The sequences of the mouse and human beta-globin LCRs are homologous, indicating conservation of an essential function in beta-globin gene regulation. We have sequenced regions flanking the beta-globin locus in both mouse and human and found that homology associated with the LCR is more extensive than previously known, making up a conserved block of approximately 40 kb. In addition, we have identified DNaseI-hypersensitive sites within the newly sequenced regions in both mouse and human, and these structural features also are conserved. Finally, we have found that both mouse and human beta-globin loci are embedded within an array of odorant receptor genes that are expressed in olfactory epithelium, and we also identify an olfactory receptor gene located 3' of the beta-globin locus in chicken. The data demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved genomic organization for the beta-globin locus and suggest a possible role for the beta-globin LCR in control of expression of these odorant receptor genes and/or the presence of mechanisms to separate regulatory signals in different tissues.

10359825	19990609	A mutation in the human ortholog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ALG6 gene causes carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome type-Ic.	Carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome (CDGS) represents a class of genetic diseases characterized by abnormal N-linked glycosylation. CDGS patients show a large number of glycoprotein abnormalities resulting in dysmorphy, encephalopathy, and other organ disorders. The majority of CDGSs described to date are related to an impaired biosynthesis of dolichyl pyrophosphate-linked Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 in the endoplasmic reticulum. Recently, we identified in four related patients a novel type of CDGS characterized by an accumulation of dolichyl pyrophosphate-linked Man9GlcNAc2. Elaborating on the analogy of this finding with the phenotype of alg5 and alg6 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, we have cloned and analyzed the human orthologs to the ALG5 dolichyl phosphate glucosyltransferase and ALG6 dolichyl pyrophosphate Man9GlcNAc2 alpha1,3-glucosyltransferase in four novel CDGS patients. Although ALG5 was not altered in the patients, a C--&gt;T transition was detected in ALG6 cDNA of all four CDGS patients. The mutation cosegregated with the disease in a Mendelian recessive manner. Expression of the human ALG5 and ALG6 cDNA could partially complement the respective S. cerevisiae alg5 and alg6 deficiency. By contrast, the mutant ALG6 cDNA of CDGS patients failed to revert the hypoglycosylation observed in alg6 yeasts, thereby proving a functional relationship between the alanine to valine substitution introduced by the C--&gt;T transition and the CDGS phenotype. The mutation in the ALG6 alpha1,3-glucosyltransferase gene defines an additional type of CDGS, which we propose to refer to as CDGS type-Ic. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 D013485

9624153	19980623	Liprins, a family of LAR transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase-interacting proteins.	LAR family transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatases function in axon guidance and mammary gland development. In cultured cells, LAR binds to the intracellular, coiled coil LAR-interacting protein at discrete ends of focal adhesions, implicating these proteins in the regulation of cell-matrix interactions. We describe seven LAR-interacting protein-like genes in humans and Caenorhabditis elegans that form the liprin gene family. Based on sequence similarities and binding characteristics, liprins are subdivided into alpha-type and beta-type liprins. The C-terminal, non-coiled coil regions of alpha-liprins bind to the membrane-distal phosphatase domains of LAR family members, as well as to the C-terminal, non-coiled coil region of beta-liprins. Both alpha- and beta-liprins homodimerize via their N-terminal, coiled coil regions. Liprins are thus multivalent proteins that potentially form complex structures. Some liprins have broad mRNA tissue distributions, whereas others are predominately expressed in the brain. Co-expression studies indicate that liprin-alpha2 alters LAR cellular localization and induces LAR clustering. We propose that liprins function to localize LAR family tyrosine phosphatases at specific sites on the plasma membrane, possibly regulating their interaction with the extracellular environment and their association with substrates.

14628291	20031125	Mutations in the ZNF41 gene are associated with cognitive deficits: identification of a new candidate for X-linked mental retardation.	Nonsyndromic X-linked mental retardation (MRX) is defined by an X-linked inheritance pattern of low IQ, problems with adaptive behavior, and the absence of additional specific clinical features. The 13 MRX genes identified to date account for less than one-fifth of all MRX, suggesting that numerous gene defects cause the disorder in other families. In a female patient with severe nonsyndromic mental retardation and a de novo balanced translocation t(X;7)(p11.3;q11.21), we have cloned the DNA fragment that contains the X-chromosomal and the autosomal breakpoint. In silico sequence analysis provided no indication of a causative role for the chromosome 7 breakpoint in mental retardation (MR), whereas, on the X chromosome, a zinc-finger gene, ZNF41, was found to be disrupted. Expression studies indicated that ZNF41 transcripts are absent in the patient cell line, suggesting that the mental disorder in this patient results from loss of functional ZNF41. Moreover, screening of a panel of patients with MRX led to the identification of two other ZNF41 mutations that were not found in healthy control individuals. A proline-to-leucine amino acid exchange is present in affected members of one family with MRX. A second family carries an intronic splice-site mutation that results in loss of specific ZNF41 splice variants. Wild-type ZNF41 contains a highly conserved transcriptional repressor domain that is linked to mechanisms of chromatin remodeling, a process that is defective in various other forms of MR. Our results suggest that ZNF41 is critical for cognitive development; further studies aim to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which ZNF41 alterations lead to MR. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.

Muscle-eye-brain disease is a congenital muscular dystrophy with eye and brain involvement due to POMGnT1 mutations. To describe the clinical and molecular features of 3 Italian patients with POMGnT1 mutations. Case reports. One patient had muscle and brain abnormalities without eye involvement. Two patients had a classic muscle-eye-brain disease phenotype with different levels of clinical severity. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed cortical malformation and posterior fossa involvement. Immunofluorescence for glycosylated alpha-dystroglycan performed on muscle biopsy specimens demonstrated an absent signal in 1 patient and reduced staining in 2 patients. Molecular analysis identified 5 mutations, 2 of which are novel. This article adds to what is known about the genotype-phenotype correlation and expands our awareness of the clinical spectrum associated with POMGnT1 mutations. 	Arch._Neurol.

16094673	20050812	Missense mutations in N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase alpha/beta subunit gene in a patient with mucolipidosis III and a mild clinical phenotype.	Mucolipidosis type III (ML III, pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy), an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of lysosomal enzyme targeting is due to a defective N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphotransferase (phosphotransferase) activity and leads to the impaired formation of mannose 6-phosphate markers in soluble lysosomal enzymes followed by their increased excretion into the serum. Mutations in the phosphotransferase gamma subunit gene (GNPTAG) have been reported to be responsible for ML III. Here we report on a 14-year-old adolescent with a mild clinical phenotype of ML III. He presented with progressive joint stiffness and swelling. Urinary oligosaccharide and mucopolysaccharide excretion was normal. Lysosomal enzyme activities were significantly elevated in the serum and decreased in cultured fibroblasts. Impaired trafficking of the lysosomal protease cathepsin D (CtsD) was confirmed by metabolic labeling of the patient's fibroblasts. Neither mutations in the GNPTAG gene nor alterations in the GNPTAG mRNA level were detected whereas the steady state concentration of the 97 kDa GNPTAG dimer was reduced. Most importantly, the patient is homozygous for a pathogenic nucleotide substitution and a polymorphism in the phosphotransferase alpha/beta subunit gene (GNPTA). The data indicate that defects in genes other than GNPTAG can be linked to ML III contributing to the variability of the phenotype. 	Am._J._Med._Genet._A	D002363 D016428 D013485
17584854	20070623	Large spectrum of lissencephaly and pachygyria phenotypes resulting from de novo missense mutations in tubulin alpha 1A (TUBA1A).	We have recently reported a missense mutation in exon 4 of the tubulin alpha 1A (Tuba1a) gene in a hyperactive N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) induced mouse mutant with abnormal lamination of the hippocampus. Neuroanatomical similarities between the Tuba1a mutant mouse and mice deficient for Doublecortin (Dcx) and Lis1 genes, and the well-established functional interaction between DCX and microtubules (MTs), led us to hypothesize that mutations in TUBA1A (TUBA3, previous symbol), the human homolog of Tuba1a, might give rise to cortical malformations. This hypothesis was subsequently confirmed by the identification of TUBA1A mutations in two patients with lissencephaly and pachygyria, respectively. Here we report additional TUBA1A mutations identified in six unrelated patients with a large spectrum of brain dysgeneses. The de novo occurrence was shown for all mutations, including one recurrent mutation (c.790C&gt;T, p.R264C) detected in two patients, and two mutations that affect the same amino acid (c.1205G&gt;A, p.R402H; c.1204C&gt;T, p.R402C) detected in two other patients. Retrospective examination of MR images suggests that patients with TUBA1A mutations share not only cortical dysgenesis, but also cerebellar, hippocampal, corpus callosum, and brainstem abnormalities. Interestingly, the specific high level of Tuba1a expression throughout the period of central nervous system (CNS) development, shown by in situ hybridization using mouse embryos, is in accordance with the brain-restricted developmental phenotype caused by TUBA1A mutations. All together, these results, in combination with previously reported data, strengthen the relevance of the known interaction between MTs and DCX, and highlight the importance of the MTs/DCX complex in the neuronal migration process.

16201836	20051006	Emergence of young human genes after a burst of retroposition in primates.	The origin of new genes through gene duplication is fundamental to the evolution of lineage- or species-specific phenotypic traits. In this report, we estimate the number of functional retrogenes on the lineage leading to humans generated by the high rate of retroposition (retroduplication) in primates. Extensive comparative sequencing and expression studies coupled with evolutionary analyses and simulations suggest that a significant proportion of recent retrocopies represent bona fide human genes. We estimate that at least one new retrogene per million years emerged on the human lineage during the past approximately 63 million years of primate evolution. Detailed analysis of a subset of the data shows that the majority of retrogenes are specifically expressed in testis, whereas their parental genes show broad expression patterns. Consistently, most retrogenes evolved functional roles in spermatogenesis. Proteins encoded by X chromosome-derived retrogenes were strongly preserved by purifying selection following the duplication event, supporting the view that they may act as functional autosomal substitutes during X-inactivation of late spermatogenesis genes. Also, some retrogenes acquired a new or more adapted function driven by positive selection. We conclude that retroduplication significantly contributed to the formation of recent human genes and that most new retrogenes were progressively recruited during primate evolution by natural and/or sexual selection to enhance male germline function.

11968089	20020423	Low-density DNA microarrays are versatile tools to screen for known mutations in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.	Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM or CMH) is a myocardial disorder caused by mutations that affect the contractile machinery of heart muscle cells. Genetic testing of HCM patients is hampered by the fact that mutations in at least eight different genes contribute to the disease. An affordable high-throughput mutation detection method is as yet not available. Since a significant number of mutations have been repeatedly found in unrelated families, we consider it feasible to pre-screen patients for known mutations, before more laborious techniques capable of detecting new mutations are applied. Here we demonstrate that the principle of hybridization of DNA to oligonucleotide probes immobilized on chips (glass slides) can be applied for this purpose. We have developed a low-density oligonucleotide probe array capable of detecting 12 different heterozygous mutations (in four different genes), among them single- and double-base exchanges, a single nucleotide insertion, and a trinucleotide deletion. The assay is simple and may be amenable to automation. Detection is achieved with a CCD camera-based fluorescence biochip reader. The technique turned out to be robust: Variations in either the relative position of a mutation, or the amount and size of target-DNA were compatible with mutation detection. Mutations could even be detected in amplicons as long as 800 bp, allowing the screening of more than one exon in one amplicon. Our data suggest that the development of a chip that covers all or most of known HCM-associated mutations is feasible and useful. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428
7575533	19950925	Galactose stabilizes various missense mutants of alpha-galactosidase in Fabry disease.	The effect of galactose on alpha-galactosidase missense mutants causing Fabry disease was investigated in the COS-1 cell expression system and lymphoblasts. Three mutant enzymes, A156V, L166V and Q279E, showed increases in activity and amount in COS-1 cells cultured with galactose. Another mutant without catalytic activity, C142Y, did not show any changes. In lymphoblasts cultured with galactose, the enzyme activity increased significantly in four classical Fabry patients with the respective mutations, A156V, L166V, G260A and G373S, and in three atypical Fabry patients with the respective mutations, Q279E, R301Q and M296I. Such an increase was not observed in the other four classical Fabry patients, with C142Y, E66Q/R112C, G328R and N320K, respectively. This suggests that many missense mutations in the alpha-galactosidase gene causing Fabry disease allow the expression of catalytically active mutant enzymes regardless of the clinical phenotype, which are rapidly degraded under physiological conditions and stabilized by galactose.

9585331	19980519	Homozygous alpha-sarcoglycan mutation in two siblings: one asymptomatic and one steroid-responsive mild limb-girdle muscular dystrophy patient.	We describe a couple of siblings who have a homozygous mutation in the alpha-sarcoglycan gene and present a striking clinical difference in their phenotype; the brother is asymptomatic, and the sister is affected with mild limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Drug therapy with a new steroid (deflazacort) was done over 6 months in the mild limb-girdle patient, and we observed objective benefit in muscle strength and in functional tests. Side effects were minimal. Immunohistochemistry for alpha-sarcoglycan showed reduced intensity of reaction in the limb-girdle dystrophy patient and was similar to normal in the asymptomatic case. A reduced amount of residual alpha-sarcoglycan protein level was found in their muscle biopsies. Unknown epigenetic or environmental factors may have an important role in determining protein and clinical phenotype expression. This is the first report of a patient with homozygous sarcoglycan gene mutation without overt muscle weakness in his adulthood. The spectrum of clinical phenotypes in sarcoglycanopathies is therefore wider than previously thought. 	Muscle_Nerve	D016428 D013485
19413330	20090506	Lys-N and trypsin cover complementary parts of the phosphoproteome in a refined SCX-based approach.	The analysis of proteome-wide phosphorylation events is still a major analytical challenge because of the enormous complexity of protein phosphorylation networks. In this work, we evaluate the complementarity of Lys-N, Lys-C, and trypsin with regard to their ability to contribute to the global analysis of the phosphoproteome. A refined version of low-pH strong cation exchange was used to efficiently separate N-terminally acetylated, phosphorylated, and nonmodified peptides. A total of 5036 nonredundant phosphopeptides could be identified with a false discovery rate of &lt;1% from 1 mg of protein using a combination of the three enzymes. Our data revealed that the overlap between the phosphopeptide data sets generated with different proteases was marginal, whereas the overlap between two similarly generated tryptic data sets was found to be at least 4 times higher. In this way, the parallel use of Lys-N and trypsin enabled a 72% increase in the number of detected phosphopeptides as compared to trypsin alone, whereas a trypsin replicate experiment only led to a 25% increase. Thus, when focusing solely on the trypsin and Lys-N data, we identified 4671 nonredundant phosphopeptides. Further analysis of the detected sites showed that the Lys-N and trypsin data sets were enriched in significantly different phosphorylation motifs, further evidencing that multiprotease approaches are very valuable in phosphoproteome analyses.

8317498	19930701	Mutation in type II procollagen (COL2A1) that substitutes aspartate for glycine alpha 1-67 and that causes cataracts and retinal detachment: evidence for molecular heterogeneity in the Wagner syndrome and the Stickler syndrome (arthro-ophthalmopathy)	A search for mutations in the gene for type II procollagen (COL2A1) was carried out in affected members of a family with early-onset cataracts, lattice degeneration of the retina, and retinal detachment. They had no symptoms suggestive of involvement of nonocular tissues, as is typically found in the Stickler syndrome. The COL2A1 gene was amplified with PCR, and the products were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The results suggested a mutation in one allele for exon 10. Sequencing of the fragment demonstrated a single-base mutation that converted the codon for glycine at position alpha 1-67 to aspartate. The mutation was found in three affected members of the family available for study but not in unaffected members or 100 unrelated individuals. Comparison with previously reported mutations suggested that mutations introducing premature termination codons in the COL2A1 gene are a frequent cause of the Stickler syndrome, but mutations in the COL2A1 gene that replace glycine codons with codons for bulkier amino acid can produce a broad spectrum of disorders that range from lethal chondrodysplasias to a syndrome involving only ocular tissues, similar to the syndrome in the family originally described by Wagner in 1938.

We have recently shown that the hemorrhagic destruction of the brain, subependymal, calcification, and congenital cataracts is caused by biallelic mutations in the gene encoding junctional adhesion molecule 3 (JAM3) protein. Affected members from three new families underwent detailed clinical examination including imaging of the brain. Affected individuals presented with a distinctive phenotype comprising hemorrhagic destruction of the brain, subependymal calcification, and congenital cataracts. All patients had a catastrophic clinical course resulting in death. Sequencing the coding exons of JAM3 revealed three novel homozygous mutations: c.2T&gt;G (p.M1R), c.346G&gt;A (p.E116K), and c.656G&gt;A (p.C219Y). The p.M1R mutation affects the start codon and therefore is predicted to impair protein synthesis. Cellular studies showed that the p.C219Y mutation resulted in a significant retention of the mutated protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting a trafficking defect. The p.E116K mutant traffics normally to the plasma membrane as the wild-type and may have lost its function due to the lack of interaction with an interacting partner. Our data further support the importance of JAM3 in the development and function of the vascular system and the brain. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428 D052061 D013485
12672064	20030403	Natural killer cell receptors in cattle: a bovine killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor multigene family contains members with divergent signaling motifs.	Natural killer (NK) cells recognize and kill certain tumor cells, virally infected cells and MHC class I-disparate normal hematopoietic cells. NK cell cytotoxicity is regulated by a multitude of receptors with either activating or inhibitory signaling function. We here report the molecular cloning of bovine CD94 [killer cell lectin-like receptor (KLR)-D1] and NKp46 orthologues, four members of a bovine CD158 [killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)] family, and a novel KLR. This novel receptor was termed KLRJ1 and is most similar to Ly-49 (KLRA). The KLRD1 and KLRJ1 loci were mapped to a bovine NK gene complex on chromosome 5 by radiation hybrid mapping, whereas KIR2DL1 and NKP46 were localized to chromosome 18. Two of the bovine KIR(KIR2DL1 and KIR3DL1) contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIM), suggesting an inhibitory function. Bovine KIR2DS1 and KIR3DS1 lack ITIM but have an arginine-containing motif in their transmembrane domain, similar to primate KIR2DL4. Thus, KIR multigene families with divergent signaling motifs do not only exist in primates. Based on sequence comparison, it appears that the primate and bovine KIR multigene families may have evolved independently. 	Eur._J._Immunol.	D016428 D013485
9989976	19990217	Endotoxin-tolerant mice have mutations in Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4)	Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) provokes a vigorous, generalized proinflammatory state in the infected host. Genetic regulation of this response has been localized to the Lps locus on mouse chromosome 4, through study of the C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCr inbred strains. Both C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCr mice are homozygous for a mutant Lps allele (Lpsd/d) that confers hyporesponsiveness to LPS challenge, and therefore exhibit natural tolerance to its lethal effects. Genetic and physical mapping of 1,345 backcross progeny segregating this mutant phenotype confined Lps to a 0.9-cM interval spanning 1.7 Mb. Three transcription units were identified within the candidate interval, including Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4), part of a protein family with members that have been implicated in LPS-induced cell signaling. C3H/HeJ mice have a point mutation within the coding region of the Tlr4 gene, resulting in a nonconservative substitution of a highly conserved proline by histidine at codon 712, whereas C57BL/ 10ScCr mice exhibit a deletion of Tlr4. Identification of distinct mutations involving the same gene at the Lps locus in two different hyporesponsive inbred mouse strains strongly supports the hypothesis that altered Tlr4 function is responsible for endotoxin tolerance.

10806195	20000512	Cloning of two human thyroid cDNAs encoding new members of the NADPH oxidase family.	Two cDNAs encoding NADPH oxidases and constituting the thyroid H(2)O(2) generating system have been cloned. The strategy of cloning was based on the functional similarities between H(2)O(2) generation in leukocytes and the thyroid, according to the hypothesis that one of the components of the thyroid system would belong to the gp91(Phox)/Mox1 gene family and display sequence similarities with gp91(Phox). Screening at low stringency with a gp91(Phox) probe of cDNA libraries from thyroid cells in primary culture yielded two distinct human cDNA clones harboring open reading frames of 1551 (ThOX1) and 1548 amino acids (ThOX2), respectively. The encoded polypeptides display 83% sequence similarity and are clearly related to gp91(Phox) (53 and 47% similarity). The theoretical molecular mass of 177 kDa is close to the apparent molecular mass of 180 kDa of the native corresponding porcine flavoprotein and the protein(s) detected by Western blot in dog and human thyroid. ThOX1 and ThOX2 display sequence similarities of 53% and 61%, respectively, with a predicted protein of Caenorhabditis elegans over their entire length. They show along their first 500 amino acids a similarity of 43% with thyroperoxidase. The corresponding genes of ThOX1 and ThOX2 are closely linked on chromosome 15q15.3. The dog mRNA expression is thyroid-specific and up-regulated by agents activating the cAMP pathway as is the synthesis of the polypeptides they are coding for. In human thyroid the positive regulation by cAMP is less pronounced. The proteins ThOX1 and ThOX2 accumulate at the apical membrane of thyrocytes and are co-localized with thyroperoxidase.

22073189	20111111	Exome-sequencing confirms DNAJC5 mutations as cause of adult neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis.	We performed whole-exome sequencing in two autopsy-confirmed cases and an elderly unaffected control from a multigenerational family with autosomal dominant neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (ANCL). A novel single-nucleotide variation (c.344T&gt;G) in the DNAJC5 gene was identified. Mutational screening in an independent family with autosomal dominant ANCL found an in-frame single codon deletion (c.346_348 delCTC) resulting in a deletion of p.Leu116del. These variants fulfill all genetic criteria for disease-causing mutations: they are found in unrelated families with the same disease, exhibit complete segregation between the mutation and the disease, and are absent in healthy controls. In addition, the associated amino acid substitutions are located in evolutionarily highly conserved residues and are predicted to functionally affect the encoded protein (CSP?). The mutations are located in a cysteine-string domain, which is required for membrane targeting/binding, palmitoylation, and oligomerization of CSP?. We performed a comprehensive in silico analysis of the functional and structural impact of both mutations on CSP?. We found that these mutations dramatically decrease the affinity of CSP? for the membrane. We did not identify any significant effect on palmitoylation status of CSP?. However, a reduction of CSP? membrane affinity may change its palmitoylation and affect proper intracellular sorting. We confirm that CSP? has a strong intrinsic aggregation propensity; however, it is not modified by the mutations. A complementary disease-network analysis suggests a potential interaction with other NCLs genes/pathways. This is the first replication study of the identification of DNAJC5 as the disease-causing gene for autosomal dominant ANCL. The identification of the novel gene in ANCL will allow us to gain a better understanding of the pathological mechanism of ANCLs and constitutes a great advance toward the development of new molecular diagnostic tests and may lead to the development of potential therapies.

20876471	20100930	Mutations in SACS cause atypical and late-onset forms of ARSACS.	Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in SACS. The phenotype consists of a childhood-onset triad of cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and pyramidal tract signs. To provide more insight into the prevalence of SACS mutations and the variability of the associated phenotype. Mutation screening of SACS by direct sequencing and multiplex amplicon quantification for detection of intragenic copy number variations in a cohort of 85 index patients with phenotypes suggestive for ARSACS. Additional short tandem repeat (STR) marker analysis was performed for haplotype sharing. In 11 families,18 new SACS mutations were found (12.9% of total cohort). Five patients displayed onset ages in adulthood, a feature not known to be associated with ARSACS. The remaining index patients displayed a classic early onset phenotype. Initial phenotypic presentation was atypical in several patients, obscuring the clinical diagnosis. A founder mutation in SACS was identified in 3 Belgian families. In one isolated patient, an intragenic SACS deletion of exons 3-5 was detected. Partial SACS deletions were not previously described. In this study, we enlarge the ARSACS phenotype and the underlying genetic spectrum of SACS mutations. Patients with ARSACS are more common than previously known and risk underdiagnosis due to late onset age and unusual presentation. 	Neurology	D016428 D013485
7781776	19950529	Primary structure and expression of a novel human laminin alpha 4 chain.	The complete primary structure of a novel human laminin alpha 4 chain was derived from cDNA clones. The translation product contains a 24-residue signal peptide preceding the mature alpha 4 chain of 1792 residues. The domain structure is similar to that of the recently described alpha 3 chain [Ryan, Tizard, Van Devanter and Carter (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 22779-22787]. Northern analysis of RNA from human fetal and adult tissues revealed developmental regulation of expression. In adult, strong expression was observed in heart as well as lung, ovary, small and large intestines, placenta and liver, whereas weak or no expression was detected in skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, testis, prostate or brain. In contrast, fetal lung and kidney revealed high expression. In situ hybridization analysis of human fetal and newborn tissues showed expression of the laminin in alpha 4 chain in certain mesenchymal cells in tissues such as smooth muscle and dermis.

24130121	20131017	Correlation of phenotype/genotype in a cohort of 23 xeroderma pigmentosum-variant patients reveals 12 new disease-causing POLH mutations.	Xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XP-V) is a rare genetic disease, characterized by some sunlight sensitivity and predisposition to cutaneous malignancies. We described clinical and genetic features of the largest collection ever published of 23 XPV patients (ages between 21 and 86) from 20 unrelated families. Primary fibroblasts from patients showed normal nucleotide excision repair but UV-hypersensitivity in the presence of caffeine, a signature of the XP-V syndrome. 87% of patients developed skin tumors with a median age of 21 for the first occurrence. The median numbers of basal-cell carcinoma was 13 per patient, six for squamous-cell carcinoma, and five for melanoma. XP-V is due to defects in the translesion-synthesis DNA polymerase Pol? coded by the POLH gene. DNA sequencing of POLH revealed 29 mutations, where 12 have not been previously identified, leading to truncated polymerases in 69% of patients. Four missense mutations are correlated with the protein stability by structural modeling of the Pol? polymerase domain. There is a clear relationship between the types of missense mutations and clinical severity. For truncating mutations, which lead to an absence of or to inactive proteins, the life-cumulated UV exposure is probably the best predictor of cancer incidence, reinforcing the necessity to protect XP-Vs from sun exposure.

8317502	19930701	Identification of novel rhodopsin mutations responsible for retinitis pigmentosa: implications for the structure and function of rhodopsin.	Ten rhodopsin mutations have been found in a screen of 282 subjects with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), 76 subjects with Leber congenital amaurosis, and 3 subjects with congenital stationary night blindness. Eight of these mutations (gly51-to-ala, val104-to-ile, gly106-to-arg, arg135-to-gly, cys140-to-ser, gly188-to-glu, val209-to-met, and his211-to-arg) produce amino acid substitutions, one (gln64-to-ter) introduces a stop codon, and one changes a guanosine in the intron 4 consensus splice donor sequence to thymidine. Cosegregation of RP with gln64-to-ter, gly106-to-arg, arg135-to-gly, cys140-to-ser, gly188-to-glu, his211-to-arg, and the splice site guanosine-to-thymidine indicates that these mutations are likely to cause retinal disease. Val104-to-ile does not cosegregate and is therefore unlikely to be related to retinal disease. The relevance of gly51-to-ala and val209-to-met remains to be determined. The finding of gln64-to-ter in a family with autosomal dominant RP is in contrast to a recent report of a recessive disease phenotype associated with the rhodopsin mutation glu249-to-ter. In the present screen, all of the mutations that cosegregate with retinal disease were found among patients with RP. The mutations described here bring to 35 the total number of amino acid substitutions identified thus far in rhodopsin that are associated with RP. The distribution of the substitutions along the polypeptide chain is significantly nonrandom: 63% of the substitutions involve those 19% of amino acids that are identical among vertebrate visual pigments sequenced to date.

12821155	20030625	ABCA10, a novel cholesterol-regulated ABCA6-like ABC transporter.	We recently identified several novel members of the A subclass of ABC transporters. In this study, we report the cloning of an additional ABC A subfamily transporter, denoted ABCA10, from macrophages. The coding sequence of ABCA10 is of 4.6 kb size and codes for a 1543-amino acid protein that bears the structural features of a full-size ABC transporter. Intriguingly, ABCA10 contains a PEST sequence downstream of the N-terminal transmembrane domain which may be potentially involved in the control of its turnover rate by proteasomal degradation. Several distinct ABCA10 transcripts are expressed in human macrophages that predict the existence of various truncated forms of the novel transporter. Moreover, we identified seven single nucleotide polymorphisms in ABCA10 transcripts. ABCA10 displays high amino acid sequence homology with ABCA6 (63%), ABCA8 (62%), and ABCA9 (63%), respectively, known members of the subgroup of ABCA6-like transporters. Like other transporters of this subfamily, ABCA10 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed and highest gene expression levels are detectable in heart, brain, and the gastrointestinal tract. Analysis of the gene structure demonstrated that the ABCA10 gene consists of 40 exons that extend across a genomic region of approximately 97kb size (Chr. 17q24.3). ABCA10 mRNA is expressed in similar quantities in monocytes and M-CSF differentiated macrophages. Importantly, ABCA10 expression is suppressed by cholesterol import into macrophages, indicating that it is a cholesterol-responsive gene. Our results identify ABCA10 as a novel member of the group of ABCA6-like transporters and suggest its involvement in macrophage lipid homeostasis. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.	D016428 D013485
9529364	19980613	Identification of constitutional WT1 mutations, in patients with isolated diffuse mesangial sclerosis, and analysis of genotype/phenotype correlations by use of a computerized mutation database.	Constitutional mutations of the WT1 gene, encoding a zinc-finger transcription factor involved in renal and gonadal development, are found in most patients with Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS), or diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS) associated with pseudohermaphroditism and/or Wilms tumor (WT). Most mutations in DDS patients lie in exon 8 or exon 9, encoding zinc finger 2 or zinc finger 3, respectively, with a hot spot (R394W) in exon 9. We analyzed a series of 24 patients, 10 with isolated DMS (IDMS), 10 with DDS, and 4 with urogenital abnormalities and/or WT. We report WT1 heterozygous mutations in 16 patients, 4 of whom presented with IDMS. One male and two female IDMS patients with WT1 mutations underwent normal puberty. Two mutations associated with IDMS are different from those described in DDS patients. No WT1 mutations were detected in the six other IDMS patients, suggesting genetic heterogeneity of this disease. We analyzed genotype/phenotype correlations, on the basis of the constitution of a WT1 mutation database of 84 germ-line mutations, to compare the distribution and type of mutations, according to the different symptoms. This demonstrated (1) the association between mutations in exons 8 and 9 and DMS; (2) among patients with DMS, a higher frequency of exon 8 mutations among 46, XY patients with female phenotype than among 46,XY patients with sexual ambiguity or male phenotype; and (3) statistically significant evidence that mutations in exons 8 and 9 preferentially affect amino acids with different functions.

9090885	19970301	The Arabidopsis NIM1 protein shows homology to the mammalian transcription factor inhibitor I kappa B.	The NIM1 (for noninducible immunity) gene product is involved in the signal transduction cascade leading to both systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and gene-for-gene disease resistance in Arabidopsis. We have isolated and characterized five new alleles of nim1 that show a range of phenotypes from weakly impaired in chemically induced pathogenesis-related protein-1 gene expression and fungal resistance to very strongly blocked. We have isolated the NIM1 gene by using a map-based cloning procedure. Interestingly, the NIM1 protein shows sequence homology to the mammalian signal transduction factor I kappa B subclass alpha. NF-kappa B/I kappa B signaling pathways are implicated in disease resistance responses in a range of organisms from Drosophila to mammals, suggesting that the SAR signaling pathway in plants is representative of an ancient and ubiquitous defense mechanism in higher organisms.

8514894	19930601	Skeletal muscle expression and abnormal function of beta-myosin in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.	Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an important inherited disease. The phenotype has been linked, in some kindreds, to the beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC) gene. Missense and silent mutations in the beta-MHC gene were used as markers to demonstrate the expression of mutant and normal cardiac beta-MHC gene message in skeletal muscle of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients. Mutant beta-myosin, also shown to be present in skeletal muscle by Western blot analysis, translocated actin filaments slower than normal controls in an in vitro motility assay. Thus, single amino acid changes in beta-myosin result in abnormal actomyosin interactions, confirming the primary role of missense mutations in beta-MHC gene in the etiology of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

8571957	19960201	Molecular analysis of a series of alleles in humans with reduced activity at the triosephosphate isomerase locus.	Individuals with 50% of expected triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) enzyme activity have been previously identified in families during the screening of approximately 2,000 newborn children for quantitative variation in activity of 12 erythrocyte enzymes. The frequency of the trait was 9/1,713 individuals in the Caucasian population and 7/168 individuals among the African-American population studied. Genetic transmission of the trait was confirmed in all families. The frequency of the presumptive deficiency allele(s) at the TPI locus was greater than expected, given the reported incidence of clinical TPI deficiency. We report the molecular characterization of the variant alleles from seven African-American and three Caucasian individuals in this group of unrelated individuals. Three amino acid substitutions--a Gly--&gt;Ala substitution at residue 72, a Val--&gt;Met at residue 154, and a previously described Glu--&gt;Asp substitution at residue 104--were identified in the Caucasian individuals. The substitutions occur at residues that are not directly involved in the active site but are highly conserved through evolutionary time, suggesting important roles for these residues in maintenance of subunit structure and conformation. The variant allele in the seven African-American individuals had nucleotide changes at positions -8 and -5 (5' of) from the transcription-initiation site. In three of these individuals, an additional T--&gt;G substitution was detected in a TATA box-like sequence located 24 nucleotides 5' of the transcription-initiation site and on the same chromosome as the -5/-8 substitutions. Thus, molecular alterations at the TPI locus were detected in 10 unrelated individuals in whom segregation of a phenotype of reduced TPI activity previously had been identified. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.

11349230	20010512	The molecular basis of X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda.	The X-linked form of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda (SEDL), a radiologically distinct skeletal dysplasia affecting the vertebrae and epiphyses, is caused by mutations in the SEDL gene. To characterize the molecular basis for SEDL, we have identified the spectrum of SEDL mutations in 30 of 36 unrelated cases of X-linked SEDL ascertained from different ethnic populations. Twenty-one different disease-associated mutations now have been identified throughout the SEDL gene. These include nonsense mutations in exons 4 and 5, missense mutations in exons 4 and 6, small (2-7 bp) and large (&gt;1 kb) deletions, insertions, and putative splicing errors, with one splicing error due to a complex deletion/insertion mutation. Eight different frameshift mutations lead to a premature termination of translation and account for &gt;43% (13/30) of SEDL cases, with half of these (7/13) being due to dinucleotide deletions. Altogether, deletions account for 57% (17/30) of all known SEDL mutations. Four recurrent mutations (IVS3+5G--&gt;A, 157-158delAT, 191-192delTG, and 271-275delCAAGA) account for 43% (13/30) of confirmed SEDL cases. The results of haplotype analyses and the diverse ethnic origins of patients support recurrent mutations. Two patients with large deletions of SEDL exons were found, one with childhood onset of painful complications, the other relatively free of additional symptoms. However, we could not establish a clear genotype/phenotype correlation and therefore conclude that the complete unaltered SEDL-gene product is essential for normal bone growth. Molecular diagnosis can now be offered for presymptomatic testing of this disorder. Appropriate lifestyle decisions and, eventually, perhaps, specific SEDL therapies may ameliorate the prognosis of premature osteoarthritis and the need for hip arthroplasty. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.

10051407	19990303	Structure of the human palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-2 gene (PPT2) in the major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6p21.3.	Palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-2 (PPT2) is a homolog of PPT1, the enzyme that is deficient in the lysosomal storage disorder, infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). As a first step toward determining whether mutations in the gene encoding PPT2 (PPT2) are associated with any of the molecularly uncharacterized forms of NCL, we report here the structure and chromosomal localization of human PPT2. PPT2 spans about 10 kb and is composed of nine exons. One major (2.0 kb) and two minor (7.0 and 2.8 kb) mRNAs are transcribed from the gene, and the larger transcripts appear to be messenger RNAs in which PPT2 exons are spliced into a downstream gene encoding a homolog of human latent transforming growth factor-beta binding protein (human LTBP). PPT2 is located in the human major histocompatibility class III locus on chromosome 6p21.3, a position that rules out PPT2 as the causative gene in any of the NCLs at defined chromosomal loci. No mutations were detected by SSCP analysis in a preliminary analysis of 12 subjects referred with a suspected diagnosis of infantile NCL who had normal PPT activity. However, five single nucleotide polymorphisms were found in unrelated normal individuals. These polymorphisms (and a microsatellite discovered within PPT2) will aid in the further delineation of the possible role of PPT2 in lysosomal storage disorders of unknown etiology.

10329005	19990518	The presynaptic cytomatrix protein Bassoon: sequence and chromosomal localization of the human BSN gene.	Bassoon is a novel 420-kDa protein recently identified as a component of the cytoskeleton at presynaptic neurotransmitter release sites. Analysis of the rat and mouse sequences revealed a polyglutamine stretch in the C-terminal part of the protein. Since it is known for some proteins that abnormal amplification of such polyglutamine regions can cause late-onset neurodegeneration, we cloned and localized the human BASSOON gene (BSN). Phage clones spanning most of the open reading frame and the 3' untranslated region were isolated from a human genomic library and used for chromosomal localization of BSN to chromosome 3p21 by FISH. The localization was confirmed by PCR on rodent/human somatic cell hybrids; it is consistent with the localization of the murine Bsn gene at chromosome 9F. Sequencing revealed a polyglutamine stretch of only five residues in human, and PCR amplifications from 50 individuals showed no obvious length polymorphism in this region. Analysis of the primary structure of Bassoon and comparison to previous database entries provide evidence for a newly emerging protein family. 	Genomics	D016428 D013485 D013487
7508181	19940201	Preferential sites in keratin 10 that are mutated in epidermolytic hyperkeratosis.	Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (EH) is a rare autosomal dominant skin disease. Recent studies in our laboratory established genetic linkage to the type II keratin gene locus on chromosome 12q in one family with EH and identified a single amino acid mutation in keratin 1 that is responsible for the disease. Other point mutations in the keratin 1 or keratin 10 genes have now been reported in other patients with EH. We have examined a series of probands with EH in order to develop a catalog of mutations in keratin 10. Using direct sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic DNA, we have identified mutations in six families, in which five mutations occur in the beginning of the 1A rod domain of keratin 10-namely, two ARg10 to His, one Arg10 to Cys, and Asn8 to His, and a Tyr14 to Asp. This region contains highly conserved residues among all keratins. An additional mutation (Leu103 to Gln) was found in the conserved region late in the 2B rod domain in keratin 10. We developed several allele-specific assays to assess the frequency of these mutations in the general population. No evidence was found for the presence of such changes in unaffected individuals. In vitro functional assays performed with peptides corresponding to the 1A mutations in these families show severely diminished capacity to disaggregate preformed keratin intermediate filaments, in comparison with a wild-type control peptide. Results from this work support the hypothesis that the beginning of the 1A rod domain segment in keratin 10 contains preferential sites for disease-causing mutation in EH. This should be of considerable use when developing prenatal diagnostic tests and biologically based therapies for this disease. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428
16020725	20050716	The genome sequence of Trypanosoma cruzi, etiologic agent of Chagas disease.	Whole-genome sequencing of the protozoan pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi revealed that the diploid genome contains a predicted 22,570 proteins encoded by genes, of which 12,570 represent allelic pairs. Over 50% of the genome consists of repeated sequences, such as retrotransposons and genes for large families of surface molecules, which include trans-sialidases, mucins, gp63s, and a large novel family (&gt;1300 copies) of mucin-associated surface protein (MASP) genes. Analyses of the T. cruzi, T. brucei, and Leishmania major (Tritryp) genomes imply differences from other eukaryotes in DNA repair and initiation of replication and reflect their unusual mitochondrial DNA. Although the Tritryp lack several classes of signaling molecules, their kinomes contain a large and diverse set of protein kinases and phosphatases; their size and diversity imply previously unknown interactions and regulatory processes, which may be targets for intervention.

22415848	20120315	Deep sequencing of the LRRK2 gene in 14,002 individuals reveals evidence of purifying selection and independent origin of the p.Arg1628Pro mutation in Europe.	Genetic variation in LRRK2 predisposes to Parkinson disease (PD), which underpins its development as a therapeutic target. Here, we aimed to identify novel genotype-phenotype associations that might support developing LRRK2 therapies for other conditions. We sequenced the 51 exons of LRRK2 in cases comprising 12 common diseases (n = 9,582), and in 4,420 population controls. We identified 739 single-nucleotide variants, 62% of which were observed in only one person, including 316 novel exonic variants. We found evidence of purifying selection for the LRRK2 gene and a trend suggesting that this is more pronounced in the central (ROC-COR-kinase) core protein domains of LRRK2 than the flanking domains. Population genetic analyses revealed that LRRK2 is not especially polymorphic or differentiated in comparison to 201 other drug target genes. Among Europeans, we identified 17 carriers (0.13%) of pathogenic LRRK2 mutations that were not significantly enriched within any disease or in those reporting a family history of PD. Analysis of pathogenic mutations within Europe reveals that the p.Arg1628Pro (c4883G&gt;C) mutation arose independently in Europe and Asia. Taken together, these findings demonstrate how targeted deep sequencing can help to reveal fundamental characteristics of clinically important loci. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428 D052061 D013485
23579484	20130413	Exome sequencing reveals CCDC111 mutation associated with high myopia.	Myopia is a refractive error of the eye that is prevalent worldwide. The most extreme form, high myopia, is usually associated with other ocular disorders such as retinal detachment, macular degeneration, cataract, and glaucoma, and is one of leading causes of blindness. The etiology is complex and has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we identified a novel missense variant of the CCDC111 gene (NM_152683.2: c.265T &gt; G; p.Y89D) in a high myopia family by exome sequencing. The variant was identified in 4 patients from an additional 270 sporadic high myopia patients, but not found in 270 controls. The amino acid is highly conserved across species, and variants giving rise to amino acid substitutions are predicted to be functionally damaging. The CCDC111 gene was ubiquitously expressed in primary cell cultures from human eye tissue, including corneal epithelial cells, choroidal melanoma cells, scleral fibroblasts, retinal epithelial cells, retinal Müller cells, and lens capsule epithelial cells. In summary, our results suggested that the CCDC111 may be a susceptibility gene for high myopia. 	Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
8402893	19931008	Complementation cloning of an MHC class II transactivator mutated in hereditary MHC class II deficiency (or bare lymphocyte syndrome).	Hereditary major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II deficiency (or bare lymphocyte syndrome) is a form of severe primary immunodeficiency with a total lack of MHC class II expression. It is due to a defect in the regulation of MHC class II genes. A novel gene was isolated by complementation cloning, using an MHC class II-negative mutant cell line. This gene (CIITA) functions as a transactivator of MHC class II gene expression and restores expression of all MHC class II isotypes in mutant cells. In addition, CIITA fully corrects the MHC class II regulatory defect of cells from patients with bare lymphocyte syndrome. In this disease we have identified a splicing mutation that results in a 24 amino acid deletion in CIITA, resulting in loss of function of the transactivator. Hence, the CIITA gene is essential for MHC class II gene expression and has been shown to be responsible for hereditary MHC class II deficiency. 	Cell	D016428 D013485
8128956	19940401	Mutation analysis of the Fanconi anemia gene FACC.	Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a unique hypersensitivity of cells to DNA cross-linking agents; a gene for complementation group C (FACC) has recently been cloned. We have amplified FACC exons with their flanking intron sequences from genomic DNA from 174 racially and ethnically diverse families in the International Fanconi Anemia Registry and have screened for mutations by using SSCP analysis. We identified eight different variants in 32 families; three were detected in exon 1, one in exon 4, one in intron 4, two in exon 6, and one in exon 14. Two of the eight variants, in seven families, did not segregate with the disease allele in multiplex families, suggesting that these variants represented benign polymorphisms. Disease-associated mutations in FACC were detected in a total of 25 (14.4%) of 174 families screened. The most frequent mutations were IVS4 + 4 A--&gt;T (intron 4; 12 families) and 322delG (exon 1; 9 families). Other, less common mutations include Q13X in exon 1, R185X and D195V in exon 6, and L554P in exon 14. The polymorphisms were S26F in exon 1 and G139E in exon 4. All patients in our study with 322delG, Q13X, R185X, and D195V are of northern or eastern European or southern Italian ancestry, and 18 of 19 have a mild form of the disease, while the 2 patients with L554P, both from the same family, have a severe phenotype. All 19 patients with IVS4 + 4 A--&gt;T have Jewish ancestry and have a severe phenotype. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013487
15800844	20050401	Over- and underdosage of SOX3 is associated with infundibular hypoplasia and hypopituitarism.	Duplications of Xq26-27 have been implicated in the etiology of X-linked hypopituitarism associated with mental retardation (MR). Additionally, an expansion of a polyalanine tract (by 11 alanines) within the transcription factor SOX3 (Xq27.1) has been reported in patients with growth hormone deficiency and variable learning difficulties. We report a submicroscopic duplication of Xq27.1, the smallest reported to date (685.6 kb), in two siblings with variable hypopituitarism, callosal abnormalities, anterior pituitary hypoplasia (APH), an ectopic posterior pituitary (EPP), and an absent infundibulum. This duplication contains SOX3 and sequences corresponding to two transcripts of unknown function; only Sox3 is expressed in the infundibulum in mice. Next, we identified a novel seven-alanine expansion within a polyalanine tract in SOX3 in a family with panhypopituitarism in three male siblings with an absent infundibulum, severe APH, and EPP. This mutation led to reduced transcriptional activity, with impaired nuclear localization of the mutant protein. We also identified a novel polymorphism (A43T) in SOX3 in another child with hypopituitarism. In contrast to findings in previous studies, there was no evidence of MR or learning difficulties in our patients. We conclude that both over- and underdosage of SOX3 are associated with similar phenotypes, consisting of infundibular hypoplasia and hypopituitarism but not necessarily MR. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.

12618761	20030306	Novel succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) mutations in familial phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas, but an absence of somatic SDHB mutations in sporadic phaeochromocytomas.	Phaeochromocytomas arising in adrenal or extra-adrenal sites and paragangliomas of the head and neck, in particular of the carotid bodies, occur sporadically and also in a familial setting. In addition to mutations in RET and VHL in familial disease, germline mutations in SDHD and SDHB genes that encode subunits of mitochondrial complex II have also been associated with the development of familial phaeochromocytomas. To further investigate the role of SDHD and SDHB in the development of these tumours we determined the occurrence of germline SDHD and SDHB mutations in four patients with a family history of phaeochromocytoma with associated head and neck paraganglioma, one patient with a family history of phaeochromocytoma only and two patients with apparently sporadic extra-adrenal phaeochromocytoma, one of whom had early onset disease. Secondly, we investigated whether somatic SDHB mutations correlated with loss of heterozygosity at 1p36 in a subgroup of 11 sporadic and three MEN 2-associated RET-mutation-positive phaeochromocytomas. Novel SDHB mutations were identified in the probands from four families and two apparently sporadic cases (six of seven probands studied), including two missense mutations, a single nonsense and frameshift mutation, as well as two splice site mutations, one of which was shown to have partial penetrance resulting in 'leaky' splicing. Further, five intronic polymorphisms in SDHB were found. No SDHD mutations were identified. In addition, no somatic SDHB mutations were found in the remaining allele of the 11 sporadic adrenal phaeochromocytomas with allelic loss at 1p36 or the three MEN 2-associated RET-mutation-positive phaeochromocytomas. Therefore, we conclude that SDHB has a major role in the pathogenesis of familial phaeochromocytomas, but the possible role of SDHB in sporadic tumours showing allelic loss at 1p36 has yet to be ascertained.

10906052	20000725	Spermatid-specific expression of the novel X-linked gene product SPAN-X localized to the nucleus of human spermatozoa.	Formation of mature spermatozoa involves a series of dramatic molecular and morphological changes in the male germ cell lineage. These changes result from the temporally regulated transcription and translation of several testis-specific gene products. Here, we describe a novel, testis-specific protein designated SPAN-X for sperm protein associated with the nucleus on the X chromosome. SPAN-X sequences showed no significant similarity with known cDNA or peptide sequences. The SPAN-X peptide sequences contained three overlapping consensus nuclear localization signals, a high percentage (33%-37%) of charged amino acid residues, and a relatively acidic isoelectric point (pI; 4.88-6.05). Northern analysis of mRNA from multiple human tissues identified a SPAN-X transcript exclusively in the testis. In situ hybridization of human testes sections showed SPAN-X mRNA expression in haploid, round, and elongating spermatids. The SPANX gene was mapped to chromosome Xq27. 1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and by Southern blot analysis of human/mouse somatic cell hybrids. On Western blots of human sperm proteins, antirecombinant SPAN-X antibodies reacted with broad bands migrating between 15-20 kDa. Immunofluorescent labeling of human spermatozoa demonstrated SPAN-X localization to nuclear craters and cytoplasmic droplets. Expression of SPAN-X, an X-linked gene product, exclusively in haploid spermatids leads to interesting questions regarding the transcription of sex-linked genes during spermiogenesis. 	Biol._Reprod.

10071200	19990310	Mapping and genomic characterization of the gene encoding diacylglycerol kinase gamma (DAGK3): assessment of its role in dominant optic atrophy (OPA1).	The family of diacylglycerol kinases (DAGKs) is known to play an important role in signal transduction linked to phospholipid turnover. In the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, a human DAGK ortholog, DGK2, was shown to underlie the phenotype of the visual mutant retinal degeneration A (rdgA). Previously, the gene encoding a novel member of the human DAGK family, termed DAGK3, was cloned and demonstrated to be abundantly expressed in the human retina. Based on these findings we reasoned that DAGK3 might be an excellent candidate gene for a human eye disease. In the present study, we report the genomic organization of the human DAGK3 gene, which spans over 30 kb of genomic DNA interrupted by 23 introns. In addition, we have mapped the gene locus by fluorescence in situ hybridization to 3q27-28, overlapping the chromosomal region known to contain the gene underlying dominant optic atrophy (OPA1), the most common form of hereditary atrophy of the optic nerve. Mutational analysis of the entire coding region of DAGK3 in 19 unrelated German OPA1 patients has not revealed any disease-causing mutations, therefore excluding DAGK3 as a major cause underlying OPA1.

8504303	19930401	Fucosidosis: four new mutations and a new polymorphism.	Fucosidosis is a rare lysosomal storage disease due to a nearly complete deficiency of alpha-L-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51). In this study, all 8 exons of the alpha-L-fucosidase structural gene (FUCA-1) were amplified by PCR methods, and the amplified products were subcloned and sequenced. Five patient groups with fucosidosis were selected according to their ethnic backgrounds and haplotypes for RFLPs in FUCA-1. Four presumptive disease causing mutations were detected: 1) A major deletion of DNA containing the last two exons of FUCA-1 in two Algerian siblings. 2) A G to T mutation in exon 6 resulting in an in-frame termination codon (E375X) in eight Hispanic patients from Colorado and New Mexico. 3) A G to A mutation (G60D) in exon 1 in four Italian patients and in three related French-American (Cajun) patients. This G60D mutation creates a unique site for AflIII. 4) A frameshift mutation resulted from a two-base deletion in exon 2 (K151fs) in an Italian patient. This deletion obliterates a unique BstXI site and creates a new BpmI site, and was found in only this patient and in only one allele. The rationale for proposing these defects as disease causing mutations includes pedigree analysis and the predicted consequences of each defect upon the activity and the concentration of the enzyme. An A to G transition (Q281R) in exon 5 was found to be present in homozygous form in affected patients and also in normal subjects; it appears to be a newly identified polymorphism. It causes a charge change and may be responsible for the electrophoretic variant phenotype of fucosidosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D013487
11606364	20011019	A polymorphism in endostatin, an angiogenesis inhibitor, predisposes for the development of prostatic adenocarcinoma.	We have performed association studies between a novel coding single nucleotide polymorphism (D104N) in endostatin, one of the most potent inhibitors of angiogenesis, and prostate cancer. We observed that heterozygous N104 individuals have a 2.5 times increased chance of developing prostate cancer as compared with homozygous D104 subjects (odds ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-4.16). Modeling of the endostatin mutant showed that the N104 protein is stable. These results together with the observation that residue 104 is evolutionary conserved lead us to propose that: (a) the DNA segment containing this residue might contain a novel interaction site to a yet unknown receptor; and (b) the presence of N104 impairs the function of endostatin.

10924276	20000805	Complex association analysis of graves disease using a set of polymorphic markers.	Graves disease is complex autoimmune thyrotoxicosis. A number of genes may contribute to the development of the disorder. Some of them may be genes that encode cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated serine esterase-4 (CTLA4), subunit 2 of large multifunctional protease (LMP2), thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN). We studied polymorphism of Ala17Thr CTLA4, H60R LMP2, Pro52Thr TSHR, and IL1RN-VNTR in healthy controls (n = 93) and patients with Graves disease (n = 78) using PCR. To study CTLA4, H60R, and TSHR polymorphism, PCR products were digested with MboI, Hin6I and PsyI, respectively. Comparative analysis using chi(2) test showed significant differences in allele and genotype frequency of Ala17Thr polymorphic marker between the two groups studied. Thus, the CTLA4 gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of Graves disease in a Moscow population. 	Mol._Genet._Metab.	D003160 D016428
11298601	20010412	Characterization and localization of expression of an erythropoietin-induced gene, ERIC-1/TACC3, identified in erythroid precursor cells.	Gene expression profiles during erythropoietin (Epo)-induced differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells derived from the Friend virus anaemia (FVA) and phenylhydrazine (PHZ) murine models have been examined using differential display polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Ten cDNA fragments upregulated by Epo were isolated. The ribonuclease protection assay confirmed differential expression between Epo-stimulated and Epo-deprived cells for one of these, provisionally named ERIC-1. Sequencing of the full-length cDNA predicted a protein of 558 amino acids, 17 amino acids longer than mTACC3, the third member of a novel family of proteins that contain a coiled-coil domain. The human homologue, cloned using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR, encodes a larger protein of 838 amino acids that is identical to hTACC3. In addition to erythroid precursor cells, ERIC-1/TACC3 is expressed at high levels in the testes, at moderate levels in the thymus and peripheral leucocytes, and at lower levels in the spleen and intestinal tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis using an antibody to a GST fusion product of the C-terminus of hERIC-1/TACC3 revealed that it is localized to Sertoli cells in the human testes. Confocal microscopy demonstrated hERIC-1/TACC3 protein concentrated in the perinuclear vesicles of dermal microvascular endothelial cells. Although ERIC-1/TACC3 is expressed in a wide range of tissues, its upregulation by Epo in erythroid progenitors implies that it has a role in terminal erythropoiesis. 	Br._J._Haematol.	D016428
21907147	20110913	Mutations in MTFMT underlie a human disorder of formylation causing impaired mitochondrial translation.	The metazoan mitochondrial translation machinery is unusual in having a single tRNA(Met) that fulfills the dual role of the initiator and elongator tRNA(Met). A portion of the Met-tRNA(Met) pool is formylated by mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (MTFMT) to generate N-formylmethionine-tRNA(Met) (fMet-tRNA(met)), which is used for translation initiation; however, the requirement of formylation for initiation in human mitochondria is still under debate. Using targeted sequencing of the mtDNA and nuclear exons encoding the mitochondrial proteome (MitoExome), we identified compound heterozygous mutations in MTFMT in two unrelated children presenting with Leigh syndrome and combined OXPHOS deficiency. Patient fibroblasts exhibit severe defects in mitochondrial translation that can be rescued by exogenous expression of MTFMT. Furthermore, patient fibroblasts have dramatically reduced fMet-tRNA(Met) levels and an abnormal formylation profile of mitochondrially translated COX1. Our findings demonstrate that MTFMT is critical for efficient human mitochondrial translation and reveal a human disorder of Met-tRNA(Met) formylation. 	Cell_Metab.	D016428 D052061 D013485
9399950	19980131	An interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain mutation with normal thymus morphology.	One of the most common human immunodeficiencies is an X-linked condition arising from mutations of the gamma subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2Rgamma). The IL-2Rgamma protein is one chain of the heterotrimeric (alpha, beta, gamma) IL-2 receptor, but also participates in the formation of the IL-4, 7, 9, and 15 receptor complexes. The diagnosis of X-linked SCID is usually relatively simple due to the distinctive immunological presentation; IL-2Rgamma-deficient patients typically lacking mature T lymphocytes (T-B+). However, it is becoming clear that this merely represents one extreme of a potential range of clinical presentations. We describe here a novel mutation of the human IL-2Rgamma chain (R222C) resulting in an unusual immunological phenotype. Although clinically immunodeficient, this patient has normal numbers of peripheral T and B cells, responds normally to mitogenic stimuli, and unusually, has a normal thymus gland. This IL-2Rgamma mutation is distinctive in that the protein is sufficiently stable to be expressed at the cell surface. While the T cell receptor repertoire appears complete, suggesting normal T cell differentiation occurs, patient T cells demonstrate a reduced ability to bind IL-2 and this appears sufficient to cause a deficiency in their ability to participate in antigenic responses. Early clinical recognition of this phenotype is critical as a delay in diagnosis may result in a fatal infection. 	J._Clin._Invest.	D002363 D016428 D013485
9738465	19980917	Human cathepsin X: a novel cysteine protease of the papain family with a very short proregion and unique insertions.	A novel cDNA encoding a cysteine protease of the papain family named cathepsin X was obtained by PCR amplification from a human ovary cDNA library. The cathepsin X cDNA is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and contains an open reading frame of 912 nucleotides encoding a predicted protein of 303 amino acids. All highly conserved regions in papain-like cysteine proteases including the catalytic residues are present in cathepsin X. The mature part of cathepsin X is 26-32% identical to human cathepsins B, C, H, K, L, O, S and W. The cathepsin X sequence contains several unique features: (i) a very short proregion; (ii) a three amino acid residue insertion in a highly conserved region between the glutamine of the putative oxyanion hole and the active site cysteine; and (iii) a second insertion of 15 amino acid residues that can be aligned with the occluding loop region in cathepsin B.

15448106	20040928	Permanent neonatal diabetes due to mutations in KCNJ11 encoding Kir6.2: patient characteristics and initial response to sulfonylurea therapy.	Permanent neonatal diabetes (PND) can be caused by mutations in the transcription factors insulin promoter factor (IPF)-1, eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2alpha kinase 3 (EIF2AK3), and forkhead box-P3 and in key components of insulin secretion: glucokinase (GCK) and the ATP-sensitive K(+) channel subunit Kir6.2. We sequenced the gene encoding Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) in 11 probands with GCK-negative PND. Heterozygous mutations were identified in seven probands, causing three novel (F35V, Y330C, and F333I) and two known (V59M and R201H) Kir6.2 amino acid substitutions. Only two probands had a family history of diabetes. Subjects with the V59M mutation had neurological features including motor delay. Three mutation carriers tested had an insulin secretory response to tolbutamide, but not to glucose or glucagon. Glibenclamide was introduced in increasing doses to investigate whether sulfonylurea could replace insulin. At a glibenclamide dose of 0.3-0.4 mg. kg(-1). day(-1), insulin was discontinued. Blood glucose did not deteriorate, and HbA(1c) was stable or fell during 2-6 months of follow-up. An oral glucose tolerance test performed in one subject revealed that glucose-stimulated insulin release was restored. Mutations in Kir6.2 were the most frequent cause of PND in our cohort. Apparently insulin-dependent patients with mutations in Kir6.2 may be managed on an oral sulfonylurea with sustained metabolic control rather than insulin injections, illustrating the principle of pharmacogenetics applied in diabetes treatment.

9311737	19970801	Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer families not complying with the Amsterdam criteria show extremely low frequency of mismatch-repair-gene mutations.	Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is a common autosomal dominant cancer-susceptibility condition characterized by early onset colorectal cancer. Germ-line mutations in one of four DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS1, or hPMS2, are known to cause HNPCC. Although many mutations in these genes have been found in HNPCC kindreds complying with the so-called Amsterdam criteria, little is known about the involvement of these genes in families not satisfying these criteria but showing clear-cut familial clustering of colorectal cancer and other cancers. Here, we applied denaturing gradient-gel electrophoresis to screen for hMSH2 and hMLH1 mutations in two sets of HNPCC families, one set comprising families strictly complying with the Amsterdam criteria and another set in which at least one of the criteria was not satisfied. Interestingly, hMSH2 and hMLH1 mutations were found in 49% of the kindreds fully complying with the Amsterdam criteria, whereas a disease-causing mutation could be identified in only 8% of the families in which the criteria were not satisfied fully. In correspondence with these findings, 4 of 6 colorectal tumors from patients belonging to kindreds meeting the criteria showed microsatellite instability, whereas only 3 of 11 tumors from the other set of families demonstrated this instability. Although the number of tumors included in the study admittedly is small, the frequencies of mutations in the MMR genes show obvious differences between the two clinical sets of families. These results also emphasize the practical importance of the Amsterdam criteria, which provide a valid clinical subdivision between families, on the basis of their chance of carrying an hMSH2 or an hMLH1 mutation, and which bear important consequences for genetic testing and counseling and for the management of colorectal cancer families.

8131794	19931201	IL-1 inducible genes in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.	In an attempt to understand more directly the molecular mechanisms involved in the cellular response of endothelial cells to Interleukin-1 (IL-1), we have made several cDNA libraries from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) stimulated for 1 h with IL-1 in the presence of cycloheximide. The cDNA libraries were differentially screened with labelled cDNA derived from mRNA isolated from untreated or IL-1 treated HUVEC. Forty cDNA clones induced by IL-1 were isolated and partially sequenced. Thirty-eight of these corresponded to known genes, that is IL-8, ELAM-1, GRO-alpha, GRO-beta, PA-I and I-kB. The last two clones contained an identical insert belonging to a previously unknown gene. The full length cDNA of this new gene was isolated and called PTX3. It encodes for a 42 kD, 381 amino-acid long protein which shows in its 3' half a high degree of homology to all the known members of the pentaxin gene family, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid P component (SAP). PTX3 may represent a novel marker of inflammatory reactions, particularly those involving the vessel wall. 	Eur._Heart_J.	D016428 D013485
11919338	20020329	Mutations at the galactose-1-p-uridyltransferase gene in infants with a positive galactosemia newborn screening test.	Newborn screening for galactosemia yields a high number of false-positive results. Confirmatory DNA testing for unknown galactosemia mutations on the initial positive sample using novel techniques of mutation detection tenders itself to reduce the recall rate. The potential benefits of confirmatory DNA testing, however, could be offset by the detection of a high percentage of galactosemia carriers, Duarte/galactosemia compound heterozygotes, and infants with benign sequence changes in the galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) gene among infants with a positive biochemical screening test. Our aim was to determine the frequency and allelic distribution of all sequence changes in the GALT gene in 110 newborns with a positive total galactose screening test among 43,688 Austrian newborns screened consecutively. We found that only 20 of the 110 probands carried at least one known or novel candidate galactosemia mutation (one galactosemia homozygote, 7 Duarte/galactosemia compounds, 12 carriers) as judged by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and cleavage fragment length polymorphism analysis. Four novel galactosemia candidate mutations (Q9H, A46fsdelCAGCT, M129T, L342I) were identified. Sixty-seven probands had no detectable sequence changes and 23 carried only the benign Duarte or Los Angeles variant alleles or silent mutations. We conclude that a rapid and automatable confirmation test for unknown GALT mutations, e.g. on a high-density oligonucleotide array basis, has the potential to lower the recall rate of galactosemia screening in our population by about five-fold from 0.25 to 0.046%. Further research, however, will be required before the development of such a test can be advocated. 	Pediatr._Res.	D016428 D013485
16163268	20050916	Genotype-phenotype variations in five Spanish families with Norrie disease or X-linked FEVR.	Norrie disease (OMIM 310600) is a rare X-linked disorder characterized by congenital blindness in males. Approximately 40 to 50% of the cases develop deafness and mental retardation. X-linked familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (XL-FEVR) is a hereditary ocular disorder characterized by a failure of peripheral retinal vascularization. Both X-linked disorders are due to mutations in the NDP gene, which encodes a 133 amino acid protein called Norrin, but autosomal recessive (AR) and autosomal dominant (AD) forms of FEVR have also been described. In this study, we report the molecular findings and the related phenotype in five Spanish families affected with Norrie disease or XL-FEVR due to mutations of the NDP gene. The study was conducted in 45 subjects from five Spanish families. These families were clinically diagnosed with Norrie disease or similar conditions. The three exons of the NDP gene were analyzed by automatic DNA sequencing. Haplotype analyses were also performed. Two new nonsense mutations, apart from other mutations previously described in the NDP gene, were found in those patients affected with ND or X-linked FEVR. An important genotype-phenotype variation was found in relation to the different mutations of the NDP gene. In fact, the same mutation may be responsible for different phenotypes. We speculate that there might be other molecular factors that interact in the retina with Norrin, which contribute to the resultant phenotypes. 	Mol._Vis.	D016428 D013485
16011022	20050714	Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analysis of two single nucleotide polymorphisms in STK15 in Chinese.	STK15 (Serine/Threonine protein kinase 15) is a serine/threonine kinase encoding gene, whose overexpression in mammalian cells leads to centrosome amplification, chromosomal instability, and oncogenic transformation. 91A--&gt;T, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 3 of STK15, has recently been shown to be associated with human cancer susceptibility. Within exon 3 of STK15, there are three nonsynonymous SNPs: 91 A--&gt;T, 169G--&gt;A and 311C--&gt;T. We have determined STK15 genotypes and haplotypes composed of 91A--&gt;T and 169G--&gt;A by PCR-RFLP in a randomly sampled cohort of 193 normal individuals from Northeast China. DNA samples from all individuals were subjected to first round of PCR using a pair of specific primers. For the subsequent nested PCR,a mismatch forward primer, which could introduce an EcoR I restriction site to the 91A allele, was included. The nested PCR products were digested with the restriction endonucleases EcoRI and AccII. The double restriction digests were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Three haplotypes,91A-169G, 91T-169A and 91T-169G, were detected and their frequencies were 68.65%, 10.88% and 20.47%, respectively. Six genotypes composed of the above three haplotypes were found,and their frequencies were 91A-169G/91 A-169G (46.11%), 91A-169G/91 T-169A (14.51%), 91A-169G/91T-169G (30.57%), 91T-169G/91T-169G (3.11%), 91T-169G/91T-169A (4.15%), 91T-169A/91T-169A (1.55%). Whereas no 91A-169A haplotype was detected in all individuals examined in the current study, linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the two SNPs was found. 	Yi_Chuan_Xue_Bao	D016428 D013485
2009263	19910402	Cloning and expression of complementary DNAs for multiple members of the human cytochrome P450IIC subfamily.	The present study characterizes the profile of cDNAs from the human P450IIC subfamily in a library from one individual, and it describes three new members of this subfamily (IIC17, IIC18, and IIC19) isolated from two human cDNA libraries. cDNA libraries were constructed from two human livers which differed phenotypically in the hepatic content of P450 HLx (IIC8). The library from the phenotypically low HLx individual was screened by using a cDNA for rat liver P450IIC13 and an oligonucleotide probe for human IIC8. One clone, 245c, was isolated which clearly represents a new member of the human P450IIC subfamily (IIC17). This clone lacked the first 358 nucleotides at the N-terminus but was only 91% homologous in its nucleic acid sequence to IIC9 and 79% homologous to IIC8. Near-full-length clones for IIC9 were also isolated from this library, but no clones for IIC8 were found. Northern blots indicated that the mRNA for IIC8 was low or absent in this individual. A second cDNA library (from a liver phenotypically high in HLx) was then screened. Eighty-three essentially full-length (greater than 1.8 kb) clones belonging to the IIC subfamily were isolated from this library. These include full-length clones for two additional new members of the IIC subfamily.

2994716	19850702	Nucleotide sequence of the gene for human factor IX (antihemophilic factor B).	Two different human genomic DNA libraries were screened for the gene for blood coagulation factor IX by employing a cDNA for the human protein as a hybridization probe. Five overlapping lambda phages were identified that contained the gene for factor IX. The complete DNA sequence of about 38 kilobases for the gene and the adjacent 5' and 3' flanking regions was established by the dideoxy chain termination and chemical degradation methods. The gene contained about 33.5 kilobases of DNA, including seven introns and eight exons within the coding and 3' noncoding regions of the gene. The eight exons code for a prepro leader sequence and 415 amino acids that make up the mature protein circulating in plasma. The intervening sequences range in size from 188 to 9473 nucleotides and contain four Alu repetitive sequences, including one in intron A and three in intron F. A fifth Alu repetitive sequence was found immediately flanking the 3' end of the gene. A 50 base pair insert in intron A was found in a clone from one of the genomic libraries but was absent in clones from the other library. Intron A as well as the 3' noncoding region of the gene also contained alternating purine-pyrimidine sequences that provide potential left-handed helical DNA or Z-DNA structures for the gene. KpnI repetitive sequences were identified in intron D and the region flanking the 5' end of the gene. The 5' flanking region also contained a 1.9-kb HindIII subfamily repeat. The seven introns in the gene for factor IX were located in essentially the same position as the seven introns in the gene for human protein C, while the first three were found in positions identical with those in the gene for human prothrombin.

18330911	20080312	SIX1 mutation screening in 247 branchio-oto-renal syndrome families: a recurrent missense mutation associated with BOR.	Branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR) is a clinically heterogeneous autosomal dominant form of syndromic hearing loss characterized by variable hearing impairment, malformations of the pinnae, the presence of branchial arch remnants, and various renal abnormalities. Both EYA1 and SIX1 are expressed in developing otic, branchial and renal tissue. Consistent with this expression pattern, mutations in both genes cause BOR syndrome. Mutations in EYA1 are found in approximately 40% of patients with the BOR phenotype, however, the role of SIX1 is much lower. To date only three different SIX1 mutations have been described in BOR patients. The current screen of 247 BOR families detected five novel SIX1 mutations (c.50T&gt;A, c.218A&gt;C, c.317T&gt;G, c.329G&gt;A, c.334C&gt;T) and one previously reported mutation (c.328C&gt;T) seen in 5 unrelated families. All mutations are within the protein-binding Six domain. Phenotypic variability was high in these BOR families. Seven of the eight known SIX1 mutations are missense and the one in frame deletion is predicted to be functionally similar. The wide phenotypic variability precludes making genotype-phenotype correlations at this time. 	Hum._Mutat.	D002363 D016428
1988452	19910125	A de novo G to T transversion in a pro-alpha 1 (I) collagen gene for a moderate case of osteogenesis imperfecta. Substitution of cysteine for glycine 178 in the triple helical domain.	Cultured fibroblasts from a patient affected with a moderate form of osteogenesis imperfecta were defective for the synthesis of type I collagen molecules; about half of the alpha 1(I) chains contained a cysteine residue in the triple helical domain and a disulfide link formed when two mutant alpha 1(I) chains were incorporated into a type I collagen heterotrimer. The proband's parents were clinically and biochemically normal. The cysteine was localized within peptide alpha 1(I)CB8 between residues 170 and 200 of the triple helical domain using a chemical procedure with 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid (Tenni, R., Rossi, A., Valli, M., Mottes, M., Pignatti, P. F., and Cetta, G. (1990) Matrix 10, 20-26). Type I procollagen heterotrimers containing either one or two mutant chains showed (i) a slight abnormality in secretion from cells; (ii) a low degree of post-translational overmodifications; (iii) the same, but lower than normal, thermal stability. Total RNA was isolated from the proband's dermal fibroblast cultures, and cDNAs for pro-alpha 1(I) were prepared d using total RNA. A portion of cDNA, coding for the region encompassing residues 119-193 of alpha 1(I) triple helical domain, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. A single base pair mismatch was identified by chemical cleavage of DNA.DNA heteroduplexes, indicating a possible substitution of a guanine in the triplet coding for glycine 178 or 181. The same unique mismatch was detected by chemical cleavage in about one-half of the molecules in heteroduplexes formed between patient's pro-alpha 1(I) mRNAs and a normal cDNA probe. The amplified products were cloned and sequenced, confirming the heterozygous nature of the patient and demonstrating the presence and the location of a missense mutation; a single T for G substitution was found in the first base of the triplet coding for residue 178 of alpha 1(I) triple helical domain, leading to a cysteine for glycine substitution. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization to amplified DNA confirmed a de novo point mutation in the proband's genome. The findings in this patient are in accord with the phenotypic gradient model, which correlates the localization of the structural defect with the clinical outcome of osteogenesis imperfecta. The mutant protein has some properties that differ from the caused by the cysteine for glycine 175 substitution, suggesting a direct influence of the neighboring amino acids on the effects of the mutation.

24610330	20140311	PREPL deficiency with or without cystinuria causes a novel myasthenic syndrome.	To investigate the genetic and physiologic basis of the neuromuscular symptoms of hypotonia-cystinuria syndrome (HCS) and isolated PREPL deficiency, and their response to therapy. We performed molecular genetic, histochemical, immunoblot, and ultrastructural studies, investigated neuromuscular transmission in vitro in a patient with isolated PREPL deficiency, and evaluated the effect of pyridostigmine in this patient and in 3 patients with the HCS. HCS is caused by recessive deletions involving the SLC3A1 and PREPL genes. The major clinical features of HCS are type A cystinuria, growth hormone deficiency, muscle weakness, ptosis, and feeding problems. The proband with isolated PREPL deficiency had myasthenic symptoms since birth and a positive edrophonium test but no cystinuria. She and 1 of 3 patients with HCS responded transiently to pyridostigmine during infancy. The proband harbors a paternally inherited nonsense mutation in PREPL and a maternally inherited deletion involving both PREPL and SLC3A1; therefore, the PREPL deficiency determines the phenotype. We detected no PREPL expression in the patient's muscle and endplates. Electrophysiology studies revealed decreased quantal content of the endplate potential and reduced amplitude of the miniature endplate potential without endplate acetylcholine receptor deficiency or altered endplate geometry. Isolated PREPL deficiency is a novel monogenic disorder that causes a congenital myasthenic syndrome with pre- and postsynaptic features and growth hormone deficiency. The myasthenic symptoms in PREPL deficiency with or without cystinuria may respond to pyridostigmine in early life. We attribute the myasthenia to abrogated interaction of PREPL with adaptor protein 1. 	Neurology	D002363 D016428 D052061 D013485
21423869	20110323	Mutation screening and genotype phenotype correlation of ?-crystallin, ?-crystallin and GJA8 gene in congenital cataract.	To screen ?-crystallin (CRYAB), ?-crystallin (CRYGC and CRYGD), and Connexin 50 (Cx-50 or GJA8) genes in congenital cataract patients and controls. Thirty clinically diagnosed congenital cataract cases below 3 years of age from northern India, presenting at Dr. R. P. Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences (AIIMS, New Delhi, India) were enrolled in this study. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood, all coding and exon/intron regions were amplified using PCR and direct sequencing was performed to detect any nucleotide variation. ProtScale and Discovery Studio programs were used for insilico and structural analysis of non-synonymous mutations. DNA sequencing analysis of CRYAB, CRYGC, CRYGD, and GJA8 showed a total of six variations of which two were novel (CRYGC:p.R48H and GJA8:p.L281C) and four have been previously reported (CRYAB: rs11603779T&gt;G, GJA8: p.L268L, CRYGD: p.R95R, and c.T564C). Both the novel changes, in CRYGC and GJA8 were found in 16.6% of the patients. Previously reported nucleotide alterations (CRYGD:p.R95R and c.T564C) were found in 90% of the patients. Insilico and structural analysis data suggested that two novel non-synonymous mutations altered the stability and solvent accessibility of ?C-crystallin and Cx-50 proteins which may lead to lens opacification. We observed two novel nonsynonymous variations and four reported variations in CRYAB, CRYGC, CRYGD, and GJA8. The p.R48H variation in ?C-crystallin may disrupt the normal structure of lens and can cause cataract. Cx50 is responsible for joining the lens cells into a functional syncytium and a mutation (p.L281C) in GJA8 may lead to lens opacification resulting in cataract formation. This study further expands the mutation spectrum of congenital cataract and help understanding how mutant proteins lead to opacification of lens. 	Mol._Vis.	D016428 D013485
20650941	20100724	Novel connexin40 missense mutations in patients with familial atrial fibrillation.	This research was aimed at screening connexin40, a cardiac gap junction protein alpha 5, for genetic defects in patients with familial atrial fibrillation (AF). The subjects included 218 unrelated families with lone AF and 200 ethnically matched unrelated healthy individuals as controls. The entire coding region of the connexin40 gene was sequenced initially in 218 unrelated probands with familial AF. The relatives of mutation carriers and 200 controls were subsequently genotyped for the presence of mutations identified in probands. Three novel connexin40 mutations, p.V85I, p.L221I, and p.L229M, were identified in 3 of 218 unrelated AF families, respectively. These heterozygous missense mutations co-segregated with AF in the families and were absent in the 200 unrelated control subjects. A cross-species alignment of connexin40 protein sequences revealed that the altered amino acids were completely conserved evolutionarily. The findings expand the spectrum of mutations in connexin40 linked to AF and provide new insight into the molecular aetiology involved in the pathogenesis of AF. 	Europace	D016428 D013485
2894306	19870101	Molecular biology of the alpha-L-fucosidase gene and fucosidosis.	Human alpha-L-fucosidase, a lysosomal enzyme, hydrolyzes alpha-L-fucose from glycolipids and glycoproteins. Its activity is deficient in human fucosidosis an autosomal recessive disease. In order to understand the molecular basis of this lysosomal storage disorder we have cloned several cDNAs coding for human alpha-L-fucosidase from a human hepatoma and a human liver cDNA library constructed in lambda gt11. Compiling the cDNA sequences of these clones we have identified 1,829 base pairs (bp) encoding human alpha-L-fucosidase. This includes an open reading frame of 1,172 bp, a consensus polyadenylation signal AAT AAA and a poly(A)+ tail. The sequence is incomplete at the 5'-end, and clones encoding the amino terminus of the native protein, the propeptide and leader signal have not yet been isolated. The open reading frame encodes for 390 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 45,557. This represents 78-95% of the mature processed alpha-L-fucosidase. The availability of these cDNA clones has enabled us to map the structural gene for alpha-L-fucosidase to chromosome 1p34.1-1p36.1 by Southern blot analysis of DNA from human-rodent somatic cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization. Furthermore, a Pvu II restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) has been identified at the human alpha-L-fucosidase gene locus. Analysis of mRNA by Northern blotting gives a major species of 2.25 kb. In 4 patients with fucosidosis no mRNA signal was detected and Western blots gave no immunoreactive enzyme. Southern blotting after Eco RI digestion in two fucosidosis families revealed a banding abnormality (extra 6-kb band).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) 	Enzyme	D016428 D013485 D013487
11992121	20020507	Mutation of GABRA1 in an autosomal dominant form of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.	Although many genes that predispose for epilepsy in humans have been determined, those that underlie the classical syndromes of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) have yet to be identified. We report that an Ala322Asp mutation in GABRA1, encoding the alpha1 subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subtype A (GABA(A)), is found in affected individuals of a large French Canadian family with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Compared with wildtype receptors, GABA(A) receptors that contain the mutant subunit show a lesser amplitude of GABA-activated currents in vitro, indicating that seizures may result from loss of function of this inhibitory ligand-gated channel. Our results confirm that mutation of GABRA1 predisposes towards a common idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndrome in humans. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D013485
14574646	20031024	Protein-truncating mutations in ASPM cause variable reduction in brain size.	Mutations in the ASPM gene at the MCPH5 locus are expected to be the most common cause of human autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH), a condition in which there is a failure of normal fetal brain development, resulting in congenital microcephaly and mental retardation. We have performed the first comprehensive mutation screen of the 10.4-kb ASPM gene, identifying all 19 mutations in a cohort of 23 consanguineous families. Mutations occurred throughout the ASPM gene and were all predicted to be protein truncating. Phenotypic variation in the 51 affected individuals occurred in the degree of microcephaly (5-11 SDs below normal) and of mental retardation (mild to severe) but appeared independent of mutation position.

10694920	20000301	Three novel missense mutations in the glucokinase gene (G80S; E221K; G227C) in Italian subjects with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Mutations in brief no. 162. Online.	The maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), an autosomal dominant form of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), is caused by mutations in the glucokinase (GK, MODY 2) and in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1a (MODY 3) and 4a (MODY 1) genes. We have screened the glucokinase gene by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) in fifteen subjects with clinical characteristics of MODY and one parent with NIDDM, impaired glucose tolerance or gestational diabetes. PCR products with abnormal mobility in DGGE were directly sequenced. We have identified four mutant alleles, three of them (G80S, E221K, G227C) are new missense mutations located in or near the region of the active site cleft of the enzyme. The mutations co-segregate with hyperglycemia in the families of the three probands, whose biochemical and clinical phenotype is similar to other individuals with MODY 2 mutations. 	Hum._Mutat.

7977368	19941201	Mutations in argininosuccinate synthetase mRNA of Japanese patients, causing classical citrullinemia.	Citrullinemia is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a genetic deficiency of argininosuccinate synthetase. In order to characterize mutations in Japanese patients with classical citrullinemia, RNA isolated from 10 unrelated patients was reverse-transcribed, and cDNA amplified by PCR was cloned and sequenced. The 10 mutations identified included 6 missense mutations (A118T, A192V, R272C, G280R, R304W, and R363L), 2 mutations associated with an absence of an exon 7 or exon 13, 1 mutation with a deletion of the first 7 bp in exon 16 (which might be caused by abnormal splicing), and 1 mutation with an insertion of 37 bp within exons 15 and 16 in cDNA. The insertion mutation and the five missense mutations (R304W being excluded) are new mutations described in the present paper. These are in addition to 14 mutations (9 missense mutations, 4 mutations associated with an absence of an exon in mRNA, and 1 splicing mutation) that we identified previously in mainly American patients with neonatal citrullinemia. Two of these 20 mutations, a deletion of exon 13 sequence and a 7-bp deletion in exon 16, were common to Japanese and American populations from different ethnic backgrounds; however, other mutations were unique to each population. Furthermore, the presence of a frequent mutation--the exon 7 deletion mutation in mRNA, which accounts for 10 of 23 affected alleles--was demonstrated in Japanese citrullinemia. This differs from the situation in the United States, where there was far greater heterogeneity of mutations. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
26590955	20151123	Dual genetic diagnoses: Atypical hand-foot-genital syndrome and developmental delay due to de novo mutations in HOXA13 and NRXN1.	We describe a male patient with dual genetic diagnoses of atypical hand-foot-genital syndrome (HFGS) and developmental delay. The proband had features of HFGS that included bilateral vesicoureteric junction obstruction with ectopic ureters, brachydactyly of various fingers and toes, hypoplastic thenar eminences, and absent nails on both 4th toes and right 5th toe. The atypical features of HFGS present were bilateral hallux valgus malformations and bilateral preaxial polydactyly of the hands. Chromosomal microarray analysis identified a de novo 0.5?Mb deletion at 2p16.3, including the first four exons of the NRXN1 gene. Whole exome sequencing and subsequent Sanger sequencing identified a de novo missense mutation (c.1123G&gt;T, p.Val375Phe) in exon 2 of the HOXA13 gene, predicted to be damaging and located in the homeobox domain. The intragenic NRXN1 deletion is thought to explain his developmental delay via a separate genetic mechanism. 	Am._J._Med._Genet._A	D002363 D016428
7592926	19951110	Cloning and characterization of an ATBF1 isoform that expresses in a neuronal differentiation-dependent manner.	The human ATBF1 cDNA reported previously, now termed ATBF1-B, encodes a 306-kDa protein containing 4 homeodomains and 18 zinc fingers including one pseudo zinc finger motif. Here, we report the isolation of a second ATBF1 cDNA, 12 kilobase pairs long, termed ATBF1-A. The deduced ATBF1-A protein is 404 kDa in size and differs from ATBF1-B by a 920-amino acid extention at the N terminus. Analysis of 5'-genomic sequences showed that the 5'-noncoding sequences specific to ATBF1-A and ATBF1-B transcripts were contained in distinct exons that could splice to a downstream exon common to the ATBF1-A and ATBF1-B mRNAs. The expression of ATBF1-A transcripts increased to high levels when P19 and NT2/D1 cells were treated with retinoic acid to induce neuronal differentiation. Preferential expression of ATBF1-A transcripts was also observed in developing mouse brain. Transient transfection assays showed that the 5.5-kilobase pair sequence upstream of the ATBF1-A-specific exon (exon 2) supported expression of the linked chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene in neuronal cells derived from P19 cells but not in undifferentiated P19 or in F9 cells, which do not differentiate into neurons. These results showed that ATBF1-A and ATBF1-B transcripts are generated by alternative promoter usage combined with alternative splicing and that the ATBF1-A-specific promoter is activated during neuronal differentiation.

9285778	19970901	Characterization of a new BLM mutation associated with a topoisomerase II alpha defect in a patient with Bloom's syndrome.	Bloom's syndrome (BS), a human recessive disorder associated with an increased risk of malignancy, arises through mutations in both alleles of the BLM gene, which was recently identified as a member of the RecQ helicase family. BS cells are characterized by an increased rate of sister chromatid exchange (SCE). However, a subpopulation of lymphocytes exhibiting a normal level of SCE is observed in some patients. It has been proposed that reversion to a low-SCE phenotype involves an intragenic crossing over between the paternal and maternal BLM alleles, generating a wild-type allele. In this study we characterize a new BLM mutation in a BS patient leading to the replacement, in the C-terminal region of Blm, of a highly conserved cysteine by a phenylalanine in codon 1036. Moreover, our data show that this patient also inherited a BLM allele carrying a mutation affecting its expression and that a somatic intragenic crossing over was involved in reversion to the low-SCE phenotype. Further, we show that both topoisomerase II alpha mRNA and protein levels are decreased in the high-SCE cells derived from this patient, whereas they are normal in the corresponding low-SCE cells. Altogether, our data led us to propose that besides its putative helicase activity, Blm could be involved in transcription regulation. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D013485
7663510	19950601	The polycystic kidney disease 1 (PKD1) gene encodes a novel protein with multiple cell recognition domains.	Characterization of the polycystic kidney disease 1 (PKD1) gene has been complicated by genomic rearrangements on chromosome 16. We have used an exon linking strategy, taking RNA from a cell line containing PKD1 but not the duplicate loci, to clone a cDNA contig of the entire transcript. The transcript consists of 14,148 bp (including a correction to the previously described C terminus), distributed among 46 exons spanning 52 kb. The predicted PKD1 protein, polycystin, is a glycoprotein with multiple transmembrane domains and a cytoplasmic C-tail. The N-terminal extracellular region of over 2,500 aa contains leucine-rich repeats, a C-type lectin, 16 immunoglobulin-like repeats and four type III fibronectin-related domains. Our results indicate that polycystin is an integral membrane protein involved in cell-cell/matrix interactions. 	Nat._Genet.	D003160 D016428 D013485
11261557	20010323	Genetic variation among chicken lines and mammalian species in specific genes.	Thirteen gene-specific primer sets provided by the U.S. Poultry Genome Coordinators were used to investigate DNA polymorphisms between two highly inbred chicken lines of Leghorn and Fayoumi origin. Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences were then compared among these chicken lines and the Genbank sequences of chicken, mouse, and human. The following genes were selected as candidates for immune response or transcription activation: B2M, DAD1, IAP1, IL2, IREB1, LAP18, MAFL, POU1F1, RREB1, TAD, TBP1, TCRG, and ZOV3. Total cDNA was obtained from the spleens of Leghorn and Fayoumi lines by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and was used as a template to PCR-amplify gene-specific products. All primers except POU1F1 and TCRG generated single PCR products of the predicted 325- to 667-bp size, confirming the efficacy of these gene-specific primers in the chicken. Three and seven of the 11 amplified gene fragments yielded line-specific nucleotide polymorphisms between the Leghorn and Fayoumi sequences and between the Leghorn and Genbank chicken sequences respectively. Similarities between inbred Leghorn and mammalian species were 36 to 86% for nucleotides and 25 to 96% for predicted amino acid sequence. The polymorphisms of some gene fragments between the Leghorn and Fayoumi lines will allow for investigation of associations of these genes with immune response and other biological traits.

10917596	20000805	dADAR, a Drosophila double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase is highly developmentally regulated and is itself a target for RNA editing.	We have identified a homolog of the ADAR (adenosine deaminases that act on RNA) class of RNA editases from Drosophila, dADAR. The dADAR locus has been localized to the 2B6-7 region of the X chromosome and the complete genomic sequence organization is reported here. dADAR is most homologous to the mammalian RNA editing enzyme ADAR2, the enzyme that specifically edits the Q/R site in the pre-mRNA encoding the glutamate receptor subunit GluR-B. Partially purified dADAR expressed in Pichia pastoris has robust nonspecific A-to-I deaminase activity on synthetic dsRNA substrates. Transcripts of the dADAR locus originate from two regulated promoters. In addition, alternative splicing generates at least four major dADAR isoforms that differ at their amino-termini as well as altering the spacing between their dsRNA binding motifs. dADAR is expressed in the developing nervous system, making it a candidate for the editase that acts on para voltage-gated Na+ channel transcripts in the central nervous system. Surprisingly, dADAR itself undergoes developmentally regulated RNA editing that changes a conserved residue in the catalytic domain. Taken together, these findings show that both transcription and processing of dADAR transcripts are under strict developmental control and suggest that the process of RNA editing in Drosophila is dynamically regulated.

27259050	20160604	Ataxia-Pancytopenia Syndrome Is Caused by Missense Mutations in SAMD9L.	Ataxia-pancytopenia (AP) syndrome is characterized by cerebellar ataxia, variable hematologic cytopenias, and predisposition to marrow failure and myeloid leukemia, sometimes associated with monosomy 7. Here, in the four-generation family UW-AP, linkage analysis revealed four regions that provided the maximal LOD scores possible, one of which was in a commonly microdeleted chromosome 7q region. Exome sequencing identified a missense mutation (c.2640C&gt;A, p.His880Gln) in the sterile alpha motif domain containing 9-like gene (SAMD9L) that completely cosegregated with disease. By targeted sequencing of SAMD9L, we subsequently identified a different missense mutation (c.3587G&gt;C, p.Cys1196Ser) in affected members of the first described family with AP syndrome, Li-AP. Neither variant is reported in the public databases, both affect highly conserved amino acid residues, and both are predicted to be damaging. With time in culture, lymphoblastic cell lines (LCLs) from two affected individuals in family UW-AP exhibited copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity for large portions of the long arm of chromosome 7, resulting in retention of only the wild-type SAMD9L allele. Newly established LCLs from both individuals demonstrated the same phenomenon. In addition, targeted capture and sequencing of SAMD9L in uncultured blood DNA from both individuals showed bias toward the wild-type allele. These observations indicate in vivo hematopoietic mosaicism. The hematopoietic cytopenias that characterize AP syndrome and the selective advantage for clones that have lost the mutant allele support the postulated role of SAMD9L in the regulation of cell proliferation. Furthermore, we show that AP syndrome is distinct from the dyskeratoses congenita telomeropathies, with which it shares some clinical characteristics. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013486
11157794	20010207	Functional analysis of mutations in SLC7A9, and genotype-phenotype correlation in non-Type I cystinuria.	Cystinuria (OMIM 220100) is a common recessive disorder of renal reabsorption of cystine and dibasic amino acids that results in nephrolithiasis of cystine. Mutations in SLC3A1, which encodes rBAT, cause Type I cystinuria, and mutations in SLC7A9, which encodes a putative subunit of rBAT (b(o,+)AT), cause non-Type I cystinuria. Here we describe the genomic structure of SLC7A9 (13 exons) and 28 new mutations in this gene that, together with the seven previously reported, explain 79% of the alleles in 61 non-Type I cystinuria patients. These data demonstrate that SLC7A9 is the main non-Type I cystinuria gene. Mutations G105R, V170M, A182T and R333W are the most frequent SLC7A9 missense mutations found. Among heterozygotes carrying these mutations, A182T heterozygotes showed the lowest urinary excretion values of cystine and dibasic amino acids. Functional analysis of mutation A182T after co-expression with rBAT in HeLa cells revealed significant residual transport activity. In contrast, mutations G105R, V170M and R333W are associated to a complete or almost complete loss of transport activity, leading to a more severe urinary phenotype in heterozygotes. SLC7A9 mutations located in the putative transmembrane domains of b(o,+)AT and affecting conserved amino acid residues with a small side chain generate a severe phenotype, while mutations in non-conserved residues give rise to a mild phenotype. These data provide the first genotype-phenotype correlation in non-Type I cystinuria, and show that a mild urinary phenotype in heterozygotes may associate with mutations with significant residual transport activity.

15389765	20040925	Investigation of the human serotonin receptor gene HTR3B in bipolar affective and schizophrenic patients.	The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) mediates a multitude of central nervous functions by activating 5-HT receptor subtypes. A dysfunction of serotonergic neurotransmission is considered to play a major role in the pathophysiology of complex neuropsychiatric disorders. In our study, a mutation screen of the serotonin receptor gene HTR3B was carried out to explore a putative contribution to the etiology of bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) and schizophrenia (SZ). Screening of 49 patients suffering from BPAD, 78 patients with SZ and 62 control individuals revealed eleven sequence variations including a 3 bp deletion within the 5'UTR (5' untranslated region), four exonic and five intronic SNPs as well as a point mutation in the 3'UTR of HTR3B. Four of these sequence variations have not been described previously. Statistical computation rated most variants as probably non-disease related polymorphisms. However, IVS6 + 31C &gt; T, IVS6 + 40C &gt; A, and 1386T &gt; C were solely detected in bipolar affective patients and in none of the controls. Interestingly, we observed a significant underrepresentation of the 3 bp deletion -100_-102delAAG in an extended sample of 162 bipolar affected patients compared to controls (allele-wise: 8% vs. 15%, P = 0.006, OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.3-0.82; genotype-wise: 15,5% vs. 29,0%, P = 0.005, OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.26-0.77). We suggest that this deletion may influence translational efficiency, thereby possibly affecting the development of bipolar affective disease. 	Am._J._Med._Genet._B_Neuropsychiatr._Genet.

9446754	19980328	Glucosephosphate isomerase (GPI) deficiency mutations associated with hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (HNSHA).	Five unrelated patients with hereditary glucosephosphate isomerase (GPI) deficiency resulting in nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia were studied. Three new mutations were found in the coding region of the GPI gene: two patients were heterozygous for 223 A--&gt;G (R75G) and 898 G--&gt;C(R300P), respectively and one was homozygous for 1415G--&gt;A(R472H). Surprisingly, 2 previously reported mutations, 286 C--&gt;T and 1039 C--&gt;T, were found in 2 and 3 patients respectively. Until now only 4 of 18 GPI mutations had been found more than once in unrelated patients and these 4 in only 2 patients each. Eleven of the 20 known point mutations have occurred at CpG &quot;hot spots&quot; and the 286 C--&gt;T and 1039 C--&gt;T are among these. The 489 G/A polymorphism in the GPI coding region was used to demonstrate unequivocally that the 1039 C--&gt;T mutation occurred in both haplotypes and therefore probably originated more than once. Because no common GPI mutation has been found we suggest that heterozygosity for GPI confers little if any selective advantage. 	Blood_Cells_Mol._Dis.	D002363 D016428 D013485 D013487
7173395	19821018	Structural study of hemoglobin Knossos, beta 27 (B9) Ala leads to Ser. A new abnormal hemoglobin present as a silent beta-thalassemia.	A new electrophoretically silent hemoglobin variant is described that produces the classical phenotype of beta thalassemic intermedia in association with beta thalassemia trait. This variant has the expression of a silent beta thalassemia trait. The abnormal hemoglobin was detected by acid-urea-Triton-acrylamide electrophoresis and further demonstrated by isoelectric focusing. The amount of the variant in carrier is approximately 30% of the total hemoglobin. No instability was found. Absence of hemoglobin A in the propositus blood facilitated structural studies. Peptides maps were normal but analysis of individual peptide spots showed an Ala leads to Ser substitution in the beta T3. This variant has been previously called Hb Knossos (beta 27 (B9) Ala leads to Ser). 	FEBS_Lett.	D016428 D013485
8411057	19930801	The substitution of glycine 661 by arginine in type III collagen produces mutant molecules with different thermal stabilities and causes Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV.	Previous studies have shown that Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV (EDS IV) is caused by mutations of type III collagen (COL3A1). Here we have characterised the most amino-terminal glycine substitution so far described in a patient with EDS IV. A combination of peptide mapping and chemical cleavage analysis of cDNA localised the mutation in cyanogen bromide peptide CB5. Sequence analysis showed a G to A mutation, converting glycine 661 to arginine, which was a new dominant mutation. Analysis of type III collagen secreted by cultured fibroblasts showed an overmodified mutant protein with normal thermal stability. However, the intracellularly retained form melted 2 degrees C lower than normal. This indicated that molecules resulting from the same mutation can differ in their thermal stabilities.

22578956	20120515	Mutational analysis of the NPHS2 gene in Czech patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome.	Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and minimal change disease represent frequent histological patterns of renal injury in patients with nephrotic syndrome. Few cases carrying NPHS2 gene variants have been described to date. Mutational analysis of the NPHS2 gene was performed in 50 Czech adult patients with histologically proved FSGS/MCD. The common p.P20L and p.R229Q polymorphisms of the NPHS2 gene were tested in 169 patients with IgA nephropathy and in 300 individuals of the control group. No mutation in the NPHS2 gene in patients with adult onset was identified. One homozygous mutation p.V290M in a patient with onset in early childhood was found. One new heterozygous variant in the non-conservative area of the NPHS2 gene, p.G97S, was identified in a patient with childhood-onset FSGS. In one adult patient, there were two polymorphisms, p.P20L and p.R229Q, in trans-heterozygous state, which could contribute to steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. The most common polymorphism p.R229Q was identified in 12 % of FSGS/ MCD patients, in 11.8 % of IGAN patients and in 10% of controls. The heterozygosity of p.R229Q polymorphism was similar in the IGAN group, with non-significantly higher prevalence in IGAN patients with progressive form of the disease (15.9 % versus 9.4 %). The prevalence of p.P20L polymorphism was not significantly different among the groups (6 % in FSGS patients, 1.8 % in IGAN patients, 1 % in the control group). To conclude, NPHS2 mutations are rare in patients with adult onset of FSGS/MCD. The R229Q polymorphism is frequent in the Czech population and probably could have some influence on IGAN.

21741611	20110712	Inactivation of IL11 signaling causes craniosynostosis, delayed tooth eruption, and supernumerary teeth.	Craniosynostosis and supernumerary teeth most often occur as isolated developmental anomalies, but they are also separately manifested in several malformation syndromes. Here, we describe a human syndrome featuring craniosynostosis, maxillary hypoplasia, delayed tooth eruption, and supernumerary teeth. We performed homozygosity mapping in three unrelated consanguineous Pakistani families and localized the syndrome to a region in chromosome 9. Mutational analysis of candidate genes in the region revealed that all affected children harbored homozygous missense mutations (c.662C&gt;G [p.Pro221Arg], c.734C&gt;G [p.Ser245Cys], or c.886C&gt;T [p.Arg296Trp]) in IL11RA (encoding interleukin 11 receptor, alpha) on chromosome 9p13.3. In addition, a homozygous nonsense mutation, c.475C&gt;T (p.Gln159X), and a homozygous duplication, c.916_924dup (p.Thr306_Ser308dup), were observed in two north European families. In cell-transfection experiments, the p.Arg296Trp mutation rendered the receptor unable to mediate the IL11 signal, indicating that the mutation causes loss of IL11RA function. We also observed disturbed cranial growth and suture activity in the Il11ra null mutant mice, in which reduced size and remodeling of limb bones has been previously described. We conclude that IL11 signaling is essential for the normal development of craniofacial bones and teeth and that its function is to restrict suture fusion and tooth number. The results open up the possibility of modulation of IL11 signaling for the treatment of craniosynostosis. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
7557992	19950520	Identification, expression, and pharmacology of a Cys23-Ser23 substitution in the human 5-HT2c receptor gene (HTR2C).	The function of brain serotonin-2C (5-HT2C) receptors, including behavioral and neurochemical responses to 5-HT2C agonist challenge, has been suggested to be abnormal in individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, it is important to identify polymorphisms and functional variants within this gene. Using SSCP analysis, we identified a Cys23-Ser23 substitution (designated 5-HT2Ccys and 5-HT2Cser) in the first hydrophobic region of the human 5-HT2C receptor. Allele frequencies in unrelated Caucasians were 0.13 and 0.87 for 5-HT2Cser and 5-HT2Ccys, respectively. DNAs from informative CEPH families were typed for this polymorphism and analyzed with respect to 20 linked markers on the X chromosome. Linkage analysis placed the 5-HT2C receptor gene (HTR2C) on Xq24. To evaluate whether this amino acid substitution causes a variant function of this receptor, recombinant human 5-HT2Ccys and 5-HT2Cser receptors were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and tested for responses to 5-HT using electrophysiological techniques. Concentration-response curves for 5-HT were not significantly different in oocytes expressing either form of the receptor, suggesting that the 5-HT2Ccys and 5-HT2Cser receptor proteins may not differ in their responses to serotonin under baseline physiological conditions.

24784932	20140503	Mutations in COG2 encoding a subunit of the conserved oligomeric golgi complex cause a congenital disorder of glycosylation.	The conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex is involved in intra-Golgi retrograde trafficking, and mutations in six of its eight subunits have been reported in congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). Here we report a patient showing severe acquired microcephaly, psychomotor retardation, seizures, liver dysfunction, hypocupremia, and hypoceruloplasminemia. Analysis of his serum glycoproteins revealed defects in both sialylation and galactosylation of glycan termini. Trio-based whole-exome sequencing identified two heterozygous mutations in COG2: a de novo frameshift mutation [c.701dup (p.Tyr234*)] and a missense mutation [c.1900T?&gt;?G (p.Trp634Gly)]. Sequencing of cloned reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) products revealed that both mutations were located on separate alleles, as expected, and that the mutant transcript harboring the frameshift mutation underwent degradation. The c.1900T?&gt;?G (p.Trp634Gly) mutation is located in a domain highly conserved among vertebrates and was absent from both the public database and our control exomes. Protein expression of COG2, along with COG3 and COG4, was decreased in fibroblasts from the patient. Our data strongly suggest that these compound heterozygous mutations in COG2 are causative of CDG. 	Clin._Genet.	D002363 D016428 D013485
9765152	19981009	Alterations of the PPP2R1B gene in human lung and colon cancer.	The PPP2R1B gene, which encodes the beta isoform of the A subunit of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), was identified as a putative human tumor suppressor gene. Sequencing of the PPP2R1B gene, located on human chromosome 11q22-24, revealed somatic alterations in 15% (5 out of 33) of primary lung tumors, 6% (4 out of 70) of lung tumor-derived cell lines, and 15% (2 out of 13) of primary colon tumors. One deletion mutation generated a truncated PP2A-Abeta protein that was unable to bind to the catalytic subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme. The PP2R1B gene product may suppress tumor development through its role in cell cycle regulation and cellular growth control. 	Science	D016428 D013485 D013486 D013487
12628721	20030312	Natural history of dilated cardiomyopathy due to lamin A/C gene mutations.	We examined the prevalence, genotype-phenotype correlation, and natural history of lamin A/C gene (LMNA) mutations in subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Mutations in LMNA have been found in patients with DCM with familial conduction defects and muscular dystrophy, but the clinical spectrum, prognosis, and clinical relevance of laminopathies in DCM are unknown. A cohort of 49 nuclear families, 40 with familial DCM and 9 with sporadic DCM (269 subjects, 105 affected), was screened for mutations in LMNA using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and sequence analysis. Bivariate analysis of clinical predictors of LMNA mutation carrier status and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were performed. Mutations in LMNA were detected in four families (8%), three with familial (R89L, 959delT, R377H) and one with sporadic DCM (S573L). There was significant phenotypic variability, but the presence of skeletal muscle involvement (p &lt; 0.001), supraventricular arrhythmia (p = 0.003), conduction defects (p = 0.01), and &quot;mildly&quot; DCM (p = 0.006) were predictors of LMNA mutations. The LMNA mutation carriers had a significantly poorer cumulative survival compared with non-carrier DCM patients: event-free survival at the age of 45 years was 31% versus 75% in non-carriers. Mutations in LMNA cause a severe and progressive DCM in a relevant proportion of patients. Mutation screening should be considered in patients with DCM, in particular when clinical predictors of LMNA mutation are present, regardless of family history. 	J._Am._Coll._Cardiol.

9791010	19981029	Molecular cloning of human ABPL, an actin-binding protein homologue.	Based on two partial cDNA sequences, a full-length cDNA sequence for an actin-binding like protein previously named ABPL has been isolated and characterized. ABPL is homologous to the human actin-binding proteins ABP-280 and ABP-278. The predicted sequence for ABPL is 2,705 amino acids in length with a calculated molecular mass of 289 kDa. It contains an amino terminal actin-binding domain followed by 24 tandem repeats of approximately 96 amino acids. Two hinge regions, Hinge I and Hinge II, were located prior to repeats 16 and 24, respectively. An isoform of ABPL lacking Hinge I, with a calculated molecular mass of 286 kDa, was also identified by the reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) method. A comparison with genomic sequences indicated the isoform resulted from alternative RNA splicing. ABPL has a unique insertion sequence of 82 amino acids in repeat 20 that was not present in the other two homologues and has a tissue distribution that was also different from the other two homologues.

23910690	20130806	Clinical, functional, and genetic characterization of chronic granulomatous disease in 89 Turkish patients.	Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare primary immunodeficiency disorder of phagocytes resulting in impaired killing of bacteria and fungi. A mutation in one of the 4 genes encoding the components p22(phox), p47(phox), p67(phox), and p40(phox) of the leukocyte nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate reduced (NADPH) oxidase leads to autosomal recessive (AR) CGD. A mutation in the CYBB gene encoding gp91(phox) leads to X-linked recessive CGD. The aim of this study is to show the correlation between clinical, functional, and genetic data of patients with CGD from Turkey. We report here the results of 89 patients with CGD from 73 Turkish families in a multicenter study. Most of the families (55%) have an AR genotype, and 38% have an X-linked genotype; patients from 5 families with a suspected AR genotype (7%) were not fully characterized. We compared patients with CGD according to the severity of NADPH oxidase deficiency of neutrophils. Patients with A22(0), A67(0) or X91(0) phenotypes with a stimulation index of 1.5 or less have early clinical presentation and younger age at diagnosis (mean, 3.2 years). However, in p47(phox)-deficient cases and in 5 other AR cases with high residual oxidase activity (stimulation index ? 3), later and less severe clinical presentation and older age at diagnosis (mean, 7.1 years) were found. Pulmonary involvement was the most common clinical feature, followed by lymphadenitis and abscesses. Later and less severe clinical presentation and older age at diagnosis are related to the residual NADPH oxidase activity of neutrophils and not to the mode of inheritance. CGD caused by A22(0) and A67(0) subtypes manifests as severe as the X91(0) subtype. 	J._Allergy_Clin._Immunol.	D016428 D013485
10199409	19990413	Germline mutations in the extracellular domains of the 55 kDa TNF receptor, TNFR1, define a family of dominantly inherited autoinflammatory syndromes.	Autosomal dominant periodic fever syndromes are characterized by unexplained episodes of fever and severe localized inflammation. In seven affected families, we found six different missense mutations of the 55 kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1), five of which disrupt conserved extracellular disulfide bonds. Soluble plasma TNFR1 levels in patients were approximately half normal. Leukocytes bearing a C52F mutation showed increased membrane TNFR1 and reduced receptor cleavage following stimulation. We propose that the autoinflammatory phenotype results from impaired downregulation of membrane TNFR1 and diminished shedding of potentially antagonistic soluble receptor. TNFR1-associated periodic syndromes (TRAPS) establish an important class of mutations in TNF receptors. Detailed analysis of one such mutation suggests impaired cytokine receptor clearance as a novel mechanism of disease. 	Cell	D016428 D013485 D013487
9071574	19970301	Characterization of a YAC contig containing the NBCCS locus and a novel Kruppel-type zinc finger sequence on chromosome segment 9q22.3.	Gorlin's syndrome or nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a familial or hereditary predisposition to basal cell carcinomas (generally multiple and of early onset), odontogenic keratocysts (jaw cysts), palmar and plantar pits, a wide variety of developmental defects, as well as cancers such as medulloblastomas and ovarian fibromas. The gene for NBCCS has been mapped to human chromosome region 9q22.1-q31 by linkage analysis and by cytogenetic evidence of deletions in this region in patients with the syndrome. This is supported by loss of heterozygosity in tumors of polymorphic marker loci flanked by D9S197 and D9S180. We have utilized sequence tagged site (STS) mapping and somatic cell hybrid panel analysis to construct two overlapping yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contigs spanning this region of the genome. We used the YAC contigs to identify a new zinc finger gene containing a highly informative microsatellite locus. 	Genes_Chromosomes_Cancer	D016428
27213289	20160524	NANS-mediated synthesis of sialic acid is required for brain and skeletal development.	We identified biallelic mutations in NANS, the gene encoding the synthase for N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc; sialic acid), in nine individuals with infantile-onset severe developmental delay and skeletal dysplasia. Patient body fluids showed an elevation in N-acetyl-D-mannosamine levels, and patient-derived fibroblasts had reduced NANS activity and were unable to incorporate sialic acid precursors into sialylated glycoproteins. Knockdown of nansa in zebrafish embryos resulted in abnormal skeletal development, and exogenously added sialic acid partially rescued the skeletal phenotype. Thus, NANS-mediated synthesis of sialic acid is required for early brain development and skeletal growth. Normal sialylation of plasma proteins was observed in spite of NANS deficiency. Exploration of endogenous synthesis, nutritional absorption, and rescue pathways for sialic acid in different tissues and developmental phases is warranted to design therapeutic strategies to counteract NANS deficiency and to shed light on sialic acid metabolism and its implications for human nutrition.

9082980	19970404	The receptor for the cytotoxic ligand TRAIL.	TRAIL (also known as Apo-2L) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family that rapidly induces apoptosis in a variety of transformed cell lines. The human receptor for TRAIL was found to be an undescribed member of the TNF-receptor family (designated death receptor-4, DR4) that contains a cytoplasmic &quot;death domain&quot; capable of engaging the cell suicide apparatus but not the nuclear factor kappa B pathway in the system studied. Unlike Fas, TNFR-1, and DR3, DR4 could not use FADD to transmit the death signal, suggesting the use of distinct proximal signaling machinery. Thus, the DR4-TRAIL axis defines another receptor-ligand pair involved in regulating cell suicide and tissue homeostasis. 	Science	D016428 D013487
1532289	19920401	Six novel deleterious and three neutral mutations in the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of hexosaminidase A in non-Jewish individuals.	Initial investigations demonstrated that only 3/34 &quot;Tay-Sachs chromosomes&quot; in 22 unrelated, non-Jewish patients or carriers of some form of GM2-gangliosidosis (7 black and 15 non-Jewish Caucasian) had either of the two mutations commonly found in the Jewish population. To determine the nature and incidence of the alterations in this non-Jewish population we have utilized PCR, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and sequencing to detect new mutations in genomic DNA. Fourteen primer sets have been utilized to analyze 80% of the coding region and 23/26 splice sites of the gene coding for the alpha chain of hexosaminidase A. Presumed deleterious mutations were discovered in 17/34 chromosomes believed to be carrying a beta-hexosaminidase A alpha-subunit gene mutation. Ten had abnormalities which have been described previously. In the remaining 24 Tay-Sachs disease alleles, six novel mutations predicted to be deleterious were discovered. These include two small deletions (a single-base frameshift and a three-base deletion removing an amino acid), two different nonsense mutations, an initiation codon mutation (ATG----GTG), and a missense mutation (Arg499Cys) in a highly conserved residue. In addition, three presumed nondeleterious mutations were found. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013487
15254937	20040716	Analysis of an early-onset Parkinson's disease cohort for DJ-1 mutations.	The frequency and relative contribution of DJ-1 mutations in early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) is currently unknown. We analyzed a cohort of 89 EOPD patients (mean age at onset of PD +/- SD, 41.5 +/- 7.2 years), ascertained independent of family history, who participated in a study of the genetic epidemiology of PD. This study includes sequence analysis of the DJ-1 gene in addition to assaying the 14,082-bp deletion spanning exons 1 to 5, previously identified in a Dutch kindred, in 89 EOPD cases. A heterozygous missense mutation in exon 5 (A104T) was identified in an EOPD case of Asian ethnicity; this sequence variant was absent in 308 control chromosomes. We identified additional sequence variation in the DJ-1 gene, including a polymorphism in the coding region in exon 5 (R98Q), three polymorphisms in the 5' untranslated region (exon 1A/1B), and two polymorphisms in intronic regions (IVS1 and IVS5). Mutations in the DJ-1 gene are rare in EOPD in both sporadic and familial cases. 	Mov._Disord.	D016428 D013485 D013487
10767172	20000418	Structure and analysis of the human dimethylglycine dehydrogenase gene.	Dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (DMGDH; E.C. 1.5.99.2) is an enzyme involved in the catabolism of choline, catalyzing the oxidative demethylation of dimethylglycine (DMG) to form sarcosine. Subsequently, sarcosine dehydrogenase (SDH; E.C. 1.5.99.1) converts sarcosine to glycine via a similar reaction. Both enzymes are found as monomers in the mitochondrial matrix, and both contain 1 mol of covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide. DMGDH and SDH also utilize a noncovalently bound folate coenzyme that receives the &quot;1-carbon&quot; groups that are removed by DMGDH and SDH, forming &quot;active formaldehyde.&quot; We have recently described a new inborn error of metabolism of DMGDH characterized by an unusual fish-like body odor. To augment our study of this new disorder, we have isolated two human genomic clones that together contain 16 exons of coding sequence for the hDMGDH gene. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis of the hDMGDH gene indicates that it is found on chromosome 5q12.2-q12.3. In addition, several polymorphisms have been identified in the hDMGDH cDNA sequence. Population analysis of two Ser/Pro polymorphisms found 367 amino acids apart reveals a skew of alleles, with the haplotypes Ser/Pro or Pro/Ser (79%) overrepresented compared to the number of Ser/Ser or Pro/Pro alleles observed. Possible functional consequences of these findings are discussed. Characterization of the gene structure for hDMGDH will aid in the study of patients with inherited defects of this enzyme.

11309420	20010420	Myopalladin, a novel 145-kilodalton sarcomeric protein with multiple roles in Z-disc and I-band protein assemblies.	We describe here a novel sarcomeric 145-kD protein, myopalladin, which tethers together the COOH-terminal Src homology 3 domains of nebulin and nebulette with the EF hand motifs of alpha-actinin in vertebrate Z-lines. Myopalladin's nebulin/nebulette and alpha-actinin-binding sites are contained in two distinct regions within its COOH-terminal 90-kD domain. Both sites are highly homologous with those found in palladin, a protein described recently required for actin cytoskeletal assembly (Parast, M.M., and C.A. Otey. 2000. J. Cell Biol. 150:643-656). This suggests that palladin and myopalladin may have conserved roles in stress fiber and Z-line assembly. The NH(2)-terminal region of myopalladin specifically binds to the cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP), a nuclear protein involved in control of muscle gene expression. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy studies revealed that myopalladin also colocalized with CARP in the central I-band of striated muscle sarcomeres. Overexpression of myopalladin's NH(2)-terminal CARP-binding region in live cardiac myocytes resulted in severe disruption of all sarcomeric components studied, suggesting that the myopalladin-CARP complex in the central I-band may have an important regulatory role in maintaining sarcomeric integrity. Our data also suggest that myopalladin may link regulatory mechanisms involved in Z-line structure (via alpha-actinin and nebulin/nebulette) to those involved in muscle gene expression (via CARP).

21636066	20110604	Mutations in FYCO1 cause autosomal-recessive congenital cataracts.	Congenital cataracts (CCs), responsible for about one-third of blindness in infants, are a major cause of vision loss in children worldwide. Autosomal-recessive congenital cataracts (arCC) form a clinically diverse and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders of the crystalline lens. To identify the genetic cause of arCC in consanguineous Pakistani families, we performed genome-wide linkage analysis and fine mapping and identified linkage to 3p21-p22 with a summed LOD score of 33.42. Mutations in the gene encoding FYVE and coiled-coil domain containing 1 (FYCO1), a PI(3)P-binding protein family member that is associated with the exterior of autophagosomes and mediates microtubule plus-end-directed vesicle transport, were identified in 12 Pakistani families and one Arab Israeli family in which arCC had previously been mapped to the overlapping CATC2 region. Nine different mutations were identified, including c.3755 delC (p.Ala1252AspfsX71), c.3858_3862dupGGAAT (p.Leu1288TrpfsX37), c.1045 C&gt;T (p.Gln349X), c.2206C&gt;T (p.Gln736X), c.2761C&gt;T (p.Arg921X), c.2830C&gt;T (p.Arg944X), c.3150+1 G&gt;T, c.4127T&gt;C (p.Leu1376Pro), and c.1546C&gt;T (p.Gln516X). Fyco1 is expressed in the mouse embryonic and adult lens and peaks at P12d. Expressed mutant proteins p.Leu1288TrpfsX37 and p.Gln736X are truncated on immunoblots. Wild-type and p.L1376P FYCO1, the only missense mutant identified, migrate at the expected molecular mass. Both wild-type and p. Leu1376Pro FYCO1 proteins expressed in human lens epithelial cells partially colocalize to microtubules and are found adjacent to Golgi, but they primarily colocalize to autophagosomes. Thus, FYCO1 is involved in lens development and transparency in humans, and mutations in this gene are one of the most common causes of arCC in the Pakistani population. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.

12530222	20030118	Pheromone binding proteins of Epiphyas postvittana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) are encoded at a single locus.	The light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana (Tortricidae: Lepidoptera) uses a blend of (E)-11-tetradecenyl acetate and (E,E)-9,11-tetradecadienyl acetate as its sex pheromone. Odorant binding proteins, abundant in the antennae of male and female E. postvittana, were separated by native PAGE to reveal four major proteins with distinct mobilities. Microsequencing of their N-terminal residues showed that two were general odorant binding proteins (GOBPs) while two were pheromone binding proteins (PBPs). Full length cDNAs encoding these proteins were amplified using a combination of PCR and RACE-PCR. Sequence of the GOBPs revealed two genes (EposGOBP1, EposGOBP2), similar to orthologues in other species of Lepidoptera. Eleven cDNAs of the PBP gene were amplified, cloned and sequenced revealing two major phylogenetic clusters of PBP sequences differing by six amino acid substitutions. The position of the six amino acid differences on the protein was predicted by mapping onto the three-dimensional structure of PBP of Bombyx mori. All six substitutions were predicted to fall on the outside of the protein away from the inner pheromone binding pocket. One substitution does fall close to the putative dimerisation region of the protein (Ser63Thr). Expression of three of the cDNAs in a baculovirus expression system revealed that one class encodes an electrophoretically slow form (EposPBP1-12) while the other encodes a fast form (EposPBP1-2, EposPBP1-3). A native Western of these expressed proteins compared with antennal protein extracts demonstrated that PBP is also expressed in female antennae and that PBP may be present as a dimer as well as a monomer in E. postvittana. The fast and slow forms of EposPBP1 are allelic. Westerns on single antennal pair protein extracts and allele-specific PCR from genomic DNA both show a segregating pattern of inheritance in laboratory and wild populations. Radio labelled (E)-11-tetradecenyl acetate binds to both fast and slow PBP forms in gel assays. Taken together, the genetic and biochemical data do not support the hypothesis that these PBPs are specific for each component of the E. postvittana pheromone. However, duplication of this PBP locus in the future might allow such diversification to evolve, as observed in the other species. 	Insect_Biochem._Mol._Biol.	D016428 D013485
20093627	20100123	Myozap, a novel intercalated disc protein, activates serum response factor-dependent signaling and is required to maintain cardiac function in vivo.	The intercalated disc (ID) is a highly specialized cell-cell contact structure that ensures mechanical and electric coupling of contracting cardiomyocytes. Recently, the ID has been recognized to be a hot spot of cardiac disease, in particular inherited cardiomyopathy. Given its complex structure and function we hypothesized that important molecular constituents of the ID still remain unknown. Using a bioinformatics screen, we discovered and cloned a previously uncharacterized 54 kDa cardiac protein which we termed Myozap (Myocardium-enriched zonula occludens-1-associated protein). Myozap is strongly expressed in the heart and lung. In cardiac tissue it localized to the ID and directly binds to desmoplakin and zonula occludens-1. In a yeast 2-hybrid screen for additional binding partners of Myozap we identified myosin phosphatase-RhoA interacting protein (MRIP), a negative regulator of Rho activity. Myozap, in turn, strongly activates SRF-dependent transcription through its ERM (Ezrin/radixin/moesin)-like domain in a Rho-dependent fashion. Finally, in vivo knockdown of the Myozap ortholog in zebrafish led to severe contractile dysfunction and cardiomyopathy. Taken together, these findings reveal Myozap as a previously unrecognized component of a Rho-dependent signaling pathway that links the intercalated disc to cardiac gene regulation. Moreover, its subcellular localization and the observation of a severe cardiac phenotype in zebrafish, implicate Myozap in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy. 	Circ._Res.	D016428 D052061 D013485
11039935	20001020	Two-amino acid molecular switch in an epithelial morphogen that regulates binding to two distinct receptors.	Ectodysplasin, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family, is encoded by the anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (EDA) gene. Mutations in EDA give rise to a clinical syndrome characterized by loss of hair, sweat glands, and teeth. EDA-A1 and EDA-A2 are two isoforms of ectodysplasin that differ only by an insertion of two amino acids. This insertion functions to determine receptor binding specificity, such that EDA-A1 binds only the receptor EDAR, whereas EDA-A2 binds only the related, but distinct, X-linked ectodysplasin-A2 receptor (XEDAR). In situ binding and organ culture studies indicate that EDA-A1 and EDA-A2 are differentially expressed and play a role in epidermal morphogenesis. 	Science	D016428
10328397	19990518	A mutation within exon 14 of the TGFBI (BIGH3) gene on chromosome 5q31 causes an asymmetric, late-onset form of lattice corneal dystrophy.	Two forms of autosomal-dominant lattice corneal dystrophy (LCD), types I and IIIA, have previously been shown to be caused by different mutations within the transforming growth factor, beta-induced (TGFBI) gene. A clinical and molecular analysis of three unrelated kindreds with a clinically distinct late-onset LCD was undertaken to determine whether this phenotype is also caused by mutations within the TGFBI gene. Experimental study. Thirty-two members of three kindreds with corneal dystrophy. DNA from 100 normal control subjects was used as a control population. Members of three kindreds with LCD were examined clinically, and blood samples were taken for DNA analysis. Mutation analysis was undertaken on all individuals for the coding region of the TGFBI gene by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by single-stranded conformation polymorphism/heteroduplex analysis, subcloning, and sequencing. Detection of mutations within the TGFBI gene. Clinical examination revealed a form of LCD that was bilateral in all but one case, with onset around the fourth to fifth decade. The majority of cases showed significant asymmetry, and in one case there was evidence of onset directly after minor superficial corneal trauma. Molecular analysis in all families demonstrated sequence changes within exon 14 of the TGFBI gene on chromosome 5q31, at codon 622 in family 3, and at codon 626 in families 1 and 2, which are presumed to be responsible for the disease. Previously, a late-onset form of LCD, termed IIIA, was shown to be caused by a P501T mutation in exon 11 of TGFBI. The authors present the first description of mutations in exon 14 of TGFBI causing an LCD, also of late onset. Although the condition presented is morphologically and histopathologically typical of an isolated lattice dystrophy, the age of onset and clinical course is not typical of type I, III, or IIIA lattice dystrophy. This, in conjunction with recent developments in our understanding of the molecular genetics of these disorders, calls into question the usefulness and validity of the current classification of the isolated lattice dystrophies.

21495993	20110419	Two novel mutations of the nicastrin gene in Chinese patients with acne inversa.	Acne inversa (AI, OMIM 142690), also called hidradenitis suppurativa, is a chronic, inflammatory, recurrent and debilitating skin follicular disease that usually presents after puberty with painful, deep-seated, inflamed lesions in the apocrine gland-bearing areas of the body, most commonly the axilla, inguinal and anogenital regions.(1) The prevalence of AI has been estimated at 1 in 100 to 1 in 600.(2) Of patients with AI, 35-40% have a positive family history.(3) The pattern of transmission is consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.(4) In 2006, Gao et al.(5) mapped the AI gene at chromosome 1p21.1-1q25.3. In 2010, Wang et al.(6) were the first to identify mutations of ?-secretase genes responsible for AI among six Chinese families. ?-Secretase is a transmembrane protease composed of four essential protein subunits: one catalytic presenilin (PSEN1) subunit and three cofactor subunits [presenilin enhancer 2 (PSENEN), nicastrin (NCSTN) and anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1)]. Two, one and three mutations were found in PSENEN, PSEN1 and NCSTN, respectively. Here, we report a heterozygous nonsense c.1695T&gt;G mutation and a heterozygous missense c.632C&gt;G mutation of the NCSTN gene in two Chinese AI families. 	Br._J._Dermatol.	D002363 D016428 D013485
15854030	20050428	A novel mutation in the lysyl hydroxylase 1 gene causes decreased lysyl hydroxylase activity in an Ehlers-Danlos VIA patient.	The clinical diagnosis of a patient with the phenotype of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VI was confirmed biochemically by the severely diminished level of lysyl hydroxylase (LH) activity in the patient's skin fibroblasts. A novel homozygous mutation, a single base change of T(1360)--&gt;G in exon 13 of the LH1 gene, predicted to result in W446G, was identified in the patient's full-length cDNA. This was confirmed in genomic DNA from both the patient and her parents, who were heterozygous for the mutation. This mutation was introduced into an LH1-pAcGP67 baculoviral construct and expressed, in parallel with normal LH1, in an insect cell system. The loss of LH activity in the mutated recombinant construct confirmed the pathogenicity of this mutation. Although not in the major catalytic site, this mutation occurs in a highly conserved region of the LH1 gene and may contribute to loss of activity by interfering with normal folding of the enzyme.

12080485	20020625	Mutations in two genes encoding different subunits of a receptor signaling complex result in an identical disease phenotype.	Polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy (PLOSL), also known as &quot;Nasu-Hakola disease,&quot; is a globally distributed recessively inherited disease leading to death during the 5th decade of life and is characterized by early-onset progressive dementia and bone cysts. Elsewhere, we have identified PLOSL mutations in TYROBP (DAP12), which codes for a membrane receptor component in natural-killer and myeloid cells, and also have identified genetic heterogeneity in PLOSL, with some patients carrying no mutations in TYROBP. Here we complete the molecular pathology of PLOSL by identifying TREM2 as the second PLOSL gene. TREM2 forms a receptor signaling complex with TYROBP and triggers activation of the immune responses in macrophages and dendritic cells. Patients with PLOSL have no defects in cell-mediated immunity, suggesting a remarkable capacity of the human immune system to compensate for the inactive TYROBP-mediated activation pathway. Our data imply that the TYROBP-mediated signaling pathway plays a significant role in human brain and bone tissue and provide an interesting example of how mutations in two different subunits of a multisubunit receptor complex result in an identical human disease phenotype.

18192679	20080115	Huntingtin-associated protein-1 is a modifier of the age-at-onset of Huntington's disease.	A polyglutamine repeat expansion of more than 36 units in a protein called huntingtin (htt) is the only known cause of Huntington's disease (HD). The expanded repeat length is inversely correlated with the age-at-onset (AAO), however, the onset age among HD patients with CAG repeats below 60 units varies considerably. In addition to environmental factors, genetic factors different from the expanded CAG repeat length can modify the AAO of HD. We hypothezised that htt interacting proteins might contribute to this variation in the AAO and investigated human htt-associated protein-1 (HAP1) using genetic and functional assays. We identified six polymorphisms in the HAP1 gene including one that substitutes methionine (M441) for threonine (T441) at amino acid 441. Analyzing 980 European HD patients, we found that patients homozygous for the M441 genotype show an 8-year delay in the AAO. Functional assays demonstrated that human M441-HAP1 interacts with mutant htt more tightly than does human T441-HAP1, reduces soluble htt degraded products and protects against htt-mediated toxicity. We thus provide genetic and functional evidence that the M441-HAP1 polymorphism modifies the AAO of HD. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013485
2243100	19901125	Characterization of human 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 5-delta 4-isomerase gene and its expression in mammalian cells.	Three beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 5-delta 4-isomerase (3 beta-HSD) catalyze the oxidative conversion of delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroids to the delta 4-3-keto configuration and is therefore essential for the biosynthesis of all classes of hormonal steroids, namely progesterone, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, androgens, and estrogens. Using human 3 beta-HSD cDNA as probe, a human 3 beta-HSD gene was isolated from a lambda-EMBL3 library of leucocyte genomic DNA. A fragment of 3 beta-HSD genomic DNA was also obtained by amplification of genomic DNA using the polymerase chain reaction. The 3 beta-HSD gene contains a 5'-untranslated exon of 53 base pairs (bp) and three successive translated exons of 232, 165, and 1218 bp, respectively, separated by introns of 129, 3883, and 2162 bp. The transcription start site is situated 267 nucleotides upstream from the ATG initiating codon. DNA sequence analysis of the 5'-flanking region reveals the existence of a putative TATA box (ATAAA) situated 28 nucleotides upstream from the transcription start site while a putative CAAT binding sequence is located 57 nucleotides upstream from the TATA box. Expression of a cDNA insert containing the coding region of 3 beta-HSD in nonsteroidogenic cells shows that the gene encodes a single 42-kDa protein containing both 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and delta 5-delta 4-isomerase activities. Moreover, all natural steroid substrates tested are transformed with comparable efficiency by the enzyme. In addition to its importance for studies of the regulation of expression of 3 beta-HSD in gonadal as well as peripheral tissues, knowledge of the structure of the human 3 beta-HSD gene should permit investigation of the molecular defects responsible for 3 beta-HSD deficiency, the second most common cause of adrenal hyperplasia in children.

19540318	20090623	Characterization of mature mitochondrial transcripts in Drosophila, and the implications for the tRNA punctuation model in arthropods.	The mitochondrial genome of Drosophila melanogaster is thought to be transcribed in about five polycistronic primary transcripts, which are processed into 11 mRNA, 22 tRNA and two rRNA species required for the genome's function. The tRNA punctuation model has been proposed to predict the cleavage sites used in this process. In this model, tRNAs are removed from the primary transcripts and the fragments that remain become mRNA and rRNA transcripts. Thus the 5' and 3' ends of the major gene transcripts are defined by the endpoints of the intervening tRNA sequences. We used 5' and 3' RACE, and circularization and RT-PCR methods to determine the sequences of both ends of all major gene transcripts of the D. melanogaster mitochondrial genome. In general, the tRNA punctuation model accurately predicts the 3' ends of most mRNA and rRNA molecules, even where there are non-coding residues present. Non-coding residues at the 5' end are evidently removed during RNA processing. The mRNAs begin precisely at the start codon for each gene. In particular, the 5' end of the cox1 gene is the first in-frame sense codon, UCG, implying that this codon serves as the start. In-frame TAA stop codons immediately preceding both the cox1 and cox2 genes may serve to prevent in-frame translation of these genes prior to the completion of processing, and are removed from the mature transcripts. Where multiple tRNA genes are present, as between nad3 and nad5, they are removed sequentially in a 3' to 5' direction. 	Gene	D016428 D013485
12093361	20020703	Deficiency of dolichyl-P-Man:Man7GlcNAc2-PP-dolichyl mannosyltransferase causes congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ig.	Deficiency of the endoplasmic reticulum enzyme dolichyl-phosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man):Man(7)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichyl mannosyltransferase leads to a new type of congenital disorder of glycosylation, designated type Ig. The patient 1 presented with a multisystemic disorder with microcephaly, developmental retardation, convulsions and dysmorphic signs. The isoelectric focusing pattern of the patient's serum transferrin showed the partial loss of complete N-glycan side chains. In skin fibroblasts from the patient, the activity of Dol-P-Man:Man(7)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol mannosyltransferase was severely reduced leading to the accumulation of Man(7)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol, which was transferred to newly synthesized glycoproteins. Sequencing of the Dol-P-Man:Man(7)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol mannosyltransferase cDNA revealed a compound heterozygosity for two point mutations, leading to the exchange of leucine(158) for a proline residue and a premature translation stop with loss of the C-terminal 74 amino acids. The parents were heterozygous for one of the two mutations. Retroviral expression of the wild-type Dol-P-Man:Man(7)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol mannosyltransferase cDNA in patient's fibroblasts normalized the mannosyltransferase activity. 	Biochem._J.	D016428 D013485
8981943	19970101	Most germ-line mutations in the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome lead to a premature termination of the PATCHED protein, and no genotype-phenotype correlations are evident.	The human homologue of the Drosophila segment polarity gene patched is implicated in the development of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) and in the genesis of sporadic basal cell carcinomas. In order to examine the phenotypic variability in NBCCS and to highlight functionally important domains of the PTCH protein, we have now screened 71 unrelated NBCCS individuals for mutations in the PTCH exons. We identified 28 mutations that are distributed throughout the entire gene, and most (86%) cause protein truncation. As part of this analysis, we demonstrate that failure of one NBCCS family to show clear linkage to chromosome 9q22.3-31 is most likely due to germinal mosaicism. We have identified three families bearing identical mutations with variable phenotypes, suggesting phenotypic variability in NBCCS is a complex genetic event. No phenotype genotype correlation between the position of truncation mutations and major clinical features was evident. Two missense mutations have been identified, and their location within transmembrane domains supports the notion that PTCH may have a transport function. The preponderance of truncation mutants in the germ line of NBCCS patients suggests that the developmental defects associated with the disorder are most likely due to haploinsufficiency.

15862286	20050503	Adaptive evolution of MRGX2, a human sensory neuron specific gene involved in nociception.	MRGX2, a G-protein-coupled receptor, is specifically expressed in the sensory neurons of the human peripheral nervous system and involved in nociception. Here, we studied DNA polymorphism patterns and evolution of the MRGX2 gene in world-wide human populations and the representative nonhuman primate species. Our results demonstrated that MRGX2 had undergone adaptive changes in the path of human evolution, which were likely caused by Darwinian positive selection. The patterns of DNA sequence polymorphisms in human populations showed an excess of derived substitutions, which against the expectation of neutral evolution, implying that the adaptive evolution of MRGX2 in humans was a relatively recent event. The reconstructed secondary structure of the human MRGX2 revealed that three of the four human-specific amino acid substitutions were located in the extra-cellular domains. Such critical substitutions may alter the interactions between MRGX2 protein and its ligand, thus, potentially led to adaptive changes of the pain-perception-related nervous system during human evolution.

Fumarase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of the citric acid cycle causing severe neurological impairment. The cDNA for both the rat and human enzymes has been cloned previously and shown to encode a coding region of 1.46 kb. To scan for mutations in fumarase-deficient patients we amplified the coding region of fumarase from fibroblast/lymphoblast cDNA employing the oligonucleotide primers designed from the published human and rat cDNA sequence. We then directly sequenced the polymerase chain reaction product. In seven unrelated patients, we detected four missense mutations (A265T, D383V, F269C, K187R), a nonsense mutation (W458X), a 3-bp AAA insertion that introduces an additional lysine residue at codon 435, and a spontaneous new mutation resulting in a 74-bp deletion (66del74). Seven at-risk pregnancies were monitored with one prenatal diagnosis of fumarase deficiency by molecular analysis and favorable outcome of the other pregnancies as predicted by enzyme assay of cultured fetal cells or molecular analysis.

22553128	20120504	Prostaglandin transporter mutations cause pachydermoperiostosis with myelofibrosis.	Pachydermoperiostosis, or primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (PHO), is an inherited multisystem disorder, whose features closely mimic the reactive osteoarthropathy that commonly accompanies neoplastic and inflammatory pathologies. We previously described deficiency of the prostaglandin-degrading enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD) as a cause of this condition, implicating elevated circulating prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) as causative of PHO, and perhaps also as the principal mediator of secondary HO. However, PHO is genetically heterogeneous. Here, we use whole-exome sequencing to identify recessive mutations of the prostaglandin transporter SLCO2A1, in individuals lacking HPGD mutations. We performed exome sequencing of four probands with severe PHO, followed by conventional mutation analysis of SLCO2A1 in nine others. Biallelic SLCO2A1 mutations were identified in 12 of the 13 families. Affected individuals had elevated urinary PGE(2), but unlike HPGD-deficient patients, also excreted considerable quantities of the PGE(2) metabolite, PGE-M. Clinical differences between the two groups were also identified, notably that SLCO2A1-deficient individuals have a high frequency of severe anemia due to myelofibrosis. These findings reinforce the key role of systemic or local prostaglandin excess as the stimulus to HO. They also suggest that the induction or maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells by prostaglandin may depend upon transporter activity. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428 D013485
9779809	19981021	Identification of a missense mutation in a Friedreich's ataxia patient: implications for diagnosis and carrier studies.	Approximately 95% of all Friedreich's ataxia (FA) patients are homozygous for a large GAA triplet-repeat expansion in the first intron of the Friedreich's ataxia gene (FRDA). The remaining cases are expected to be compound heterozygous with a GAA expansion on one allele and a point mutation on the other. Generally, the clinical diagnostic profile in this group of patients is indistinguishable from that in classic FA patients with homozygous expansions. This study describes a mildly affected patient who presents with only one expanded allele by Southern blot analysis. Point mutation screening shows a single base change in FRDA exon 3 resulting in a nonconservative amino acid replacement in the N-terminal portion of the frataxin protein. Extended family studies show that two of the patient's sibs are carriers of the expanded allele and one is a carrier of the missense mutation. This case study demonstrates the benefits of implementing a combined Southern blot and point mutation diagnostic protocol for compound heterozygous patients. By identifying both mutations, this procedure confirms the diagnosis of FA in patients with an atypical disease course and allows for more complete family studies. 	Am._J._Med._Genet.

25568300	20150109	The phenotypic spectrum of SCN8A encephalopathy.	SCN8A encodes the sodium channel voltage-gated ?8-subunit (Nav1.6). SCN8A mutations have recently been associated with epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders. We aimed to delineate the phenotype associated with SCN8A mutations. We used high-throughput sequence analysis of the SCN8A gene in 683 patients with a range of epileptic encephalopathies. In addition, we ascertained cases with SCN8A mutations from other centers. A detailed clinical history was obtained together with a review of EEG and imaging data. Seventeen patients with de novo heterozygous mutations of SCN8A were studied. Seizure onset occurred at a mean age of 5 months (range: 1 day to 18 months); in general, seizures were not triggered by fever. Fifteen of 17 patients had multiple seizure types including focal, tonic, clonic, myoclonic and absence seizures, and epileptic spasms; seizures were refractory to antiepileptic therapy. Development was normal in 12 patients and slowed after seizure onset, often with regression; 5 patients had delayed development from birth. All patients developed intellectual disability, ranging from mild to severe. Motor manifestations were prominent including hypotonia, dystonia, hyperreflexia, and ataxia. EEG findings comprised moderate to severe background slowing with focal or multifocal epileptiform discharges. SCN8A encephalopathy presents in infancy with multiple seizure types including focal seizures and spasms in some cases. Outcome is often poor and includes hypotonia and movement disorders. The majority of mutations arise de novo, although we observed a single case of somatic mosaicism in an unaffected parent. 	Neurology	D016428 D052061 D013485
19777577	20090925	CC2D2A mutations in Meckel and Joubert syndromes indicate a genotype-phenotype correlation.	Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS) is a lethal fetal disorder characterized by diffuse renal cystic dysplasia, polydactyly, a brain malformation that is usually occipital encephalocele, and/or vermian agenesis, with intrahepatic biliary duct proliferation. Joubert syndrome (JBS) is a viable neurological disorder with a characteristic &quot;molar tooth sign&quot; (MTS) on axial images reflecting cerebellar vermian hypoplasia/dysplasia. Both conditions are classified as ciliopathies with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Allelism of MKS and JBS has been reported for TMEM67/MKS3, CEP290/MKS4, and RPGRIP1L/MKS5. Recently, one homozygous splice mutation with a founder effect was reported in the CC2D2A gene in Finnish fetuses with MKS, defining the 6th locus for MKS. Shortly thereafter, CC2D2A mutations were also reported in JBS. The analysis of the CC2D2A gene in our series of MKS fetuses, identified 14 novel truncating mutations in 11 cases. These results confirm the involvement of CC2D2A in MKS and reveal a major contribution of CC2D2A to the disease. We also identified three missense CC2D2A mutations in two JBS cases. Therefore, and in accordance with the data reported regarding RPGRIP1L, our results indicate phenotype-genotype correlations, as missense and presumably hypomorphic mutations lead to JBS while all null alleles lead to MKS.

11350187	20010515	Identification of four novel mutations in classical Menkes disease and successful prenatal DNA diagnosis.	Menkes disease is an X-linked recessive disorder of the copper metabolism and affected males suffer a systemic copper deficiency due to malabsorption and defective distribution of dietary copper. It is caused by a defect in the Menkes (ATP7A) gene, which encodes a transmembrane copper-transporting P-type ATPase. A variety of mutations were reported; however, only a few mutations were reported in Asian patients. We identified four novel mutations and one known mutation in five Korean patients. Arg646Ter in exon 8, a novel mutation transmitted from his carrier mother, was identified in one patient. Prenatal DNA diagnosis on an unaffected fetus in this carrier mother was successfully accomplished. An additional three novel mutations, Leu706Arg in exon 9, Gly1118Asp in exon 17, and Gly1255Arg in exon 19, were identified. Splicing mutation was not identified. Menkes disease in Korean patients appears to be caused by heterogeneous mutations with different spectrums from Caucasian patients. 	Mol._Genet._Metab.	D002363 D016428 D013485

Miyoshi distal myopathy (MM) and limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) were found to map to the same mutant gene encoding for dysferlin on chromosome 2p13. Most reported cases were large inbred kindreds whose members demonstrated both MM and LGMD2B phenotypes. To investigate the clinical, neurophysiological, histopathological, and genetic features in 4 patients with MM from 2 unrelated Chinese families demonstrating linkage to the dysferlin locus. All patients were characterized by early adult onset, preferential atrophy, and weakness of calf muscles, marked elevation of serum creatine kinase levels, and absence of dysferlin staining. Magnetic resonance imaging showed fatty and fibrotic tissue signals in the affected muscles. Genetic analysis revealed novel compound heterozygous mutations, 1310+1G to A and GGG to GTC transition at nucleotide 1650 (G426V ) in one family and another novel compound heterozygous mutation, a deletion of C at nucleotide 477 and a CCG to CTG transition at nucleotide 6576 (P2068L), in the other family. Miyoshi distal myopathy in these 2 Chinese families demonstrated a homogenous phenotype and compound heterozygous mutations. Among the 4 mutations, 3 were novel mutations that, to our knowledge, have not been reported previously. 	Arch._Neurol.	D003160 D016428

21129728	20101207	Temtamy preaxial brachydactyly syndrome is caused by loss-of-function mutations in chondroitin synthase 1, a potential target of BMP signaling.	Altered Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling leads to multiple developmental defects, including brachydactyly and deafness. Here we identify chondroitin synthase 1 (CHSY1) as a potential mediator of BMP effects. We show that loss of human CHSY1 function causes autosomal-recessive Temtamy preaxial brachydactyly syndrome (TPBS), mainly characterized by limb malformations, short stature, and hearing loss. After mapping the TPBS locus to chromosome 15q26-qterm, we identified causative mutations in five consanguineous TPBS families. In zebrafish, antisense-mediated chsy1 knockdown causes defects in multiple developmental processes, some of which are likely to also be causative in the etiology of TPBS. In the inner ears of zebrafish larvae, chsy1 is expressed similarly to the BMP inhibitor dan and in a complementary fashion to bmp2b. Furthermore, unrestricted Bmp2b signaling or loss of Dan activity leads to reduced chsy1 expression and, during epithelial morphogenesis, defects similar to those that occur upon Chsy1 inactivation, indicating that Bmp signaling affects inner-ear development by repressing chsy1. In addition, we obtained strikingly similar zebrafish phenotypes after chsy1 overexpression, which might explain why, in humans, brachydactyly can be caused by mutations leading either to loss or to gain of BMP signaling.
