25921280	20150430	ABCB1 polymorphisms correlate with susceptibility to adult acute leukemia and response to high-dose methotrexate.	The aim of this study is to investigate the association of ABCB1 polymorphisms with susceptibility to adult acute leukemia, and the influence of ABCB1 polymorphisms on the efficacy of high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX). ABCB1 polymorphisms in 178 acute leukemia patients (case group) and 150 healthy subjects (control group) were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. All patients received HDMTX therapy. Correlation analysis was performed to explore the associations of ABCB1 polymorphisms with MTX concentration and efficacy of MTX therapy. All statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS 19.0 software. The frequency of TT genotype and T allele on ABCB1 3435C?&gt;?T in case group were significantly higher than the control group (P?&lt;?0.05), while no statistical difference between the two groups was observed in genotypic distribution and allele frequencies of ABCB1 2677G?&gt;?T/A (P?&gt;?0.05). Furthermore, 24-h MTX concentration of patients carrying TT and TA genotypes on 2677G?&gt;?T/A was higher than carriers with other genotypes (P?&lt;?0.05), and 24-h MTX concentration of patients with TT and CT genotypes on 3435C?&gt;?T was also apparently higher than carriers with CC genotype (P?&lt;?0.05). In addition, ABCB1 polymorphisms were connected with increased risk of liver dysfunction and infection (P?&lt;?0.05). Complete remission (CR) rate in patients carrying GG on 2677G?&gt;?T/A was markedly lower than carriers with non-GG genotype (P?&lt;?0.05). ABCB1 3435C?&gt;?T polymorphisms may be associated with susceptibility to acute leukemia, and ABCB1 polymorphisms might be a sensitive indicator for predicting efficacy of MTX therapy in the treatment of acute leukemia.

9843168	19981208	Factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene G 20210 A variant in children with ischemic stroke.	To investigate if the factor V Leiden mutation (F-V-LM) and/or the prothrombin gene G 20210 A variant (P-G20210A-V) are risk factors for acute stroke in Austrian children. 33 children with acute ischemic stroke documented by computer tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were enrolled in an open multicenter survey. 6/33 children had F-V-LM (5 heterozygous, 1 homozygous). This represents 18% (95% CI: 6.7-39.9%) of our pediatric stroke population and thus exceeds the expected prevalence in the Austrian population of 4,6% (Fischer's exact test, p = 0.01). F-V-LM was not found in 11 children with neonatal stroke but in 6/22 children with stroke after the neonatal period. 5/6 children with F-V-LM had an underlying disorder that is a risk factor for stroke in children. The P-G20210A-V was detected in 1/26 (3.85%; 95% CI: 0.1-21.4%) patients. Comparison of the prevalence of P-G20210A-V in our study with that in the general population of Austria of 1% revealed no statistical significance (Fischer's exact test, p = 0.38). Our data suggest that the F-V-LM is a risk factor for acute stroke in Austrian children beyond the neonatal period. The P-G20210A-V apparently does not represent a risk factor for stroke in Austrian children. 	Thromb._Haemost.	D016428 D013485
12540638	20030124	The E23K variant of Kir6.2 associates with impaired post-OGTT serum insulin response and increased risk of type 2 diabetes.	The E23K polymorphism of the pancreatic beta-cell ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel subunit Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) is associated with type 2 diabetes in whites, and a recent in vitro study of the E23K variant suggests that the association to diabetes might be explained by a slight inhibition of serum insulin release. In a study comprising 519 unrelated glucose-tolerant subjects, we addressed the question as to whether the E23K variant was related to reduced serum insulin release during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Furthermore, the polymorphism was examined in a case-control study comprising 803 type 2 diabetic patients and 862 glucose-tolerant control subjects. The E23K variant was associated with significant reductions in the insulinogenic index (P = 0.022) and serum insulin levels under the response curve during an OGTT (0-120 min) (P = 0.014) as well as with an increase in BMI (P = 0.013). In the present study, the association of the E23K polymorphism with type 2 diabetes was not significant (P = 0.26). However, the K23K genotype significantly associated with type 2 diabetes in a meta-analysis of white case and control subjects (n = 2,824, odds ratio [OR] 1.49, P = 0.00022). In conclusion, the widespread E23K polymorphism may have a diabetogenic effect by impairing glucose-induced insulin release and increasing BMI. 	Diabetes	D003160 D016428 D013485
8837474	19961001	Carboxyl terminal region of the MukB protein in Escherichia coli is essential for DNA binding activity.	The purified MukB protein of Escherichia coli has DNA binding activity and nucleotide binding activity. We have isolated a mutation, mukB1013, causing a substitution of valine at position 1379 to leucine. This mutant MukB protein was defective for DNA binding, while the ATP binding activity remained unaffected. A truncated MukB protein that is short of 109 amino acids from the C-terminus failed to bind DNA. 	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D016428 D013485
11369770	20010523	The subnuclear three-dimensional image analysis of androgen receptor fused to green fluorescence protein.	To establish the novel approach in order to distinguish the transcriptionally active androgen receptor (AR) from the transcriptionally inactive AR, we performed the three-dimensional construction of confocal microscopic images of intranuclear AR. This method clearly distinguished the subnuclear localization of transcriptionally active AR tagged with green fluorescent protein (AR-GFP) from the transcriptionally inactive AR-GFP. Transcriptionally active AR-GFP mainly produced 250-400 fluorescence foci in the boundary region between euchromatin and heterochromatin. Although the AR-GFP bound to such antiandrogens as hydroxyflutamide or bicalutamide translocated to the nucleus, they homogeneously spread throughout the nucleus without producing any fluorescence foci. Antiandrogenic environmental disrupting chemicals, such as 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene, vinclozolin, or nitrofen, also disrupted the intranuclear fluorescence foci. A point mutation (T877A) resulted in the loss of ligand specificity in AR-GFP. Even in this mutant receptor, agonists, such as dihydrotestosterone, hydroxyflutamide, or progesterone, produced the fluorescence foci in the nucleus, whereas the transcriptionally inactive mutant binding bicalutamide was observed to be spread homogeneously in the nucleus. Taken together, our findings suggest that, after nuclear translocation, AR is possibly located in the specific region in the nucleus while demonstrating clustering tightly depending on the agonist-induced transactivation competence.

11801251	20020122	Replacement of the methionine axial ligand in cytochrome c(550) by a lysine: effects on the haem electronic structure.	The prosthetic group of low-spin haem proteins is an iron porphyrin with two axial ligands, typically histidine, methionine or lysine. Determining the geometry of the axial ligands is an important step in structural characterisation, particularly in the paramagnetic oxidised forms. This work extends earlier studies of the hyperfine nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shifts of haem substituents in bis-His and His-Met cytochromes to His-Lys co-ordination in the M100K mutant of Paracoccus versutus cytochrome c(550). The electronic structure of the His-Lys haem is shown to be similar to that produced by His-cyanide co-ordination, such that NMR can be used to determine the geometry of the His ligand. 	FEBS_Lett.

22253645	20120119	Hypokalemic periodic paralysis; two different genes responsible for similar clinical manifestations.	Primary hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HOKPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder manifesting as recurrent periodic flaccid paralysis and concomitant hypokalemia. HOKPP is divided into type 1 and type 2 based on the causative gene. Although 2 different ion channels have been identified as the molecular genetic cause of HOKPP, the clinical manifestations between the 2 groups are similar. We report the cases of 2 patients with HOKPP who both presented with typical clinical manifestations, but with mutations in 2 different genes (CACNA1Sp.Arg528His and SCN4A p.Arg672His). Despite the similar clinical manifestations, there were differences in the response to acetazolamide treatment between certain genotypes of SCN4A mutations and CACNA1S mutations. We identified p.Arg672His in the SCN4A gene of patient 2 immediately after the first attack through a molecular genetic testing strategy. Molecular genetic diagnosis is important for genetic counseling and selecting preventive treatment. 	Korean_J_Pediatr	D016428
8931144	19961101	Individual amino acids in the N-terminal loop region determine the thermostability and unfolding characteristics of bacterial glucanases.	Thermostability and unfolding behavior of the wild-type (1,3-1,4)-beta-glucanases from Bacillus macerans (MAC) and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (AMY) and of two hybrid enzymes H(A12-M) delta F14 and H(A12-M) delta Y13F14A were studied by spectroscopic and microcalorimetric measurements. H(A12-M) delta F14 is constructed by the fusion of 12 N-terminal amino acids of AMY with amino acids 13-214 of MAC, and by deletion of F14. In H(A12-M) delta Y13F14A, the N-terminal region of MAC is exchanged against the AMY sequence, Y13 is deleted, and Phe 14 is exchanged against Ala. The sequence of the N-terminal loop region from Pro 9 to amino acid 16 (or 17) is very important for the properties of the enzymes and influences the effects of Ca2+ ions on the thermostability and unfolding behavior of the enzymes. The half transition temperatures T(m) are higher in the presence of Ca2+ than in Ca2+ free buffer. Furthermore, the unfolding mechanism is influenced by Ca2+. In Ca(2+)-free buffer, MAC, H(A12-M) delta F14 and H(A12-M) delta Y13F14A unfold in a single cooperative transition from the folded state to the unfolded state, whereas for AMY, a two-step unfolding was found. In the presence of Ca2+, the two-step unfolding of AMY is strengthened. Furthermore, for H(A12-M) delta F14, a two-step unfolding is induced by Ca2+. These data indicate a two-domain structure of AMY and H(A12-M) delta F14, in the presence of Ca2+. Thus, point mutations in a peripheral loop region are decisive for thermal stabilities and unfolding mechanisms of the studied glucanases in the presence of Ca2+. 	Protein_Sci.	D016428 D013485
24645551	20140321	[The role of genetic factors in the prediction of myocardial infarction complications within one year follow up].	A sample of 165 patients with myocardial infarction (MI) with ST segment elevation has been studied to construct a prediction model for one-year period complications (recurrent nonfatal IM or cardiac death). Polymorphic genetic markers (n = 32) with confirmed role in pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease were analyzed. The best model to stratify patients by risk of post-IM complications included variants rs4291 (A-240T) in the ACE gene, rs6025 (G1691A, Leiden mutation) in the F5, and rs5918 (Leu59Pro) in the IGTB3. C statistics for the genetic model was 0.75 (0.64; 0.86), p = 0.001, which is comparable with characteristics of the GRACE scale for the same patients' population: 0.73 (0.61; 0.85). Thereby, analysis of a limited number of genetic markers was sufficient to create risk prediction model for post-MI complications with comparable effectiveness to the model, which is currently in use in clinical practice. To confirm the clinical validity, the predictive model obtained in the study should be evaluated in independent samples of MI patients. Association analysis of individual genetic markers with patients' outcomes has revealed that T allele carrier status (AT and TT genotypes) rs4291 of the ACE and CG genotype rs328 of the LPL gene are risk factors for cardiac death during one year after MI; Leiden mutation (rs6025) of the F5 gene is related to the higher risk of recurrent non-fatal MI or death during one year; CC genotype of the rs10811661, located in 9p21 locus has a protective effect against recurrent MI or death within one year after acute event.

17606451	20070704	Effects of the factor V G1691A mutation and the factor II G20210A variant on the clinical expression of severe hemophilia A in children--results of a multicenter studys.	The present multicenter cohort study of 107 pediatric PUPs was performed to determine whether the concomitant inheritance of the factor (F) V G1691A or the F II G20210A mutation influences the clinical expression of severe hemophilia A (HA). Carriers of the FV and FII mutations had a significantly lower annual bleeding frequency (ABF) than non-carriers (p=0.012). Joint damage (Pettersson score) was significantly less severe in patients with thrombophilia (p=0.022). A protective effect of thrombophilic risk factors was shown for ABF (OR [CIs]: 0.7[0.5-0.9]; p=0.02) and the severity of the hemophilic arthropathy (OR [CIs]: 0.06[0.01-0.3]; p=0.0009).

26834155	20160203	miR-23?27?24 clusters control effector T cell differentiation and function.	Coordinated repression of gene expression by evolutionarily conserved microRNA (miRNA) clusters and paralogs ensures that miRNAs efficiently exert their biological impact. Combining both loss- and gain-of-function genetic approaches, we show that the miR-23?27?24 clusters regulate multiple aspects of T cell biology, particularly helper T (Th) 2 immunity. Low expression of this miRNA family confers proper effector T cell function at both physiological and pathological settings. Further studies in T cells with exaggerated regulation by individual members of the miR-23?27?24 clusters revealed that miR-24 and miR-27 collaboratively limit Th2 responses through targeting IL-4 and GATA3 in both direct and indirect manners. Intriguingly, although overexpression of the entire miR-23 cluster also negatively impacts other Th lineages, enforced expression of miR-24, in contrast to miR-23 and miR-27, actually promotes the differentiation of Th1, Th17, and induced regulatory T cells, implying that under certain conditions, miRNA families can fine tune the biological effects of their regulation by having individual members antagonize rather than cooperate with each other. Together, our results identify a miRNA family with important immunological roles and suggest that tight regulation of miR-23?27?24 clusters in T cells is required to maintain optimal effector function and to prevent aberrant immune responses.

17214851	20070112	Analysis of the CC chemokine receptor 5 delta32 polymorphism in a Brazilian population with cutaneous leishmaniasis.	Patients with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) show a vigorous T-cell immune response against Leishmania braziliensis. Because the Th response is associated with inflammation, the non-functional CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) may rely in a less severe inflammatory state. The aim of this study was to investigate the CCR5 gene in a Brazilian population with leishmaniasis compared with healthy control subjects and to determine the progression from cutaneous to MCL in the Delta32 allele carriers. Among 100 patients with Montenegro skin test and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIF) values positive for leishmaniasis, there were 32% women and 68% men. The patients were 89% CCR5/CCR5, 10% CCR5/Delta32, and 1% Delta32/Delta32, while healthy subjects showed a 91% incidence of CCR5/CCR5, 8% of CCR5/Delta32, and 1% of Delta32/Delta32. The CCR5/CCR5 patients (89%) showed a large spectrum of clinical manifestations, where 22.47% had active mucous lesions and 77.53% had cutaneous lesions. In this work, the Delta32 allele carriers (10%) showed only cutaneous manifestations when compared with wild-type individuals. Finally, with regard to the Delta32 allele carriers, a less severe spectrum of clinical manifestations was observed in comparison with wild-type individuals. Although a lack of mucocutaneous lesions was evident among Delta32 allele carriers, the number of individuals studied was small. Therefore, further investigations are needed to elucidate the role of CCR5 in the clinical aspects of leishmaniasis. 	J._Cutan._Pathol.	D016428 D013485
12446743	20021126	Localized suppression of RhoA activity by Tyr31/118-phosphorylated paxillin in cell adhesion and migration.	RhoA activity is transiently inhibited at the initial phase of integrin engagement, when Cdc42- and/or Rac1-mediated membrane spreading and ruffling predominantly occur. Paxillin, an integrin-assembly protein, has four major tyrosine phosphorylation sites, and the phosphorylation of Tyr31 and Tyr118 correlates with cell adhesion and migration. We found that mutation of Tyr31/118 caused enhanced activation of RhoA and premature formation of stress fibers with substantial loss of efficient membrane spreading and ruffling in adhesion and migration of NMuMG cells. These phenotypes were similar to those induced by RhoA(G14V) in parental cells, and could be abolished by expression of RhoA(T19N), Rac1(G12V), or p190RhoGAP in the mutant-expressing cells. Phosphorylated Tyr31/118 was found to bind to two src homology (SH)2 domains of p120RasGAP, with coprecipitation of endogenous paxillin with p120RasGAP. p190RhoGAP is known to be a major intracellular binding partner for the p120RasGAP SH2 domains. We found that Tyr31/118-phosphorylated paxillin competes with p190RhoGAP for binding to p120RasGAP, and provides evidence that p190RhoGAP freed from p120RasGAP efficiently suppresses RhoA activity during cell adhesion. We conclude that Tyr31/118-phosphorylated paxillin serves as a template for the localized suppression of RhoA activity and is necessary for efficient membrane spreading and ruffling in adhesion and migration of NMuMG cells.

26617591	20151201	On the Ancestral UDP-Glucose Pyrophosphorylase Activity of GalF from Escherichia coli.	In bacteria, UDP-glucose is a central intermediate in carbohydrate metabolism. The enzyme responsible for its synthesis is encoded by the galU gene and its deletion generates cells unable to ferment galactose. In some bacteria, there is a second gene, galF, encoding for a protein with high sequence identity to GalU. However, the role of GalF has been contradictory regarding its catalytic capability and not well understood. In this work we show that GalF derives from a catalytic (UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase) ancestor, but its activity is very low compared to GalU. We demonstrated that GalF has some residual UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity by in vitro and in vivo experiments in which the phenotype of a galU (-) strain was reverted by the over-expression of GalF and its mutant. To demonstrate its evolutionary path of &quot;enzyme inactivation&quot; we enhanced the catalysis by mutagenesis and showed the importance of the quaternary structure. This study provides important information to understand the structural and functional evolutionary origin of the protein GalF in enteric bacteria. 	Front_Microbiol	D016428
18538445	20080610	Distribution of gemcitabine pathway genotypes in ethnic Asians and their association with outcome in non-small cell lung cancer patients.	Pharmacogenetics suggests variants of genes involved in gemcitabine pharmacology could be useful markers for predicting inter-ethnic and inter-patient outcomes from treatment with the agent. Here, we have characterized the distribution of variants of genes involved in gemcitabine pharmacology in ethnic Asian populations and their association with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient outcome. All genes involved in gemcitabine transport, metabolism and activity were screened for suitable variants for analysis using publications and public databases. By pyrosequencing, the frequency of qualifying variants was characterized from germline DNA of 94 healthy Asian donors and 53 NSCLC patients receiving gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Significant differences in genotype distribution between Caucasians and Asians were seen at 10/25 (45%) variant loci. In NSCLC patients, CDA+435 C&gt;T variants were associated with response (p=0.026) and time to progression (p=0.016) and SLC28A1+1561 G&gt;A variants were associated with neutropenia (p=0.030) and thrombocytopenia nadir (p=0.037). Many genotypes in gemcitabine pharmacology vary in their frequency between Caucasians and Asians. CDA+435, and SLC28A1+1561 are worthy of further investigation as potential indicators of patient outcome after gemcitabine treatment. 	Lung_Cancer	D016428 D013485
19956678	20091204	Virus movements on the plasma membrane support infection and transmission between cells.	How viruses are transmitted across the mucosal epithelia of the respiratory, digestive, or excretory tracts, and how they spread from cell to cell and cause systemic infections, is incompletely understood. Recent advances from single virus tracking experiments have revealed conserved patterns of virus movements on the plasma membrane, including diffusive motions, drifting motions depending on retrograde flow of actin filaments or actin tail formation by polymerization, and confinement to submicrometer areas. Here, we discuss how viruses take advantage of cellular mechanisms that normally drive the movements of proteins and lipids on the cell surface. A concept emerges where short periods of fast diffusive motions allow viruses to rapidly move over several micrometers. Coupling to actin flow supports directional transport of virus particles during entry and cell-cell transmission, and local confinement coincides with either nonproductive stalling or infectious endocytic uptake. These conserved features of virus-host interactions upstream of infectious entry offer new perspectives for anti-viral interference. 	PLoS_Pathog.	D016428 D013485 D016454
18833334	20081004	Isolation of autochthonous non-white rot fungi with potential for enzymatic upgrading of Venezuelan extra-heavy crude oil.	The increasing world demand for fuels makes it necessary to exploit the largest reserve of extra-heavy crude oil (EHCO) of the Orinoco Oil Belt from Venezuela. We propose the use of extracellular oxidative enzymes, in particular, lignin-degrading enzyme systems (LDS) of fungi, for enzymatic improvement of EHCO. Autochthonous non-white rot fungal strains able to use EHCO, and several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as sole carbon source and energy, were isolated from EHCO-polluted soils and identified as belonging to the genera Fusarium, Penicillium , Trichoderma , Aspergillus , Neosartorya, Pseudallescheria, Cladosporium, Pestalotiopsis , Phoma and Paecillomyces. Phenotypic and biochemical assays revealed the ability of these filamentous fungi to synthesize extracellular oxidative enzymes, and suggested a relationship between the LDS and EHCO bioconversion. This work reports, for the first time, the use of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) as substrate to measure extracellular ligninolytic peroxidases (ELP) in culture broths of filamentous fungi (Fusarium solani HP-1), and constitutes the first formal study of the fungal community associated with the EHCO of the Orinoco Oil Belt.

27034136	20160402	A mutation abolishing the ZMPSTE24 cleavage site in prelamin A causes a progeroid disorder.	In 1994 in the Journal of Cell Science, Hennekes and Nigg reported that changing valine to arginine at the endoproteolytic cleavage site in chicken prelamin A abolishes its conversion to lamin A. The consequences of this mutation in an organism have remained unknown. We now report that the corresponding mutation in a human subject leads to accumulation of prelamin A and causes a progeroid disorder. Next generation sequencing of the subject and her parents' exomes identified a de novo mutation in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA) that resulted in a leucine to arginine amino acid substitution at residue 647 in prelamin A. The subject's fibroblasts accumulated prelamin A, a farnesylated protein, which led to an increased percentage of cultured cells with morphologically abnormal nuclei. Treatment with a protein farnesyltransferase inhibitor improved abnormal nuclear morphology. This case demonstrates that accumulation of prelamin A, independent of the loss of function of ZMPSTE24 metallopeptidase that catalyzes processing of prelamin A, can cause a progeroid disorder and that a cell biology assay could be used in precision medicine to identify a potential therapy.

Furthermore, the deviation of the physical properties of URu2-xRexSi2 from Fermi-liquid behavior is most pronounced at the ferromagnetic quantum critical point, and the NFL behavior found in the ferromagnetic phase may be consistent with the Griffiths-McCoy phase model.

19875614	20091031	A genome-wide association study identifies a novel major locus for glycemic control in type 1 diabetes, as measured by both A1C and glucose.	Glycemia is a major risk factor for the development of long-term complications in type 1 diabetes; however, no specific genetic loci have been identified for glycemic control in individuals with type 1 diabetes. To identify such loci in type 1 diabetes, we analyzed longitudinal repeated measures of A1C from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial. We performed a genome-wide association study using the mean of quarterly A1C values measured over 6.5 years, separately in the conventional (n = 667) and intensive (n = 637) treatment groups of the DCCT. At loci of interest, linear mixed models were used to take advantage of all the repeated measures. We then assessed the association of these loci with capillary glucose and repeated measures of multiple complications of diabetes. We identified a major locus for A1C levels in the conventional treatment group near SORCS1 (10q25.1, P = 7 x 10(-10)), which was also associated with mean glucose (P = 2 x 10(-5)). This was confirmed using A1C in the intensive treatment group (P = 0.01). Other loci achieved evidence close to genome-wide significance: 14q32.13 (GSC) and 9p22 (BNC2) in the combined treatment groups and 15q21.3 (WDR72) in the intensive group. Further, these loci gave evidence for association with diabetic complications, specifically SORCS1 with hypoglycemia and BNC2 with renal and retinal complications. We replicated the SORCS1 association in Genetics of Diabetes in Kidneys (GoKinD) study control subjects (P = 0.01) and the BNC2 association with A1C in nondiabetic individuals. A major locus for A1C and glucose in individuals with diabetes is near SORCS1. This may influence the design and analysis of genetic studies attempting to identify risk factors for long-term diabetic complications. 	Diabetes	D016428 D052061 D013485
25027604	20140717	Expression, purification, and characterization of rhTyrRS.	Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) catalyze the first step of protein synthesis. Emerging evidence indicates that AARSs may have additional functions, playing a role in signal transduction pathways regulating thrombopoiesis and inflammation. Recombinant human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (rhTyrRS) is engineered with a single amino acid substitution that unmasks its cytokine activity. An industrial production method that provides high yield as well as high purity, quality, and potency of this protein is required for preclinical research. We expressed codon-optimized rhTyrRS in Escherichia coli under fermentation conditions. Soluble protein was purified by a three-step purification method using cation exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and anion exchange chromatography. We also established a method to test the biological activity of rhTyrRS by measuring aminoacylation and IL-8 release in rhTyrRS-treated HL-60 cells. The characterization of purified rhTyrRS indicated that this protein can be used in pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies. 	BMC_Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485
10369769	19990617	Mutational analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Smf1p, a member of the Nramp family of metal transporters.	We have recently shown that a member of the Nramp family of metal transporters, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Smf1p, is tightly regulated at the level of protein stability and protein sorting. Under metal replete conditions, Smf1p is targeted to the vacuole for degradation in a manner dependent on the S. cerevisiaeBSD2 gene product, but under metal starvation conditions, Smf1p accumulates at the cell surface. Here, we have addressed whether Smf1p activity may be necessary for its regulation by metal ions and Bsd2p. Well conserved residues within transmembrane domain 4 and the transport signature sequence of Smf1p were mutagenized. We identified two mutants, G190A and G424A, which destroyed Smf1p activity as monitored by complementation of a smf1 mutation. Notably, these mutations also abolished control by metal ions and Bsd2p, suggesting that Smf1p metal transport function may be necessary for its regulation. Two additional mutants isolated (Q419A and E423A) exhibited wild-type complementation activity and were properly targeted for vacuolar degradation in a Bsd2-dependent manner. However, these mutants failed to re-distribute to the plasma membrane under conditions of metal starvation. A model is proposed herein describing the probable role of Smf1 protein conformation in directing its movement to the vacuole versus cell surface in response to changes in metal ion availability.

Kidney Na+/HCO3- cotransporter (kNBC1) cDNA from peripheral lymphocytes from a patient with permanent isolated pRTA and bilateral glaucoma was screened, and a novel homozygous mutation, namely a cytosine-to-thymine transition at nucleotide 234, which resulted in the formation of a stop codon at codon 29, was identified. This homozygous mutation, Q29X, was identified in the unique 5'-end of the kNBC1 gene (SLC4A4) of the patient. Cosegregation of this Q29X mutation with the disease and heterozygosity in the parents of the affected patient were observed. The absence of this mutation in 156 alleles from 78 Japanese individuals indicates that this mutation is directly related to the disease and is not a common DNA sequence polymorphism. This nonsense mutation predicts a truncated kNBC1 protein that lacks the 1007 amino acids of the carboxyl-terminus, and the effect on kNBC1 cotransport activity is likely to be a loss of function. In contrast, the pancreatic Na+/HCO3- cotransporter of the patient is not likely to be affected by this nonsense mutation. These results have implications for understanding the role of kNBC1 in the pathophysiologic processes of pRTA associated with ocular abnormalities and mental retardation. 	J._Am._Soc._Nephrol.

27432399	20160720	Critical role of bacterial isochorismatase in the autophagic process induced by Acinetobacter baumannii in mammalian cells.	A recent study reported that Acinetobacter baumannii could induce autophagy, but the recognition and clearance mechanism of intracytosolic A. baumannii in the autophagic process and the molecular mechanism of autophagy induced by the pathogen remains unknown. In this study, we first demonstrated that invading A. baumannii induced a complete, ubiquitin-mediated autophagic response that is dependent upon septins SEPT2 and SEPT9 in mammalian cells. We also demonstrated that autophagy induced by A. baumannii was Beclin-1 dependent via the AMPK/ERK/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Of interest, we found that the isochorismatase mutant strain had significantly decreased siderophore-mediated ferric iron acquisition ability and had a reduced the ability to induce autophagy. We verified that isochorismatase was required for the recognition of intracytosolic A. baumannii mediated by septin cages, ubiquitinated proteins, and ubiquitin-binding adaptor proteins p62 and NDP52 in autophagic response. We also confirmed that isochorismatase was required for the clearance of invading A. baumannii by autophagy in vitro and in the mouse model of infection. Together, these findings provide insight into the distinctive recognition and clearance of intracytosolic A. baumannii by autophagy in host cells, and that isochorismatase plays a critical role in the A. baumannii-induced autophagic process.-Wang, Y., Zhang, K., Shi, X., Wang, C., Wang, F., Fan, J., Shen, F., Xu, J., Bao, W., Liu, M., Yu, L.

23878237	20130724	Capturing the mutational landscape of the beta-lactamase TEM-1.	Adaptation proceeds through the selection of mutations. The distribution of mutant fitness effect and the forces shaping this distribution are therefore keys to predict the evolutionary fate of organisms and their constituents such as enzymes. Here, by producing and sequencing a comprehensive collection of 10,000 mutants, we explore the mutational landscape of one enzyme involved in the spread of antibiotic resistance, the beta-lactamase TEM-1. We measured mutation impact on the enzyme activity through the estimation of amoxicillin minimum inhibitory concentration on a subset of 990 mutants carrying a unique missense mutation, representing 64% of possible amino acid changes in that protein reachable by point mutation. We established that mutation type, solvent accessibility of residues, and the predicted effect of mutations on protein stability primarily determined alone or in combination changes in minimum inhibitory concentration of mutants. Moreover, we were able to capture the drastic modification of the mutational landscape induced by a single stabilizing point mutation (M182T) by a simple model of protein stability. This work thereby provides an integrated framework to study mutation effects and a tool to understand/define better the epistatic interactions. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 D013485
23343928	20130125	Deep Sequencing Analyses of DsiRNAs Reveal the Influence of 3' Terminal Overhangs on Dicing Polarity, Strand Selectivity, and RNA Editing of siRNAs.	25/27 Base duplex RNAs that are substrates for Dicer have been demonstrated to enhance RNA interference (RNAi) potency and efficacy. Since the target sites are not always equally susceptible to suppression by small interfering RNA (siRNA), not all 27-mer duplexes that are processed into the corresponding conventional siRNAs show increased potency. Thus random designing of Dicer-substrate siRNAs (DsiRNAs) may generate siRNAs with poor RNAi due to unpredictable Dicer processing. Previous studies have demonstrated that the 3'-overhang affects dicing cleavage site and the orientation of Dicer entry. Moreover, an asymmetric 27-mer duplex having a 3' two-nucleotide overhang and 3'-DNA residues on the blunt end has been rationally designed to obtain greater efficacy. This asymmetric structure directs dicing to predictably yield a single primary cleavage product. In the present study, we analyzed the in vitro and intracellular dicing patterns of chemically synthesized duplex RNAs with different 3'-overhangs. Consistent with previous studies, we observed that Dicer preferentially processes these RNAs at a site 21-22 nucleotide (nt) from the two-base 3'-overhangs. We also observed that the direction and ability of human Dicer to generate siRNAs can be partially or completely blocked by DNA residues at the 3'-termimi. To examine the effects of various 3'-end modifications on Dicer processing in cells, we employed Illumina Deep sequencing analyses to unravel the fates of the asymmetric 27-mer duplexes. To validate the strand selection process and knockdown capabilities we also conducted dual-luciferase psiCHECK reporter assays to monitor the RNAi potencies of both the &quot;sense&quot; (S) and &quot;antisense&quot; (AS) strands derived from these DsiRNAs. Consistent with our in vitro Dicer assays, the asymmetric duplexes were predictably processed into desired primary cleavage products of 21-22-mers in cells. We also observed the trimming of the 3' end, especially when DNA residues were incorporated into the overhangs and this trimming ultimately influenced the Dicer-cleavage site and RNAi potency. Moreover, the observation that the most efficacious strand was the most abundant revealed that the relative frequencies of each &quot;S&quot; or &quot;AS&quot; strand are highly correlated with the silencing activity and strand selectivity. Collectively, our data demonstrate that even though the only differences between a family of DsiRNAs was the 3' two-nuclotide overhang, dicing polarity and strand selectivity are distinct depending upon the sequence and chemical nature of this overhang. Thus, it is possible to predictably control dicing polarity and strand selectivity via simply changing the 3'-end overhangs without altering the original duplex sequence. These optimal design features of 3'-overhangs might provide a facile approach for rationally designing highly potent 25/27-mer DsiRNAs. 	Mol_Ther_Nucleic_Acids	D016428

21869931	20110827	TP53 Mutations and HBX Status Analysis in Hepatocellular Carcinomas from Iran: Evidence for Lack of Association between HBV Genotype D and TP53 R249S Mutations.	High incidence of HCC is mostly due to the combination of two major risk factors, chronic infection with hepatitis B (HBV) and/or C (HCV) viruses and exposure to the mycotoxin aflatoxin B(1), which induces a particular mutation at codon 249 in TP53 (R249S). Eight genotypes of HBV are diversely found in high and low incidence areas. Regardless of documented strong associations between TP53 R249S mutation and HBV genotypes B, C, A or E, there is no report of such association for genotype D despite of the presence of aflatoxin in areas with high prevalence of HBV genotype D. In Iran, 3% of the population is chronically infected with HBV, predominantly genotype D. Twenty-one histologically confirmed HCC cases from Iran were analyzed for TP53 R249S and HBV double mutations 1762(T)/1764(A), hallmarks of more pathogenic forms of HBV. We did not detect any of these mutations. In addition, we report the only case identified so far carrying both R249S mutation and chronic HBV genotype D, a patient from The Gambia in West Africa. This paper suggests that association between HBV genotype D and aflatoxin-induced TP53 mutation is uncommon, explaining the relatively lower incidence of HCC in areas where genotype D is highly prevalent.

9425181	19980221	Local circuit abnormalities in chronically epileptic rats after intrahippocampal tetanus toxin injection in infancy.	In vitro slice experiments were undertaken in adult rats to investigate the physiological origins of a chronic epileptic condition that was initiated in infancy. A unilateral injection of a minute quantity of tetanus toxin into hippocampus on postnatal day 10 produced a severe convulsive syndrome characterized by brief but repeated seizures that lasted for 5-7 days. Hippocampal slices were then taken from these rats in adulthood because at this time previous studies have shown the occurrence of electrographic and behavioral seizures. Dramatic alterations in local circuit functioning were observed. In normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), spontaneous epileptiform network bursts were recorded in a majority (73%) of experimental rats. Network bursts occurred in area CA3 of both the injected and contralateral hippocampus. These consisted of intracellular depolarization shifts that were coincident with extracellularly recorded network bursts. Often they occurred at frequencies of 0.05-0.1 Hz and although variable in amplitude and duration, had all-or-none-like qualities. These events appeared to arise largely from local circuits in the CA3C subfield. Network bursts were rarely recorded in area CA1 and were never observed in the dentate gyrus. However in 31% of rats, a novel, higher frequency (2-8 Hz) field potential was recorded in area CA1. This was coincident with rhythmic, intracellularly recorded, inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). These summated IPSPs blocked action potential firing and reversed polarity near -75 mV. To understand the origins of network bursting in area CA3C, comparisons were made of the fundamental neurophysiological properties of pyramidal cells in epileptic and control rats. Of the passive and active membrane properties examined, all appeared normal. Unusually prolonged bursts of action potentials were observed in a small subset of pyramidal cells. However on average the duration of intrinsic bursts were unaltered in the CA3 neurons analyzed from experimental rats. To explore the role that alterations in CA3 recurrent excitatory network excitability may play in epileptiform discharges, picrotoxin was bath applied. On blockade of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors, slices from experimental rats underwent prolonged electrographic seizures that were up to 10 s in duration. In contrast, slices from control rats produced only brief 100-ms network bursts. These results suggest that a change in excitability within CA3C recurrent excitatory networks likely contributes to seizures in chronically epileptic rats. However, at the same time, this hyperexcitability is controlled to an important degree by functional GABAA-mediated synaptic inhibition. 	J._Neurophysiol.	D016428 D013485 D013487
11092761	20001125	Hyperammonemia with reduced ornithine, citrulline, arginine and proline: a new inborn error caused by a mutation in the gene encoding delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase.	delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS), a bifunctional ATP- and NADPH-dependent mitochondrial enzyme, catalyzes the reduction of glutamate to delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, a critical step in the biosynthesis of proline, ornithine and arginine. Recently, we reported the cloning and expression of human and murine P5CS cDNAs. Previously, we showed that mammalian P5CS undergoes alternative splicing to generate two isoforms differing only by a 2 amino acid insert at the N-terminus of the gamma-glutamyl kinase active site. The short isoform has high activity in the gut, where it participates in arginine biosynthesis and is inhibited by ornithine. The long isoform, expressed in multiple tissues, is necessary for the synthesis of proline from glutamate and is insensitive to ornithine. Here, we describe a newly recognized inborn error due to the deficiency of P5CS in two siblings with progressive neurodegeneration, joint laxity, skin hyperelasticity and bilateral subcapsular cataracts. Their metabolic phenotype includes hyperammonemia, hypoornithinemia, hypocitrullinemia, hypoargininemia and hypoprolinemia. Both are homozygous for the missense mutation, R84Q, which alters a conserved residue in the P5CS gamma-glutamyl kinase domain. R84Q is not present in 194 control chromosomes and dramatically reduces the activity of both P5CS isoforms when expressed in mammalian cells. Additionally, R84Q appears to destabilize the long isoform. This is the first documented report of an inborn error of P5CS and suggests that this disorder should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with neurodegeneration and/or cataracts and connective tissue disease.

12052604	20020608	The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677 C--&gt;T polymorphism and preeclampsia in two populations.	The C677T polymorphism of the 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene is associated with decreased MTHFR activity and elevated plasma homocysteine levels with the result of an increased risk for vascular disease. Because thrombosis of the maternal spiral arteries can be one of the causative events in the disease, it has been suggested that the C677T polymorphism may also play a role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Our case-control study investigated the prevalence of the 677T allele in two ethnically different populations and the potential association of the 677T allele with preeclampsia. Special attention was paid to the potential contribution of the fetal genotype to disease risk. Blood samples were collected from 81 mothers and 61 newborns after preeclampsia and 99 mothers and 61 newborns with normal pregnancies. Genomic DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with locus-specific primers, and presence of the polymorphism was determined by enzymatic digestion with HinfI and visualization on polyacrylamide gels. Genotypes carrying the MTHFR 677T allele were significantly more frequent in German-Croatians than in Indonesians in both patients and controls (P =.0033 in controls). In contrast, the prevalence of genotypes with the 677T allele was not increased among patients with preeclampsia compared with controls in both ethnic groups (P &gt;.5 in all groups). In Germans, the frequency of 677T homozygotes among controls even exceeded that observed in preeclamptic patients (677T/T genotype frequency 0.20 in controls and 0.07 in patients). We did not find an increased prevalence of paternally inherited 677T alleles in preeclamptic fetuses relative to controls or other signs of maternal-fetal transmission distortion. In our study, the MTHFR C677T polymorphism was not associated with an increased risk for preeclampsia on the level of the maternal or fetal genotype. However, significant differences of the frequency of genotypes carrying the 677T allele between Middle-Europeans and Indonesians were identified. 	Obstet_Gynecol	D016428 D013485

25966699	20150514	Direct Estimation of CaV1.2 Gating Parameters: Quantification of Voltage Sensor - Pore Transductions and their Modulation by FLP 64176.	Calcium agonists such as FPL 64174 increase macroscopic calcium channel currents and induce substantial changes in current kinetics. Their molecular mechanism of action is currently unknown. Here we propose a technique enabling the estimation of FPL 64174 effects on rate constants of the voltage sensing machinery and pore transitions from macroscopic CaV1.2 current kinetics making use of a hybrid stochastic-deterministic optimization procedure. Current traces of wild type CaV1.2, a channel construct with neutralized segment IIS4 (IIS4N) and a pore mutant (A780T) were fitted to a circular four-state (rest, activated, open, deactivated) channel model in control and FPL 64174 (1 ?M). The estimated rate constants provided novel insights in how structural elements of the voltage sensing unit and the channel pore influence the action of FPL 64174. The new approach may be applicable for the analysis of drug effects on other ion channels as well as for quantification of VS transitions and rate constants of pore gating from macroscopic current kinetics.

18647184	20080724	Association between polymorphisms in the beta2-adrenoceptor gene and migraine in women.	To investigate the role of three common polymorphisms in the beta2-adrenoceptor gene in migraine. Migraine has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and asthma in which beta2-adrenoceptors play an important role; beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are used in migraine prevention. However, the role of variants in the beta2-adrenoceptor gene in migraine is unclear. Association study among 23,753 white women, participating in the Women's Health Study, for whom we had information on migraine at baseline and genotype status of the polymorphisms rs1042713 (Gly16Arg), rs1042714 (Gln27Glu), rs1800888 (Thr164Ile). Migraine was self-reported and we distinguished between any history of migraine, active migraine with and without aura, and prior migraine (history of migraine but not active migraine) in our analyses. At baseline 4339 women reported any history of migraine. Of these, 3041 had active migraine (1221 migraine with aura, 1820 migraine without aura) and 1298 prior migraine. No migraine was reported by 19,414 women. Genotype- and haplotype-based analyses did not show an association of any of the gene variants tested with any history of migraine. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence intervals) for any history of migraine in the additive model were 1.0 (0.96-1.05) for rs1042713, 1.0 (0.95-1.05) for rs1042714, and 0.84 (0.68-1.05) for rs1800888. In the haplotype analysis the ORs ranged from 0.83 (0.67-1.03) to 1.01 (0.94-1.07) with Gly16-Glu27-Thr164 as the reference. We also did not find associations in the genotype- and haplotype-based analyses within migraine-specific subgroups. Our results do not support a role of 3 investigated polymorphisms in the beta2-adrenoceptor gene in migraine pathophysiology. 	Headache	D016428 D052061 D013485
14636049	20031126	Analysis of the role of the active site residue Arg98 in the flavoprotein tryptophan 2-monooxygenase, a member of the L-amino oxidase family.	The flavoprotein tryptophan 2-monooxygenase catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of tryptophan to indoleacetamide. We have previously identified tryptophan 2-monooxygenase as a homologue of L-amino acid oxidase [Sobrado, P., and Fitzpatrick, P. F. (2002) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 402, 24-30]. On the basis of the sequence comparisons of the different LAAO family members, Arg98 of tryptophan 2-monooxygenase can be identified as an active site residue which interacts with the carboxylate of the amino acid substrate. The catalytic properties of R98K and R98A tryptophan 2-monooxygenase have been characterized to evaluate the role of this residue. Mutation of Arg98 to lysine decreases the first-order rate constant for flavin reduction by 180-fold and the second-order rate constant for flavin oxidation by 26-fold, has no significant effect on the K(d) value for tryptophan or the K(i) value for the competitive inhibitor indoleacetamide, and increases the K(i) value for indolepyruvate less than 2-fold. Mutation of this residue to alanine decreases the rate constants for reduction and oxidation an additional 5- and 2-fold, respectively, and increases the K(d) value for tryptophan and the K(i) value for indolepyruvate by 31- and 17-fold, respectively, while having an only 2-fold effect on the K(i) value for indoleacetamide. Both mutations increase the value of the primary deuterium isotope effect with tryptophan as a substrate, consistent with a later transition state. Both mutant enzymes catalyze a simple oxidase reaction, producing indolepyruvate and hydrogen peroxide. The pH dependences of the V/K(trp) values for the mutant enzymes show that the anionic form of the substrate is preferred but that the zwitterionic form is a substrate. The results are consistent with the interaction between Arg98 and the carboxylate of the amino acid substrate being critical for correct positioning of the substrate in the active site for efficient catalysis.

20164093	20100219	A cooperative and specific DNA-binding mode of HIV-1 integrase depends on the nature of the metallic cofactor and involves the zinc-containing N-terminal domain.	HIV-1 integrase catalyzes the insertion of the viral genome into chromosomal DNA. We characterized the structural determinants of the 3'-processing reaction specificity--the first reaction of the integration process--at the DNA-binding level. We found that the integrase N-terminal domain, containing a pseudo zinc-finger motif, plays a key role, at least indirectly, in the formation of specific integrase-DNA contacts. This motif mediates a cooperative DNA binding of integrase that occurs only with the cognate/viral DNA sequence and the physiologically relevant Mg(2+) cofactor. The DNA-binding was essentially non-cooperative with Mn(2+) or using non-specific/random sequences, regardless of the metallic cofactor. 2,2'-Dithiobisbenzamide-1 induced zinc ejection from integrase by covalently targeting the zinc-finger motif, and significantly decreased the Hill coefficient of the Mg(2+)-mediated integrase-DNA interaction, without affecting the overall affinity. Concomitantly, 2,2'-dithiobisbenzamide-1 severely impaired 3'-processing (IC(50) = 11-15 nM), suggesting that zinc ejection primarily perturbs the nature of the active integrase oligomer. A less specific and weaker catalytic effect of 2,2'-dithiobisbenzamide-1 is mediated by Cys 56 in the catalytic core and, notably, accounts for the weaker inhibition of the non-cooperative Mn(2+)-dependent 3'-processing. Our data show that the cooperative DNA-binding mode is strongly related to the sequence-specific DNA-binding, and depends on the simultaneous presence of the Mg(2+) cofactor and the zinc effector.

23359867	20130130	SUMO modification of menin.	Menin acts as contextual a tumor suppressor and a tumor promoter, partly via epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. While menin is phosphorylated, it remains unclear whether wild type menin has other post-translational modifications. Here, we report that menin is SUMOylated by SUMO1 in vivo and in vitro, and the SUMOylation is reduced by a SUMO protease. Lysine 591 of menin was covalently modified by SUMO1 and K591R mutation in menin blocked SUMOylation of the C-terminal part of menin in transfected cells. Full-length menin with K591 mutation was still SUMOylated in vivo, suggesting the existence of multiple SUMOylation sites. Menin K591R mutant or menin-SUMO fusion protein still retains the ability to regulate cell proliferation and the expression of the examined menin target genes. 	Am_J_Cancer_Res	D016428
24320622	20131211	Comparative transcriptional profiling analysis of olive ripe-fruit pericarp and abscission zone tissues shows expression differences and distinct patterns of transcriptional regulation.	In fleshy fruit, abscission of fully ripe fruit is a process intimately linked to the ripening process. In many fruit-tree species, such as olive (Olea europaea L. cv. Picual), there is a coupling of the full ripening and the activation of the abscission-zone (AZ). Although fully ripe fruit have marked physiological differences with respect to their AZs, dissimilarities in gene expression have not been thoroughly investigated. The present study examines the transcriptome of olive fruit and their AZ tissues at the last stage of ripening, monitored using mRNA-Seq. Roche-454 massive parallel pyrosequencing enabled us to generate 397,457 high-quality EST sequences, among which 199,075 were from ripe-fruit pericarp and 198,382 from AZ tissues. We assembled these sequences into 19,062 contigs, grouped as 17,048 isotigs. Using the read amounts for each annotated isotig (from a total of 15,671), we identified 7,756 transcripts. A comparative analysis of the transcription profiles conducted in ripe-fruit pericarp and AZ evidenced that 4,391 genes were differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in fruit and AZ. Functional categorization of the DEGs revealed that AZ tissue has an apparently higher response to external stimuli than does that of ripe fruit, revealing a higher expression of auxin-signaling genes, as well as lignin catabolic and biosynthetic pathway, aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway, isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway, protein amino acid dephosphorylation, amino acid transport, and photosynthesis. By contrast, fruit-enriched transcripts are involved in ATP synthesis coupled proton transport, glycolysis, and cell-wall organization. Furthermore, over 150 transcripts encoding putative transcription-factors (TFs) were identified (37 fruit TFs and 113 AZ TFs), of which we randomly selected eight genes and we confirmed their expression patterns using quantitative RT-PCR. We generated a set of EST sequences from olive fruit at full ripening, and DEGs between two different olive tissues, ripe fruit and their AZ, were also identified. Regarding the cross-talk between fruit and AZ, using qRT-PCR, we confirmed a set of TF genes that were differentially expressed, revealing profiles of expression that have not previously been reported, this offering a promising beginning for studies on the different transcription regulation in such tissues.

25487529	20141210	HIV type 1 drug resistance patterns among patients failing first and second line antiretroviral therapy in Nairobi, Kenya.	The ever-expanding rollout of antiretroviral therapy in poor resource settings without routine virological monitoring has been accompanied with development of drug resistance that has resulted in limited treatment success. A cross-sectional study with one time viral load was conducted during the period between 2012 and 2013 to determine treatment failure and drug resistance mutations among adults receiving first-line (44) (3TC_d4T/AZT_NVP/EFV) and second-line (20) (3TC/AZT/LPV/r) in Nairobi, Kenya. HIV-1 pol-RT genotyping for drug resistance was performed using an in-house protocol. A total of 64 patients were recruited (mean age 36.9?yrs.) during the period between 2012 and 2013 of the 44 adult patients failing first-line 24 (40.9%) had drug resistance mutations. Eight (8) patients had NRTI resistance mutations with NAMS M184V (54.2%) and K65R (8.4%) mutations being the highest followed by TAMs T215Y and K70R (12.5%). In addition, among patients failing second-line (20), six patients (30%) had NNRTI resistance; two patients on K103N and G190A mutations while V106A, Y184V, A98G, Y181C mutations per patient were also detected. However, for NRTI two patients had TAM T215Y. M184V mutation occurred in one patient. The study findings showed that HIV-1 drug resistance was significantly high in the study population. The detected accumulated resistance strains show that emergence of HIV drug resistance will continue to be a big challenge and should be given more attention as the scale up of treatment in the country continues.

25305017	20141012	Coevolution of the ATPase ClpV, the sheath proteins TssB and TssC, and the accessory protein TagJ/HsiE1 distinguishes type VI secretion classes.	The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a bacterial nanomachine for the transport of effector molecules into prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. It involves the assembly of a tubular structure composed of TssB and TssC that is similar to the tail sheath of bacteriophages. The sheath contracts to provide the energy needed for effector delivery. The AAA(+) ATPase ClpV disassembles the contracted sheath, which resets the systems for reassembly of an extended sheath that is ready to fire again. This mechanism is crucial for T6SS function. In Vibrio cholerae, ClpV binds the N terminus of TssC within a hydrophobic groove. In this study, we resolved the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ClpV1 and observed structural alterations in the hydrophobic groove. The modification in the ClpV1 groove is matched by a change in the N terminus of TssC, suggesting the existence of distinct T6SS classes. An accessory T6SS component, TagJ/HsiE, exists predominantly in one of the classes. Using bacterial two-hybrid approaches, we showed that the P. aeruginosa homolog HsiE1 interacts strongly with ClpV1. We then resolved the crystal structure of HsiE1 in complex with the N terminus of HsiB1, a TssB homolog and component of the contractile sheath. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that these differences distinguish T6SS classes that resulted from a functional co-evolution between TssB, TssC, TagJ/HsiE, and ClpV. The interaction of TagJ/HsiE with the sheath as well as with ClpV suggests an alternative mode of disassembly in which HsiE recruits the ATPase to the sheath. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
27482462	20160803	Accelerating degradation rate of pure iron by zinc ion implantation.	Pure iron has been considered as a promising candidate for biodegradable implant applications. However, a faster degradation rate of pure iron is needed to meet the clinical requirement. In this work, metal vapor vacuum arc technology was adopted to implant zinc ions into the surface of pure iron. Results showed that the implantation depth of zinc ions was about 60?nm. The degradation rate of pure iron was found to be accelerated after zinc ion implantation. The cytotoxicity tests revealed that the implanted zinc ions brought a slight increase on cytotoxicity of the tested cells. In terms of hemocompatibility, the hemolysis of zinc ion implanted pure iron was lower than 2%. However, zinc ions might induce more adhered and activated platelets on the surface of pure iron. Overall, zinc ion implantation can be a feasible way to accelerate the degradation rate of pure iron for biodegradable applications. 	Regen_Biomater	D016428
17687455	20070810	Elevated plasma endothelin-1 and pulmonary arterial pressure in children exposed to air pollution.	Controlled exposures of animals and humans to particulate matter (PM) or ozone air pollution cause an increase in plasma levels of endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor that regulates pulmonary arterial pressure. The primary objective of this field study was to determine whether Mexico City children, who are chronically exposed to levels of PM and O(3) that exceed the United States air quality standards, have elevated plasma endothelin-1 levels and pulmonary arterial pressures. We conducted a study of 81 children, 7.9 +/- 1.3 years of age, lifelong residents of either northeast (n = 19) or southwest (n = 40) Mexico City or Polotitl?n (n = 22), a control city with PM and O(3) levels below the U.S. air quality standards. Clinical histories, physical examinations, and complete blood counts were done. Plasma endothelin-1 concentrations were determined by immunoassay, and pulmonary arterial pressures were measured by Doppler echocardiography. Mexico City children had higher plasma endothelin-1 concentrations compared with controls (p &lt; 0.001). Mean pulmonary arterial pressure was elevated in children from both northeast (p &lt; 0.001) and southwest (p &lt; 0.05) Mexico City compared with controls. Endothelin-1 levels in Mexico City children were positively correlated with daily outdoor hours (p = 0.012), and 7-day cumulative levels of PM air pollution &lt; 2.5 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM(2.5)) before endothelin-1 measurement (p = 0.03). Chronic exposure of children to PM(2.5) is associated with increased levels of circulating endothelin-1 and elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure. 	Environ._Health_Perspect.

24312616	20131207	Structural and functional analysis of human SOD1 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease with familial inheritance (fALS) in 5% to 10% of cases; 25% of those are caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein. More than 100 mutations in the SOD1 gene have been associated with fALS, altering the geometry of the active site, protein folding and the interaction between monomers. We performed a functional analysis of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in 124 fALS SOD1 mutants. Eleven different algorithms were used to estimate the functional impact of the replacement of one amino acid on protein structure: SNPs&amp;GO, PolyPhen-2, SNAP, PMUT, Sift, PhD-SNP, nsSNPAnalyzer, TANGO, WALTZ, LIMBO and FoldX. For the structural analysis, theoretical models of 124 SNPs of SOD1 were created by comparative modeling using the MHOLline workflow, which includes Modeller and Procheck. Models were aligned with the native protein by the TM-align algorithm. A human-curated database was developed using the server side include in Java, JMOL. The results of this functional analysis indicate that the majority of the 124 natural mutants are harmful to the protein structure and thus corroborate the correlation between the reported mutations and fALS. In the structural analysis, all models showed conformational changes when compared to wild-type SOD1, and the degree of structural alignment varied between them. The SOD1 database converge structural and functional analyses of SOD1; it is a vast resource for the molecular analysis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which allows the user to expand his knowledge on the molecular basis of the disease. The SOD1 database is available at http://bioinfogroup.com/database. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
18752451	20080830	p.Ala546 &gt; Asp and p.Arg555 &gt; Trp mutations of TGFBI gene and their clinical manifestations in two large Chinese families with granular corneal dystrophy type I.	The aim of this study was to conduct clinical, genetic, and molecular analysis of Chinese patients with granular corneal dystrophy type I (CDGG1). Two large unrelated Chinese families with CDGG1 were clinically and genetically evaluated. Molecular genetic analysis was performed on DNA extracted from peripheral blood. Exons 4, 11, 12, and 14 of the human transforming growth factor beta-induced gene (TGFBI, formerly designated BIGH3) were amplified by PCR, scanned for mutations using the single-strand conformation polymorphism method, and the mutations identified by nucleotide sequencing. One family segregated the p.Ala546 &gt; Asp mutation, and the other family had a p.Arg555 &gt; Trp mutation. These missense mutations were not found in 53 unrelated, healthy individuals analyzed as controls. Clinical and genetic evaluations revealed the variable severity, symmetry, and age of onset in visual impairment in these families for different mutations. Penetrance of visual impairment in these families was 100% and 75%, respectively. This study confirms that the p.Arg555 &gt; Trp mutation is a frequent cause of CDGG1, and that the p.Ala546 &gt; Asp mutation is also associated with this disease. 	Genet._Test.	D016428 D013485
17094971	20061111	Prevalent genotypes of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR C677T and A1298C) in spontaneously aborted embryos.	To assess prevalent 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms in spontaneously aborted embryos. A retrospectively analyzed, prospectively obtained database. Bundang CHA General Hospital and Kangnam CHA Hospital. Ninety-four spontaneously aborted embryos at &lt;20 weeks of gestational age. None. Genotype frequency of MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms in spontaneously aborted embryos. The aborted embryos exhibited both a significantly high frequency of the MTHFR 677CC genotype and a low frequency of the MTHFR 677CT genotype, compared to both the child and the adult control groups, respectively, whereas no significant change in the fetal MTHFR A1298C genotype frequency was observed. The combinative genotype of MTHFR 677CC/1298AC from the abortus had a high prevalence compared to the child controls. Further, the chromosomal integrity of the abortus did not affect the frequency of the MTHFR 677CC and 1298AC genotypes. Spontaneously aborted embryos have a unique distribution of MTHFR C677T and A1289C polymorphisms, regardless of their chromosomal integrity. 	Fertil._Steril.	D016428 D013485
16105728	20050818	Lack of association between variations in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene and temporal lobe epilepsy.	Recently, an association between the C240T polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene and partial epilepsy was demonstrated in a Japanese population. In this study we attempted to replicate the initial finding in a patient-control population of European ancestry and in addition tested whether the functional Val66Met polymorphism is associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Genotypes of 151 TLE patients and 189 controls did not differ significantly for either of the variations. Results suggest that neither of the studied polymorphisms are strong susceptibility factors for TLE in this sample of individuals of European ancestry. 	Epilepsy_Res.	D003160 D016428 D052061 D013487
25273986	20141003	Suppressor mutants from MotB-D24E and MotS-D30E in the flagellar stator complex of Bacillus subtilis.	The bacterial flagellar motor is mainly energized by either a proton (H(+)) or sodium ion (Na(+)) motive force and the motor torque is generated by interaction at the rotor-stator interface. MotA/MotB-type stators use H(+) as the coupling ion, whereas MotP/MotS- and PomA/PomB-type stators use Na(+). Bacillus subtilis employs both H(+)-coupled MotA/MotB and Na(+)-coupled MotP/MotS stators, which contribute to the torque required for flagellar rotation. In Escherichia coli, there is a universally conserved Asp-32 residue of MotB that is critical for motility and is a predicted H(+)-binding site. In B. subtilis, the conserved aspartic acid residue corresponds to Asp-24 of MotB (MotB-D24) and Asp-30 of MotS (MotS-D30). Here we report the isolation of two mutants, MotB-D24E and MotS-D30E, which showed a non-motile and poorly motile phenotype, respectively. Up-motile mutants were spontaneously isolated from each mutant. We identified a suppressor mutation at MotB-T181A and MotP-L172P, respectively. Mutants MotB-T181A and MotP-L172P showed about 50% motility and a poorly motile phenotype compared to each wild type strain. These suppressor sites were suggested to indirectly affect the structure of the ion influx pathway. 	J._Gen._Appl._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485
24620715	20140314	Transthyretin-derived amyloidosis: probably a common cause of lumbar spinal stenosis.	Senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA) derived from wild-type transthyretin is a fairly common condition of old individuals, particularly men. The main presentation is by cardiac involvement, which can lead to severe restrictive cardiomyopathy. SSA is, however, a systemic disease, and amyloid deposits may appear in many other tissues but are thought to be without clinical symptoms outside the heart. Amyloid is a very common finding in cartilage and ligaments of elderly subjects, and transthyretin has been demonstrated in some deposits. Lumbar spinal stenosis is also a condition of usually elderly individuals in whom narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal leads to compression of nerves to the lower limbs. We questioned whether lumbar spinal stenosis sometimes could be a manifestation of undiagnosed SSA. In this first report we have studied the presence of amyloid in material obtained at surgery for spinal stenosis in 26 patients. Amyloid was found in 25 subjects. Transthyretin was demonstrated immunohistochemically in 5 out of 15 studied resected tissues. Four of the positive materials were analyzed with Western blot revealing both full-length transthyretin (TTR) and C-terminal TTR fragments, typically seen in SSA. We conclude that lumbar spinal stenosis quite frequently may be a consequence of SSA and that further studies are warranted. 	Ups._J._Med._Sci.	D016428 D013485
25015817	20140713	Does ?-hexosaminidase function only as a degranulation indicator in mast cells? The primary role of ?-hexosaminidase in mast cell granules.	?-Hexosaminidase, which is generally present in the lysosome, is essential for glycoprotein metabolism in the maintenance of cell homeostasis. In mast cells (MCs), large amounts of ?-hexosaminidase are present in the granules as opposed to the lysosome, and the biological role of MC ?-hexosaminidase has yet to be fully elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the biological role of ?-hexosaminidase in MC granules. Bone marrow-derived MCs from C57BL/6 (BL/6-BMMC) or ?-hexosaminidase gene-deficient (hexb(-/-)-BMMC) mice were transplanted into MC-deficient (WBB6F1/J-Kit(W)/Kit(W-v) [W/W(v)]) mice to generate MC-reconstituted models. In asthma model experiments, no differences were observed in the symptoms of BL/6, W/W(v), BL/6-BMMC-reconstituted W/W(v), or hexb(-/-)-BMMC-reconstituted W/W(v) mice. In Staphylococcus epidermidis experimental infection model experiments, the severity of symptoms and frequency of death were markedly higher in W/W(v) and hexb(-/-)-BMMC-reconstituted W/W(v) mice than in BL/6 and BL/6-BMMC-reconstituted W/W(v) mice. The growth of S. epidermidis in an in vitro study was clearly inhibited by addition of BL/6-BMMC lysate, but not by addition of hexb(-/-)-BMMC lysate. Moreover, suppression of bacterial proliferation was completely recovered when bacteria were incubated with hexb(-/-)-BMMC lysate plus ?-hexosaminidase. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that the cell wall of S. epidermidis was heavily degraded following coincubation of bacteria with BL/6-BMMC lysate, but not following coincubation with hexb(-/-)-BMMC lysate. These findings strongly suggest that MC granule ?-hexosaminidase is crucial for defense against bacterial invasion, but is not involved in the allergic response. Our results also suggest that the bactericidal mechanism of ?-hexosaminidase involves degradation of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan. 	J._Immunol.	D016428 D013485
26319017	20150831	Nucleosome compaction facilitates HP1? binding to methylated H3K9.	The ?, ? and ? isoforms of mammalian heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) selectively bind to methylated lysine 9 of histone H3 via their chromodomains. Although the phenotypes of HP1-knockout mice are distinct for each isoform, the molecular mechanisms underlying HP1 isoform-specific function remain elusive. In the present study, we found that in contrast to HP1?, HP1? could not bind tri-methylated H3 lysine 9 in a reconstituted tetra-nucleosomes when the nucleosomes were in an uncompacted state. The hinge region connecting HP1's chromodomain and chromoshadow domain contributed to the distinct recognition of the nucleosomes by HP1? and HP1?. HP1?, but not HP1?, was strongly enhanced in selective binding to tri-methylated lysine 9 in histone H3 by the addition of Mg(2+) or linker histone H1, which are known to induce compaction of nucleosomes. We propose that this novel property of HP1? recognition of lysine 9 in the histone H3 tail in different nucleosome structures plays a role in reading the histone code. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.

8951229	19961201	Synthesis, miscoding specificity, and thermodynamic stability of oligodeoxynucleotide containing 8-methyl-2'-deoxyguanosine.	8-Methyl-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-MedG) was synthesized by reacting dG under the methyl radical generating system and incorporated into oligodeoxynucleotides using phosphoramidite techniques. The site-specifically modified oligodeoxynucleotide containing a single 8-MedG was then used as a template for primer extension reactions catalyzed by the 3' --&gt; 5' exonuclease-free (exo-) Klenow fragment of Escherichia Coli DNA polymerase I and mammalian DNA polymerase alpha. Primer extension catalyzed by the exo- Klenow fragment readily passed the 8-MedG lesion in the template while that catalyzed by pol alpha was retarded opposite the lesion. The fully extended products formed during DNA synthesis were analyzed to quantify the miscoding specificities of 8-MedG. Both DNA polymerases incorporated primarily dCMP, the correct base opposite the lesion, along with small amounts of incorporation of dGMP and dAMP. In addition, two-base deletion was observed only when the exo- Klenow fragment was used. The thermodynamic stability of 8-MedG in the duplex was also studied. The duplex containing 8-MedG:dG was more thermally and thermodynamically stable than that of dG:dG. The duplex containing 8-MedG:dA was more thermodynamically stable than that of dG:dA. We conclude that 8-MedG is a miscoding lesion and capable of generating G --&gt; C and G --&gt; T transversions and deletion in cells. 	Chem._Res._Toxicol.	D016428
24798719	20140507	TNF-? SNP rs1800629 and risk of relapse in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: relation to immunophenotype.	In the AIEOP-BFM ALL (Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica-Berlin Frankfurt M?nster acute lymphoblastic leukemia) 2000 protocol, 70% of relapsed patients had favorable prognostic features and fell within less intensive polychemotherapeutic regimens, suggesting the need for better assessing lower risk stratification. A novel two-phase study design selected 614 children to be genotyped for TNF-? SNP rs1800629 (-308G&gt;A). A weighted Cox model was applied to evaluate the SNP effect on hazard of relapse, adjusting for immunophenotype, risk group, age and gender and including interaction terms. Significant interaction was found with immunophenotypes (p = 0.0007, with minor allele genotypes being adverse genetic markers in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and protective ones in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia), and also with risk protocols (p = 0.0041, with minor allele genotypes as prognostic factor of relapse for standard risk patients [only one T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the subgroup analyzed]). The presence of at least one A allele in TNF-? SNP rs1800629 should suggest a closer monitoring in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia standard risk patients. 	Pharmacogenomics	D016428 D013485
19843922	20091022	Protein kinase A-dependent biophysical phenotype for V227F-KCNJ2 mutation in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.	KCNJ2 encodes Kir2.1, a pore-forming subunit of the cardiac inward rectifier current, I(K1). KCNJ2 mutations are associated with Andersen-Tawil syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The aim of this study was to characterize the biophysical and cellular phenotype of a KCNJ2 missense mutation, V227F, found in a patient with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Kir2.1-wild-type (WT) and V227F channels were expressed individually and together in Cos-1 cells to measure I(K1) by voltage clamp. Unlike typical Andersen-Tawil syndrome-associated KCNJ2 mutations, which show dominant negative loss of function, Kir2.1WT+V227F coexpression yielded I(K1) indistinguishable from Kir2.1-WT under basal conditions. To simulate catecholamine activity, a protein kinase A (PKA)-stimulating cocktail composed of forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine was used to increase PKA activity. This PKA-simulated catecholaminergic stimulation caused marked reduction of outward I(K1) compared with Kir2.1-WT. PKA-induced reduction in I(K1) was eliminated by mutating the phosphorylation site at serine 425 (S425N). Heteromeric Kir2.1-V227F and WT channels showed an unusual latent loss of function biophysical phenotype that depended on PKA-dependent Kir2.1 phosphorylation. This biophysical phenotype, distinct from typical Andersen-Tawil syndrome mutations, suggests a specific mechanism for PKA-dependent I(K1) dysfunction for this KCNJ2 mutation, which correlates with adrenergic conditions underlying the clinical arrhythmia.

20625915	20100714	Changes in visual-evoked potential habituation induced by hyperventilation in migraine.	Hyperventilation is often associated with stress, an established trigger factor for migraine. Between attacks, migraine is associated with a deficit in habituation to visual-evoked potentials (VEP) that worsens just before the attack. Hyperventilation slows electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and decreases the functional response in the occipital cortex during visual stimulation. The neural mechanisms underlying deficient-evoked potential habituation in migraineurs remain unclear. To find out whether hyperventilation alters VEP habituation, we recorded VEPs before and after experimentally induced hyperventilation lasting 3 min in 18 healthy subjects and 18 migraine patients between attacks. We measured VEP P100 amplitudes in six sequential blocks of 100 sweeps and habituation as the change in amplitude over the six blocks. In healthy subjects, hyperventilation decreased VEP amplitude in block 1 and abolished the normal VEP habituation. In migraine patients, hyperventilation further decreased the already low block 1 amplitude and worsened the interictal habituation deficit. Hyperventilation worsens the habituation deficit in migraineurs possibly by increasing dysrhythmia in the brainstem-thalamo-cortical network. 	J_Headache_Pain	D016428
21203528	20110105	Fatty acids derived from royal jelly are modulators of estrogen receptor functions.	Royal jelly (RJ) excreted by honeybees and used as a nutritional and medicinal agent has estrogen-like effects, yet the compounds mediating these effects remain unidentified. The possible effects of three RJ fatty acids (FAs) (10-hydroxy-2-decenoic-10H2DA, 3,10-dihydroxydecanoic-3,10DDA, sebacic acid-SA) on estrogen signaling was investigated in various cellular systems. In MCF-7 cells, FAs, in absence of estradiol (E(2)), modulated the estrogen receptor (ER) recruitment to the pS2 promoter and pS2 mRNA levels via only ER? but not ER?, while in presence of E(2) FAs modulated both ER? and ER?. Moreover, in presence of FAs, the E(2)-induced recruitment of the EAB1 co-activator peptide to ER? is masked and the E(2)-induced estrogen response element (ERE)-mediated transactivation is inhibited. In HeLa cells, in absence of E(2), FAs inhibited the ERE-mediated transactivation by ER? but not ER?, while in presence of E(2), FAs inhibited ERE-activity by both ER? and ER?. Molecular modeling revealed favorable binding of FAs to ER? at the co-activator-binding site, while binding assays showed that FAs did not bind to the ligand-binding pocket of ER? or ER?. In KS483 osteoblasts, FAs, like E(2), induced mineralization via an ER-dependent way. Our data propose a possible molecular mechanism for the estrogenic activities of RJ's components which, although structurally entirely different from E(2), mediate estrogen signaling, at least in part, by modulating the recruitment of ER?, ER? and co-activators to target genes.

27066243	20160412	Genetic variation at the MHC DRB1 locus is similar across Gunnison's prairie dog (Cynomys gunnisoni) colonies regardless of plague history.	Yersinia pestis was introduced to North America around 1900 and leads to nearly 100% mortality in prairie dog (Cynomys spp.) colonies during epizootic events, which suggests this pathogen may exert a strong selective force. We characterized genetic diversity at an MHC class II locus (DRB1) in Gunnison's prairie dog (C.?gunnisoni) and quantified population genetic structure at the DRB1 versus 12 microsatellite loci in three large Arizona colonies. Two colonies, Seligman (SE) and Espee Ranch (ES), have experienced multiple plague-related die-offs in recent years, whereas plague has never been documented at Aubrey Valley (AV). We found fairly low allelic diversity at the DRB1 locus, with one allele (DRB1*01) at high frequency (0.67-0.87) in all colonies. Two other DRB1 alleles appear to be trans-species polymorphisms shared with the black-tailed prairie dog (C.?ludovicianus), indicating that these alleles have been maintained across evolutionary time frames. Estimates of genetic differentiation were generally lower at the MHC locus (F ST?=?0.033) than at microsatellite markers (F ST?=?0.098). The reduced differentiation at DRB1 may indicate that selection has been important for shaping variation at MHC loci, regardless of the presence or absence of plague in recent decades. However, genetic drift has probably also influenced the DRB1 locus because its level of differentiation was not different from that of microsatellites in an F ST outlier analysis. We then compared specific MHC alleles to plague survivorship in 60 C.?gunnisoni that had been experimentally infected with Y.?pestis. We found that survival was greater in individuals that carried at least one copy of the most common allele (DRB1*01) compared to those that did not (60% vs. 20%). Although the sample sizes of these two groups were unbalanced, this result suggests the possibility that this MHC class II locus, or a nearby linked gene, could play a role in plague survival.

The aim of this study is to make sure whether polymorphism Ala54Thr of gene Fatty Acid-Binding Protein 2 (FABP2) is associated with stroke risk in Hunan Han population of China. A total of 206 cerebral infarction (CI), 185 cerebral hemorrhage (CH) and 172 controls were enrolled in our study. Ala54Thr was applied by polymerasechain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). No significant difference in Ala54Thr genotypic distribution of FABP2 was observed between stroke group (CI subgroup, CH subgroup included) and controls group. In stroke group, plasma TG level of who carried Ala54Thr, Thr54Thr of FABP2 is significantly higher than who carring Ala54Ala. In controls group, blood lipid is not significantly different among 3 genotypes of Ala54Thr. There is no significant difference in blood pressure and fasting blood sugar between strokes and controls. Our study shows that Ala54Thr of FABP2 may be not associated with stroke risk but associated with plasma TG level of stroke patients for Hunan Han population of China. 	Med._Sci._Monit.

12538664	20030123	A single amino acid alteration in cytoplasmic domain determines IL-2 promoter activation by ligation of CD28 but not inducible costimulator (ICOS).	The CD28 family molecules, CD28, and inducible costimulator (ICOS) all provide positive costimulatory signals. However, unlike CD28, ICOS does not costimulate IL-2 secretion. The YMNM motif that exists in the CD28 cytoplasmic domain is a known binding site for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and Grb2. ICOS possesses the YMFM motif in the corresponding region of CD28 that binds PI3-K but not Grb2. We postulated that the reason that ICOS does not have the ability to induce IL-2 production is because it fails to recruit Grb2. To verify this hypothesis, we generated a mutant ICOS gene that contains the CD28 YMNM motif and measured IL-2 promoter activation after ICOS ligation. The results indicated that ICOS became competent to activate the IL-2 promoter by this single alteration. Further analysis demonstrated that Grb2 binding to ICOS was sufficient to activate the NFAT/AP-1 site in the IL-2 promoter and that the cytoplasmic domain of CD28 outside of the YMNM motif is required for activation of the CD28RE/AP-1 and NF-kappaB sites. Together, these observations lead us to believe that the difference of a single amino acid, which affects Grb2 binding ability, may define a functional difference between the CD28- and ICOS-mediated costimulatory signals.

The N-H H atoms are syn and an intra-molecular hy-droxy-imine O-H?N hydrogen bond is noted. In the crystal, the N-bonded H atoms form hydrogen bonds to symmetry-related water mol-ecules, and the latter form donor inter-actions with the hy-droxy O atom and with a hy-droxy-benzene ring, forming a O-H?? inter-action. The hydrogen bonding leads to supra-molecular tubes aligned along the b axis. The tubes are connected into layers via C-H?O inter-actions, and these stack along the c axis with no directional inter-actions between them. 	Acta_Crystallogr_E_Crystallogr_Commun	D016428
25219798	20140916	Construction of a chimeric lysin Ply187N-V12C with extended lytic activity against staphylococci and streptococci.	Developing chimeric lysins with a wide lytic spectrum would be important for treating some infections caused by multiple pathogenic bacteria. In the present work, a novel chimeric lysin (Ply187N-V12C) was constructed by fusing the catalytic domain (Ply187N) of the bacteriophage lysin Ply187 with the cell binding domain (146-314aa, V12C) of the lysin PlyV12. The results showed that the chimeric lysin Ply187N-V12C had not only lytic activity similar to Ply187N against staphylococcal strains but also extended its lytic activity to streptococci and enterococci, such as Streptococcus?dysgalactiae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, which Ply187N could not lyse. Our work demonstrated that generating novel chimeric lysins with an extended lytic spectrum was feasible through fusing a catalytic domain with a cell-binding domain from lysins with lytic spectra across multiple genera.

The recombinant KGF and KITLG proteins were solubilized in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5 and 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4 and purified using Ni-NTA column and GST affinity chromatography, respectively. The purity and molecular weight of His-KGF (~23 kDa) and GST-KITLG (~57 kDa) proteins were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. The co-immunoprecipitation assay accompanied with computational analysis demonstrated the interaction between KGF and KITLG proteins. We deduced 3D structures of the candidate proteins and assessed their binding based on protein docking. In the process, KGF specific residues, Lys123, Glu135, Lys140, Lys155 and Trp156 and KITLG specific ones, Ser226, Phe233, Gly234, Ala235, Phe236, Trp238 and Lys239 involved in the formation of KGF-KITLG complex were detected. The hydrophobic interactions surrounding KGF-KITLG complex affirmed their binding affinity and stability to the interacting interface. Additionally, in-silico site directed mutagenesis enabled the assessment of changes that occurred in the binding energies of mutated KGF-KITLG protein complex. Our results demonstrate that in the presence of KITLG, KGF mimics its native binding mode suggesting all the KGF residues are specific to their binding complex. This study provides an insight on the critical amino acid residues participating in buffalo ovarian folliculogenesis. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485

27134758	20160503	TRIP6 antagonizes the recruitment of A20 and CYLD to TRAF6 to promote the LPA2 receptor-mediated TRAF6 activation.	The elevated lysophosphatidic acid signaling has been causally linked to cancer-associated inflammation and tumorigenesis through upregulation of nuclear factor-?B signaling. However, how this signaling event is regulated has not yet been fully understood. Here we demonstrate that TRIP6, an LPA2 receptor-interacting adaptor protein, functions as a positive regulator of nuclear factor-?B and JNK signaling through direct binding to and activation of the E3 ligase TRAF6. Upon lysophosphatidic acid stimulation, TRIP6 recruits TRAF6 to the LPA2 receptor and promotes lysophosphatidic acid-induced JNK and nuclear factor-?B activation in a TRAF6-dependent manner. TRIP6 antagonizes the recruitment of deubiquitinases A20 and CYLD to TRAF6, thus sustaining the E3 ligase activity of TRAF6 and augmenting lysophosphatidic acid-activated nuclear factor-?B signaling. In contrast, depletion of TRIP6 by TRIP6-specific shRNA or Cas9/sgRNA greatly enhances the association of TRAF6 with A20 and CYLD, and attenuates lysophosphatidic acid-induced muclear factor-?B and JNK/p38 activation in ovarian cancer cells. On the other hand, TRAF6 also regulates TRIP6 by facilitating its binding to nuclear factor-?B p65 and phosphorylation by c-Src. Together, TRIP6 cooperates with TRAF6 to regulate the LPA2 receptor signaling, which may ultimately contribute to chronic inflammation, apoptotic resistance and cell invasion. 	Cell_Discov	D016428
9240638	19970701	Stage T1-2 prostate cancer with pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level &lt; or = 10 ng/ml: radiation therapy or surgery?	To detect differences in biochemical failure rates by treatment modality (radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy) in patients with early-stage prostate cancer presenting with pretreatment prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) levels &lt; or = 10.0 ng/ml. A total of 1467 consecutive patients with prostate carcinoma were treated with either radiotherapy (RT) or radical prostatectomy (RP) between January 1987 and June 1996. Patients with the following were excluded from the present study: initial PSA (iPSA) level &gt; 10 ng/ml (n = 444), clinical Stage T3 disease (n = 73), adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment (n = 173), no available iPSA level (n = 31), no available biopsy Gleason score (GS) (n = 33), incomplete pathologic information (n = 16), and no available follow-up PSA levels (n = 90). The analysis was performed on 607 cases: 354 treated with RP and 253 with RT (median dose 68.4 Gy). The outcome of interest was biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS), with biochemical relapse being defined as either a detectable PSA level after RP or elevation in PSA levels of &gt; or = 1.0 ng/ml above the nadir after RT. Proportional hazards were used to analyze the effect of treatment modality and confounding variables (i.e., age, stage, biopsy GS, iPSA levels) on treatment outcome. Seventy-nine percent of patients (n = 478) had clinical Stage T1 or T2A disease at presentation (RP vs. RT: 84% vs. 71%, p &lt; 0.001). Twenty-one percent of patients (n = 127) had iPSA levels &lt; or = 4 ng/ml (RP vs. RT: 24% vs. 17%, p = 0.027). Seventy-six percent of patients (n = 460) had biopsy GS &lt; or = 6 (RP vs. RT: 79% vs. 71%, p = 0.014). The median follow-up time was 24 months (range 3-110). For the 607 patients, the 5-year bRFS rate was 76%. The 5-year RFS rates for RP versus RT were 76% versus 75%, respectively (p = 0.09). After adjustment for all confounding variables, iPSA levels (p &lt; 0.001) and biopsy GS (p = 0.001) were the only independent predictors of relapse, whereas age, clinical stage, and treatment modality were not (p = 0.20; p = 0.09; and p = 0.10, respectively). In patients with clinical Stage T1-2 prostate cancer and pretreatment PSA &lt; or = 10 ng/ml, there is no difference in biochemical failure rates between those treated with radiation and those treated with surgery.

23028316	20121003	Marburg virus VP35 can both fully coat the backbone and cap the ends of dsRNA for interferon antagonism.	Filoviruses, including Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV), cause fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates. All filoviruses encode a unique multi-functional protein termed VP35. The C-terminal double-stranded (ds)RNA-binding domain (RBD) of VP35 has been implicated in interferon antagonism and immune evasion. Crystal structures of the VP35 RBD from two ebolaviruses have previously demonstrated that the viral protein caps the ends of dsRNA. However, it is not yet understood how the expanses of dsRNA backbone, between the ends, are masked from immune surveillance during filovirus infection. Here, we report the crystal structure of MARV VP35 RBD bound to dsRNA. In the crystal structure, molecules of dsRNA stack end-to-end to form a pseudo-continuous oligonucleotide. This oligonucleotide is continuously and completely coated along its sugar-phosphate backbone by the MARV VP35 RBD. Analysis of dsRNA binding by dot-blot and isothermal titration calorimetry reveals that multiple copies of MARV VP35 RBD can indeed bind the dsRNA sugar-phosphate backbone in a cooperative manner in solution. Further, MARV VP35 RBD can also cap the ends of the dsRNA in solution, although this arrangement was not captured in crystals. Together, these studies suggest that MARV VP35 can both coat the backbone and cap the ends, and that for MARV, coating of the dsRNA backbone may be an essential mechanism by which dsRNA is masked from backbone-sensing immune surveillance molecules.

23268649	20121228	Human CD72 splicing isoform responsible for resistance to systemic lupus erythematosus regulates serum immunoglobulin level and is localized in endoplasmic reticulum.	CD72 is an inhibitory co-receptor expressed on B cells. We previously demonstrated significant association of the polymorphism of the CD72 gene with susceptibility to human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in individuals carrying a SLE-susceptible FCGR2B genotype (FCGR2B-232Thr/Thr). The human CD72 locus generates a splicing isoform that lacks exon 8 (CD72?ex8) as well as full-length CD72 (CD72fl), and the CD72 polymorphism regulates exon 8 skipping. Here we demonstrated that individuals carrying the disease-protective CD72 genotype exhibit significantly lower serum immunoglobulin levels than do individuals carrying other CD72 genotypes (P &lt; 0.05). Although expression level of CD72fl in the peripheral blood B cells was similar regardless of CD72 genotype, the protein level of CD72?ex8 was increased in individuals carrying the disease-protective CD72 genotype, suggesting a crucial role of CD72?ex8 in regulation of antibody production. By expressing these human CD72 isoforms in mouse cell lines, we further demonstrated that CD72?ex8 is accumulated in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and fails to regulate BCR signaling whereas human CD72fl is efficiently transported to the cell surface and inhibits signaling through the B cell antigen receptor (BCR), as is the case for mouse CD72. Human CD72 polymorphism appears to regulate antibody production as well as susceptibility to SLE by regulating expression of ER-localizing CD72?ex8. 	BMC_Immunol.	D016428 D013485
12473176	20021211	No evidence for association of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene T2119C and C3161G amino acid substitution variants with risk of breast cancer.	There is evidence that certain mutations in the double-strand break repair pathway ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene act in a dominant-negative manner to increase the risk of breast cancer. There are also some reports to suggest that the amino acid substitution variants T2119C Ser707Pro and C3161G Pro1054Arg may be associated with breast cancer risk. We investigate the breast cancer risk associated with these two nonconservative amino acid substitution variants using a large Australian population-based case-control study. The polymorphisms were genotyped in more than 1300 cases and 600 controls using 5' exonuclease assays. Case-control analyses and genotype distributions were compared by logistic regression. The 2119C variant was rare, occurring at frequencies of 1.4 and 1.3% in cases and controls, respectively (P = 0.8). There was no difference in genotype distribution between cases and controls (P = 0.8), and the TC genotype was not associated with increased risk of breast cancer (adjusted odds ratio = 1.08, 95% confidence interval = 0.59-1.97, P = 0.8). Similarly, the 3161G variant was no more common in cases than in controls (2.9% versus 2.2%, P = 0.2), there was no difference in genotype distribution between cases and controls (P = 0.1), and the CG genotype was not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (adjusted odds ratio = 1.30, 95% confidence interval = 0.85-1.98, P = 0.2). This lack of evidence for an association persisted within groups defined by the family history of breast cancer or by age. The 2119C and 3161G amino acid substitution variants are not associated with moderate or high risks of breast cancer in Australian women. 	Breast_Cancer_Res.	D016428 D013485 D013487
1678520	19910815	A single amino acid substitution strongly modulates the activity and substrate specificity of the mouse mdr1 and mdr3 drug efflux pumps.	Specific protein domains and amino acids responsible for the apparent capacity of P-glycoprotein (mdr) to recognize and transport a large group of structurally unrelated drugs have not been identified. We have introduced a single Ser----Phe substitution within the predicted TM11 domain of mdr1 (position 941) and mdr3 (position 939) and analyzed the effect of these substitutions on the drug-resistance profiles of these two proteins. Mutations at this residue drastically altered the overall degree of drug resistance conveyed by mdr1 and mdr3. The modulating effect of this mutation on mdr1 and mdr3 varied for the drugs tested: it was very strong for colchicine and adriamycin and moderate for vinblastine. For mdr1, the Ser941----Phe941 substitution produced a unique mutant protein that retained the capacity to confer vinblastine resistance but lost the ability to confer adriamycin and colchicine resistance. These results strongly suggest that the predicted TM11 domain of proteins encoded by mdr and mdr-like genes plays an important role in the recognition and transport of their specific substrates.

24031716	20130914	Membrane permeability alteration of some bacterial clinical isolates by selected antihistaminics.	Several antihistaminics possess antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria. However, the exact mechanism of such activity was unclear. Hence, the aim of this study is to investigate their mechanism of antibacterial activity especially their effect upon the permeability of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. The effects of azelastine, cetirizine, cyproheptadine and diphenhydramine were studied using Gram-positive and Gram-negative multiresistant clinical isolates. Leakage of 260 and 280 nm UV-absorbing materials was detected upon treatment with the tested antihistaminics; indicative of membrane alteration. Using an artificial membrane model, cholesterol-free negatively-charged unilamellar liposomes, confirmed the effect of antihistaminics upon the membrane permeability both by showing an apparent membrane damage as observed microscopically and by detection of leakage of preloaded dye from the liposomes colorimatrically. Moreover, examination of the ultrastructure of cells treated with azelastine and cetirizine under the transmission electron microscope substantiated the detected abnormalities in the cell wall and membrane. Furthermore, the effect of pretreating certain isolates for both short and long periods with selected antihistaminics was followed by the viable count technique. Increased vulnerability towards further exposure to azelastine was observed in cells pretreated with azelastine for 2 days and those pretreated with azelastine or cetrizine for 30 days.

19017358	20081120	Association of human NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) polymorphism with development of acute lung injury.	Acute lung injury (ALI) is a syndrome with significant morbidity and mortality, but its genetic susceptibility is not clearly understood. In the present study, we characterized functional promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the phase II antioxidant gene NQO1 (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase1) to evaluate its role in susceptibility to ALI. Three previously uncharacterized SNPs in the NQO1 promoter were selected for investigation. Luciferase assays were performed using constructs of each promoter polymorphism to evaluate function. Functional SNPs were genotyped in a prospective cohort of major trauma patients (N = 264) and assessed for association with development of ALI. The A/C SNP at -1221 decreased in vitro transcription of NQO1 at baseline and after exposure to hyperoxia and other oxidant stressors. Patients heterozygous for the -1221 C allele were at significantly lesser risk of ALI after major trauma compared with patients with wild-type alleles, even after adjustment for APACHE III score, and mechanism of trauma [OR, 0.46 (95% CI 0.23, 0.90); P = 0.024]. This study demonstrated that the AC genotype at position -1221 in the NQO1 gene caused decreased transcription and was associated with a lower incidence of ALI following major trauma. These novel findings may have important implications in diseases with oxidant stress aetiologies. 	J._Cell._Mol._Med.	D016428 D052061 D052060 D013485
24157612	20131026	BRAFV600E immunohistochemistry in conjunction with mismatch repair status predicts survival in patients with colorectal cancer.	Immunohistochemistry has recently been validated for the detection of the BRAFV600E mutation across a range of tumor types. In colorectal carcinoma, the presence of the BRAFV600E mutation can be used to virtually exclude Lynch syndrome in mismatch repair-deficient tumors. In mismatch repair-proficient tumors, BRAFV600E mutation assessed by molecular methods has been proposed as a poor prognostic factor. We investigated whether combined BRAFV600E and mismatch repair status assessment by immunohistochemistry alone can be used as a prognostic marker in the routine clinical setting. We performed immunohistochemistry for BRAFV600E, MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 on 1426 consecutive unselected colorectal carcinomas. Ninety-one (6.4%) carcinomas were mismatch repair-proficient and BRAFV600E mutant, and these tumors demonstrated a significantly worse 5-year survival of 49.7% compared with mismatch repair-proficient BRAF wild type (74.1% of tumors, 65.4% survival), mismatch repair-deficient BRAFV600E mutant (12.9% of tumors, 70.1% survival), and mismatch repair-deficient BRAF wild type (6.6% of tumors, 73.6% survival). The poor survival was confirmed by univariate analysis (P&lt;0.01) but fell away in multivariate analysis (P=0.68) because of the strong effect of tumor stage and age on overall survival. We conclude that in addition to its utility in screening for Lynch syndrome, reflex BRAFV600E and mismatch repair assessment by immunohistochemistry can be used as a powerful predictor of all-cause survival.

2555183	19890901	Role of myristoylation of poliovirus capsid protein VP4 as determined by site-directed mutagenesis of its N-terminal sequence.	Mutations were introduced by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis into the cDNA of poliovirus type 1 (Mahoney) in the region coding for the first five amino acids (myristoylation signal) of the viral capsid protein precursor P1. The cDNAs were then transcribed in vitro and the properties of the transcripts carrying the mutations studied in vitro by translation in a reticulocyte lysate or in vivo upon transfection of primate cells. Mutation of amino acid residue number 5 (Ser5----Thr) did not affect the viral phenotype, whereas mutations of residues number 1 (Gly1----Arg), 2 (Ala2----Pro) or 5 (Ser5----Pro) prevented myristoylation of P1 and were lethal. However, delayed production of virus was occasionally observed as the result of reverse mutations, which were found to restore a functional myristoylation signal as well as a wild-type virus phenotype. Thus, the myristoylation signal of the poliovirus polyprotein can accommodate Ala, Ser, Thr or Leu residues at position 2 and Ser, Thr or Ala residues at position 5. Mutations that altered myristoylation of P1 and affected virus viability did not prevent replication of the viral RNA but severely impeded in vitro processing of P1. This suggests that myristoylation plays a role in poliovirus capsid protein assembly. 	EMBO_J.	D016428
20591150	20100702	Insulin-like growth factor II mRNA binding protein 3 (IMP3) is overexpressed in prostate cancer and correlates with higher Gleason scores.	The oncofetal protein insulin-like growth factor II mRNA binding protein 3 (IMP3) is an important factor for cell-migration and adhesion in malignancies. Recent studies have shown a remarkable overexpression of IMP3 in different human malignant neoplasms and also revealed it as an important prognostic marker in some tumor entities. To our knowledge, IMP3 expression has not been investigated in prostate carcinomas so far. Immunohistochemical stainings for IMP3 were performed on tissue microarray (TMA) organized samples from 507 patients: 31 normal prostate tissues, 425 primary carcinomas and 51 prostate cancer metastases or castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC). IMP3 immunoreactivity was semiquantitatively scored and correlated with clinical-pathologic parameters including survival. IMP3 is significantly stronger expressed in prostate carcinomas compared to normal prostate tissues (p &lt; 0.0001), but did not show significant correlation with the pT-stage, the proliferation index (MIB1), preoperative serum PSA level and the margin status. Only a weak and slightly significant correlation was found with the Gleason score and IMP3 expression failed to show prognostic significance in clinico-pathological correlation-analyses. Although IMP3 is overexpressed in a significant proportion of prostate cancer cases, which might be of importance for novel therapeutic approaches, it does not appear to possess any immediate diagnostic or prognostic value, limiting its potential as a tissue biomarker for prostate cancer. These results might be corroborated by the fact, that two independent tumor cohorts were separately reviewed. 	BMC_Cancer	D003160 D016428
25275608	20141003	Structural characterization of CO-inhibited Mo-nitrogenase by combined application of nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy, extended X-ray absorption fine structure, and density functional theory: new insights into the effects of CO binding and the role of the interstitial atom.	The properties of CO-inhibited Azotobacter vinelandii (Av) Mo-nitrogenase (N2ase) have been examined by the combined application of nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and density functional theory (DFT). Dramatic changes in the NRVS are seen under high-CO conditions, especially in a 188 cm(-1) mode associated with symmetric breathing of the central cage of the FeMo-cofactor. Similar changes are reproduced with the ?-H195Q N2ase variant. In the frequency region above 450 cm(-1), additional features are seen that are assigned to Fe-CO bending and stretching modes (confirmed by (13)CO isotope shifts). The EXAFS for wild-type N2ase shows evidence for a significant cluster distortion under high-CO conditions, most dramatically in the splitting of the interaction between Mo and the shell of Fe atoms originally at 5.08 ? in the resting enzyme. A DFT model with both a terminal -CO and a partially reduced -CHO ligand bound to adjacent Fe sites is consistent with both earlier FT-IR experiments, and the present EXAFS and NRVS observations for the wild-type enzyme. Another DFT model with two terminal CO ligands on the adjacent Fe atoms yields Fe-CO bands consistent with the ?-H195Q variant NRVS. The calculations also shed light on the vibrational &quot;shake&quot; modes of the interstitial atom inside the central cage, and their interaction with the Fe-CO modes. Implications for the CO and N2 reactivity of N2ase are discussed. 	J._Am._Chem._Soc.	D016428 D052061 D013485 D013486
18305827	20080229	Functional gene clustering via gene annotation sentences, MeSH and GO keywords from biomedical literature.	Gene function annotation remains a key challenge in modern biology. This is especially true for high-throughput techniques such as gene expression experiments. Vital information about genes is available electronically from biomedical literature in the form of full texts and abstracts. In addition, various publicly available databases (such as GenBank, Gene Ontology and Entrez) provide access to gene-related information at different levels of biological organization, granularity and data format. This information is being used to assess and interpret the results from high-throughput experiments. To improve keyword extraction for annotational clustering and other types of analyses, we have developed a novel text mining approach, which is based on keywords identified at the level of gene annotation sentences (in particular sentences characterizing biological function) instead of entire abstracts. Further, to improve the expressiveness and usefulness of gene annotation terms, we investigated the combination of sentence-level keywords with terms from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Gene Ontology (GO) resources. We find that sentence-level keywords combined with MeSH terms outperforms the typical 'baseline' set-up (term frequencies at the level of abstracts) by a significant margin, whereas the addition of GO terms improves matters only marginally. We validated our approach on the basis of a manually annotated corpus of 200 abstracts generated on the basis of 2 cancer categories and 10 genes per category. We applied the method in the context of three sets of differentially expressed genes obtained from pediatric brain tumor samples. This analysis suggests novel interpretations of discovered gene expression patterns. 	Bioinformation	D016428
11240952	20010310	Differences in proliferation of the hematopoietic cell line TF-1 and cytokine production by peripheral blood leukocytes induced by 2 naturally occurring forms of human IL-3.	A naturally occurring polymorphism in the coding region of the human IL3 gene leads to a change in amino acid residue 8 from proline to serine. We sought to determine whether the 2 different forms of IL-3 varied in function. These different forms are available as recombinant proteins (recombinant human IL-3/proline 8 [rhIL-3/P8] and recombinant human IL-3/serine 8 [rhIL-3/S8]). The erythroleukemic cell line TF-1 was incubated with varying concentrations of rhIL-3/P8 or rhIL-3/S8 to determine the capacity of each type of IL-3 to induce proliferation. Human leukocytes were primed with rhIL-3/P8 or rhIL-3/S8 for up to 24 hours and then stimulated with anti-IgE and assessed for leukotrienes (LTs), IL-4, and TNF-alpha. Proliferation of TF-1 cells was induced by both forms of IL-3 at 48 and 72 hours but to a greater degree by rhIL-3/P8. In contrast, the mean fold increase over control values of LT and IL-4 production was higher after priming the cells with rhIL-3/S8 versus rhIL-3/P8. Additionally, TNF-alpha production was greater (and reached significance only) for rhIL-3/S8. This activity was independent of IgE and thus directly stimulated by IL-3. Studies with basophil-enriched and basophil-depleted cell preparations revealed that LT production was evident only from the former and TNF-alpha only from the latter. We conclude that the 2 naturally occurring forms of human IL-3 have similar spectra of activities on cells with IL-3 receptors, but the 2 forms have reversed relative efficacies for promoting proliferation (rhIL-3/P8 &gt; rhIL-3/S8) compared with priming or inducing mediator secretion (rhIL-3/S8 &gt; rhIL-3/P8).

26019279	20150529	Variable content of von Willebrand factor mutant monomer drives the phenotypic variability in a family with von Willebrand disease.	Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is an inherited bleeding disorder characterized by incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. We evaluated a 24-member pedigree with VWD type 2 caused by a T&gt;G mutation at position 3911 that predicts a methionine to arginine (M1304R) change in the platelet-binding A1 domain of von Willebrand factor (VWF). This mutation manifests as an autosomal-dominant trait, with clinical and biochemical phenotypic variability among affected individuals, including differences in bleeding tendency and VWF quantity, activity, and multimer pattern. Sequencing of all VWF coding regions in 3 affected individuals did not identify additional mutations. When expressed in heterologous cells, M1304R was secreted in lower quantities, failed to drive formation of storage granules, and was defective in multimerization and platelet binding. When cotransfected in equal quantities with the wild-type complementary DNA, the mutant complementary DNA depressed VWF secretion, although multimerization was only mildly affected. A llama nanobody (AU/VWFa-11) that detects the mutant A1 domain demonstrated highly variable binding to VWF from different affected members, indicating that the VWF contained different percentages of mutant monomers in different individuals. Thus, the observed variability in VWD phenotypes could in part be determined by the extent of mutant monomer incorporation in the final multimer structure of plasma VWF.

17665456	20070801	Increased expression of the collagen receptor discoidin domain receptor 2 in articular cartilage as a key event in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis.	To investigate the role of the collagen receptor discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR-2) in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA). Histologic and immunohistochemical analyses were performed to characterize femoral head cartilage from 7 patients with OA and 4 patients with fracture, as well as articular cartilage from the knee joints of mice with surgically induced OA. Gene constructs encoding human Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP), DDR-2 lacking the discoidin (DS) domain (DeltaDS-DDR-2) or the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) core (DeltaPTK-DDR-2), DDR-2 containing a substitution of tyrosine for alanine at position 740 (Y740A), and luciferase driven by the matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) promoter were transfected into human chondrocyte cell lines. Activated and neutralized alpha2beta1 integrin polyclonal antibodies, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, and the chemical inhibitors SB203580, for p38, and SP600125, for JNKs, were used in cell cultures. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to examine MMP-13 and DDR-2 messenger RNA (mRNA). Increased immunostaining for DDR-2, MMP-13, and MMP-derived type II collagen fragments was detected in cartilage from patients with OA and from mice with surgically induced OA. The discoidin domain and PTK core of DDR-2 were essential for signal transmission and the resulting increased expression of MMP-13 in chondrocytes. Y740A mutation of DDR-2 reduced levels of mRNA for MMP-13 and endogenous DDR-2. The overexpression of RKIP or preincubation with the p38 inhibitor reduced MMP-13 mRNA levels. DDR-2 signaling was independent of the alpha2beta1 integrin and the interleukin-1-induced signaling pathways in chondrocytes. These findings suggest that increased expression of DDR-2, resulting in the elevated expression of MMP-13, may be one of the common events in OA progression. 	Arthritis_Rheum.	D016428 D052061
15364613	20040915	Functional heterogeneity of ryanodine receptor mutations associated with sudden cardiac death.	Point mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) mediate abnormal intracellular Ca(2+) release and are associated with stress-induced ventricular tachycardia (VT), leading to sudden cardiac death (SCD). Although the precise molecular basis of RyR2 dysfunction in SCD remains controversial, there is consensus that the mutations characterised to date all exhibit gain-of-function Ca(2+) release properties following cell stimulation. We investigated the functional impact of a distinct set of SCD-linked RyR2 mutations (L(433)P, N(2386)I, R(176)Q/T(2504)M) on intracellular Ca(2+) handling. We expressed full-length recombinant human wild-type (WT) and SCD-linked RyR2 mutations in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, and profiled the spatial and amplitude characteristics of caffeine-evoked Ca(2+) release through homo-tetrameric channels in living cells using rapid confocal laser scanning microscopy. Analysis of the precise mode of Ca(2+) release in HEK cells expressing RyR2 mutants demonstrated profound differences when compared with WT channels. The SCD-linked RyR2 mutations characterised in this study exhibited heterogeneous Ca(2+) release profiles, including the novel observation that one of the mutants, (L(433)P), exhibited a marked reduction in sensitivity to channel activation. However, all SCD-linked RyR2 mutations characterised in this study resulted in an increased duration of elevated cytoplasmic Ca(2+) levels following channel activation. Our live cell-based data demonstrates functional heterogeneity of Ca(2+) release through SCD-linked RyR2 mutants, suggesting that the mechanistic basis of RyR2 dysfunction in SCD may be more complex than previously anticipated. These findings may have profound consequences for the therapeutic modulation of RyR2 in stress-induced VT and SCD. 	Cardiovasc._Res.	D016428 D013485
16950817	20060905	A novel mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA(Ser(AGY)) gene associated with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, and complex I deficiency.	To identify molecular defects in a girl with clinical features of MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy and lactic acidosis) and MERRF (ragged-red fibres) syndromes. The enzyme complex activities of the mitochondrial respiratory chain were assayed. Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis was used to scan the entire mitochondrial genome for unknown mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alterations, which were then identified by direct DNA sequencing. A novel heteroplasmic mtDNA mutation, G12207A, in the tRNA(Ser(AGY)) gene was identified in the patient who had a history of developmental delay, feeding difficulty, lesions within her basal ganglia, cerebral atrophy, proximal muscle weakness, increased blood lactate, liver dysfunction, and fatty infiltration of her muscle. Muscle biopsy revealed ragged red fibres and pleomorphic mitochondria. Study of skeletal muscle mitochondria revealed complex I deficiency associated with mitochondrial proliferation. Real time quantitative PCR analysis showed elevated mtDNA content, 2.5 times higher than normal. The tRNA(Ser(AGY)) mutation was found in heteroplasmic state (92%) in the patient's skeletal muscle. It was not present in her unaffected mother's blood or in 200 healthy controls. This mutation occurs at the first nucleotide of the 5' end of tRNA, which is involved in the formation of the stem region of the amino acid acceptor arm. Mutation at this position may affect processing of the precursor RNA, the stability and amino acid charging efficiency of the tRNA, and overall efficiency of protein translation. This case underscores the importance of comprehensive mutational analysis of the entire mitochondrial genome when a mtDNA defect is strongly suggested. 	J._Med._Genet.	D016422 D013485
7949148	19941201	X-linked sideroblastic anemia: identification of the mutation in the erythroid-specific delta-aminolevulinate synthase gene (ALAS2) in the original family described by Cooley.	In 1945, Thomas Cooley described the first cases of X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) in two brothers from a large family in which the inheritance of the disease was documented through six generations. Almost 40 years later the enzymatic defect in XLSA was identified as the deficient activity of the erythroid-specific form of delta-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS2), the first enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. To determine the nature of the mutation in the ALAS2 gene causing XLSA in Cooley's original family, genomic DNAs were isolated from two affected hemizygotes, and each ALAS2 exon was PCR amplified and sequenced. A single transversion (A to C) was identified in exon 5. The mutation predicted the substitution of leucine for phenylalanine at residue 165 (F165L) in the first highly conserved domain of the ALAS2 catalytic core shared by all species. No other nucleotide changes were found by sequencing each of the 11 exons, including intron/exon boundaries, 1 kb of 5'-flanking and 350 nucleotides of 3'-flanking sequence. The mutation introduced an Mse I site and restriction analysis of PCR-amplified genomic DNA confirmed the presence of the lesion in the two affected brothers and in three obligate heterozygotes from three generations of this family. Carrier diagnosis of additional family members identified the mutation in one of the proband's sisters. After prokaryotic expression and affinity purification of both mutant and normal ALAS2 fusion proteins, the specific activity of the F165L mutant enzyme was about 26% of normal. The cofactor, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, activated and/or stabilized the purified mutant recombinant enzyme in vitro, consistent with the pyridoxine-responsive anemia in affected hemizygotes from this family.

24209603	20131112	Association of apolipoprotein A1 -75 G/A polymorphism with susceptibility to the development of acute lung injury after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.	Apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) is the major apoprotein constituent of high density lipoprotein (HDL) which exerts innate protective effects in systemic inflammation. However, its role in the acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has not been well studied. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential association between APOA1 -75 G/A polymorphism and the development of ALI after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery. A hospital-based case-control study was conducted in patients with ALI (n = 300), patients without ALI (n = 300) and healthy controls (n = 300). Polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay was applied to assess the APOA1 -75 G/A genotypes. Patients with ALI had a significantly higher frequency of APOA1 -75 AA genotype [odds ratio (OR) =1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04, 2.92; P = 0.03] than patients without ALI. APOA1 -75 AA genotype (OR =3.47, 95% CI = 1.60, 7.52; P = 0.002) and A allele (OR =1.92, 95% CI = 1.24, 2.96; P = 0.003) were the significant independent prognostic factors for the 30-day survival rate of patients with ALI after CPB surgery. Our study suggested that APOA1 -75 AA genotype was associated with a higher ALI risk after CPB surgery. Patients with the APOA1 -75 AA genotype and A allele had higher 30-day mortality of ALI after CPB surgery. Additional studies are needed to confirm this finding. 	Lipids_Health_Dis	D016428

A collection of 767 multiplex type 1 diabetes families from the US and UK were tested for linkage to the IRS1 gene and for allelic association with a specific variant of IRS1, G972R. Pedigree disequilibrium testing revealed preferential transmission of the 972R allele to affected offspring in these families (P = 0.02). Linkage analyses conditioning on status at IRS1 position 972 suggest the possibility of interaction with an unidentified locus on chromosome 8. 	Mol._Genet._Metab.	D016428 D013485 D013487
15462678	20041007	Reduced proviral loads during primo-infection of sheep by Bovine Leukemia virus attenuated mutants.	The early stages consecutive to infection of sheep (e.g. primo-infection) by Bovine leukemia virus mutants are largely unknown. In order to better understand the mechanisms associated with this period, we aimed at analyzing simultaneously three parameters: B-lymphocytosis, cell proliferation and viral replication. Sheep were experimentally infected either with a wild type BLV provirus or with selected mutants among which: a virus harboring an optimalized LTR promoter with consensus cyclic AMP-responsive elements, two deletants of the R3 or the G4 accessory genes and a fusion-deficient transmembrane recombinant. Seroconversion, as revealed by the onset of an anti-viral antibody response, was detected at 3 to 11 weeks after inoculation. At seroconversion, all sheep exhibited a marked increase in the numbers of circulating B lymphocytes expressing the CD5 and CD11b cluster of differentiation markers and, interestingly, this phenomenon occurred independently of the type of virus. The net increase of the absolute number of B cells was at least partially due to accelerated proliferation as revealed, after intravenous injection of bromodeoxyuridine, by the higher proportion of circulating BrdU+ B lymphocytes. BLV proviral DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in the leucocytes of all sheep, as expected. However, at seroconversion, the proviral loads were lower in sheep infected by the attenuated proviruses despite similar levels of B cell lymphocytosis. We conclude that the proviral loads are not directly linked to the extent of B cell proliferation observed during primo-infection of BLV-infected sheep. We propose a model of opportunistic replication of the virus supported by a general activation process of B lymphocytes. 	Retrovirology	D016428 D013485
20565839	20100623	A general framework for optimization of probes for gene expression microarray and its application to the fungus Podospora anserina.	The development of new microarray technologies makes custom long oligonucleotide arrays affordable for many experimental applications, notably gene expression analyses. Reliable results depend on probe design quality and selection. Probe design strategy should cope with the limited accuracy of de novo gene prediction programs, and annotation up-dating. We present a novel in silico procedure which addresses these issues and includes experimental screening, as an empirical approach is the best strategy to identify optimal probes in the in silico outcome. We used four criteria for in silico probe selection: cross-hybridization, hairpin stability, probe location relative to coding sequence end and intron position. This latter criterion is critical when exon-intron gene structure predictions for intron-rich genes are inaccurate. For each coding sequence (CDS), we selected a sub-set of four probes. These probes were included in a test microarray, which was used to evaluate the hybridization behavior of each probe. The best probe for each CDS was selected according to three experimental criteria: signal-to-noise ratio, signal reproducibility, and representative signal intensities. This procedure was applied for the development of a gene expression Agilent platform for the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina and the selection of a single 60-mer probe for each of the 10,556 P. anserina CDS. A reliable gene expression microarray version based on the Agilent 44K platform was developed with four spot replicates of each probe to increase statistical significance of analysis.

28008997	20161224	2</sub>O reduction reduce N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from a biochar-amended sandy clay loam soil.	Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas that is produced during microbial nitrogen transformation processes such as nitrification and denitrification. Soils represent the largest sources of N2O emissions with nitrogen fertilizer application being the main driver of rising atmospheric N2O concentrations. Soil biochar amendment has been proposed as a promising tool to mitigate N2O emissions from soils. However, the underlying processes that cause N2O emission suppression in biochar-amended soils are still poorly understood. We set up microcosm experiments with fertilized, wet soil in which we used15N tracing techniques and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to investigate the impact of biochar on mineral and gaseous nitrogen dynamics and denitrification-specific functional marker gene abundance and expression. In accordance with previous studies our results showed that biochar addition can lead to a significant decrease in N2O emissions. Furthermore, we determined significantly higher quantities of soil-entrapped N2O and N2in biochar microcosms and a biochar-induced increase in typical and atypical nosZ transcript copy numbers. Our findings suggest that biochar-induced N2O emission mitigation is based on the entrapment of N2O in water-saturated pores of the soil matrix and concurrent stimulation of microbial N2O reduction resulting in an overall decrease of the N2O/(N2O?+?N2) ratio.

26519518	20151101	Mindbomb 2 is dispensable for embryonic development and Notch signalling in zebrafish.	The Mindbomb E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (Mib) family of proteins, Mib1 and Mib2, are RING finger ubiquitin ligases that share specific substrates. Mib1 is known to play essential roles in Notch signalling by ubiquitinating Notch ligands in vivo. Conversely, the functions of Mib2 in vivo are not fully understood, although Mib2 ubiquitinates multiple substrates, including Notch ligands, in vitro. To determine the Notch-dependent and Notch-independent functions of Mib2 in vivo, we generated mutant alleles of zebrafish mib2 using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). We found that mib2 homozygous mutants were viable and fertile. Notch-mediated functions, such as early neurogenesis, somitogenesis, and pigment cell development, were not affected in mib2 mutant embryos. The lack of Notch-deficient phenotypes in mib2 mutants was not due to compensation by a mib2 maternal gene product because mib2 maternal-zygotic mutants also did not exhibit a distinct phenotype. We also showed that Mib2 does not redundantly act with Mib1 because the genetic ablation of mib2 neither enhanced mib(tfi91)-null phenotypes nor did it alleviate antimorphic mib(ta52b) phenotypes. Furthermore, the postulated Notch-independent roles of Mib2 in maintaining muscular integrity and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activity were not evident: mib2 mutants did not show phenotypes different from that of the control embryos. These observations suggest that Mib2 is dispensable for embryonic development and does not have redundant functions with Mib1 in Notch signalling at least during early development stages in zebrafish.

1408745	19920911	Repair and replication of plasmids with site-specific 8-oxodG and 8-AAFdG residues in normal and repair-deficient human cells.	The in vivo mutagenicity of 7-hydro-8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) and N-(guanin-8-yl)-N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene (8-AAFdG) in human cells was determined by transfecting various cell lines with plasmids that carried a single adduct at a defined site. 8-OxodG is one of the many DNA modifications formed by oxygen radicals, and was found to be highly miscoding during replication with purified DNA polymerases in vitro. Here we show that the frequency of mutations induced by 8-oxodG during replication in vivo is at most only 2% above background. The most predominant mutation found was a single G----T transversion. The frequency of this transversion was found to be 3 to 5-fold increased in excision repair deficient XP-A cells. Interestingly, also the replication of 8-oxodG containing plasmids was significantly impaired (approximately 4-fold) in the XP-A cells, but not in HeLa cells, normal fibroblasts or XP-A revertant cells. When 8-AAFdG containing plasmids were used, the mutation frequencies did not exceed background levels (less than 2%) with any of the cell lines tested. The presence of 8-AAFdG almost completely inhibited plasmid replication (more than 50-fold) in XP-A cells. Apparently, both 8-AAFdG and 8-oxodG are not or poorly repaired in these cells, causing a block of DNA replication. This suggests that both lesions are substrates for excision repair, although to a varying extent. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D013485
15705733	20050212	PPARGC1A genotype (Gly482Ser) predicts exceptional endurance capacity in European men.	Animal and human data indicate a role for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha (PPARGC1A) gene product in the development of maximal oxygen uptake (V(O2 max)), a determinant of endurance capacity, diabetes, and early death. We tested the hypothesis that the frequency of the minor Ser482 allele at the PPARGC1A locus is lower in World-class Spanish male endurance athletes (cases) [n = 104; mean (SD) age: 26.8 (3.8) yr] than in unfit United Kingdom (UK) Caucasian male controls [n = 100; mean (SD) age: 49.3 (8.1) yr]. In cases and controls, the Gly482Ser genotype met Hardy-Weinberg expectations (P &gt; 0.05 in both groups tested separately). Cases had significantly higher V(O2 max) [73.4 (5.7) vs. 29.4 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1) (3.8); P &lt; 0.0001] and were leaner [body mass index: 20.6 (1.5) vs. 27.6 kg/m2 (3.9); P &lt; 0.0001] than controls. In unadjusted chi2 analyses, the frequency of the minor Ser482 allele was significantly lower in cases than in controls (29.1 vs. 40.0%; P = 0.01). To assess the possibility that genetic stratification could confound these observations, we also compared Gly482Ser genotype frequencies in Spanish (n = 164) and UK Caucasian men (n = 381) who were unselected for their level of fitness. In these analyses, Ser482 allele frequencies were very similar (36.9% in Spanish vs. 37.5% in UK Caucasians, P = 0.83), suggesting that confounding by genetic stratification is unlikely to explain the association between Gly482Ser genotype and endurance capacity. In summary, our data indicate a role for the Gly482Ser genotype in determining aerobic fitness. This finding has relevance from the perspective of physical performance, but it may also be informative for the targeted prevention of diseases associated with low fitness such as Type 2 diabetes.

20426817	20100430	Basal keratin expression in breast cancer by quantification of mRNA and by immunohistochemistry.	Definitions of basal-like breast cancer phenotype vary, and microarray-based expression profiling analysis remains the gold standard for the identification of these tumors. Immunohistochemical identification of basal-like carcinomas is hindered with a fact, that on microarray level not all of them express basal-type cytokeratin 5/6, 14 and 17. We compared expression of cytokeratin 5, 14 and 17 in 115 patients with operable breast cancer estimated by real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Despite the method of dichotomization and statistical analysis, there were cases with discordant results comparing immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR analysis. For dichotomisation based on quartiles and ROC, 14% of cases were negative on immunohistochemical examination for CK5/6, but presented high CK5 mRNA levels. There were also 48-55% cases, which were CK5/6-immunopositive, but were negative by mRNA examination. Similar discordances were observed for CK14 and CK17. Basal keratin mRNAs did not correlate with ER mRNA levels, while immunohistochemistry produced significant relationship with ER status. Our observation suggest that both method may produce different results in a small proportion of cases. Discordance between immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR may confound attempts to establish a simple methods for identification of basal-like tumors. 	J._Exp._Clin._Cancer_Res.	D016428 D013485
8068029	19940815	Effects of mutating Asn-52 to isoleucine on the haem-linked properties of cytochrome c.	Asn-52 of rat cytochrome c and baker's yeast iso-1-cytochrome c was changed to isoleucine by site-directed mutagenesis and the mutated proteins expressed in and purified from cultures of transformed yeast. This mutation affected the affinity of the haem iron for the Met-80 sulphur in the ferric state and the reduction potential of the molecule. The yeast protein, in which the sulphur-iron bond is distinctly weaker than in vertebrate cytochromes c, became very similar to the latter: the pKa of the alkaline ionization rose from 8.3 to 9.4 and that of the acidic ionization decreased from 3.4 to 2.8. The rates of binding and dissociation of cyanide became markedly lower, and the affinity was lowered by half an order of magnitude. In the ferrous state the dissociation of cyanide from the variant yeast cytochrome c was three times slower than in the wild-type. The same mutation had analogous but less pronounced effects on rat cytochrome c: it did not alter the alkaline ionization pKa nor its affinity for cyanide, but it lowered its acidic ionization pKa from 2.8 to 2.2. These results indicate that the mutation of Asn-52 to isoleucine increases the stability of the cytochrome c closed-haem crevice as observed earlier for the mutation of Tyr-67 to phenylalanine [Luntz, Schejter, Garber and Margoliash (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 3524-3528], because of either its effects on the hydrogen-bonding of an interior water molecule or a general increase in the hydrophobicity of the protein in the domain occupied by the mutated residues. The reduction potentials were affected in different ways; the Eo of rat cytochrome c rose by 14 mV whereas that of the yeast iso-1 cychrome c was 30 mV lower as a result of the change of Asn-52 to isoleucine.

26662444	20151215	Expression of STK39 in peripheral blood of hypertension patients and the relationship between its genetic polymorphism and blood pressure.	This study investigated the STK39 expression in peripheral blood of hypertension patients and the relation between its genetic polymorphism and blood pressure. The observation group comprised of 42 primary hypertension patients admitted to our hospital, and the control group comprised of 30 healthy individuals who underwent physical examination in our hospital during the same period. Fasting venous blood was collected from both groups in the morning to determine the STK39 mRNA and protein levels in peripheral blood using quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. STK39 gene SNP (rs6433027) was sequenced using PCR and its genetic variation was analyzed. The relationship between STK39 protein level, genetic variation, and diastolic and systolic blood pressure was also analyzed. The observation group showed increased STK39 mRNA and protein levels in peripheral blood compared to the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05), suggesting C/T mutation in STK39 gene SNP (rs6433027). Correlation analysis showed positive association between STK39 protein level and diastolic and systolic blood pressure (P &lt; 0.05), indicating a positive association between C/T genetic mutation and diastolic and systolic blood pressure (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, STK39 mRNA and protein express abnormally in primary hypertension patients with genetic variation, which is related to the blood pressure. 	Genet._Mol._Res.	D016428
20101775	20100127	Lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase R620W variant and inflammatory bowel disease in Tunisia.	To assess the possible association between PTPN22 (R620W) gene polymorphism and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). One hundred and sixty-four patients with IBD [105 Crohn's disease (CD) and 59 ulcerative colitis (UC)] and 100 healthy controls were recruited. Genotyping of the PTPN22 gene 1858C--&gt;T polymorphism was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction with RsaI digestion. The genotypic and allelic frequencies of (R620W) PTPN22 gene polymorphism reveal a significant association of the PTPN22 620-W allele with IBD, compared to the healthy control group (OR: 17.81, 95% CI: 4.18-21.86, P = 0.00001). Nevertheless, no difference in this polymorphism was found between CD and UC patients. No significant association was found between the frequencies of genotypes of the PTPN22 gene with either the clinical features such as sex, age, age at disease onset, and extent of colitis, or the production of serological markers (anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody in CD and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody in UC). These observations confirm the association of IBD susceptibility with the PTPN22 1858T (620-W) allele in Tunisian patients. 	World_J._Gastroenterol.	D016428 D013485
9661642	19980714	A novel mutation affecting the interdomain link region of the growth hormone receptor in a Vietnamese girl, and response to long-term treatment with recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-I and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue.	A Vietnamese girl with Laron syndrome has been treated with recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-I for 4 yr from age 11.28 yr. Her height SD score increased from -6.3 to -4.7 without acceleration of bone age. Isolated breast development progressed despite pubertal suppression with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue, which was stopped after 3 yr because of growth deceleration. Facial coarsening was documented with serial photographs. Sequencing and in vitro analysis identified a homozygous base pair substitution in exon 6 of the proband's GH receptor (GHR), which changed amino acid 131 from proline to glutamine (P131Q) and disrupted GH binding. Both the P131Q-mutated human GHR and wildtype (wt) hGHR were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells, as demonstrated by Western blotting, but the P131Q-transfected cells did not bind 125I-hGH. Similarly, FDC-P1 cells transfected with wthGHR bound 125I-hGH with high affinity and proliferated in response to GH, whereas the P131Q hGHR cells did neither. In CHO-K1 cells cotransfected with wthGHR and the Egr-1 promotor linked to a luciferase reporter gene, GH evoked a 2.14 +/- 0.21-fold increase in luciferase activity, but there was no response in the cells carrying the P131Q hGHR mutation. From examination of the crystal structure of the GHR, we suggest that the P131Q mutation disrupts the interdomain link between the extracellular domains of the GHR, causing a conformational change that results in disruption of the GH binding site.

27184732	20160518	Establishing a murine xenograft-model for long-term analysis of factors inducing chromosomal instability in myelodysplastic syndrome: Pitfalls and successes.	Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are difficult to culture long-term showing the need of a model to study the fate of cells with MDS-abnormalities associated with chromosomal instability (CIN). This approach to establish a xenograft model transplanting human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) with different independent lentivirally-mediated MDS-related modifications into immunodeficient mice is a long-lasting and tedious experiment with many parameters and every positive as well as non-functioning intermediate step will help the research community. As the establishment of appropriate xenograft models is increasing worldwide we aim to share our experiences to contribute toward minimizing loss of mice and following the &quot;right&quot; approach. Here, modified HSCs were intrafemorally transplanted into NSG and/or NSGS mice: (1) RPS14-haploinsufficiency, (2) TP53-deficiency, (3) TP53 hotspot mutations (R248W, R175H, R273H, R249S). Engraftment was achieved and cytogenetic analyses showed human cells with normal karyotypes. However, in all experiments with NSG mice, mainly control cells or GFP-negative cells were engrafted, not allowing observation of modified HSCs. In NSGS mice, engraftment rate was higher, but mice developed graft-versus-host disease. In summary, engraftment of HSCs is promising and could be used to analyze the induction of CIN. However, the analysis of modified HSCs is limited and further experiments are required to improve this model. 	Cancer_Genet	D016428 D013485

To report the occurrence of a spontaneous pregnancy in a patient who was homozygous for the Q106R mutation in the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) gene. Case report. Reproductive endocrinology unit of an academic medical center. A 27-year-old woman who initially presented with partial idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and who achieved a spontaneous pregnancy 3 months after oral contraceptive pill (OCP) withdrawal. Blood sampling for hormonal and genetic investigations, transvaginal ultrasound. LH, FSH, E2, and betahCG serum levels. Ultrasound examination of the uterine cavity. Three months after OCP withdrawal, the patient was amenorrheic. However, the betahCG serum level was 149 IU/L. Transvaginal ultrasound 2 weeks later revealed the presence of one intrauterine sac containing two embryos with cardiac activity. At 9 weeks of gestation, no cardiac activity was found. A curettage was then performed, and the pathological examination indicated the presence of chorionic villi. OCP withdrawal might have induced a transient situation with optimal endogenous pulsatile GnRH secretion, thus overriding the GnRH resistance induced by the partially inactivating Q106R GnRHR gene mutation and allowing ovulation to occur.

17374152	20070322	Tic62: a protein family from metabolism to protein translocation.	The function and structure of protein translocons at the outer and inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts (Toc and Tic complexes, respectively) are a subject of intensive research. One of the proteins that have been ascribed to the Tic complex is Tic62. This protein was proposed as a redox sensor protein and may possibly act as a regulator during the translocation process. Tic62 is a bimodular protein that comprises an N-terminal module, responsible for binding to pyridine nucleotides, and a C-terminal module which serves as a docking site for ferredoxin-NAD(P)-oxido-reductase (FNR). This work focuses on evolutionary analysis of the Tic62-NAD(P)-related protein family, derived from the comparison of all available sequences, and discusses the structure of Tic62. Whereas the N-terminal module of Tic62 is highly conserved among all oxyphototrophs, the C-terminal region (FNR-binding module) is only found in vascular plants. Phylogenetic analyses classify four Tic62-NAD(P)-related protein subfamilies in land plants, closely related to members from cyanobacteria and green sulphur bacteria. Although most of the Tic62-NAD(P)-related eukaryotic proteins are localized in the chloroplast, one subgroup consists of proteins without a predicted transit peptide. The N-terminal module of Tic62 contains the structurally conserved Rossman fold and probably belongs to the extended family of short-chain dehydrogenases-reductases. Key residues involved in NADP-binding and residues that may attach the protein to the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts or to the Tic complex are proposed. The Tic62-NAD(P)-related proteins are of ancient origin since they are not only found in cyanobacteria but also in green sulphur bacteria. The FNR-binding module at the C-terminal region of the Tic62 proteins is probably a recent acquisition in vascular plants, with no sequence similarity to any other known motifs. The presence of the FNR-binding domain in vascular plants might be essential for the function of the protein as a Tic component and/or for its regulation. 	BMC_Evol._Biol.	D003160 D016428 D013485
9649565	19980703	Absence of polycythemia in a child with a unique erythropoietin receptor mutation in a family with autosomal dominant primary polycythemia.	Primary familial and congenital polycythemia (PFCP or familial erythrocytosis) is a rare proliferative disorder of erythroid progenitor cells, characterized by elevated erythrocyte mass and hemoglobin concentration, hypersensitivity of erythroid progenitors to erythropoietin (EPO), and autosomal dominant inheritance or sporadic occurrence. A number of EPO receptor (EPOR) mutations were found in subjects with PFCP; most of these mutations resulted in the truncation of the COOH-terminal of the EPOR protein. We studied a family with autosomal dominant inheritance of PFCP in which four subjects were affected in three generations. We screened the affected individuals for EPOR gene mutations using SSCP analysis and found a C5964G mutation in exon VIII that changes tyrosine codon 426 to a translation termination codon resulting in an EPOR protein truncated by 83 amino acids. The mutant C5964G-EPOR exhibited hypersensitive EPO-dependent proliferation compared to the wild-type EPOR when tested in a murine interleukin-3-dependent myeloid cell line (FDC-P1). We also examined the segregation of the mutation with PFCP in the family and found that a child in the third generation inherited the mutation without having laboratory evidence of polycythemia. Further in vitro analysis of the erythroid progenitor cells of this affected child revealed that the progenitor cells were hypersensitive to EPO (a hallmark of PFCP) suggesting the presence of the disease at the level of progenitor cells. Failure of this child to develop polycythemia suggests the existence of as yet unidentified environmental or genetic factors that may suppress disease development. 	J._Clin._Invest.

23662020	20130511	Effect of Casilan(?) on (13)C-caffeine metabolism in overnight-fasted healthy Nigerian children.	To determine the effect of Casilan(?) on (13)C-caffeine metabolism in healthy Nigerian children. TWELVE HEALTHY NIGERIAN CHILDREN (MALE: six, female: six) aged 3-8 years were studied on three occasions. After an overnight fast, the children were studied after ingesting Casilan(?) only (Week 1). They were restudied after ingesting 3 mg/kg of labeled caffeine only (Week 2), and further re-studied after ingesting both Casilan(?) and labeled caffeine (Week 3). Breath samples were collected by blowing via a straw into an exentainer bottle. The cumulative percentage of (13)C-caffeine exhaled as (13)CO2 was measured over 2 h. The time courses of (13)C-enrichments in exhaled CO2 for all the children, after they had ingested labeled caffeine only and after they had ingested both Casilan(?) and labeled caffeine, were identical. There was a gradual rise and peak of the enrichments at about 60-75 min, followed by a gradual fall (II) or a plateau (III). Contrarily, the time course of (13)C-enrichments for all the children was consistently low and stable after they had ingested Casilan(?) only (I). The mean values of cumulative percent (13)C-doses recovered in the CO2 exhaled over a 2-h period, after ingesting labeled caffeine only (8.59 ? 1.10 ?%/mg) and after ingesting both Casilan(?) and labeled caffeine (8.58 ? 1.33 ?%/mg), were identical, with no statistically significant difference (P = 0.972). This suggests that Casilan(?) did not affect the CYP1A2 metabolic pathway. Casilan(?) is a safe, reliable and quantitative food supplement for overnight-fasted children undergoing caffeine breath test. 	J_Pharmacol_Pharmacother	D016428

15338275	20040901	Low prevalence of MYOC mutations in UK primary open-angle glaucoma patients limits the utility of genetic testing.	Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) affects 1% of people over age 40. Early detection and treatment can prevent blindness, but the disease is often asymptomatic until a late stage. Positive family history is an important risk factor and previous studies indicate that approximately 5% of POAG results from mutations in the myocilin ( MYOC) gene, raising the possibility of identifying individuals genetically predisposed to glaucoma. We collected DNA samples from 426 unselected UK POAG patients and analyzed them for MYOC mutations. The Q368X mutation was found in six patients (1.4%). No other mutations were identified, suggesting that amongst patients unselected for family history, the prevalence of MYOC mutations in the UK is lower than in other populations. Genetic and glaucoma screening was offered to first-degree relatives of these six probands (group 1) and of age/sex-matched mutation-negative controls (group 2). Of 11 group-1 relatives, three carried Q368X, one of whom already had glaucoma. Notably, of the 13 relatives in both groups who were mutation negative, one was already being treated for ocular hypertension. We therefore caution against changing glaucoma surveillance regimens in such individuals and suggest that routine untargeted genetic testing for MYOC mutations in patients with POAG would be of limited value until additional significant genetic risk factors are identified.

8448149	19930302	Structure of an engineered, metal-actuated switch in trypsin.	The X-ray crystal structure of the copper complex of the rat trypsin mutant Arg96 to His96 (trypsin R96H) has been determined in order to ascertain the nature of the engineered metal-binding site and to understand the structural basis for the metal-induced enzymatic inhibition. In the structure, the catalytically essential His57 residue is reoriented out of the active-site pocket and forms a chelating, metal-binding site with residue His96. The copper is bound to the N epsilon 2 atoms of both histidine residues with Cu-N epsilon 2 = 2.2 A and N epsilon 2-Cu-N epsilon 2 = 89 degrees. The metal is clearly bound to a third ligand leading to a distorted square planar geometry at Cu. The X-ray results do not unambiguously yield the identity of this third ligand, but chemical data suggest that it is a deprotonated, chelating Tris molecule which was used as a carrier to solubilize the copper in alkaline solution (pH 8.0). Upon reorientation of His57, a unique water molecule moves into the active site and engages in hydrogen-bonding with Asp102-O delta 2 and His57-N delta 1. Except for small movements of the peptide backbone near His96, the remainder of the trypsin molecule is isostructural with the native enzyme. These data support the notion that the effective inhibition of catalytic activity by metal ions observed in trypsin R96H is indeed caused by a specific and reversible reorganization of the active site in the enzyme.

24596595	20140306	Genetic variants and non-genetic factors predict circulating vitamin D levels in Hispanic and non-Hispanic White women: the Breast Cancer Health Disparities Study.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common polymorphisms in or near GC, CYP2R1, CYP24A1, and NADSYN1/DHCR7 genes to be associated with circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] in European populations. To replicate these GWAS findings, we examined six selected polymorphisms from these regions and their relation with circulating 25(OH)D levels in 1,605 Hispanic women (629 U.S. Hispanics and 976 Mexicans) and 354 non-Hispanic White (NHW) women. We also assessed the potential interactions between these variants and known non-genetic predictors of 25(OH)D levels, including body mass index (BMI), sunlight exposure and vitamin D intake from diet and supplements. The minor alleles of the two GC polymorphisms (rs7041 and rs2282679) were significantly associated with lower 25(OH)D levels in both Hispanic and NHW women. The CYP2R1 polymorphism, rs2060793, also was significantly associated with 25(OH)D levels in both groups. We found no significant associations for the polymorphisms in the CYP24A1. In Hispanic controls, 25(OH)D levels were significantly associated with the rs12785878T and rs1790349G haplotype in the NADSYN1/DHCR7 region. Significant interactions between GC rs2282679 and BMI and between rs12785878 and time spent in outdoor activities were observed. These results provide further support for the contribution of common genetic variants to individual variability in circulating 25(OH)D levels. The observed interactions between SNPs and non-genetic factors warrant confirmation. 	Int_J_Mol_Epidemiol_Genet	D016428
23533327	20130328	Microbial diversity and biochemical potential encoded by thermal spring metagenomes derived from the Kamchatka Peninsula.	Volcanic regions contain a variety of environments suitable for extremophiles. This study was focused on assessing and exploiting the prokaryotic diversity of two microbial communities derived from different Kamchatkian thermal springs by metagenomic approaches. Samples were taken from a thermoacidophilic spring near the Mutnovsky Volcano and from a thermophilic spring in the Uzon Caldera. Environmental DNA for metagenomic analysis was isolated from collected sediment samples by direct cell lysis. The prokaryotic community composition was examined by analysis of archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA genes. A total number of 1235 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained and used for taxonomic classification. Most abundant in the samples were members of Thaumarchaeota, Thermotogae, and Proteobacteria. The Mutnovsky hot spring was dominated by the Terrestrial Hot Spring Group, Kosmotoga, and Acidithiobacillus. The Uzon Caldera was dominated by uncultured members of the Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotic Group and Enterobacteriaceae. The remaining 16S rRNA gene sequences belonged to the Aquificae, Dictyoglomi, Euryarchaeota, Korarchaeota, Thermodesulfobacteria, Firmicutes, and some potential new phyla. In addition, the recovered DNA was used for generation of metagenomic libraries, which were subsequently mined for genes encoding lipolytic and proteolytic enzymes. Three novel genes conferring lipolytic and one gene conferring proteolytic activity were identified. 	Archaea	D016428 D013485
14566051	20031021	Mutations in human complement regulator, membrane cofactor protein (CD46), predispose to development of familial hemolytic uremic syndrome.	Membrane cofactor protein (MCP; CD46) is a widely expressed transmembrane complement regulator. Like factor H it inhibits complement activation by regulating C3b deposition on targets. Factor H mutations occur in 10-20% of patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). We hypothesized that MCP mutations could predispose to HUS, and we sequenced MCP coding exons in affected individuals from 30 families. MCP mutations were detected in affected individuals of three families: a deletion of two amino acids (D237/S238) in family 1 (heterozygous) and a substitution, S206P, in families 2 (heterozygous) and 3 (homozygous). We evaluated protein expression and function in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from these individuals. An individual with the D237/S238 deletion had reduced MCP levels and approximately 50% C3b binding compared with normal controls. Individuals with the S206P change expressed normal quantities of protein, but demonstrated approximately 50% reduction in C3b binding in heterozygotes and complete lack of C3b binding in homozygotes. MCP expression and function was evaluated in transfectants reproducing these mutations. The deletion mutant was retained intracellularly. S206P protein was expressed on the cell surface but had a reduced ability to prevent complement activation, consistent with its reduced C3b binding and cofactor activity. This study presents further evidence that complement dysregulation predisposes to development of thrombotic microangiopathy and that screening patients for such defects could provide informed treatment strategies.

25863041	20150412	Lipoprotein lipase deficiency: clinical, biochemical and molecular characteristics in three patients with novel mutations in the LPL gene.	Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency, caused by mutations in the LPL gene, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder manifesting in early childhood with recurrent abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, acute pancreatitis, lipaemia retinalis and eruptive xanthomas. Typical laboratory findings are lactescent serum, extreme hypertriglyceridaemia and hypercholesterolaemia. The diagnostics is based on postheparin serum LPL assay and DNA analyses of the LPL gene. We report clinical, biochemical and molecular data of three children with LPL deficiency. One child manifested since the first week of life with recurrent abdominal pain (Patient 1), the second with abdominal distension and hepatosplenomegaly since the second month of life (Patient 3) and patient 2, asymptomatic younger brother of patient 1, was diagnosed in the first week of life. Lipaemia retinalis and splenomegaly were present in two symptomatic children, hepatomegaly in patient 3 and acute pancreatitis in patient 1. All children had lactescent serum, profound hypertriglyceridaemia (124 ? 25 mmol/l; controls &lt; 2.2), hypercholesterolaemia (22.8 ? 7.3 mmol/l, controls &lt; 4.2) and their LPL immunoreactive mass in serum did not increase after heparin injection. Molecular analyses revealed that both siblings are homozygous for novel mutation c.476C &gt; G in the LPL gene changing the conserved amino acid of the catalytic centre. The third patient is a compound heterozygote for mutations c.604G&gt;A and c.698A&gt;G in the LPL gene, both affecting highly conserved amino acids. We conclude that LPL deficiency must be considered in neonates and young infants with abdominal pain and hypertriglyceridaemia because early treatment might prevent development of life-threatening acute pancreatitis.

17434710	20070417	Characterization of the P373L E-cadherin germline missense mutation and implication for clinical management.	Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is a cancer susceptibility syndrome caused by E-cadherin germline mutations. One-third of these mutations are of the missense type, representing a burden in genetic counselling. A new germline missense mutation (P373L) was recently identified in a HDGC Italian family. The present work aimed at addressing the disease-causative nature of the P373L mutant. Assessment of the P373L mutation effect was based on cell aggregation and invasion assays. LOH analysis at the E-cadherin locus, search for somatic E-cadherin mutations and for promoter hypermethylation were performed to identify the mechanism of inactivation of the E-cadherin wild-type allele in the tumour. In vitro the P373L germline mutation impaired the E-cadherin functions. E-cadherin promoter hypermethylation was observed in the tumour of the P373L mutation carrier. We conclude that the combination of clinical, in vitro and molecular genetic data is helpful for establishing an accurate analysis of HDGC-associated CDH1 germline missense mutations and subsequently for appropriate clinical management of asymptomatic mutation carriers.

19488068	20090603	PTGS2-899G&gt;C and prostate cancer risk: a population-based nested case-control study (ProtecT) and a systematic review with meta-analysis.	Prostaglandin endoperoxidase synthase 2 is a key regulator of inflammation and may play a role in prostate carcinogenesis. The polymorphism, -899G&gt;C (rs20417), alters a transcription factor-binding site and is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal adenoma. We tested the hypothesis that rs20417 may influence prostate cancer risk, using a large case-control study (n(cases)=1608, n(controls)=3058). We found no evidence that rs20417 alters prostate cancer risk (odds ratio (OR(CC &amp; GC v GG)=1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.91-1.20). A meta-analysis of three studies also found little evidence that rs20417 alters risk (pooled OR(CC &amp; GC v GG)=1.04, 95% CI=0.93-1.17), making it unlikely that rs20417 contributes in any major way to prostate cancer aetiology.

12821644	20030625	A network of transcriptional and signaling events is activated by FGF to induce chondrocyte growth arrest and differentiation.	Activating mutations in FGF receptor 3 (FGFR3) cause several human dwarfism syndromes by affecting both chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. Using microarray and biochemical analyses of FGF-treated rat chondrosarcoma chondrocytes, we show that FGF inhibits chondrocyte proliferation by initiating multiple pathways that result in the induction of antiproliferative functions and the down-regulation of growth-promoting molecules. The initiation of growth arrest is characterized by the rapid dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) p107 and repression of a subset of E2F target genes by a mechanism that is independent of cyclin E-Cdk inhibition. In contrast, hypophosphorylation of pRb and p130 occur after growth arrest is first detected, and may contribute to its maintenance. Importantly, we also find a number of gene expression changes indicating that FGF promotes many aspects of hypertrophic differentiation, a notion supported by in situ analysis of developing growth plates from mice expressing an activated form of FGFR3. Thus, FGF may coordinate the onset of differentiation with chondrocyte growth arrest in the developing growth plate. 	J._Cell_Biol.	D016428 D013487
7930260	19941101	Intracardiac echocardiography during radiofrequency catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias in humans.	The purpose of this study was to describe our preliminary experience using catheter-based intracardiac echocardiography as an adjunct to biplane fluoroscopy for guiding radiofrequency catheter ablation of atrial arrhythmias in the right side of the heart. Catheter ablation requires precise positioning and stable ablation electrode-endocardial contact. This procedure is currently guided by an analysis of intracardiac electrograms and fluoroscopy. However, the use of fluoroscopy does not allow the endocardium and certain anatomic landmarks to be identified and is associated with the hazards of radiation exposure. Seventeen symptomatic patients were studied. A 10F 10-MHz intracardiac imaging catheter was used to visualize specific anatomic landmarks in the right atrium for directing the ablation electrode in 15 patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation of 19 arrhythmias and to assist with interatrial septal puncture in 3 patients. Continuous intracardiac imaging was performed for a mean +/- SD of 63.6 +/- 39.2 min and demonstrated distal electrode-endocardial tissue contact in 81 (60%) of 134 radiofrequency applications. Movement of the catheter was demonstrated during 36 (44%), microcavitations during 39 (48%) and thrombus during 15 (19%) of the 81 imaged applications. In 7 of 10 procedures for atrial flutter, successful ablation was directed at anatomic corridors in the right atrium visualized with intracardiac echocardiography. During ablation of atrial tachycardia, imaging identified abnormal atrial anatomy related to previous surgery and guided successful ablation of a reentrant tachycardia circulating around these anatomic obstacles. In two procedures for slow pathway modification of atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia, intracardiac echocardiography confirmed catheter stability at the tricuspid annulus anterior to the coronary sinus. During catheter ablation, intracardiac echocardiography augments fluoroscopy by visualizing anatomic landmarks, ensuring stable endocardial contact and assisting in transseptal puncture. Ablation of typical atrial flutter can be successfully directed at anatomic corridors identified using intracardiac imaging. 	J._Am._Coll._Cardiol.	D016430 D016428 D013485
19144360	20090116	Leigh-like syndrome with the T8993G mutation in the mitochondrial ATPase 6 gene: long-term follow-up discloses a slowly progressive course.	We describe the long-term clinical outcome of a patient with Leigh-like syndrome presenting as an early onset encephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy caused by the T8993G mutation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Clinical follow-up for 20 years revealed a peculiar pattern of slow disease progression, characterized by the addition of new minor deficits, while worsening of previous symptoms was mild. Brain MRI revealed cerebellar atrophy, diffuse demyelination of corona radiata and parietal white matter, and bilateral and symmetrical putaminal lesions. The proportion of mutant mtDNAs in blood was 72% (+/-0.02%) and in skeletal muscle was 81% (+/-0.4%). Leigh-like syndrome caused by the T8993G mtDNA mutation is a progressive disease, although not necessarily associated with an aggressive clinical course. 	J._Neurol._Sci.	D002363 D016428 D013485
26382239	20150919	Evidence for Reduced Drug Susceptibility without Emergence of Major Protease Mutations following Protease Inhibitor Monotherapy Failure in the SARA Trial.	Major protease mutations are rarely observed following failure with protease inhibitors (PI), and other viral determinants of failure to PI are poorly understood. We therefore characterized Gag-Protease phenotypic susceptibility in subtype A and D viruses circulating in East Africa following viral rebound on PIs. Samples from baseline and treatment failure in patients enrolled in the second line LPV/r trial SARA underwent phenotypic susceptibility testing. Data were expressed as fold-change in susceptibility relative to a LPV-susceptible reference strain. We cloned 48 Gag-Protease containing sequences from seven individuals and performed drug resistance phenotyping from pre-PI and treatment failure timepoints in seven patients. For the six patients where major protease inhibitor resistance mutations did not emerge, mean fold-change EC50 to LPV was 4.07 fold (95% CI, 2.08-6.07) at the pre-PI timepoint. Following viral failure the mean fold-change in EC50 to LPV was 4.25 fold (95% CI, 1.39-7.11, p = 0.91). All viruses remained susceptible to DRV. In our assay system, the major PI resistance mutation I84V, which emerged in one individual, conferred a 10.5-fold reduction in LPV susceptibility. One of the six patients exhibited a significant reduction in susceptibility between pre-PI and failure timepoints (from 4.7 fold to 9.6 fold) in the absence of known major mutations in protease, but associated with changes in Gag: V7I, G49D, R69Q, A120D, Q127K, N375S and I462S. Phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of the emergence of genetically distinct viruses at the time of treatment failure, indicating ongoing viral evolution in Gag-protease under PI pressure. Here we observe in one patient the development of significantly reduced susceptibility conferred by changes in Gag which may have contributed to treatment failure on a protease inhibitor containing regimen. Further phenotype-genotype studies are required to elucidate genetic determinants of protease inhibitor failure in those who fail without traditional resistance mutations whilst PI use is being scaled up globally.

10082117	19990319	Frequency of a mutated CCR-5 allele (delta32) among Italian healthy donors and individuals at risk of parenteral HIV infection.	The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of a truncated allele of the CCR-5 gene (delta32) in Italy, and address its possible role in parenteral HIV transmission, as well as its influence in HIV-associated disease progression. In 371 unrelated seronegative healthy blood donors the delta32 allele frequency was 0.047; this figure was significantly different from those reported in northern America and northern Europe populations. However, delta32 allele frequency in healthy individuals did not differ significantly from that found in 54 seronegative drug users (0.065), 98 seronegative hemophiliacs (0.051), and 81 seropositive hemophiliacs (0.049). Although in seropositive hemophiliacs the wt/delta32 heterozygous genotype was associated with a trend to a slower decline in CD4+ cell counts, its presence did not seem to influence disease progression, as comparable delta32 allele frequency frequencies were found among progressing (0.042) and nonprogressing (0.111) patients. These data do not seem to support a protective role of the delta32 allele in preventing HIV infection through the parenteral route, or in influencing the natural history of the disease in this particular risk category, although the delta32 heterozygous state was associated with lower plasma viremia levels. On the other hand, the finding of non-syncytium-inducing HIV strains in the majority of delta32 heterozygous seropositive patients suggests that its presence could not be a major factor in driving a switch toward more cytopathic, T-tropic HIV strains through selective pressure in coreceptor usage.

Cavernous malformations (CMs) of the central nervous system can occur in a sporadic condition or as a familial form with an autosomal-dominant inherited pattern. Apart from a family history, some clinical features may help to identify familial CMs. We demonstrate clinical, neuroradiological, pathological, and genetic data of a patient with cerebral and spinal CMs. The presence of multiple cerebral CMs and distinct cutaneous vascular lesions, including hyperkeratotic cutaneous capillary-venous malformations, in this patient suggested familial CMs. A genetic study confirmed a nonsense mutation (c.1708A&gt;T) in the KRIT1 gene.

22415877	20120315	No interactions between previously associated 2-hour glucose gene variants and physical activity or BMI on 2-hour glucose levels.	Gene-lifestyle interactions have been suggested to contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. Glucose levels 2 h after a standard 75-g glucose challenge are used to diagnose diabetes and are associated with both genetic and lifestyle factors. However, whether these factors interact to determine 2-h glucose levels is unknown. We meta-analyzed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) ? BMI and SNP ? physical activity (PA) interaction regression models for five SNPs previously associated with 2-h glucose levels from up to 22 studies comprising 54,884 individuals without diabetes. PA levels were dichotomized, with individuals below the first quintile classified as inactive (20%) and the remainder as active (80%). BMI was considered a continuous trait. Inactive individuals had higher 2-h glucose levels than active individuals (? = 0.22 mmol/L [95% CI 0.13-0.31], P = 1.63 ? 10(-6)). All SNPs were associated with 2-h glucose (? = 0.06-0.12 mmol/allele, P ? 1.53 ? 10(-7)), but no significant interactions were found with PA (P &gt; 0.18) or BMI (P ? 0.04). In this large study of gene-lifestyle interaction, we observed no interactions between genetic and lifestyle factors, both of which were associated with 2-h glucose. It is perhaps unlikely that top loci from genome-wide association studies will exhibit strong subgroup-specific effects, and may not, therefore, make the best candidates for the study of interactions.

26014357	20150528	Modeling of interaction between cytochrome c and the WD domains of Apaf-1: bifurcated salt bridges underlying apoptosome assembly.	Binding of cytochrome c, released from the damaged mitochondria, to the apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) is a key event in the apoptotic signaling cascade. The binding triggers a major domain rearrangement in Apaf-1, which leads to oligomerization of Apaf-1/cytochrome c complexes into an apoptosome. Despite the availability of crystal structures of cytochrome c and Apaf-1 and cryo-electron microscopy models of the entire apoptosome, the binding mode of cytochrome c to Apaf-1, as well as the nature of the amino acid residues of Apaf-1 involved remain obscure. We investigated the interaction between cytochrome c and Apaf-1 by combining several modeling approaches. We have applied protein-protein docking and energy minimization, evaluated the resulting models of the Apaf-1/cytochrome c complex, and carried out a further analysis by means of molecular dynamics simulations. We ended up with a single model structure where all the lysine residues of cytochrome c that are known as functionally-relevant were involved in forming salt bridges with acidic residues of Apaf-1. This model has revealed three distinctive bifurcated salt bridges, each involving a single lysine residue of cytochrome c and two neighboring acidic resides of Apaf-1. Salt bridge-forming amino acids of Apaf-1 showed a clear evolutionary pattern within Metazoa, with pairs of acidic residues of Apaf-1, involved in bifurcated salt bridges, reaching their highest numbers in the sequences of vertebrates, in which the cytochrome c-mediated mechanism of apoptosome formation seems to be typical. The reported model of an Apaf-1/cytochrome c complex provides insights in the nature of protein-protein interactions which are hard to observe in crystallographic or electron microscopy studies. Bifurcated salt bridges can be expected to be stronger than simple salt bridges, and their formation might promote the conformational change of Apaf-1, leading to the formation of an apoptosome. Combination of structural and sequence analyses provides hints on the evolution of the cytochrome c-mediated apoptosis. 	Biol._Direct	D016428 D013485
20689571	20100807	Combinatory cytotoxic effects produced by E1B-55kDa-deleted adenoviruses and chemotherapeutic agents are dependent on the agents in esophageal carcinoma.	We examined possible combinatory antitumor effects of replication-competent type 5 adenoviruses (Ad) lacking E1B-55kDa molecules (Ad-delE1B55) and chemotherapeutic agents in nine human esophageal carcinoma cells. Ad-delE1B55 produced cytotoxic effects on all the carcinoma cells and the cytotoxicity is not directly linked with the p53 status of the tumors or with the infectivity to respective tumors. A combinatory treatment with Ad-delE1B55 and an anticancer agent, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), mitomycin C or etoposide, produced greater cytotoxic effects than that with either the Ad or the agent. Administration of 5-FU could minimally inhibit the viral replication and a simultaneous treatment with the Ad and 5-FU achieved better cytotoxicity than sequential treatments. We also confirmed the antitumor effects by the combination of Ad-delE1B55 with 5-FU in vivo. Cisplatin, however, did not achieve the combinatory effects in most of the cells tested. These data indicate that the Ad-delE1B55 produce combinatory antitumor effects with a chemotherapeutic agent irrespective of the administration schedule, but the effects depend on an agent in esophageal carcinoma.

16914447	20060818	Structural basis of yeast aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex formation revealed by crystal structures of two binary sub-complexes.	The yeast aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) complex is formed by the methionyl- and glutamyl-tRNA synthetases (MetRS and GluRS, respectively) and the tRNA aminoacylation cofactor Arc1p. It is considered an evolutionary intermediate between prokaryotic aaRS and the multi- aaRS complex found in higher eukaryotes. While a wealth of structural information is available on the enzymatic domains of single aaRS, insight into complex formation between eukaryotic aaRS and associated protein cofactors is missing. Here we report crystal structures of the binary complexes between the interacting domains of Arc1p and MetRS as well as those of Arc1p and GluRS at resolutions of 2.2 and 2.05 A, respectively. The data provide a complete structural model for ternary complex formation between the interacting domains of MetRS, GluRS and Arc1p. The structures reveal that all three domains adopt a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-like fold and that simultaneous interaction of Arc1p with GluRS and MetRS is mediated by the use of a novel interface in addition to a classical GST dimerization interaction. The results demonstrate a novel role for this fold as a heteromerization domain specific to eukaryotic aaRS, associated proteins and protein translation elongation factors. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.

27189965	20160519	Ethanol Tolerance Affects Endogenous Adenosine Signaling in Mouse Hippocampus.	Ethanol has many pharmacological effects, including increases in endogenous adenosine levels and adenosine receptor activity in brain. Ethanol consumption is associated with both positive and negative health outcomes, but tolerance to the behavioral effects of ethanol can lead to increased consumption, which increases the risk of negative health outcomes. The present study was performed to test whether a 7-day treatment with ethanol is linked to reduced adenosine signaling and whether this is a consequence of reduced ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity. Wild-type (CD73(+/+)) and ecto-5'-nucleotidase-deficient (CD73(-/-)) mice were treated with ethanol (2 g/kg) or saline for 7 days. In CD73(+/+) mice, repeated ethanol treatment reduced the hypothermic and ataxic effects of acute ethanol, indicating the development of tolerance to the acute effects of ethanol. In CD73(+/+) mice, this 7-day ethanol treatment led to increased hippocampal synaptic activity and reduced adenosine A1 receptor activity under both basal and low Mg(2+) conditions. These effects of ethanol tolerance were associated with an 18% decrease in activity of ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity in hippocampal cell membranes. In contrast, ethanol treatment was not associated with changes in synaptic activity or adenosine signaling in hippocampus from CD73(-/-) mice. These data indicate that ethanol treatment is associated with a reduction in adenosine signaling through adenosine A1 receptors in hippocampus, mediated, at least in part, via reduced ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity.

23985319	20130830	Dissociation of the H3K36 demethylase Rph1 from chromatin mediates derepression of environmental stress-response genes under genotoxic stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	Cells respond to environmental signals by altering gene expression through transcription factors. Rph1 is a histone demethylase containing a Jumonji C (JmjC) domain and belongs to the C(2)H(2) zinc-finger protein family. Here we investigate the regulatory network of Rph1 in yeast by expression microarray analysis. More than 75% of Rph1-regulated genes showed increased expression in the rph1-deletion mutant, suggesting that Rph1 is mainly a transcriptional repressor. The binding motif 5'-CCCCTWA-3', which resembles the stress response element, is overrepresented in the promoters of Rph1-repressed genes. A significant proportion of Rph1-regulated genes respond to DNA damage and environmental stress. Rph1 is a labile protein, and Rad53 negatively modulates Rph1 protein level. We find that the JmjN domain is important in maintaining protein stability and the repressive effect of Rph1. Rph1 is directly associated with the promoter region of targeted genes and dissociated from chromatin before transcriptional derepression on DNA damage and oxidative stress. Of interest, the master stress-activated regulator Msn2 also regulates a subset of Rph1-repressed genes under oxidative stress. Our findings confirm the regulatory role of Rph1 as a transcriptional repressor and reveal that Rph1 might be a regulatory node connecting different signaling pathways responding to environmental stresses.

15001545	20040306	Pancreas duodenum homeobox-1 transcriptional activation requires interactions with p300.	The homeodomain transcription factor, pancreas duodenum homeobox (PDX)-1, is essential for pancreas development, insulin production, and glucose homeostasis. Mutations in pdx-1(ipf-1) are associated both with maturity-onset diabetes of the young and type 2 diabetes. PDX-1 interacts with multiple transcription factors and coregulators, including the coactivator p300, to activate the transcription of the insulin gene and other target genes within pancreatic beta-cells. In characterizing the protein-protein interactions of PDX-1 and p300, we identified mutations in PDX-1 that disrupt its function and are associated with increased or decreased interactions with p300. Several mutant PDX-1 proteins that are associated with heritable forms of diabetes in humans, in particular the mutant P63fsdelC, exhibited increased binding to a carboxy-terminal segment of p300 in the setting of decreased DNA-binding activities, suggesting that sequestration of p300 by mutant PDX-1 proteins may be an additional mechanism by which insulin gene expression is reduced in heterozygous carriers of pdx-1(ipf-1) mutations. The introduction of the point mutations S66A/Y68A in the highly conserved amino-terminal PDX-1 transactivation domain reduced the ability of PDX-1 to interact with p300, substantially diminished the transcriptional activation of PDX-1, and reduced the synergistic activation of glucose-responsive insulin promoter enhancer sequences by PDX-1, E12, and E47. We propose that interactions of PDX-1 with p300 are required for the transcriptional activation of PDX-1 target genes. Impairment of interactions between PDX-1 and p300 in pancreatic beta-cells may limit insulin production and lead to the development of diabetes. 	Endocrinology	D016428 D013485 D013487
16364203	20051221	Evaluation of the ELOVL4 gene in a Chinese family with autosomal dominant STGD3-like macular dystrophy.	Stargardt disease-3 (STGD3) is an autosomal dominant juvenile-onset macular dystrophy characterized by progressive decreasing visual acuity, bilateral atrophic changes in the macula and absence of characteristic dark choroids. We identified a STGD3-like macular dystrophy pedigree by clinical examination. To explore whether the STGD3-like phenotype in the kindred is linked to ELOVL4 gene or associated with any other identified STGD gene, we extracted genomic DNA from leukocytes of peripheral blood from the available family members and 50 normal controls for mutation analysis. Then the exons of ELOVL4, RDS and the three exons of ABCR were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All PCR products were screened for mutations by combination of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) analysis and DNA sequencing. No mutation was found in the exons of three candidate genes, but we obtained three non-pathogenic polymorphisms, IVS5-2533T--&gt;A in ELOVL4, 558C--&gt;T (Val106Val) and 1150G--&gt;C (Glu304Gln) in RDS. And IVS5-2533T--&gt;A is never shown in the previous references. These data suggested that there exist other unknown genes responsible for the STGD3-like phenotype in the pedigree.

27175028	20160514	Antiplatelet therapy versus observation in low-risk essential thrombocythemia with a CALR mutation.	The role of antiplatelet therapy as primary prophylaxis of thrombosis in low-risk essential thrombocythemia has not been studied in randomized clinical trials. We assessed the benefit/risk of low-dose aspirin in 433 patients with low-risk essential thrombocythemia (271 with a CALR mutation, 162 with a JAK2(V617F) mutation) who were on antiplatelet therapy or observation only. After a follow up of 2215 person-years free from cytoreduction, 25 thrombotic and 17 bleeding episodes were recorded. In CALR-mutated patients, antiplatelet therapy did not affect the risk of thrombosis but was associated with a higher incidence of bleeding (12.9 versus 1.8 episodes per 1000 patient-years, P=0.03). In JAK2(V617F)-mutated patients, low-dose aspirin was associated with a reduced incidence of venous thrombosis with no effect on the risk of bleeding. Coexistence of JAK2(V617F)-mutation and cardiovascular risk factors increased the risk of thrombosis, even after adjusting for treatment with low-dose aspirin (incidence rate ratio: 9.8; 95% confidence interval: 2.3-42.3; P=0.02). Time free from cytoreduction was significantly shorter in CALR-mutated patients with essential thrombocythemia than in JAK2(V617F)-mutated ones (median time 5 years and 9.8 years, respectively; P=0.0002) and cytoreduction was usually necessary to control extreme thrombocytosis. In conclusion, in patients with low-risk, CALR-mutated essential thrombocythemia, low-dose aspirin does not reduce the risk of thrombosis and may increase the risk of bleeding.

20484372	20100521	The dimerization domain of SOX9 is required for transcription activation of a chondrocyte-specific chromatin DNA template.	Mutations in SOX9, a gene essential for chondrocyte differentiation cause the human disease campomelic dysplasia (CD). To understand how SOX9 activates transcription, we characterized the DNA binding and cell-free transcription ability of wild-type SOX9 and a dimerization domain SOX9 mutant. Whereas formation of monomeric mutant SOX9-DNA complex increased linearly with increasing SOX9 concentrations, formation of a wild-type SOX9-DNA dimeric complex increased more slowly suggesting a more sigmoidal-type progression. Stability of SOX9-DNA complexes, however, was unaffected by the dimerization mutation. Both wild-type and mutant SOX9 activated transcription of a naked Col2a1 DNA template. However, after nucleosomal assembly, only wild-type and not the mutant was able to remodel chromatin and activate transcription of this template. Using a cell line, in which the Col2a1 vector was stably integrated, no differences were seen in the interactions of wild-type and mutant SOX9 with the chromatin of the Col2a1 vector using ChIP. However, the mutant was unable to activate transcription in agreement with in vitro results. We hypothesize that the SOX9 dimerization domain is necessary to remodel the Col2a1 chromatin in order to allow transcription to take place. These results further clarify the mechanism that accounts for CD in patients harboring SOX9 dimerization domain mutations. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D052061 D013485
20182747	20100226	Analysis of the indel at the ARMS2 3'UTR in age-related macular degeneration.	Controversy remains as to which gene at the chromosome 10q26 locus confers risk for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and statistical genetic analysis is confounded by the strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) across the region. Functional analysis of related genetic variations could solve this puzzle. Recently, Fritsche et al. reported that AMD is associated with unstable ARMS2 transcripts possibly caused by a complex insertion/deletion (indel; consisting of a 443 bp deletion and an adjacent 54 bp insertion) in its 3'UTR (untranslated region). To validate this indel, we sequenced our samples. We found that this indel is even more complex and is composed of two side-by-side indels separated by 17 bp: (1) 9 bp deletion with 10 bp insertion; (2) 417 bp deletion with 27 bp insertion. The indel is significantly associated with the risk of AMD, but is also in strong LD with the non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism rs10490924 (A69S). We also found that ARMS2 is expressed not only in placenta and retina but also in multiple human tissues. Using quantitative PCR, we found no correlation between the indel and ARMS2 mRNA level in human retina and blood samples. The lack of functional effects of the 3'UTR indel, the amino acid substitution of rs10490924 (A69S), and strong LD between them suggest that A69S, not the indel, is the variant that confers risk of AMD. To our knowledge, it is the first time it has been shown that ARMS2 is widely expressed in human tissues. Conclusively, the indel at 3'UTR of ARMS2 actually contains two side-by-side indels. The indels are associated with risk of AMD, but not correlated with ARMS2 mRNA level. 	Hum._Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013485
24031537	20130914	Effects of myrcia ovata cambess. Essential oil on planktonic growth of gastrointestinal microorganisms and biofilm formation of enterococcus faecalis.	The essential oil from the leaves of Myrcia ovata Cambess., commonly used in Brazil for the treatment of gastric illnesses, was screened for antimicrobial activity and action in the formation of microbial biofilms by Enterococcus faecalis. The oil was obtained by hydrodistillation using a clevenger-type system. Its chemical composition was analyzed using GC and GC-MS. Both MIC and MBC of the essential oil were determined by broth microdilution techniques and agar dilution method. The essential oil showed antimicrobial activity against E. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella choleraesuis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Candida parapsilosis. The results showed that the essential oil of M. ovata Cambess. was effective against the formation of biofilm by E. faecalis when compared with the control. Four volatile compounds, representing 92.1 % of the oil, were identified and geranial was the major component (50.4 %). At the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from leaves of M. ovata. 	Braz._J._Microbiol.	D016428
19721697	20090902	REV-ERBalpha participates in circadian SREBP signaling and bile acid homeostasis.	In mammals, many aspects of behavior and physiology, and in particular cellular metabolism, are coordinated by the circadian timing system. Molecular clocks are thought to rely on negative feedback loops in clock gene expression that engender oscillations in the accumulation of transcriptional regulatory proteins, such as the orphan receptor REV-ERBalpha. Circadian transcription factors then drive daily rhythms in the expression of clock-controlled output genes, for example genes encoding enzymes and regulators of cellular metabolism. To gain insight into clock output functions of REV-ERBalpha, we carried out genome-wide transcriptome profiling experiments with liver RNA from wild-type mice, Rev-erbalpha knock-out mice, or REV-ERBalpha overexpressing mice. On the basis of these genetic loss- and gain-of-function experiments, we concluded that REV-ERBalpha participates in the circadian modulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) activity, and thereby in the daily expression of SREBP target genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. This control is exerted via the cyclic transcription of Insig2, encoding a trans-membrane protein that sequesters SREBP proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membranes and thereby interferes with the proteolytic activation of SREBPs in Golgi membranes. REV-ERBalpha also participates in the cyclic expression of cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme in converting cholesterol to bile acids. Our findings suggest that this control acts via the stimulation of LXR nuclear receptors by cyclically produced oxysterols. In conclusion, our study suggests that rhythmic cholesterol and bile acid metabolism is not just driven by alternating feeding-fasting cycles, but also by REV-ERBalpha, a component of the circadian clockwork circuitry.

24045016	20130919	Phase II trial of customized first line chemotherapy according to ERCC1 and RRM1 SNPs in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.	Customized chemotherapy has several advantages: patients are more likely to be treated with the most effective agents and can be spared the toxicity of ineffective drugs. Based on the literature, excision repair cross complementation group 1 (ERCC1) and ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) genes represent predictive biomarkers of response to platinum compound and gemcitabine, in NSCLC. We had planned a phase II trial (Simon design) to evaluate combination chemotherapy according to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ERCC1 (118T/C and 8092C/A) and RRM1 (-37C/A and -524T/C) in na?ve patients affected by advanced NSCLC. ERCC1 and RRM1 SNPs assessment was performed in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). Combination chemotherapy was selected based on ERCC1 and RRM1 SNPs: we assume that patients with one or two C alleles at position 118 and with one or two A alleles at position 8092 in ERCC1 gene would correspond to Cisplatin non-responder and than with two A alleles at -37 and two C alleles at -524 in RRM1 gene to gemcitabine non-responder. Four schedules were provided: cisplatin+gemcitabine, cisplatin+docetaxel, gemcitabine+docetaxel; docetaxel+vinorelbine. Primary endpoint was overall response (ORR) in the intention-to-treat population. 42 patients were enrolled from January 2010 to November 2011; 40 patients received at least 1 cycle of chemotherapy; median age was 66 years (range: 47-72); 36(90%) had stage IV, 4(10%) IIIB; 23(58%) had adenocarcinoma, 14(35%) squamous carcinoma. Twenty-five (62%) patients received treatment A, 3(8%) treatment B, 11(28%) treatment C, 1(23%) treatment D. ORR was 55%, analysis in squamous patients subgroups showed 71.4% ORR. The median follow-up was 19.7 months, PFS was 23 weeks (95% CI = 15-26) and OS was 40.4 weeks (95% CI = 32-55). Treatment was well tolerated. We observed an increase of ORR in NSCLC patients when they were treated with chemotherapy according to ERCC1 and RRM1 SNPs status. 	Lung_Cancer	D017427 D016428 D016448
21637442	20110604	Hb H disease resulting from the association of an ?-thalassemia allele [-(?)] with an unstable ?-globin variant [Hb Icaria]: First report on the occurrence in Brazil.	Hb H Disease is caused by the loss or inactivation of three of the four functional ?-globin genes. Patients present chronic hemolytic anemia and splenomegaly. In some cases, occasional blood transfusions are required. Deletions are the main cause of this type of thalassemia ( ?-thalassemia). We describe here an unusual case of Hb H disease caused by the combination of a common ?(0) deletion [-( ?) (20.5) ] with a rare point mutation (c.427T &gt; A), thus resulting in an elongated and unstable ?-globin variant, Hb Icaria, (X142K), with 31 additional amino-acid residues. Very high levels of Hb H and Hb Bart's were detected in the patient's red blood cells (14.7 and 19.0%, respectively). This is the first description of this infrequent association in the Brazilian population. 	Genet._Mol._Biol.	D016428
23167931	20121122	Association between single nucleotide polymorphism of PD-L1 gene and non-small cell lung cancer susceptibility in a Chinese population.	To evaluate the correlation between a polymorphism of PD-L1 gene and the susceptibility of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a Chinese population. A total of 293 Chinese patients with NSCLC and 293 age and sex matched controls of the same ethnic origin were enrolled in this study. A/C polymorphism at position 8923 in intron 4 of PD-L1 gene was typed using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method (PCR-RFLP). The interactions between A/C genotype, allele frequency and NSCLC susceptibility were analyzed. The A/C genotype frequencies were significantly different between NSCLC patients and controls. The AC and CC frequencies were higher in NSCLC patients than in controls (16.4 vs 8.9%, 1.0 vs 0.3%, respectively). The C-allele frequency was higher in NSCLC patients than in controls (9.2 vs 4.8%). Significant differences in the A and C allele frequencies were noted between the two groups (?(2)?=?8.864, P?=?0.003). More risk of NSCLC was found in individuals carrying the C allele than in those carrying the A allele (OR?=?2.203; 95%?CI 1.262-3.242). In both light smokers (?20 pack-years) and heavy smokers (&gt;20 pack-years), individuals carrying the C-allele had more risk of NSCLC than those carrying the A-allele (light smokers OR?=?1.847, 95%?CI 1.001-3.409; heavy smokers OR?=?3.252, 95%?CI 1.196-8.845, respectively). An A/C polymorphism at position 8923 in the PD-L1 gene is associated with NSCLC susceptibility. The PD-L1 polymorphism plays a role in NSCLC, especially in patients with the C-allele.

25226600	20140917	Distinct ETA receptor binding mode of macitentan as determined by site directed mutagenesis.	The competitive endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA) bosentan and ambrisentan, which have long been approved for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, are characterized by very short (1 min) occupancy half-lives at the ET(A) receptor. The novel ERA macitentan, displays a 20-fold increased receptor occupancy half-life, causing insurmountable antagonism of ET-1-induced signaling in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells. We show here that the slow ET(A) receptor dissociation rate of macitentan was shared with a set of structural analogs, whereas compounds structurally related to bosentan displayed fast dissociation kinetics. NMR analysis showed that macitentan adopts a compact structure in aqueous solution and molecular modeling suggests that this conformation tightly fits into a well-defined ET(A) receptor binding pocket. In contrast the structurally different and negatively charged bosentan-type molecules only partially filled this pocket and expanded into an extended endothelin binding site. To further investigate these different ET(A) receptor-antagonist interaction modes, we performed functional studies using ET(A) receptor variants harboring amino acid point mutations in the presumed ERA interaction site. Three ET(A) receptor residues significantly and differentially affected ERA activity: Mutation R326Q did not affect the antagonist activity of macitentan, however the potencies of bosentan and ambrisentan were significantly reduced; mutation L322A rendered macitentan less potent, whereas bosentan and ambrisentan were unaffected; mutation I355A significantly reduced bosentan potency, but not ambrisentan and macitentan potencies. This suggests that--in contrast to bosentan and ambrisentan--macitentan-ET(A) receptor binding is not dependent on strong charge-charge interactions, but depends predominantly on hydrophobic interactions. This different binding mode could be the reason for macitentan's sustained target occupancy and insurmountable antagonism. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
24330612	20131217	Gene and cytokine profile analysis of macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in Fukuoka, Japan.	Recent epidemiologic data suggest that the prevalence of macrolide resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MR-M. pneumoniae) is increasing rapidly worldwide. This study assessed the present status of M. pneumoniae infection in Japan and clinical end-points to distinguish children with MR-M. pneumoniae. During an outbreak of M. pneumoniae infections in Fukuoka, Japan in 2010-11, a total of 105 children with clinically suspected M. pneumoniae infection were enrolled. M. pneumoniae was analyzed for macrolide resistance in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene. Sixty -five patients with PCR positive for M. pneumoniae were analyzed with regard to clinical symptoms, efficacy of several antimicrobial agents and several laboratory data. Causative pathogens were detected in 81.0% (85 of 105) and M. pneumoniae was identified 61.9% (65 of 105). The resistance rate of M. pneumoniae was 89.2% (58 of 65) in this general pediatric outpatient setting. Patients infected with MR-M. pneumoniae showed longer times to resolution of fever and required frequent changes of the initially prescribed macrolide to another antimicrobial agent. We observed three different genotypes of M. pneumoniae including the rarely reported A2063T mutation (A2063G: 31 strains, A2063T: 27 strains, no mutation: 7 strains). Drug susceptibility testing showed different antimicrobial susceptibility profiles for each genotype. Serum IFN-gamma, IL-6 and IP-10 levels were higher in patients with MR-genotypes than in those infected with no-mutation strains (p?&lt;?0.001). Macrolide resistance is more common than previously thought and a small epidemic of rarely reported A2063T mutation was observed in Fukuoka, Japan. Furthermore our results reveal the possibility that levels of certain inflammatory cytokines may be a candidate to predict MR-M.pneumoniae infection. 	BMC_Infect._Dis.	D016428
27556513	20160825	Control of translational activation by PIM kinase in activated B-cell diffuse large B-cell lymphoma confers sensitivity to inhibition by PIM447.	The PIM family kinases promote growth and survival of tumor cells and are expressed in a wide variety of human cancers. Their potential as therapeutic targets, however, is complicated by overlapping activities with multiple other pathways and remains poorly defined in most clinical scenarios. Here we explore activity of the new pan-PIM inhibitor PIM447 in a variety of lymphoid-derived tumors. We find strong activity in cell lines derived from the activated B-cell subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL). Sensitive lines show lost activation of the mTORC1 signaling complex and subsequent lost activation of cap-dependent protein translation. In addition, we characterize recurrent PIM1 protein-coding mutations found in DLBCL clinical samples and find most preserve the wild-type protein's ability to protect cells from apoptosis but do not bypass activity of PIM447. Pan-PIM inhibition therefore may have an important role to play in the therapy of selected ABC-DLBCL cases. 	Oncotarget	D016428
22434877	20120322	Sequencing of RDR6-dependent double-stranded RNAs reveals novel features of plant siRNA biogenesis.	Biogenesis of trans-acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs) is initiated by miRNA-directed cleavage of TAS gene transcripts and requires RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6) and Dicer-like 4 (DCL4). Here, we show that following miR173 cleavage the entire polyadenylated parts of Arabidopsis TAS1a/b/c and TAS2 transcripts are converted by RDR6 to double-stranded (ds)RNAs. Additionally, shorter dsRNAs are produced following a second cleavage directed by a TAS1c-derived siRNA. This tasiRNA and miR173 guide Argonaute 1 complexes to excise the segments from TAS2 and three TAS1 transcripts including TAS1c itself to be converted to dsRNAs, which restricts siRNA production to a region between the two cleavage sites. TAS1c is also feedback regulated by a cis-acting siRNA. We conclude that TAS1c generates a master siRNA that controls a complex network of TAS1/TAS2 siRNA biogenesis and gene regulation. TAS1/TAS2 short dsRNAs produced in this network are processed by DCL4 from both ends in distinct registers, which increases repertoires of tasiRNAs. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D013485
27513385	20160812	Macrolide Resistance in Treponema pallidum Correlates With 23S rDNA Mutations in Recently Isolated Clinical Strains.	High rates of 23S rDNA mutations implicated in macrolide resistance have been identified in Treponema pallidum samples from syphilis patients in many countries. Nonetheless, some clinicians have been reluctant to abandon azithromycin as a treatment for syphilis, citing the lack of a causal association between these mutations and clinical evidence of drug resistance. Although azithromycin resistance has been demonstrated in vivo for the historical Street 14 strain, no recent T. pallidum isolates have been tested. We used the well-established rabbit model of syphilis to determine the in vivo efficacy of azithromycin against 23S rDNA mutant strains collected in 2004 to 2005 from patients with syphilis in Seattle, Wash. Groups of 9 rabbits were each infected with a strain containing 23S rDNA mutation A2058G (strains UW074B, UW189B, UW391B) or A2059G (strains UW228B, UW254B, and UW330B), or with 1 wild type strain (Chicago, Bal 3, and Mexico A). After documentation of infection, 3 animals per strain were treated with azithromycin, 3 were treated with benzathine penicillin G, and 3 served as untreated control groups. Treatment efficacy was documented by darkfield microscopic evidence of T. pallidum, serological response, and rabbit infectivity test. Azithromycin uniformly failed to cure rabbits infected with strains harboring either 23S rDNA mutation, although benzathine penicillin G was effective. Infections caused by wild type strains were successfully treated by either azithromycin or benzathine penicillin G. A macrolide resistant phenotype was demonstrated for all strains harboring a 23S rDNA mutation, demonstrating that either A2058G or A2059G mutation confers in vivo drug resistance.

23468525	20130308	Mth1 regulates the interaction between the Rgt1 repressor and the Ssn6-Tup1 corepressor complex by modulating PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Rgt1.	Glucose uptake, the first, rate-limiting step of its utilization, is facilitated by glucose transporters. Expression of several glucose transporter (HXT) genes in yeast is repressed by the Rgt1 repressor, which recruits the glucose-responsive transcription factor Mth1 and the general corepressor complex Ssn6-Tup1 in the absence of glucose; however, it is derepressed when Mth1 is inactivated by glucose. Here we show that Ssn6-Tup1 interferes with the DNA-binding ability of Rgt1 in the absence of Mth1 and that the Rgt1 function abrogated by Ssn6 overexpression is restored by co-overexpression of Mth1. Thus Mth1 likely regulates Rgt1 function not by modulating its DNA-binding activity directly but by functionally antagonizing Ssn6-Tup1. Mth1 does so by acting as a scaffold-like protein to recruit Ssn6-Tup1 to Rgt1. Supporting evidence shows that Mth1 blocks the protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of Rgt1 that impairs the ability of Rgt1 to interact with Ssn6-Tup1. Of note, Rgt1 can bind DNA in the absence of Ssn6-Tup1 but does not inhibit transcription, suggesting that dissociation of Rgt1 from Ssn6-Tup1, but not from DNA, is necessary and sufficient for the expression of its target genes. Taken together, these findings show that Mth1 is a transcriptional corepressor that facilitates the recruitment of Ssn6-Tup1 by Rgt1. 	Mol._Biol._Cell	D016428 D052061 D013485
21095575	20101125	Cell-penetrant, nanomolar O-GlcNAcase inhibitors selective against lysosomal hexosaminidases.	Posttranslational modification of metazoan nucleocytoplasmic proteins with N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is essential, dynamic, and inducible and can compete with protein phosphorylation in signal transduction. Inhibitors of O-GlcNAcase, the enzyme removing O-GlcNAc, are useful tools for studying the role of O-GlcNAc in a range of cellular processes. We report the discovery of nanomolar OGA inhibitors that are up to 900,000-fold selective over the related lysosomal hexosaminidases. When applied at nanomolar concentrations on live cells, these cell-penetrant molecules shift the O-GlcNAc equilibrium toward hyper-O-GlcNAcylation with EC?? values down to 3 nM and are thus invaluable tools for the study of O-GlcNAc cell biology.

Its red blood cell (RBC) metabolite concentrations (6-thioguanine [6-TGN] and 6-methylmercaptopurine nucleotides [6-MMPN]) are related to drug response. We investigated the impact of non-genetic covariates and pharmacogenetic polymorphisms affecting thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA) on 6-MP metabolism and response. Sixty-six children with ALL treated according to EORTC 58951 protocol were included in this study. Six patients had a heterozygous genotype for the most common TPMT polymorphisms, nine for ITPA 94 C &gt; A and 17 for ITPA IVS2+21 A &gt; C. 6-MP metabolites concentrations were analyzed by mixed model analysis. During maintenance, steady-state RBC 6-TGN concentrations were lower in patients aged 6 years or younger (493 pmol/8 ? 10(8) RBC) than in older children (600 pmol/8 ? 10(8) RBC). 6-MMPN concentrations were low in patients with TPMT variant/wild-type ITPA (1862 pmol/8 ? 10(8) RBC), intermediate in wild-type patients and high (16468 pmol/8 ? 10(8) RBC) in patients wild-type TPMT/variant ITPA. A 6-MMPN threshold of 5000 pmol/8 ? 10(8) RBC was associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. In this study, age and both TPMT and ITPA genotypes influenced 6-MP metabolism. High 6-MMPN was associated with hepatotoxicity. These pharmacological tools should be used to monitor ALL treatment in children. 	Br_J_Clin_Pharmacol	D016428
21901155	20110909	MEF2C enhances dopaminergic neuron differentiation of human embryonic stem cells in a parkinsonian rat model.	Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can potentially differentiate into any cell type, including dopaminergic neurons to treat Parkinson's disease (PD), but hyperproliferation and tumor formation must be avoided. Accordingly, we use myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) as a neurogenic and anti-apoptotic transcription factor to generate neurons from hESC-derived neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs), thus avoiding hyperproliferation. Here, we report that forced expression of constitutively active MEF2C (MEF2CA) generates significantly greater numbers of neurons with dopaminergic properties in vitro. Conversely, RNAi knockdown of MEF2C in NPCs decreases neuronal differentiation and dendritic length. When we inject MEF2CA-programmed NPCs into 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned parkinsonian rats in vivo, the transplanted cells survive well, differentiate into tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons, and improve behavioral deficits to a significantly greater degree than non-programmed cells. The enriched generation of dopaminergic neuronal lineages from hESCs by forced expression of MEF2CA in the proper context may prove valuable in cell-based therapy for CNS disorders such as PD.

21772860	20110721	Inherited trombophilic states and pulmonary embolism.	Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, mostly, in case of PE for its lack of sensitivity of its early detection. For as much as twenty-five percent of PE patients the primary clinical appearance is unexpected death. While PE is one of the most avertable causes of hospital associated deaths, its diagnostics can be extremely difficult. Newly increased interest in an inherited thrombophilic states has been provoked by the discovery of several common inherited abnormalities, i.e. the prothrombin (PT) gene G20210A, Factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation (Arg506Gln), hyperhomocystenemia and homocysteiuria, Wein-Penzing defect, Sticky Platelet Syndrome (SPS), Quebec platelet disorder (QPD) and Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). PE incidence rates increase exponentially with age for both men and women, as they might harbor more than one thrombophilic state. Although the impact of genetic factors on PE is to some extent documented with lacking taxonomy, its genetic testing as its prevention strategy fall short.In this review thrombophilic states are divided into inherited or acquired, and only the inherited and newly documented are more closely followed. Factors are further grouped based on its thrombophilic taxonomy into; inherited defects of coagulation, inherited defects of fibrinolysis, inherited defects of enzymatic pathway in relation to development of VTE and PE and inherited defects of platelets in relation to PE. It was beyond the scope of this review to follow all inherited and newly recognized factors and its association to VTE and PE; however the overall taxonomy makes this review clinically valuable i.e. in relation to genetic testing as PE prevention.

21303516	20110210	Genetic diversity of Imjin virus in the Ussuri white-toothed shrew (Crocidura lasiura) in the Republic of Korea, 2004-2010.	Recently, Imjin virus (MJNV), a genetically distinct hantavirus, was isolated from lung tissues of the Ussuri white-toothed shrew (Crocidura lasiura) captured near the demilitarized zone in the Republic of Korea. To clarify the genetic diversity of MJNV, partial M- and L-segment sequences were amplified from lung tissues of 12 of 37 (32.4%) anti-MJNV IgG antibody-positive Ussuri white-toothed shrews captured between 2004 and 2010. A 531-nucleotide region of the M segment (coordinates 2,255 to 2,785) revealed that the 12 MJNV strains differed by 0-12.2% and 0-2.3% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. A similar degree of nucleotide (0.2-11.9%) and amino acid (0-3.8%) difference was found in a 632-nucleotide length of the L segment (coordinates 962 to 1,593) of nine MJNV strains. Phylogenetic analyses, based on the partial M and L segments of MJNV strains generated by the neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood methods, showed geographic-specific clustering, akin to the phylogeography of rodent-borne hantaviruses.

2497778	19890307	Transcriptional switching by the MerR protein: activation and repression mutants implicate distinct DNA and mercury(II) binding domains.	Bacterial resistance to mercuric compounds is controlled by the MerR metalloregulatory protein. The MerR protein functions as both a transcriptional repressor and a mercuric ion dependent transcriptional activator. Chemical mutagenesis of the cloned merR structural gene has led to the identification of mutant proteins that are specifically deficient in transcriptional repression, activation, or both. Five mutant proteins have been overproduced, purified to homogeneity, and assayed for ability to dimerize, bind mer operator DNA, and bind mercuric ion. A mutation in the recognition helix of a proposed helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif (E22K) yields protein deficient in both activation and repression in vivo (a-r-) and deficient in operator binding in vitro. In contrast, mutations in three of the four MerR cysteine residues are repression competent but activation deficient (a-r+) in vivo. In vitro, the purified cysteine mutant proteins bind to the mer operator site with near wild-type affinity but are variably deficient in binding the in vivo inducer mercury(II) ion. A subset of the isolated proteins also appears compromised in their ability to form dimers at low protein concentrations. These data, taken with the results in the preceding paper (Shewchuk et al., 1989), support a model in which DNA-bound MerR dimer binds one mercuric ion and transmits this occupancy information to a protein region involved in transcriptional activation.

25713513	20150226	Mitochondrial dynamism and the pathogenesis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.	Research on mitochondria in the last years has been characterized by the fundamental finding that the morphology of mitochondria is deeply connected to the regulation of a vast number of different processes, including oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, calcium buffering, and apoptosis. This has immediately focused the attention of the neuroscience community to the possible involvement of mitochondrial dynamism, the process underlying morphological features of mitochondria, in neurodegeneration, where mitochondrial dysfunction is believed to represent an important contributing event, or even a primary causative factor. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a disease of motor neurons and their neighboring cells, has long been considered as a neurodegenerative disease with an important mitochondrial issue. Yet, whether mitochondria have a causative, primary role in the pathogenic process has always been debated, and the specific defects which account for this role are elusive. Here we discuss recent genetic advances suggesting that defective mitochondrial dynamism is primarily involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of ALS, and that foster the longstanding concept that disruption of mitochondrial function is a vulnerable factor for motor neurons.

24084575	20131003	The MLH1 c.-27C&gt;A and c.85G&gt;T variants are linked to dominantly inherited MLH1 epimutation and are borne on a European ancestral haplotype.	Germline mutations of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2, and deletions affecting the EPCAM gene adjacent to MSH2, underlie Lynch syndrome by predisposing to early-onset colorectal, endometrial and other cancers. An alternative but rare cause of Lynch syndrome is constitutional epimutation of MLH1, whereby promoter methylation and transcriptional silencing of one allele occurs throughout normal tissues. A dominantly transmitted constitutional MLH1 epimutation has been linked to an MLH1 haplotype bearing two single-nucleotide variants, NM_000249.2: c.-27C&gt;A and c.85G&gt;T, in a Caucasian family with Lynch syndrome from Western Australia. Subsequently, a second seemingly unrelated Caucasian Australian case with the same MLH1 haplotype and concomitant epimutation was reported. We now describe three additional, ostensibly unrelated, cancer-affected families of European heritage with this MLH1 haplotype in association with constitutional epimutation, bringing the number of index cases reported to five. Array-based genotyping in four of these families revealed shared haplotypes between individual families that extended across ?2.6-?6.4 megabase regions of chromosome 3p, indicating common ancestry. A minimal ?2.6 megabase founder haplotype common to all four families was identified, which encompassed MLH1 and additional flanking genes and segregated with the MLH1 epimutation in each family. Our findings indicate that the MLH1 c.-27C&gt;A and c.85G&gt;T variants are borne on a European ancestral haplotype and provide conclusive evidence for its pathogenicity via a mechanism of epigenetic silencing of MLH1 within normal tissues. Additional descendants bearing this founder haplotype may exist who are also at high risk of developing Lynch syndrome-related cancers. 	Eur._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
23390577	20130208	Mixed regime of light-matter interaction revealed by phase sensitive measurements of the dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect.	Significant changes of the optical properties of semiconductors can be observed by applying strong electric fields capable to modify the band structure at equilibrium. This is known as the Franz-Keldysh effect (FKE). Here we study the FKE in bulk GaAs by combining single cycle THz pumps and broadband optical probes. The experiments show that the phase content of the selected electromagnetic pulses can be used to measure the timescales characteristic for the different regimes of matter-light interactions. Furthermore, the present phase-resolved measurements allow to identify a novel regime of saturation where memory effects are of relevance. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D013485
25767602	20150314	Induction of BCL2-Interacting Killer, BIK, is Mediated for Anti-Cancer Activity of Curcumin in Human Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells.	Naturally occurring diarylheptanoid curcumin (CUR), a principal component of the Asian spice turmeric, has been shown to have anti-cancer effects in many tumor types. However, a detailed mechanism regarding CUR induced tumor cell killing remain to be comprehensively explored. Using two head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines FaDu (hypopharyngeal) and Cal27 (tongue), we demonstrated a novel mechanism by which CUR levies the cytotoxic effect. We found that CUR induced upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bik, down-regulation of survival signaling by AKT and NF-?B prior to the induction of the caspase-cascade reduction of cell proliferation, are primary mechanisms of CUR-induced cell death, thus providing insights into the anti-tumor activity of CUR in HNSCC cells.

24146955	20131023	Cholesterol diet withdrawal leads to an initial plaque instability and subsequent regression of accelerated iliac artery atherosclerosis in rabbits.	Effect of long term cholesterol diet withdrawal on accelerated atherosclerosis in iliac artery of New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits has not been explored so far. Atherosclerosis was thus induced in rabbits by a combination of balloon injury and atherogenic diet (AD) (1% cholesterol and 6% peanut oil) feeding for 8 weeks (baseline) followed by chow diet (CD) feeding for 4, 8, 16, 32, 50 and 64 weeks. The plaque characterization was done using histology, real time RT-PCR and vasoreactivity studies. Significant elevation in plasma lipids with AD feeding was normalized following 16 weeks of CD feeding. However, baseline comparison showed advanced plaque features even after 8 weeks of CD period with significant elevation in intima/media thickness ratio and plaque area later showing reduction at 50 and 64 weeks CD periods. Lesion lipid accumulation and CD68 positivity was maintained till 16 weeks of CD feeding which significantly reduced from 32 to 64 weeks CD periods. Baseline comparison showed significant increase in ground substance, MMP-9 and significant decrease in ?-actin and collagen content at 8 weeks CD period indicating features of unstable plaque. These features regressed up to 64 weeks of CD. Partial restoration of functional vasoconstriction and vasorelaxation was seen after 64 weeks of CD feeding. mRNA expression of MCP-1, VCAM-1, collagen type I and III, MMP-9, TIMP-1, IFN-?, TNF-?, IL-10 and eNOS supported the above findings. The study thus reveals insights into initial plaque instability and subsequent regression on AD withdrawal in this model. These results are suggestive of an appropriate window for drug intervention for plaque stability/regression and restenosis as well as improves understanding of plaque regression phenomenon in this model.

26786101	20160121	Structural Determinants of Oligomerization of the Aquaporin-4 Channel.	The aquaporin (AQP) family of integral membrane protein channels mediate cellular water and solute flow. Although qualitative and quantitative differences in channel permeability, selectivity, subcellular localization, and trafficking responses have been observed for different members of the AQP family, the signature homotetrameric quaternary structure is conserved. Using a variety of biophysical techniques, we show that mutations to an intracellular loop (loop D) of human AQP4 reduce oligomerization. Non-tetrameric AQP4 mutants are unable to relocalize to the plasma membrane in response to changes in extracellular tonicity, despite equivalent constitutive surface expression levels and water permeability to wild-type AQP4. A network of AQP4 loop D hydrogen bonding interactions, identified using molecular dynamics simulations and based on a comparative mutagenic analysis of AQPs 1, 3, and 4, suggest that loop D interactions may provide a general structural framework for tetrameric assembly within the AQP family.

26034199	20150603	Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Protein-Mediated Inhibition of Host Cell Entry of Ebolaviruses.	Ebolaviruses are highly pathogenic in humans and nonhuman primates and pose a severe threat to public health. The interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins can restrict entry of ebolaviruses, influenza A viruses, and other enveloped viruses. However, the breadth and mechanism of the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins are incompletely understood. Here, we employed ebolavirus glycoprotein-pseudotyped vectors and ebolavirus-like particles to address this question. We show that IFITM proteins inhibit the cellular entry of diverse ebolaviruses and demonstrate that type I interferon induces IFITM protein expression in macrophages, major viral targets. Moreover, we show that IFITM proteins block entry of influenza A viruses and ebolaviruses by different mechanisms and provide evidence that antibodies and IFITM proteins can synergistically inhibit cellular entry of ebolaviruses. These results provide insights into the role of IFITM proteins in infection by ebolaviruses and suggest a mechanism by which antibodies, though poorly neutralizing in vitro, might contribute to viral control in vivo.

26065416	20150613	Proteomic Identification of DNA-PK Involvement within the RET Signaling Pathway.	Constitutive activation of the Rearranged during Transfection (RET) proto-oncogene leads to the development of MEN2A medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). The relatively clear genotype/phenotype relationship seen with RET mutations and the development of MEN2A is unusual in the fact that a single gene activity can drive the progression towards metastatic disease. Despite knowing the oncogene responsible for MEN2A, MTC, like most tumors of neural crest origin, remains largely resistant to chemotherapy. Constitutive activation of RET in a SK-N-MC cell line model reduces cell sensitivity to chemotherapy. In an attempt to identify components of the machinery responsible for the observed RET induced chemoresistance, we performed a proteomic screen of histones and associated proteins in cells with a constitutively active RET signaling pathway. The proteomic approach identified DNA-PKcs, a DNA damage response protein, as a target of the RET signaling pathway. Active DNA-PKcs, which is phosphorylated at site serine 2056 and localized to chromatin, was elevated within our model. Treatment with the RET inhibitor RPI-1 significantly reduced s2056 phosphorylation in RET cells as well as in a human medullary thyroid cancer cell line. Additionally, inhibition of DNA-PKcs activity diminished the chemoresistance observed in both cell lines. Importantly, we show that activated DNA-PKcs is elevated in medullary thyroid tumor samples and that expression correlates with expression of RET in thyroid tumors. These results highlight one mechanism by which RET signaling likely primes cells for rapid response to DNA damage and suggests DNA-PKcs as an additional target in MTC. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
15990625	20050702	Frequency of ASCA seropositivity in children with cystic fibrosis.	To determine the frequency of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) seropositivity in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and correlate ASCA with clinical features. Prospective study of children with CF aged 2 to 21 years enrolled from The Children's Hospital Cystic Fibrosis Center. Exclusion criteria included Crohn disease, immunodeficiency or immunoglobulin A deficiency. The frequency of ASCA (ASCA immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G) was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit provided by Inova, Inc. (San Diego, CA). The CF Foundation database was queried for clinical data on ASCA seropositive patients. Seventeen (20.7%) of 82 patients were seropositive for ASCA. Of these, eight had immunoglobulin A antibodies, six had immunoglobulin G antibodies and three had both. ASCA seropositivity in CF patients was significantly greater than the general population (20.7% versus 4%, P &lt; 0.0001), using an exact binomial test on a single proportion. The 95% confidence limits around our observed proportion were 12.6% to 31.1%. Of 17 ASCA positive patients, 1 (5.8%) had a history of meconium ileus, 14 (82.4%) had DeltaF508 gene mutation, 9 (52.9%) had positive sputum cultures for fungal organisms, and 17 (100%) had an ideal body weight % &gt;or=85%. Patients with CF have a higher frequency of ASCA seropositivity than the general population. When evaluating CF patients for Crohn disease, ASCA should be used with caution. The reasons for higher ASCA seropositivity in CF patients are unknown, but may include exposure to fungal organisms via intestinal or pulmonary sources. 	J._Pediatr._Gastroenterol._Nutr.

15890097	20050514	[Anti-pancreatic cancer immune response induced by K-ras mutated peptide].	Since most tumor antigens are uncertain, the immunotherapy against tumors still lingers in clinical trials. Because k-ras proto-oncogene specifically expresses in pancreatic cancer cells with constant mutation site, it may be an ideal target for immunotherapy against pancreatic cancer. This study was to evaluate the feasibility of inducing immunotherapy on pancreatic cancer by K-ras mutated peptides, give experimental evidence to clinical individual therapy on pancreatic cancer. k-ras oncogene was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)u its mutation type was detected by flow cytometry. T cells were induced by dendritic cells, which had been pulsed with synthesized mutated peptide. Killing effect of tumor specific T cells on pancreatic cancer cell line Patu8988 was assessed by MTT assay. There was a point mutation (GGT--&gt;GTT) in the 12th codon in Patu8988 cellu the amino acid was mutated to valine. The mutation epitope was efficiently presented on dendritic cells'surface. The cytotoxic T cells induced by mutated peptide could kill Patu8988 cells efficiently. The mutated peptide can efficiently induce immunocytes to kill pancreatic cancer cells, which have k-ras mutation site. This finding provides experimental clue for immunotherapy against pancreatic cancer. 	Ai_Zheng	D016428
21993378	20111014	Is the conserved mammalian region of ZNF804A locus associated with schizophrenia? A population-based genetics analysis.	Recently, several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have reproduced the significant association of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1344706 (located in intron 2 of the zinc finger protein 804A (ZNF804A) on chromosome 2q32.1) with schizophrenia. Bioinformatic analysis of the chromosome segment around rs1344706 suggests that a short conserved mammalian region exists approximately 3kb downstream of rs1344706. In the present work, we studied all SNPs in this conserved mammalian region and performed genetic analyses on samples from Chinese schizophrenia patients (n = 516) and compared control subjects (n = 520). Significant association between an allele of rs13423388 and schizophrenia was found (P = 0.0012). Haplotype analysis of the three SNPs rs4666998, rs13423388, and rs56280129 showed significant associations with schizophrenia (global P = 0.00001). Furthermore, we performed a four-SNP haplotype analysis which included the SNPs from the three-SNP haplotype analysis and rs1344706 (global P = 0.0005), and found that haplotype GCCG was associated with schizophrenia (P = 0.003). In summary, the present study adds new evidence for an association between the conserved mammalian region of the ZNF804A gene and schizophrenia. Further research is needed to clarify the transcriptional regulation of ZNF804A gene and to relate this to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. 	Schizophr._Res.	D016428 D013485
27102295	20160423	Human growth hormone and human prolactin function as autocrine/paracrine promoters of progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.	The death rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are extremely high due to the paucity of therapeutic options. Animal models and anecdotal clinical evidence indicate a potential role of hGH and hPRL in HCC. However, the prognostic relevance and the functional role of tumor expression of these hormones in human HCC are not defined. Herein, we analyzed the mRNA and protein expression of hGH and hPRL in histopathological samples of non-neoplastic liver and HCC by in situ hybridization, PCR and immunohistochemistry techniques. Increased mRNA and protein expression of both hormones was observed in HCC compared with non-neoplastic liver tissues. hGH expression was significantly associated with tumor size and tumor grade. No significant association was observed between the expression of hPRL and any histopathological features. Amplification of both hGH and hPRL genes in HCC was observed when compared to non-neoplastic tissue. Expression of both hGH and hPRL was associated with worse relapse-free and overall survival in HCC patients. In vitro and in vivo functional assays performed with HCC cell lines demonstrated that autocrine expression of hGH or hPRL in HCC cells increased STAT3 activation, oncogenicity and tumor growth while functional antagonism with hGH-G120R significantly reduced these parameters. Hence, tumor expression of hGH/hPRL is associated with a worse survival outcome for patients with HCC and hGH/hPRL function as autocrine/paracrine promoters of HCC progression. 	Oncotarget	D016428
19261551	20090306	A new splicing site mutation of the ABCB4 gene in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy with raised serum gamma-GT.	Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a liver disorder with a multifactorial etiology characterized by maternal pruritus, abnormal liver function tests and increased fetal risk. The main biochemical finding is the increase in total serum bile acid concentrations. In a subgroup of women, the serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase level is also increased. There is evidence that dysfunction of the ABCB4 gene might play a role in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy development. To investigate the role of the ABCB4 gene in Italian women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and raised gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase by, analyzing the complete coding sequence and mRNA splicing products. Among 299 women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, 10 showing raised gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase were enrolled in this study. DNA and RNA were extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using standard procedures. The 27 coding exons and the promoter region were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed by sequencing. Reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction analysis of ABCB4 mRNA and cDNA analysis were also performed. A novel splicing mutation that causes a truncated protein of 249 amino acid was identified in a woman who had the highest serum levels of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, bile acids, and the highest pruritus score. We identified also one already described p.R590Q mutation in a woman who had significantly higher serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, aspartate, and alanine aminotransferase. Our study demonstrates that splicing mutations in the ABCB4 gene can cause ICP in women with high gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and thus a complete analysis of coding sequence and cDNA products is required.

10810222	20000516	Childhood atopic asthma: positive association with a polymorphism of IL-4 receptor alpha gene but not with that of IL-4 promoter or Fc epsilon receptor I beta gene.	We examined the relative contributions of three representative candidate genes for atopy (Fc epsilon receptor I beta, IL-4, and IL-4 receptor alpha) to the development of atopic asthma. Four polymorphisms of the three candidate genes including Ile50Val and Gln551Arg of IL-4 receptor alpha, -590C/T of IL-4 promoter and Glu237Gly of Fc epsilon receptor I beta were studied in 100 patients with atopic asthma and 100 nonatopic controls in the northern Kyushu area in Japan. Among the four polymorphisms of the three candidate genes, the Ile50 allele of the IL-4 receptor alpha chain gene demonstrated an association with atopic asthma subjects (p = 0.044), especially in patients with onset at 2 years of age or earlier (p = 0.034) and in patients with moderate to severe atopic asthma (p = 0. 031). Gln551Arg of IL-4 receptor alpha, -590C/T of IL-4 promoter and Glu237Gly of Fc epsilon receptor I beta showed no association with atopic asthma. A slight linkage disequilibrium between Ile50Val and Gln551Arg polymorphisms of the IL-4 receptor alpha chain gene was observed in both patients and nonatopic controls. The identification of additional atopy genes in areas with a certain genetic background is essential for genetic diagnosis and to establish new therapeutic modalities for atopic asthma.

Chronic myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) are clonal haematopoietic stem cell malignancies characterised by an accumulation of mature myeloid cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood. Deregulation of the apoptotic machinery may be associated with MPD physiopathology. To evaluate expression of death receptors' family members, mononuclear cell apoptosis resistance, and JAK2 allele burden. Bone marrow haematopoietic progenitor CD34 cells were separated using the Ficoll-hypaque protocol followed by the Miltenyi CD34 isolation kit, and peripheral blood leukocytes were separated by the Haes-Steril method. Total RNA was extracted by the Trizol method, the High Capacity Kit was used to synthesise cDNA, and real-time PCR was performed using SybrGreen in ABIPrism 7500 equipment. The results of gene expression quantification are given as 2(-??Ct). The JAK2 V617F mutation was detected by real-time allelic discrimination PCR assay. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by the Ficoll-hypaque protocol and cultured in the presence of apoptosis inducers. In CD34 cells, there was mRNA overexpression for fas, faim and c-flip in polycythaemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythaemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), as well as fasl in PMF, and dr4 levels were increased in ET. In leukocytes, fas, c-flip and trail levels were increased in PV, and dr5 expression was decreased in ET. There was an association between dr5 and fasl expression and JAK2V617F mutation. PBMCs from patients with PV, ET or PMF showed resistance to apoptosis inducers. The results indicate deregulation of apoptosis gene expression, which may be associated with MPD pathogenesis leading to accumulation of myeloid cells in MPDs. 	J._Clin._Pathol.	D016428 D013485

Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is a ubiquitous bacterium able to survive and thrive within the environment and readily colonizes a wide range of substrates, often as a biofilm. It is also a facultative intracellular pathogen, which actively invades diverse hosts and induces listeriosis. So far, these two complementary facets of Lm biology have been studied independently. Here we demonstrate that the major Lm virulence determinant ActA, a PrfA-regulated gene product enabling actin polymerization and thereby promoting its intracellular motility and cell-to-cell spread, is critical for bacterial aggregation and biofilm formation. We show that ActA mediates Lm aggregation via direct ActA-ActA interactions and that the ActA C-terminal region, which is not involved in actin polymerization, is essential for aggregation in vitro. In mice permissive to orally-acquired listeriosis, ActA-mediated Lm aggregation is not observed in infected tissues but occurs in the gut lumen. Strikingly, ActA-dependent aggregating bacteria exhibit an increased ability to persist within the cecum and colon lumen of mice, and are shed in the feces three order of magnitude more efficiently and for twice as long than bacteria unable to aggregate. In conclusion, this study identifies a novel function for ActA and illustrates that in addition to contributing to its dissemination within the host, ActA plays a key role in Lm persistence within the host and in transmission from the host back to the environment.

23670291	20130515	Search for mutations in signaling pathways in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.	Mutations in JAK-STAT signaling pathway genes have been associated with the development of various hematological tumors, but have not been investigated in head and neck tumors, and the PIK3CA, BRAF and KRAS genes have been described in a few cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In the present study, we determined the mutation status in members of the MAPK, PI3K-AKT and JAK-STAT pathways in HNSCC. Mutations in the KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, JAK1 and JAK2 genes were evaluated in 94?HNSCCs by direct DNA sequencing analysis using cDNA synthesized from RNA extracted from patient tumor cells. All patients evaluated had wild-type KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA genes. Furthermore, although some known polymorphisms have been found in JAK1 genes (rs45598436, rs17127063, rs2230587, rs3737139, rs2230588 and rs12129819) and JAK2 (rs10429491, rs2230723, rs2230724 and rs41316003), no mutation could be detected. Our data indicate that mutations in these kinase genes seem to be rare events in HNSCC. 	Oncol._Rep.	D016428 D013485
20565738	20100623	Postpartal recurrent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in essential thrombocythaemia: case report and review of the literature.	Normal pregnancy corresponds to a procoagulant state. Acute myocardial infarction during pregnancy is rare, yet considering the low non-pregnant risk score of childbearing women it is still surprisingly frequent. We report a case of postpartum recurrent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in a 40-year-old caucasian woman with essential thrombocythaemia in the presence of a positive JAK-2 mutation and an elevated anti-cardiolipin IgM antibody titer. In the majority of cases of myocardial infarction in pregnancy or in the peripartal period, atherosclerosis, a thrombus or coronary artery dissection is observed. The combination of essential thrombocythaemia and elevated anti-cardiolipin IgM antibody titer in the presence of several cardiovascular risk factors seems to be causative in our case. In conclusion, with the continuing trend of childbearing at older ages, rare or unlikely conditions leading to severe events such as myocardial infarction must be considered in pregnant women.

22163051	20111214	Cannabidiol reduces A?-induced neuroinflammation and promotes hippocampal neurogenesis through PPAR? involvement.	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-? (PPAR?) has been reported to be involved in the etiology of pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cannabidiol (CBD), a Cannabis derivative devoid of psychomimetic effects, has attracted much attention because of its promising neuroprotective properties in rat AD models, even though the mechanism responsible for such actions remains unknown. This study was aimed at exploring whether CBD effects could be subordinate to its activity at PPAR?, which has been recently indicated as its putative binding site. CBD actions on ?-amyloid-induced neurotoxicity in rat AD models, either in presence or absence of PPAR antagonists were investigated. Results showed that the blockade of PPAR? was able to significantly blunt CBD effects on reactive gliosis and subsequently on neuronal damage. Moreover, due to its interaction at PPAR?, CBD was observed to stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis. All these findings report the inescapable role of this receptor in mediating CBD actions, here reported. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
27029810	20160401	Variants near CHRNA3/5 and APOE have age- and sex-related effects on human lifespan.	Lifespan is a trait of enormous personal interest. Research into the biological basis of human lifespan, however, is hampered by the long time to death. Using a novel approach of regressing (272,081) parental lifespans beyond age 40 years on participant genotype in a new large data set (UK Biobank), we here show that common variants near the apolipoprotein E and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha 5 genes are associated with lifespan. The effects are strongly sex and age dependent, with APOE ?4 differentially influencing maternal lifespan (P=4.2 ? 10(-15), effect -1.24 years of maternal life per imputed risk allele in parent; sex difference, P=0.011), and a locus near CHRNA3/5 differentially affecting paternal lifespan (P=4.8 ? 10(-11), effect -0.86 years per allele; sex difference P=0.075). Rare homozygous carriers of the risk alleles at both loci are predicted to have 3.3-3.7 years shorter lives. 	Nat_Commun	D016428 D013485
22040742	20111102	Plasma membrane proteomes of differentially matured dendritic cells identified by LC-MS/MS combined with iTRAQ labelling.	Dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in polarising Th lymphocyte subsets but it is unclear what molecular events occur when DCs generate Th2-type responses. Here, we analysed plasma membrane-enriched fractions from immature, pro-Th1 and pro-Th2 DCs and used a combination of iTRAQ labelling and LC-MS/MS to quantify changes in the proteomes. Analysis was performed on triplicate biological samples and changes verified by flow cytometry. MHC class II molecules and CD29 were up-regulated in pro-Th1 DCs whilst CD18 and CD44 were up-regulated in pro-Th2 DCs. One of the most down-regulated molecules in pro-Th1 DCs was YM-1 whilst the greatest decrease in pro-Th2 DCs was NAP-22. Other molecules up-regulated in pro-Th2 DC compared to pro-Th1 DCs included some potentially involved in protein folding during antigen processing (clathrin and Rab-7), whilst other non-membrane proteins such as enzymes/transporters related to cell metabolism (malate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, and ATPase Na(+)/K(+)) were also recorded. This suggests that pro-Th2 DCs are more metabolically active while pro-Th1 DCs have a mature 'end state'. Overall, although several molecules were preferentially expressed on pro-Th2 DCs, our proteomics data support the view of a 'limited maturation' of pro-Th2 DCs compared to pro-Th1 DCs.

7815942	19940901	Threonine dehydratases of Corynebacterium glutamicum with altered allosteric control: their generation and biochemical and structural analysis.	Threonine dehydratase is the key enzyme in L-isoleucine synthesis, since it is allosterically feedback-inhibited by L-isoleucine. With the aim of obtaining regulatorily altered mutants of the threonine dehydratase of Corynebacterium glutamicum, amino acids were specifically exchanged and a new biological system of mutant selection was developed, based on the intoxication of Escherichia coli by ketobutyrate, which is the dehydratase reaction product. A collection of 19 mutant enzymes was generated and genetically and biochemically characterized comprising a whole range of regulatorily and catalytically altered enzymes. Of particular interest is the mutant Val-323-Ala, which is characterized by the fact that the L-isoleucine inhibition is entirely abolished so that the enzyme is always present in a relaxed, high-activity state. Correspondingly, the Hill coefficient is 1.4, in contrast to the value of 3.4 characteristic of the wild-type enzyme. Another peculiar mutant generated is the double mutant His-278-Arg-Leu-351-Ser. Here, again, L-isoleucine no longer inhibits catalytic activity, but the effector still promotes major structural changes of the protein, as ascertained from the L-isoleucine-dependent loss of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate from this mutant enzyme. Further enzymes obtained are reduced in L-isoleucine inhibition to a varying degree. Detailed studies on the structure of the enzyme revealed a partially very high similarity of the secondary structure to the mechanistically identical beta-subunit of the tryptophan synthase. This provides further indications concerning the localization of the regulatory and catalytic domain of the threonine dehydratase. 	Mol._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485
20685742	20100806	Toll-like receptor 2 and 4 genes influence susceptibility to adverse effects of traffic-related air pollution on childhood asthma.	Epidemiological studies have reported adverse effects of ambient air pollution on the prevalence of asthma. Laboratory studies have suggested that innate immune responses are involved. A study was undertaken to determine whether the Toll-like receptor 2 and 4 genes (TLR2 and TLR4) influence the susceptibility to adverse effects of traffic-related air pollution with respect to the prevalence of childhood asthma. Haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TLR2 (n=4) and TLR4 genes (n=9) were genotyped in 916 children from the Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA) birth cohort. Exposure to particulate matter (PM(2.5)), soot and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) at the birth address was estimated by land use regression models. Interactions between levels of pollutants and SNPs in relation to annual questionnaire reports of asthma diagnosis and symptoms from birth up to 8 years of age were analysed longitudinally by generalised estimating equations. Two TLR2 SNPs and four TLR4 SNPs significantly modified the effect of air pollution on the prevalence of doctor-diagnosed asthma from birth up to 8 years of age. The risk of having doctor-diagnosed asthma increased with increasing PM(2.5) levels in children with at least one copy of the TLR2 rs4696480 A allele (OR 2.0 (95% CI 1.2 to 3.1) for an interquartile range increase in exposure). Similar observations were present with the following TLR4 genotypes: rs2770150 TC (OR 2.0 (95% CI 1.1 to 3.6)), rs10759931 GG (OR 2.6 (95% CI 1.4 to 4.9)), rs6478317 GG (OR 2.2 (95% CI 1.2 to 4.3)), rs10759932 CT or CC (OR 2.9 (95% CI 1.2 to 6.9)) and rs1927911 TT (OR 4.4 (95% CI 1.7 to 11.7)). Variant alleles of TLR2 and TLR4 genes influence the susceptibility to adverse effects of traffic-related air pollution on childhood asthma. 	Thorax	D016428 D016448 D013485
15650216	20050115	Attenuating mutations of the matrix gene of influenza A/WSN/33 virus.	The matrix protein (M1) of influenza virus plays an essential role in viral replication. Our previous studies have shown that basic amino acids 101RKLKR105 of M1 are involved in RNP binding and nuclear localization. For the present work, the functions of 101RKLKR105 were studied by introducing mutations into the M gene of influenza virus A/WSN/33 by reverse genetic methods. Individual substitution, R101S or R105S, had a minimal effect on viral replication. In contrast, the double mutation R101S-R105S was synergistic and resulted in temperature sensitivity reflected by reduced viral replication at a restrictive temperature. To investigate the in vivo effect on infection, BALB/c mice were infected with either A/WSN/33 wild-type (Wt) or mutant viruses and assessed for signs of illness, viral replication in the lungs, and survival rates. The results from mouse studies indicated that the R101S-R105S double mutant virus was strongly attenuated, while single mutant viruses R101S and R105S were minimally attenuated compared to A/WSN33 Wt under the same conditions. In challenge studies, mice immunized by infection with R101S-R105S were fully protected from lethal challenge with A/WSN/33. The replication and attenuating properties of R101S-R105S suggest its potential in development of live influenza virus vaccines. 	J._Virol.	D016428
14639609	20031126	Mutations of BRAF are associated with extensive hMLH1 promoter methylation in sporadic colorectal carcinomas.	Activating mutations of BRAF have been frequently observed in microsatellite unstable (MSI+) colorectal carcinomas (CRCs), in which mutations of BRAF and KRAS are mutually exclusive. Previously, we reported that hypermethylation of hMLH1 might play an important role in the tumorigenesis of right-sided sporadic CRCs with MSI showing less frequency of KRAS/TP53 alteration. Therefore, we have assumed that BRAF mutations might be highly associated with hMLH1 methylation status rather than MSI status. In this study, mutations of BRAF and KRAS and their relationship with MSI and hMLH1 methylation status were examined in 140 resected specimens of CRC. The methylation status was classified into 3 types: full methylation (FM), partial methylation (PM) and nonmethylation (NM). Only FM closely linked to reduced expression of hMLH1 protein. BRAF mutations were found in 16 cases (11%), all leading to the production of BRAF(V599E). As for MSI status, BRAF mutations were found in 43% of MSI+ and 4% of MSI- cases (p &lt; 0.0001). Among the MSI+ individuals, BRAF mutations were more frequent in cases with hMLH1 deficiency (58%) than those with hMSH2 deficiency (0%; p=0.02). Moreover, they were found in 69% of FM, 4% of PM and 4% of NM, revealing a striking difference between FM and the other 2 groups (FM vs. PM or NM; p &lt; 0.0001). These findings suggest that BRAF activation may participate in the carcinogenesis of sporadic CRCs with hMLH1 hypermethylation in the proximal colon, independently of KRAS activation.

21931625	20110921	Different toll-like receptor stimuli have a profound impact on cytokines required to break tolerance and induce autoimmunity.	Although toll-like receptor (TLR) signals are critical for promoting antigen presenting cell maturation, it remains unclear how stimulation via different TLRs influence dendritic cell (DC) function and the subsequent adaptive response in vivo. Furthermore, the relationship between TLR-induced cytokine production by DCs and the consequences on the induction of a functional immune response is not clear. We have established a murine model to examine whether TLR3 or TLR4 mediated DC maturation has an impact on the cytokines required to break tolerance and induce T-cell-mediated autoimmunity. Our study demonstrates that IL-12 is not absolutely required for the induction of a CD8 T-cell-mediated tissue specific immune response, but rather the requirement for IL-12 is determined by the stimuli used to mature the DCs. Furthermore, we found that IFN? is a critical pathogenic component of the cytokine milieu that circumvents the requirement for IL-12 in the induction of autoimmunity. These studies illustrate how different TLR stimuli have an impact on DC function and the induction of immunity. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
20609455	20100709	Cell culture and in vivo analyses of cytopathic hepatitis C virus mutants.	HCV-JFH1 yields subclones that develop cytopathic plaques (Sekine-Osajima Y, et al., Virology 2008; 371:71). Here, we investigated viral amino acid substitutions in cytopathic mutant HCV-JFH1 clones and their characteristics in vitro and in vivo. The mutant viruses with individual C2441S, P2938S or R2985P signature substitutions, and with all three substitutions, showed significantly higher intracellular replication efficiencies and greater cytopathic effects than the parental JFH1 in vitro. The mutant HCV-inoculated mice showed significantly higher serum HCV RNA and higher level of expression of ER stress-related proteins in early period of infection. At 8 weeks post inoculation, these signature mutations had reverted to the wild type sequences. HCV-induced cytopathogenicity is associated with the level of intracellular viral replication and is determined by certain amino acid substitutions in HCV-NS5A and NS5B regions. The cytopathic HCV clones exhibit high replication competence in vivo but may be eliminated during the early stages of infection. 	Virology	D016428 D013485
27656639	20160923	Physical Activity Participation of Disabled Children: A Systematic Review of Conceptual and Methodological Approaches in Health Research.	Physical activity (PA) participation is widely recognized as a critical component of health and development for disabled and non-disabled children. Emergent literature reflects a paradigm shift in the conceptualization of childhood PA as a multi-dimensional construct, encompassing aspects of physical performance, and self-perceived engagement. However, ambiguity remains around how participation as a health construct is integrated into PA research. The primary objective of the present mini-review is to critically examine current conceptual and methodological approaches to evaluating PA participation among disabled children. We conducted a systematic review of contemporary literature (published between 2000 and 2016). Seventeen articles met inclusion criteria, and their research approach was classified into guiding framework, definition of the key construct, and measurement used. The primary guiding framework was the international classification of functioning, disability and health. An explicit definition of PA participation was absent from all studies. Eight studies (47%) operationalized PA and participation as independent constructs. Measurements included traditional performance-based aspects of PA (frequency, duration, and intensity), and alternative participation measures (subjective perception of involvement, inclusion, or enjoyment). Approximately 64% of included articles were published in the past 2?years (2014-2016) indicating a rising interest in the topic of PA participation. Drawing from the broader discussion of participation in the literature, we offer a working definition of PA participation as it pertains to active, health-associated behaviors. Further description of alternative approaches to framing and measuring PA participation are offered to support effective assessment of health status among disabled children.

11566108	20010922	Inheritance and population structure of the white-phased &quot;Kermode&quot; black bear.	We report that a single nucleotide replacement in the melanocortin 1 receptor gene [1] (mc1r) is responsible for the white coat color of the &quot;Kermode&quot; bear [2], a color phase of the black bear (Ursus americanus Pallus) found in the rainforests along the north coast of British Columbia. In a sample of 220 bears, of which 22 were white, there was complete association of a recessive Tyr-to-Cys replacement at codon 298 with the white phase. This variant has not been yet been reported in other mammals, and it also is the lightest-colored variant yet found at mc1r. Also, we found that heterozygotes, which act as a hidden reservoir for the allele among black bears, were infrequent outside of the three islands where Kermodes are common and that, within these three islands, heterozygotes were less frequent than expected under random mating. Immigration of black bears into Kermode populations can depress the occurrence of the white phase, and management practices should be designed to avoid facilitating higher immigration rates.

11136175	20010103	Effect of ACE gene polymorphism on age at renal death in polycystic kidney disease in Japan.	Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is one of the most common genetic disorders and a major cause of renal death or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring regular hemodialysis. The responsible genes recently have been cloned; however, genetic factors influencing the rate of progression to ESRD in patients with PKD have yet to be defined. Several studies have shown increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in patients with PKD. In addition, genetic polymorphisms of the RAS have been associated with the development of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, these polymorphisms are good candidates for disease-modifying genetic factors or markers in PKD. In two previous reports of white subjects with a cumulative survival analysis, it was suggested that patients with P:KD1 homozygous for the deletion allele of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene are at increased risk for early renal death. To confirm this hypothesis in Japanese subjects, 103 individuals with PKD were genotyped for several components of the RAS, ie, ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism, angiotensinogen (AGT) M235T, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) A1166C. Seventy-six of the 103 patients (73.8%) reached ESRD at an average age of 52.1 +/- 11.3 years. The frequencies of each genotype of the genes were similar to those expected from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was a tendency to an excess of patients homozygous for the D allele in patients with ESRD (DD in patients with ESRD, 11.8%; DD in patients without ESRD, 3.7%; chi-square, 1.505; P: = 0.22). Cumulative renal survival was significantly less in those with the DD genotype compared with ID/II genotypes. Estimated mean renal survival was 46.4 years (95% confidence interval, 39.5 to 53.3) in subjects with the DD genotype and 57.2 years (95% confidence interval, 54.2 to 60.2) in ID/II genotypes (chi-square, 7.76; P: = 0.0053). There was no association between age at onset of ESRD and either M235T or A1166C polymorphism. These findings suggest that Japanese patients with PKD homozygous for the D allele of the ACE gene are at increased risk for developing ESRD at an early age. 	Am._J._Kidney_Dis.	D016428
22164050	20111214	LuxCDABE--transformed constitutively bioluminescent Escherichia coli for toxicity screening: comparison with naturally luminous Vibrio fischeri.	We show that in vitro toxicity assay based on inhibition of the bioluminescence of recombinant Escherichia coli encoding thermostable luciferase from Photorhabdus luminescens is a versatile alternative to Vibrio fischeri Microtox? test. Performance of two luxCDABE-transformed E. coli MC1061 constructs (pDNlux) and (pSLlux) otherwise identical, but having 100-fold different background luminescence was compared with the performance of V. fischeri. The microplate luminometer and a kinetic Flash-Assay test format was used that differently from Microtox test is also applicable for high throughput analysis. Toxic effects (30-s till 30-min EC(50)) of four heavy metals (Zn, Cd, Hg, Cu) and three organic chemicals (aniline, 3,5-dichloroaniline and 3,5-dichlorophenol) were studied. Both E. coli strains had comparable sensitivity and the respective 30-min EC(50) values highly correlated (log-log R(2) = 0.99; p &lt; 0.01) showing that the sensitivity of the recombinant bacteria towards chemicals analyzed did not depend on the bioluminescence level of the recombinant cells. The most toxic chemical for all used bacterial strains (E. coli, V. fischeri) was mercury whereas the lowest EC(50) values for Hg (0.04-0.05 mg/L) and highest EC(50) values for aniline (1,300-1,700 mg/L) were observed for E. coli strains. Despite of that, toxicity results obtained with both E. coli strains (pSLlux and pDNlux) significantly correlated with V. fischeri results (log-log R(2) = 0.70/0.75; p &lt; 0.05/0.01). The use of amino acids (0.25%) and glucose (0.05%)-supplemented M9 medium instead of leucine-supplemented saline significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced the apparent toxicity of heavy metals to both E. coli strains up to three orders of magnitude, but had little or no complexing effect on organic compounds. Thus, P. luminescens luxCDABE-transformed E. coli strains can be successfully used for the acute toxicity screening of various types of organic chemicals and heavy metals and can replace V. fischeri in certain cases where the thermostability of luciferase &gt;30 ?C is crucial. The kinetic Flash Assay test format of the bioluminescence inhibition assay facilitates high throughput analysis. The assay medium, especially in case of testing heavy metals should be a compromise: optimal for the viability/luminescence of the recombinant test strain and of minimum complexing potential.

22691310	20120614	Breast carcinoma and Lynch syndrome: molecular analysis of tumors arising in mutation carriers, non-carriers, and sporadic cases.	Breast carcinoma is the most common cancer in women, but its incidence is not increased in Lynch syndrome (LS) and studies on DNA mismatch repair deficiency (MMR) in LS-associated breast cancers have arrived at conflicting results. This study aimed to settle the question as to whether breast carcinoma belongs to the LS tumor spectrum. MMR status and epigenetic profiles were determined for all available breast carcinomas identified among 200 LS families from a nation-wide registry (23 tumors from mutation carriers and 18 from non-carriers). Sporadic breast carcinomas (n = 49) and other cancers (n = 105) from MMR gene mutation carriers were studied for comparison. The proportion of breast carcinomas that were MMR-deficient based on absent MMR protein, presence of microsatellite instability, or both was significantly (P = 0.00016) higher among breast carcinomas from mutation carriers (13/20, 65%) compared to non-carriers (0/14, 0%). While the average age at breast carcinoma diagnosis was similar in carriers (56 years) and non-carriers (54 years), it was lower for MMR-deficient versus proficient tumors in mutation carriers (53 years versus 61 years, P = 0.027). Among mutation carriers, absent MMR protein was less frequent in breast carcinoma (65%) than in any of seven other tumor types studied (75% to 100%). Tumor suppressor promoter methylation patterns were organ-specific and similar between breast carcinomas from mutation carriers and non-carriers. Breast carcinoma from MMR gene mutation carriers resembles common breast carcinoma in many respects (for example, general clinicopathological and epigenetic profiles). MMR status makes a distinction: over half are MMR-deficient typical of LS spectrum tumors, while the remaining subset which is MMR-proficient may develop differently. The results are important for appropriate surveillance in mutation carriers and may be relevant for LS diagnosis in selected cases. 	Breast_Cancer_Res.	D016428 D013485
20442373	20100506	Alteration of substrate specificity: the variable N-terminal domain of tobacco Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase is important for substrate recognition.	Protein kinases are major signaling molecules that are involved in a variety of cellular processes. However, the molecular mechanisms whereby protein kinases discriminate specific substrates are still largely unknown. Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) play central roles in Ca(2+) signaling in plants. Previously, we found that a tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) CDPK1 negatively regulated the transcription factor REPRESSION OF SHOOT GROWTH (RSG), which is involved in gibberellin feedback regulation. Here, we found that the variable N-terminal domain of CDPK1 is necessary for the recognition of RSG. A mutation (R10A) in the variable N-terminal domain of CDPK1 reduced both RSG binding and RSG phosphorylation while leaving kinase activity intact. Furthermore, the R10A mutation suppressed the in vivo function of CDPK1. The substitution of the variable N-terminal domain of an Arabidopsis thaliana CDPK, At CPK9, with that of Nt CDPK1 conferred RSG kinase activities. This chimeric CDPK behaved according to the identity of the variable N-terminal domain in transgenic plants. Our results open the possibility of engineering the substrate specificity of CDPK by manipulation of the variable N-terminal domain, enabling a rational rewiring of cellular signaling pathways.

12391335	20021023	Mutations that permit efficient replication of hepatitis C virus RNA in Huh-7 cells prevent productive replication in chimpanzees.	The development of a subgenomic replicon derived from the hepatitis C virus (HCV) strain Con1 enabled the study of viral RNA replication in Huh-7 cells. The level of replication of replicons, as well as full-length Con1 genomes, increased significantly by a combination of two adaptive mutations in NS3 (E1202G and T1280I) and a single mutation in NS5A (S2197P). However, these cell culture-adaptive mutations influenced in vivo infectivity. After intrahepatic transfection of chimpanzees, the wild-type Con1 genome was infectious and produced viral titers similar to those produced by other infectious HCV clones. Repeated independent transfections with RNA transcripts of a Con1 genome containing the three adaptive mutations failed to achieve active HCV infection. Furthermore, although a chimpanzee transfected with RNA transcripts of a Con1 genome with only the NS5A mutation became infected, this mutation was detected only in virus genomes recovered from serum at day 4; viruses recovered at day 7 had a reversion back to the original Con1 sequence. Our study demonstrates that mutations that are adaptive for replication of HCV in cell culture may be highly attenuating in vivo. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428
26483779	20151021	NK cell function and receptor diversity in the context of HCV infection.	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects over 170 million people in the world. While a minority of individuals are able to naturally clear this hepatotropic virus using their immune system, most people go on to develop a lifetime chronic infection that can result in severe liver pathology, potentially leading to liver cirrhosis and hepatic cellular carcinoma. Investigations into acute immune responses and spontaneous clearance of the virus are severely hampered by difficulties in identification of relevant patient cohorts. While the role for the adaptive immune response in viral clearance is well established, it is becoming clear that the innate immune system also impacts on HCV outcome. The innate immune response to infection is likely to influence the type of adaptive immune response that develops and will ultimately influence if the virus is cleared or develops into a chronic infection. Natural Killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes that have important anti-viral functions including direct cytotoxicity of infected cells and the production of inflammatory cytokines, e.g., IFN-?. They are generally considered to be cells of the innate immune system, although there is increasing evidence that NK cells adapt and persist in response to particular viral infections. NK cells are altered in patients with acute and chronic HCV infection. There is increasing evidence from both cellular and genetic studies that NK cells modulate HCV outcome. This review will describe and discuss the current experimental and clinical evidence of a role for NK cells in HCV infection and describe recent discoveries that are likely to play a role in future research.

The semi-dominant abi1-1 mutation of Arabidopsis interferes with multiple aspects of abscisic acid signal transduction resulting in reduced seed dormancy and sensitivity of root growth in ABA. Furthermore, the mutant transpires excessively as a result of abnormal stomatal regulation leading to a wilty phenotype. The ABI1 gene has been cloned. The carboxyl-terminal domain of the predicted ABI1 protein is related to the 2C class of serine-threonine phosphatases while no overt homology was found in the extended amino terminus. A combination of in vitro assays and yeast mutant complementation studies confirmed that ABI1 is a functional protein phosphatase 2C. The abi1-1 mutation converts the amino acid glycine180 to aspartic acid, and in the above test systems, causes a partial loss of the phosphatase activity. In transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana guard cells, the abi1-1 gene causes a reduction in the background current of the outward-rectifying potassium channels, and also in the abscisic acid-sensitivity of both the outward- and the inward-rectifying potassium channels in the plasma membrane. However, normal sensitivity of both potassium channels to, and stomatal closure in, abscisic acid was recovered in the presence of H7 and staurosporine, both broad-range protein kinase antagonists. These results suggest the aberrant potassium channel behavior as a major consequence of abi1-1 action and implicate ABI1 as part of a phosphatase/kinase pathway that modulates the sensitivity of guard-cell potassium channels to abscisic acid-evoked signal cascades.

27383573	20160708	Cannabinoids and haemostasis.	Elements of the endocannabinoid system (cannabinoid receptors CB1, CB2, CBPT and CBED, endocannabinoids, enzymes involved in the synthesis and metabolism of endocannabinoids) are located on the structures involved in the process of hemostasis. An increasing level of endocannabinoids was also observed in some pathological conditions, which may occur in disorders of hemostasis. At the same time, disconcertingly, there is an increased number of reports about incidents of cardiovascular events in smokers of marijuana. Experimental and clinical studies demonstrated multidirectional, often contradictory, effects of cannabinoids on hemostasis, including effects of the compounds on platelets, vascular endothelium, fibrinolysis and plasma coagulation systems. The mechanisms of action of cannabinoids on homeostasis depend on the cannabinoid receptors CB1, CB2, CBPT and CBED, receptors of other systems stimulated by endocannabinoids, as well as metabolites of endocannabinoids and nitrogen oxide. The range of biological functions of endo- and plant cannabinoids, expanded to include the process of hemostasis, may constitute a condition for their recognition as a new factor responsible for thromboembolism in smokers of marijuana, in pathological disorders with increased levels of endocannabinoids and in individuals with polymorphisms of FAAH C385A and A385A. On the other hand, there are compelling reasons for anti?hemostatic action of cannabinoids. 	Postepy_Hig_Med_Dosw_(Online)	D016428 D016454
26491440	20151023	Sex Hormones and Their Receptors Regulate Liver Energy Homeostasis.	The liver is one of the most essential organs involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Hepatic steatosis, a major manifestation of metabolic syndrome, is associated with imbalance between lipid formation and breakdown, glucose production and catabolism, and cholesterol synthesis and secretion. Epidemiological studies show sex difference in the prevalence in fatty liver disease and suggest that sex hormones may play vital roles in regulating hepatic steatosis. In this review, we summarize current literature and discuss the role of estrogens and androgens and the mechanisms through which estrogen receptors and androgen receptors regulate lipid and glucose metabolism in the liver. In females, estradiol regulates liver metabolism via estrogen receptors by decreasing lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid uptake, while enhancing lipolysis, cholesterol secretion, and glucose catabolism. In males, testosterone works via androgen receptors to increase insulin receptor expression and glycogen synthesis, decrease glucose uptake and lipogenesis, and promote cholesterol storage in the liver. These recent integrated concepts suggest that sex hormone receptors could be potential promising targets for the prevention of hepatic steatosis. 	Int_J_Endocrinol	D016428 D016454
10846053	20000614	Feline leukemia virus envelope sequences that affect T-cell tropism and syncytium formation are not part of known receptor-binding domains.	The envelope protein is a primary pathogenic determinant for T-cell-tropic feline leukemia virus (FeLV) variants, the best studied of which is the immunodeficiency-inducing virus, 61C. We have previously demonstrated that T-cell-tropic, cytopathic, and syncytium-inducing viruses evolve in cats infected with a relatively avirulent, transmissible form of FeLV, 61E. The envelope gene of an 81T variant, which encoded scattered single-amino-acid changes throughout the envelope as well as a 4-amino-acid insertion in the C-terminal half of the surface unit (SU) of envelope, was sufficient to confer the T-cell-tropic, cytopathic phenotype (J. L. Rohn, M. S. Moser, S. R. Gwynn, D. N. Baldwin, and J. Overbaugh, J. Virol. 72:2686-2696, 1998). In the present study, we examined the role of the 4-amino-acid insertion in determining viral replication and tropism of FeLV-81T. The 4-amino-acid insertion was found to be functionally equivalent to a 6-amino-acid insertion at an identical location in the 61C variant. However, viruses expressing a chimeric 61E/81T SU, containing the insertion together with the N terminus of 61E SU, were found to be replication defective and were impaired in the processing of the envelope precursor into the functional SU and transmembrane (TM) proteins. In approximately 10% of cultured feline T cells (3201) transfected with the 61E/81T envelope chimeras and maintained over time, replication-competent tissue culture-adapted variants were isolated. Compensatory mutations in the SU of the tissue culture-adapted viruses were identified at positions 7 and 375, and each was shown to restore envelope protein processing when combined with the C-terminal 81T insertion. Unexpectedly, these viruses displayed different phenotypes in feline T cells: the virus with a change from glutamine to proline at position 7 acquired a T-cell-tropic, cytopathic phenotype, whereas the virus with a change from valine to leucine at position 375 had slower replication kinetics and caused no cytopathic effects. Given the differences in the replication properties of these viruses, it is noteworthy that the insertion as well as the two single-amino-acid changes all occur outside of predicted FeLV receptor-binding domains.

27279102	20160610	The genetic heterogeneity of colorectal cancer predisposition - guidelines for gene discovery.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a cumulative term applied to a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neoplasms that occur in the bowel. Based on twin studies, up to 45?% of the CRC cases may involve a heritable component. Yet, only in 5-10?% of these cases high-penetrant germline mutations are found (e.g. mutations in APC and DNA mismatch repair genes) that result in a familial aggregation and/or an early onset of the disease. Genome-wide association studies have revealed that another ~5?% of the CRC cases may be explained by a cumulative effect of low-penetrant risk factors. Recent attempts to identify novel genetic factors using whole exome and whole genome sequencing has proven to be difficult since the remaining, yet to be discovered, high penetrant CRC predisposing genes appear to be rare. In addition, most of the moderately penetrant candidate genes identified so far have not been confirmed in independent cohorts. Based on literature examples, we here discuss how careful patient and cohort selection, candidate gene and variant selection, and corroborative evidence may be employed to facilitate the discovery of novel CRC predisposing genes. The picture emerges that the genetic predisposition to CRC is heterogeneous, involving complex interplays between common and rare (inter)genic variants with different penetrances. It is anticipated, however, that the use of large clinically well-defined patient and control datasets, together with improved functional and technical possibilities, will yield enough power to unravel this complex interplay and to generate accurate individualized estimates for the risk to develop CRC.

11901228	20020320	Dopamine transporter mutants with cocaine resistance and normal dopamine uptake provide targets for cocaine antagonism.	Cocaine's blockade of dopamine reuptake by brain dopamine transporters (DAT) is a central feature of current understanding of cocaine reward and addiction. Empirical screening of small-molecule chemical libraries has thus far failed to provide successful cocaine blockers that allow dopamine reuptake in the presence of cocaine and provide cocaine &quot;antagonism&quot;. We have approached this problem by assessing expression, dopamine uptake, and cocaine analog affinities of 56 DAT mutants in residues located in or near transmembrane domains likely to play significant roles in cocaine recognition and dopamine uptake. A phenylalanine-to-alanine mutant in putative DAT transmembrane domain 3, F154A, retains normal dopamine uptake, lowers cocaine affinity 10-fold, and reduces cocaine stereospecificity. Such mutants provide windows into DAT structures that could serve as targets for selective cocaine blockers and document how combined strategies of mutagenesis and small molecule screening may improve our abilities to identify and design compounds with such selective properties.

20931532	20101009	[Association of the Pro1770Leu polymorphism in CYP5A1 gene with myocardial infarction in Uigur population of Xinjiang].	To investigate the association between the polymorphism of the thromboxane synthase gene and Uigur patients with myocardial infarction (MI) in Xinjiang. Three hundred and fifteen patients with MI and 218 healthy control subjects were detected by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. The serum thromboxane B2 (TXB2) in all subjects was detected with radioimmunoassay kit. The genotype distributions of the MI group and control group were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Chi-square=0.375,0.029, P&gt;0.05). The frequencies of CC and TC were 0.933 and 0.067 in MI group while they were 0.977 and 0.023 in controls. There was significant difference in frequencies of the TC genotype and T allele but no difference in frequencies of CC genotype between controls and MI cases. There was significant difference in serum TXB2 level between the MI and control group (P&lt;0.05), and between individuals of the TC and CC genotypes (P&lt;0.05). The serum TXB2 level in the MI cases with TC genotype was increased compared with that of other genotypes (P&lt;0.05). The TC genotype and T allele of thromboxane synthase gene might be risk factors of MI in Uigur population in Xinjiang, which might result from the increased serum TXB2 level.

21693589	20110623	A functional channel is necessary for growth suppression by Cx37.	Connexin 37 (Cx37) profoundly suppresses the proliferation of rat insulinoma (Rin) cells by unknown mechanisms. To determine whether a functional pore domain is necessary for Cx37-mediated growth suppression, we introduced a mutation that converted threonine 154 into alanine (T154A). Like other connexins mutated at the homologous site, Cx37-T154A localized to appositional membrane but failed to form functional channels and exerted a dominant-negative effect on coexpressed wild-type Cx37 or Cx43. Unlike the wild-type protein, Cx37-T154A did not suppress the proliferation of Rin cells and did not, with serum deprivation, result in cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, progression through the cell cycle was unaffected by expression of Cx37-T154A. These results indicate that a pore-forming domain that is able to form functional channels is essential for the anti-proliferative, cell-cycle arrest and serum-sensitivity effects of Cx37, and furthermore that the normally localized C-terminal domain is not sufficient for these effects of Cx37.

15309683	20040817	Identification of 108 SNPs in TSC, WNK1, and WNK4 and their association with hypertension in a Japanese general population.	The deletion of thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter ( TSC, SLC12A3) causes Gitelman's syndrome characterized by low blood pressure, while deletions of the WNK1 ( PRKWNK1) and WNK4 ( PRKWNK4) genes cause familial hypertension known as pseudohypoaldosteronism type II. Recent studies have revealed that cell surface expression of TSC is regulated by WNK1 and WNK4. We hypothesized that molecular variations in TSC, WNK1, and WNK4 could lead to an increased morbidity of hypertension. We identified 52, 35, and 21 polymorphisms in Japanese hypertensives by sequencing the entire coding regions of TSC, WNK1 and WNK4, respectively. Twenty-one representative polymorphisms were genotyped in 1,818 Japanese individuals (771 subjects with hypertension and 1,047 controls) randomly sampled in Suita city. The results indicated that the systolic blood pressure in men with the CT+TT genotype in WNK4 C14717T was 3.1 mmHg higher than those with the CC genotype ( p=0.042) after adjustment with confounding factors such as age, BMI, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, antihypertensive drug use, smoking, and drinking. Multivariate logistic regression analysis (with adjustment for the same parameters) in men revealed that the odds ratio for the presence of hypertension of the CT+TT genotype in C14717T to the CC genotype was 1.62 ( p=0.010, 95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.33). Association of TSC and WNK1 with hypertension was not observed. In conclusion, our study suggests the possible involvement of WNK4 in essential hypertension in a Japanese general population.

23318681	20130116	Shear response of Fe-bearing MgSiO(3) post-perovskite at lower mantle pressures.	We investigate the shear response of possible slip systems activated in pure and Fe-bearing MgSiO(3) post-perovskite (PPv) through ab initio generalized stacking fault (GSF) energy calculations. Here we show that the [100](001) slip system has the easiest response to plastic shear among ten possible slip systems investigated. Incorporation of Fe(2+) decreases the strength of all slip systems but does not change the plastic anisotropy style. Therefore, pure and Fe-bearing MgSiO(3) PPv should demonstrate similar LPO patterns with a strong signature of the [100](001) slip system. An aggregate with this deformation texture is expected to produce a V(SH) &gt; V(SV) type polarization anisotropy, being consistent with seismological observations.(Communicated by Ikuo KUSHIRO, M.J.A.).

27239032	20160531	CRISPR-Mediated Drug-Target Validation Reveals Selective Pharmacological Inhibition of the RNA Helicase, eIF4A.	Targeting translation initiation is an emerging anti-neoplastic strategy that capitalizes on de-regulated upstream MAPK and PI3K-mTOR signaling pathways in cancers. A key regulator of translation that controls ribosome recruitment flux is eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F, a hetero-trimeric complex composed of the cap binding protein eIF4E, the scaffolding protein eIF4G, and the RNA helicase eIF4A. Small molecule inhibitors targeting eIF4F display promising anti-neoplastic activity in preclinical settings. Among these are some rocaglate family members that are well tolerated in?vivo, deplete eIF4F of its eIF4A helicase subunit, have shown activity as single agents in several xenograft models, and can reverse acquired resistance to MAPK and PI3K-mTOR targeted therapies. Herein, we highlight the power of using genetic complementation approaches and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing for drug-target validation ex?vivo and in?vivo, linking the anti-tumor properties of rocaglates to eIF4A inhibition.

7497438	19951001	Neurofibromatosis 2 gene in human colorectal cancer.	Colon cancers commonly have allelic losses of chromosome 22q, which suggests the presence of a tumor suppressor gene on 22q. The candidate tumor suppressor gene on 22q is the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene. Using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, we screened 24 pairs of colorectal cancer and adjacent normal mucosa, as well as 10 colon cancer cell lines from non-NF2 patients, for mutations in the coding sequence of the NF2 gene. Two SSCP variants, one in exon 14 and another one in exon 16, were detected in two of the sporadic colorectal cancers, but not in adjacent normal mucosa samples. Sequencing of these variants in one tumor detected an A-to-G transition in bp 1459 of the NF2 cDNA, resulting in the change of Ile to Val at codon 487 of merlin, the NF2 protein product. The other tumor showed a 2-bp (CT) deletion in the intronic sequence of the alternatively spliced exon 16. These results suggest that the NF2 gene is probably involved in some colorectal tumors, but is not the critical chromosome 22q tumor suppressor gene involved in colon tumorigenesis.

3567926	19870501	Response of drug-sensitive and -resistant L1210 leukemias to high-dose chemotherapy.	Alkylating agent-sensitive and -resistant L1210 leukemia cell lines were used to determine the tumor response to dose levels of drugs that exceeded conventional doses up to a factor of 10. Since those dose levels were lethal to the host mice, tumor response was based on the results of in vivo bioassays of spleen and/or tumor from drug-treated and control mice. When mice bearing about 10(8) drug-sensitive leukemic cells were treated with a single, conventional (approximately 10% lethal) dose of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum, L-phenylalanine mustard (melphalan), or 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, 10(1) to 10(4) tumor cells were recovered by bioassay. Treatment at doses that were 2 to 8 times the 10% lethal dose of either of those drugs resulted in no recoverable cells and survival of all bioassay recipient mice. Mice bearing advanced L1210 leukemia resistant to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (L1210/DDPt), 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (L1210/BCNU), cyclophosphamide (L1210/CPA), or melphalan(L1210/L-PAM) also were treated with a 10% lethal dose and greater doses of the drug to which the tumor line was resistant. Bioassay results indicated a direct correlation between dose intensity and tumor cell kill, the response being linear. Similarly, when mice with L1210/BCNU were treated with high doses of N-(2-chloroethyl)-N''-(2,6-dioxo-3-piperidinyl)-N-nitrosourea or 1,1',1''-phosphinothioylidynetrisaziridine (thioTEPA) and when mice with L1210/DDPt were treated with cyclophosphamide, an increasing, linear cell kill resulted throughout the high-dose range. Overall, these results indicate that resistance to these alkylating agents can be overcome by dose intensification and that the tumor response is linear in relation to increasing dose level.

26086362	20150619	DNA Methylation-Guided Prediction of Clinical Failure in High-Risk Prostate Cancer.	Prostate cancer (PCa) is a very heterogeneous disease with respect to clinical outcome. This study explored differential DNA methylation in a priori selected genes to diagnose PCa and predict clinical failure (CF) in high-risk patients. A quantitative multiplex, methylation-specific PCR assay was developed to assess promoter methylation of the APC, CCND2, GSTP1, PTGS2 and RARB genes in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 42 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and radical prostatectomy specimens of patients with high-risk PCa, encompassing training and validation cohorts of 147 and 71 patients, respectively. Log-rank tests, univariate and multivariate Cox models were used to investigate the prognostic value of the DNA methylation. Hypermethylation of APC, CCND2, GSTP1, PTGS2 and RARB was highly cancer-specific. However, only GSTP1 methylation was significantly associated with CF in both independent high-risk PCa cohorts. Importantly, trichotomization into low, moderate and high GSTP1 methylation level subgroups was highly predictive for CF. Patients with either a low or high GSTP1 methylation level, as compared to the moderate methylation groups, were at a higher risk for CF in both the training (Hazard ratio [HR], 3.65; 95% CI, 1.65 to 8.07) and validation sets (HR, 4.27; 95% CI, 1.03 to 17.72) as well as in the combined cohort (HR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.42 to 5.27) in multivariate analysis. Classification of primary high-risk tumors into three subtypes based on DNA methylation can be combined with clinico-pathological parameters for a more informative risk-stratification of these PCa patients.

24518835	20140213	Homozygous microdeletion of exon 5 in ZNF277 in a girl with specific language impairment.	Specific language impairment (SLI), an unexpected failure to develop appropriate language skills despite adequate non-verbal intelligence, is a heterogeneous multifactorial disorder with a complex genetic basis. We identified a homozygous microdeletion of 21,379?bp in the ZNF277 gene (NM_021994.2), encompassing exon 5, in an individual with severe receptive and expressive language impairment. The microdeletion was not found in the proband's affected sister or her brother who had mild language impairment. However, it was inherited from both parents, each of whom carries a heterozygous microdeletion and has a history of language problems. The microdeletion falls within the AUTS1 locus, a region linked to autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs). Moreover, ZNF277 is adjacent to the DOCK4 and IMMP2L genes, which have been implicated in ASD. We screened for the presence of ZNF277 microdeletions in cohorts of children with SLI or ASD and panels of control subjects. ZNF277 microdeletions were at an increased allelic frequency in SLI probands (1.1%) compared with both ASD family members (0.3%) and independent controls (0.4%). We performed quantitative RT-PCR analyses of the expression of IMMP2L, DOCK4 and ZNF277 in individuals carrying either an IMMP2L_DOCK4 microdeletion or a ZNF277 microdeletion. Although ZNF277 microdeletions reduce the expression of ZNF277, they do not alter the levels of DOCK4 or IMMP2L transcripts. Conversely, IMMP2L_DOCK4 microdeletions do not affect the expression levels of ZNF277. We postulate that ZNF277 microdeletions may contribute to the risk of language impairments in a manner that is independent of the autism risk loci previously described in this region.

21698079	20110624	Study of pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of liposomal brucine for dermal administration.	To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of liposomal brucine (LB) for dermal application. Pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution were studied by in vivo animal testing. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to detect the concentration of brucine in rats' skin, plasma and various tissues. After dermal administration, LB was absorbed rapidly in the skin and could be detected after 0.5 hours. After 36 hours, levels were too low to be detected. In plasma, levels were also too low to be detected after 36 hours. The concentration of LB reached 50% of the maximum in all tissues except the brain, peaking after 1.5 hours but still detectable after 12 hours. The concentration of LB was high in skin at the application site. LB was quickly absorbed into tissues through the blood circulation and widely distributed throughout the whole body. There was no obvious toxicity and LB did not readily accumulate in tissues and organs. It showed local potency but low overall systemic toxicity. 	Int_J_Nanomedicine	D016428 D013485
10441039	19990810	Molecular scanning of the beta-3-adrenergic receptor gene in Pima Indians and Caucasians.	The beta-3-adrenergic receptor (beta3AR) stimulates lipolysis and thermogenesis in adipocytes. The Trp64Arg beta3AR variant is associated in some, but not all, studies with an earlier onset of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and features of the insulin resistance syndrome. Functional studies as to the role of the Trp64Arg variant have been inconclusive. Earlier studies screened the beta3AR gene in only ten obese, diabetic Pima Indians. Potentially another yet to be identified polymorphism in the beta3AR gene in linkage disequilibrium with the Trp64Arg polymorphism could explain the findings in the association and functional studies. We scanned the beta3AR gene in 20 diabetic Pima subjects and 20 Caucasian subjects using single stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Variants were sequenced using dideoxy sequence analysis and further characterized using allele specific oligonucleotide hybridization (ASO) and RNA template specific-polymerase chain reaction (RS-PCR) assays. We found a guanine to thymidine substitution in the first intron, 14 bases from the splice donor site in both groups. In virtually all subjects, only two haplotypes were detected, Trp64/g1856 and Arg64/t1856, indicating that the g1856t polymorphism is in linkage disequilibrium with the Trp64Arg polymorphism. The g1856t substitution introduces a new consensus splice donor site which, if used, would encode a truncated protein. RNA levels of the two beta3AR alleles were approximately equal in omental adipose tissue of heterozygotes. No aberrantly spliced beta3AR mRNA was detected, indicating that the new consensus splice donor site is not used in vivo. The g1856t polymorphism is in linkage disequilibrium with the Trp64Arg variant, but does not appear to have a functional role. 	Diabetes_Metab._Res._Rev.	D016430 D003160 D016428 D013485 D013487
26261799	20150812	APOBEC3 Deletion is Associated with Breast Cancer Risk in a Sample of Southeast Iranian Population.	Breast Cancer (BC) is considered as one of the most important causes of death worldwide. Previous studies showed that apolipoprotein B mRNA- editing catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) gene deletion significantly increased the risk of BC risk in Chinese and European women. The present study aimed to assess the possible impact of APOBEC3 deletion and the risk of BC in a sample of Iranian population. The APOBEC3 insertion/deletion (I/D) was analyzed in a case- control study including 262 BC patients and 217 healthy women. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to genotype the variant in APOBEC3 gene. The findings of this study showed that I/D as well as I/D+D/D genotype increased the risk of BC (OR= 1.57, 95% CI= 1.07- 2.31, p= 0.025 and OR= 1.50, 95% CI= 1.03- 2.19, p= 0.037, respectively) in comparison with I/I genotype. In conclusion, our findings suggest that APOBEC3 deletion polymorphism increased the risk of BC in an Iranian population in the southeast of Iran. 	Int_J_Mol_Cell_Med	D016428
27442640	20160722	Endometrial cancer and antidepressants: A nationwide population-based study.	To our knowledge, the association between antidepressant exposure and endometrial cancer has not been previously explored. Herein, we aim to investigate the association between antidepressant prescription, including novel antidepressants, and the risk for endometrial cancer in a population-based study.Data for the analysis were derived from National Health Insurance Research Database. We identified 8392 cases with a diagnosis of endometrial cancer and 82,432 matched controls. A conditional logistic regression model was used, with adjusting for potentially confounding variables (e.g., comorbid psychiatric diseases, comorbid physical diseases, and other medications). Risk for endometrial cancer in the population-based study sample was categorized by, and assessed as a function of, antidepressant prescription and cumulative dosage.We report no association between endometrial cancer incidence and antidepressant prescription, including those prescribed either selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (adjusted odds ratio [OR]?=?0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-1.15) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (adjusted OR?=?1.14; 95% CI, 0.76-1.71). We also did not identify an association between higher cumulative doses of antidepressant prescription and endometrial cancer.There was no association between antidepressant prescription and endometrial cancer.

16525718	20060310	MMP14 gene polymorphisms in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	Proteinase/antiproteinase imbalance is a widely accepted theory for the pathogenesis of COPD. Among various proteinases, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) digest extracellular matrix of the lung and play significant roles in the development of COPD. Polymorphisms of an MMP that upregulate its activity may result in the degradation of the lung matrix. A case-control study was performed to investigate the association of polymorphisms of the MMP14 gene with COPD. Japanese subjects (96 COPD patients and 61 controls) and Egyptian subjects (106 COPD patients and 72 controls) were recruited. Each subject was genotyped for seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the MMP14 gene; -165 G/T and -72 G/A in the promoter region, +221 C/T in exon 1, +6727 C/G and +6767 G/A in exon 5, +7096 T/C in exon 6, and +8153 G/A in exon 8. The distributions of the genotype frequencies of these SNPs were not significantly different between the COPD patients and the controls in either ethnic group after correction of multiple comparisons. In the haplotype analysis, however, the haplotype -165 T : +221 T : +6727 C : +7096 C had a significantly higher frequency in the Egyptian COPD group than the control group (pcorr = 0.0063). The haplotype of the MMP14 gene, -165 T : +221 T : +6727 C : +7096 C, might be involved in the pathogenesis of COPD. 	Int._J._Mol._Med.	D003160 D016428

However, their efficacy is diminished due to enzyme-mediated covalent modification, which reduces affinity of the drug for the target ribosome. One of the most prevalent aminoglycoside resistance enzymes in Gram-negative pathogens is the adenylyltransferase ANT(2?)-Ia, which confers resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, and kanamycin. Despite the importance of this enzyme in drug resistance, its structure and molecular mechanism have been elusive. This study describes the structural and mechanistic basis for adenylylation of aminoglycosides by the ANT(2?)-Ia enzyme. ANT(2?)-Ia confers resistance by magnesium-dependent transfer of a nucleoside monophosphate (AMP) to the 2?-hydroxyl of aminoglycoside substrates containing a 2-deoxystreptamine core. The catalyzed reaction follows a direct AMP transfer mechanism from ATP to the substrate antibiotic. Central to catalysis is the coordination of two Mg(2+) ions, positioning of the modifiable substrate ring, and the presence of a catalytic base (Asp86). Comparative structural analysis revealed that ANT(2?)-Ia has a two-domain structure with an N-terminal active-site architecture that is conserved among other antibiotic nucleotidyltransferases, including Lnu(A), LinB, ANT(4')-Ia, ANT(4?)-Ib, and ANT(6)-Ia. There is also similarity between the nucleotidyltransferase fold of ANT(2?)-Ia and DNA polymerase ?. This similarity is consistent with evolution from a common ancestor, with the nucleotidyltransferase fold having adapted for activity against chemically distinct molecules. IMPORTANCE ?: To successfully manage the threat associated with multidrug-resistant infectious diseases, innovative therapeutic strategies need to be developed. One such approach involves the enhancement or potentiation of existing antibiotics against resistant strains of bacteria. The reduction in clinical usefulness of the aminoglycosides is a particular problem among Gram-negative human pathogens, since there are very few therapeutic options for infections caused by these organisms. In order to successfully circumvent or inhibit the activity of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, and to thus rejuvenate the activity of the aminoglycoside antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens, structural and mechanistic information is crucial. This study reveals the structure of a clinically prevalent aminoglycoside resistance enzyme [ANT(2?)-Ia] and depicts the molecular basis underlying modification of antibiotic substrates. Combined, these findings provide the groundwork for the development of broad-spectrum inhibitors against antibiotic nucleotidyltransferases. 	MBio	D016428 D052061 D013485
17357149	20070316	p75(NTR) gene and suicide attempts in young adults with a history of childhood-onset mood disorder.	Recently, evidence has accumulated for the role of neurotrophic processes in mood disorders. Neurotrophins operate on receptors, one of which is the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)). We examined three p75(NTR) markers at the p75(NTR) gene, including a missense polymorphism that changes serine to leucine (S205L), for association with suicide attempt (SA) in 203 childhood-onset mood disorder (COMD) cases. There was no difference between COMD suicide attempters and COMD non-attempters with logistic regression models for any of the three markers. We also compared the three polymorphisms between 192 COMD cases and 192 matched healthy controls and found no significant differences between COMD and healthy controls. Our results do not support an association of the p75(NTR) S205L polymorphism with risk for COMD or SA in COMD. 	Am._J._Med._Genet._B_Neuropsychiatr._Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013485
16473850	20060214	DNA nicking by HinP1I endonuclease: bending, base flipping and minor groove expansion.	HinP1I recognizes and cleaves the palindromic tetranucleotide sequence G downward arrowCGC in DNA. We report three structures of HinP1I-DNA complexes: in the presence of Ca(2+) (pre-reactive complex), in the absence of metal ion (binary complex) and in the presence of Mg(2+) (post-reactive complex). HinP1I forms a back-to-back dimer with two active sites and two DNA duplexes bound on the outer surfaces of the dimer facing away from each other. The 10 bp DNA duplexes undergo protein-induced distortions exhibiting features of A-, B- and Z-conformations: bending on one side (by intercalation of a phenylalanine side chain into the major groove), base flipping on the other side of the recognition site (by expanding the step rise distance of the local base pair to Z-form) and a local A-form conformation between the two central C:G base pairs of the recognition site (by binding of the N-terminal helix in the minor groove). In the pre- and post-reactive complexes, two metals (Ca(2+) or Mg(2+)) are found in the active site. The enzyme appears to cleave DNA sequentially, hydrolyzing first one DNA strand, as seen in the post-reactive complex in the crystalline state, and then the other, as supported by the observation that, in solution, a nicked DNA intermediate accumulates before linearization.

18675805	20080805	A single residue mutation in Hha preserving structure and binding to H-NS results in loss of H-NS mediated gene repression properties.	In this study, we report that a single mutation of cysteine 18 to isoleucine (C18I) in Escherichia coli Hha abolishes the repression of the hemolysin operon observed in the wild-type protein. The phenotype also includes a significant decrease in the growth rate of E. coli cells at low ionic strength. Other substitutions at this position (C18A, C18S) have no observable effects in E. coli growth or hemolysin repression. All mutants are stable and well folded and bind H-NS in vitro with similar affinities suggesting that Cys 18 is not directly involved in H-NS binding but this position is essential for the activity of the H-NS/Hha heterocomplexes in the regulation of gene expression.

19584770	20090709	Variants in COMT and spontaneous smoking cessation: retrospective cohort analysis of 925 cessation events.	Genome-wide studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with smoking behaviour and nicotine dependence. Less is known about genetic determinants of smoking cessation, but rs4680 in COMT has recently been shown to explain a substantial proportion of the variation in cessation in the general population. We attempted to replicate the reported, clinically relevant effect in a population-based retrospective cohort analysis of 1443 ever-heavy smokers, of whom 925 had reached abstinence. In Cox regression models, neither rs4680 nor two polymorphisms nearby were associated with smoking cessation. The adjusted relative cessation rate (95% confidence interval) in rs4680 methionine carriers in reference to valine homozygotes was 0.97 (0.83-1.12). The absence of a significant effect of rs4680 in this statistically well-powered study - the 95% confidence interval even excluding the previously reported effect - highlights the need for rigorous replication efforts and suggests that rs4680 genotype should not yet be considered informative for smoking patient care.

26660106	20151215	A case of Brooke-Spiegler syndrome with a novel mutation in the CYLD gene in a patient with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.	Brooke-Spiegler syndrome (BSS, familial cylindromatosis) is a rare hereditary disease characterized by multiple tumors of the skin appendages predominantly located in the head and neck region, such as cylindromas, trichoepitheliomas, or spiradenomas. It is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in the CYLD gene, mapped on chromosome 16q12-13. Association with secondary malignant neoplasms has been reported. Until now 51 different mutations in 73 families have been reported; 41?% of them constitute frameshift mutations, resulting in an interruption of the expression of the gene product CYLD. CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme and plays an important role in (NF)-?B pathway signaling, a central pathway for apoptosis regulation. Mutation-induced loss of function leads to constitutive activation of NF-?B. Here, we report the case of a 48-year-old female patient diagnosed with an abdominal aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The patient presented with multiple cylindromas of the capillitium. The patient's mother also has a mild form of late-onset cylindromas. Due to the typical clinical features indicating BSS, genotyping from peripheral blood was performed. A c.2465insAACA mutation in exon 17 of the CYLD gene, leading to a frameshift, was detected in the patient and in the patient's mother. This is the first description of this hereditary mutation in exon 17 of the CYLD gene. There have been several reports on patients with CYLD mutations and different types of malignancies. However, a coincidence with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has not been reported yet. 	J._Cancer_Res._Clin._Oncol.	D002363 D016428
12740866	20030513	Role for calbindin-D28K in in vitro classical conditioning of abducens nerve responses in turtles.	Intracellular calcium has a pivotal role in synaptic modifications that may underlie learning and memory. The present study examined whether there were changes in immunoreactivity levels of the AMPA receptor subunits GluR2/3 and calcium binding proteins during classical conditioning recorded in the abducens nerve of in vitro brain stem preparations from turtles. The results showed that abducens motor neurons in unconditioned turtle brain stems were immunopositive for GluR2/3, calbindin-D28K, and calmodulin, but were immunonegative for parvalbumin. After classical conditioning, immunoreactivity for calbindin-D28K in the abducens motor nuclei was significantly reduced, whereas there were no significant changes in GluR2/3, calmodulin, or parvalbumin. This reduction in calbindin-D28K immunoreactivity was not observed following conditioning in the NMDA receptor antagonist AP-5, which blocked conditioned responses, suggesting that these changes are NMDA receptor-dependent. Moreover, the degree of the decrease in calbindin-D28K immunoreactivity was negatively correlated with the level of conditioning. Consistent with the immunocytochemical findings, Western blot analysis showed that calbindin-D28K protein levels were reduced after classical conditioning. The results support the hypothesis that in vitro classical conditioning of abducens nerve responses utilizes intracellular calcium-dependent signaling pathways that require NMDA receptor function and suggest a specific role for the calcium binding protein calbindin-D28K.

23734237	20130605	Changes in the hydrocarbon proportions of colony odor and their consequences on nestmate recognition in social wasps.	In social insects, colonies have exclusive memberships and residents promptly detect and reject non-nestmates. Blends of epicuticular hydrocarbons communicate colony affiliation, but the question remains how social insects use the complex information in the blends to discriminate between nestmates and non-nestmates. To test this we altered colony odor by simulating interspecific nest usurpation. We split Polistes dominulus paper-wasp nests into two halves and assigned a half to the original foundress and the other half to a P. nimphus usurper for 4 days. We then removed foundresses and usurpers from nests and investigated whether emerging P. dominulus workers recognized their never-before-encountered mothers, usurpers and non-nestmates of the two species. Behavioral and chemical analyses of wasps and nests indicated that 1) foundresses marked their nests with their cuticular hydrocarbons; 2) usurpers overmarked foundress marks and 3) emerging workers learned colony odor from nests as the odor of the female that was last on nest. However, notwithstanding colony odor was usurper-biased in usurped nests, workers from these nests recognized their mothers, suggesting that there were pre-imaginal and/or genetically encoded components in colony-odor learning. Surprisingly, workers from usurped nests also erroneously tolerated P. nimphus non-nestmates, suggesting they could not tell odor differences between their P. nimphus usurpers and P. nimphus non-nestmates. Usurpers changed the odors of their nests quantitatively, because the two species had cuticular hydrocarbon profiles that differed only quantitatively. Possibly, P. dominulus workers were unable to detect differences between nestmate and non-nestmate P. nimphus because the concentration of some peaks in these wasps was beyond the range of workers' discriminatory abilities (as stated by Weber's law). Indeed, workers displayed the least discrimination abilities in the usurped nests where the relative odor changes due to usurpation were the largest, suggesting that hydrocarbon variations beyond species-specific ranges can alter discrimination abilities.

24488977	20140204	Enhanced stabilization of a stable single domain antibody for SEB toxin by random mutagenesis and stringent selection.	Single domain antibodies, recombinant variable heavy domains derived from the unique heavy-chain only antibodies found in camelids and sharks, are exceptionally rugged due to their ability to refold following heat or chemical denaturation. In addition, a number of single domain antibodies have been found to possess high melting points which provide an even greater degree of stability; one of these, llama-derived A3, is a binder of Staphylococcal enterotoxin B and has a Tm of 83.5 ?C. In this work, we utilized random mutagenesis and stringent selection in an effort to obtain variants of A3 with even higher melting points. This effort resulted in the selection of a double mutant, A3-T28I-S72I, which has a melting point of 90.0 ?C and near wild-type affinity for the target antigen. We further characterized the mutations individually to determine that while both contributed to the thermal stabilization, the T28I mutation accounted for ? 4.1 ?C of the 6.5 ?C increase. This work demonstrates that by the addition of relatively subtle changes it is possible to further improve the melting temperature of single domain antibodies that are already remarkably stable.

23548203	20130404	Genome-wide association studies identify several new loci associated with pigmentation traits and skin cancer risk in European Americans.	Aiming to identify novel genetic loci for pigmentation and skin cancer, we conducted a series of genome-wide association studies on hair color, eye color, number of sunburns, tanning ability and number of non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) among 10 183 European Americans in the discovery stage and 4504 European Americans in the replication stage (for eye color, 3871 males in the discovery stage and 2496 males in the replication stage). We targeted novel chromosome regions besides the known ones for replication. As a result, we identified a new region downstream of the EDNRB gene on 13q22 associated with hair color and the strongest association was the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs975739 (P = 2.4 ? 10(-14); P = 5.4 ? 10(-9) in the discovery set and P = 1.2 ? 10(-6) in the replication set). Using blue, intermediate (including green) and brown eye colors as co-dominant outcomes, we identified the SNP rs3002288 in VASH2 on 1q32.3 associated with brown eye (P = 7.0 ? 10(-8); P = 5.3 ? 10(-5) in the discovery set and P = 0.02 in the replication set). Additionally, we identified a significant interaction between the SNPs rs7173419 and rs12913832 in the OCA2 gene region on brown eye color (P-value for interaction = 3.8 ? 10(-3)). As for the number of NMSCs, we identified two independent SNPs on chr6 and one SNP on chromosome 14: rs12203592 in IRF4 (P = 7.2 ? 10(-14); P = 1.8 ? 10(-8) in the discovery set and P = 6.7 ? 10(-7) in the replication set), rs12202284 between IRF4 and EXOC2 (P = 5.0 ? 10(-8); P = 6.6 ? 10(-7) in the discovery set and P = 3.0 ? 10(-3) in the replication set) and rs8015138 upstream of GNG2 (P = 6.6 ? 10(-8); P = 5.3 ? 10(-7) in the discovery set and P = 0.01 in the replication set).

15796803	20050331	[Association between dopamine beta hydroxylase gene and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder complicated with disruptive behavior disorder].	Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a common behavior disorder of childhood, is a highly heterogeneous disease frequently accompanied by various mental disorders, including disruptive behavior disorder (DBD). Studies show that children suffering from ADHD with DBD are at higher risk of antisocial personality, substance abuse, and social adaptations disorder at their adulthood. The dopamine beta hydroxylase (DbetaH) is the key enzyme to ADHD since it catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine, and dysfunction there of is believed to be one of the causes of the disorder. To explore the association between DBH gene and ADHD complicated with or without DBD, the authors analyzed the transmission of a novel polymorphism DBH -1021C--&gt;T, which is found associated with plasma DbetaH activity, in ADHD nuclear families using transmission disequilibrium test (TDT). Consensus diagnoses were based on the DSM-IV. The samples included those from 292 Chinese Han nuclear families with ADHD probands. Genotypes of DBH -1021C--&gt;T polymorphism were determined by PCR amplification, endonuclease digesting and electrophoresis. The transmission of DBH -1021C--&gt;T polymorphism in ADHD nuclear families with or without DBD was analyzed by TDT. The results showed that there was transmission disequilibrium between DBH-1021C--&gt;T polymorphism and ADHD with or without DBD. In ADHD comorbid with DBD, T allele was preferentially transmitted (P &lt; 0.05); and in ADHD without DBD, so was the C allele (P &lt; 0.05). Among the three subtypes of ADHD, only ADHD-C subtype with DBD had an increased transmission of T allele (P &lt; 0.05). There is an association between DBH gene and ADHD comorbid with or without DBD, but the preferential transmission alleles are different. The low activity T allele is increased to transmit in ADHD with DBD, while the high activity C allele is preferentially transmitted in ADHD without DBD. The results support the proposition that the genetic mechanism is different between ADHD comorbid with or without DBD. We also found that only ADHD-C subtype with DBD is associated with DBH -1021C--&gt;T polymorphism in three subtypes of ADHD, which may suggest that there is a more intense relationship between DBD and ADHD-C subtype.

21364884	20110303	Apoptosis induced by cytoskeletal disruption requires distinct domains of MEKK1.	MEKK1 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) that activates the MAPK JNK and is required for microtubule inhibitor-induced apoptosis in B cells. Here, we find that apoptosis induced by actin disruption via cytochalasin D and by the protein phosphatase 1/2A inhibitor okadaic acid also requires MEKK1 activation. To elucidate the functional requirements for activation of the MEKK1-dependent apoptotic pathway, we created mutations within MEKK1. MEKK1-deficient cells were complemented with MEKK1 containing mutations in either the ubiquitin interacting motif (UIM), plant homeodomain (PHD), caspase cleavage site or the kinase domain at near endogenous levels of expression and tested for their sensitivity to each drug. We found that both the kinase activity and the PHD domain of MEKK1 are required for JNK activation and efficient induction of apoptosis by drugs causing cytoskeletal disruption. Furthermore, we discovered that modification of MEKK1 and its localization depends on the integrity of the PHD. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061
11000232	20000923	Attenuation of tick-borne encephalitis virus by structure-based site-specific mutagenesis of a putative flavivirus receptor binding site.	The impact of a specific region of the envelope protein E of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus on the biology of this virus was investigated by a site-directed mutagenesis approach. The four amino acid residues that were analyzed in detail (E308 to E311) are located on the upper-lateral surface of domain III according to the X-ray structure of the TBE virus protein E and are part of an area that is considered to be a potential receptor binding determinant of flaviviruses. Mutants containing single amino acid substitutions, as well as combinations of mutations, were constructed and analyzed for their virulence in mice, growth properties in cultured cells, and genetic stability. The most significant attenuation in mice was achieved by mutagenesis of threonine 310. Combining this mutation with deletion mutations in the 3'-noncoding region yielded mutants that were highly attenuated. The biological effects of mutation Thr 310 to Lys, however, could be reversed to a large degree by a mutation at a neighboring position (Lys 311 to Glu) that arose spontaneously during infection of a mouse. Mutagenesis of the other positions provided evidence for the functional importance of residue 308 (Asp) and its charge interaction with residue 311 (Lys), whereas residue 309 could be altered or even deleted without any notable consequences. Deletion of residue 309 was accompanied by a spontaneous second-site mutation (Phe to Tyr) at position 332, which in the three-dimensional structure of protein E is spatially close to residue 309. The information obtained in this study is relevant for the development of specific attenuated flavivirus strains that may serve as future live vaccines. 	J._Virol.	D016428
25505440	20141216	Cognition and emotional decision-making in chronic low back pain: an ERPs study during Iowa gambling task.	Previous reports documented abnormalities in cognitive functions and decision-making (DM) in patients with chronic pain, but these changes are not consistent across studies. Reasons for these discordant findings might include the presence of confounders, variability in chronic pain conditions, and the use of different cognitive tests. The present study was aimed to add evidence in this field, by exploring the cognitive profile of a specific type of chronic pain, i.e., chronic low back pain (cLBP). Twenty four cLBP patients and 24 healthy controls underwent a neuropsychological battery and we focused on emotional DM abilities by means of Iowa gambling task (IGT). During IGT, behavioral responses and the electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded in 12 patients and 12 controls. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were averaged o?ine from EEG epochs locked to the feedback presentation (4000 ms duration, from 2000 ms before to 2000 ms after the feedback onset) separately for wins and losses and the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P300 peak-to-peak amplitudes were calculated. Among cognitive measures, cLBP patients scored lower than controls in the modified card sorting test (MCST) and the score in this test was significantly influenced by pain duration and intensity. Behavioral IGT results documented worse performance and the absence of a learning process during the test in cLBP patients compared to controls, with no effect of pain characteristics. ERPs findings documented abnormal feedback processing in patients during IGT. cLBP patients showed poor performance in the MCST and the IGT. Abnormal feedback processing may be secondary to impingement of chronic pain in brain areas involved in DM or suggest the presence of a predisposing factor related to pain chronification. These abnormalities might contribute to the impairment in the work and family settings that often cLBP patients report. 	Front_Psychol	D016428
25329174	20141021	Stabilization of homoserine-O-succinyltransferase (MetA) decreases the frequency of persisters in Escherichia coli under stressful conditions.	Bacterial persisters are a small subpopulation of cells that exhibit multi-drug tolerance without genetic changes. Generally, persistence is associated with a dormant state in which the microbial cells are metabolically inactive. The bacterial response to unfavorable environmental conditions (heat, oxidative, acidic stress) induces the accumulation of aggregated proteins and enhances formation of persister cells in Escherichia coli cultures. We have found that methionine supplementation reduced the frequency of persisters at mild (37?C) and elevated (42?C) temperatures, as well as in the presence of acetate. Homoserine-o-succinyltransferase (MetA), the first enzyme in the methionine biosynthetic pathway, is prone to aggregation under many stress conditions, resulting in a methionine limitation in E. coli growth. Overexpression of MetA induced the greatest number of persisters at 42?C, which is correlated to an increased level of aggregated MetA. Substitution of the native metA gene on the E. coli K-12 WE chromosome by a mutant gene encoding the stabilized MetA led to reduction in persisters at the elevated temperature and in the presence of acetate, as well as lower aggregation of the mutated MetA. Decreased persister formation at 42?C was confirmed also in E. coli K-12 W3110 and a fast-growing WErph+ mutant harboring the stabilized MetA. Thus, this is the first study to demonstrate manipulation of persister frequency under stressful conditions by stabilization of a single aggregation-prone protein, MetA. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
23592992	20130418	Rab11-FIP1C and Rab14 direct plasma membrane sorting and particle incorporation of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein complex.	The incorporation of the envelope glycoprotein complex (Env) onto the developing particle is a crucial step in the HIV-1 lifecycle. The long cytoplasmic tail (CT) of Env is required for the incorporation of Env onto HIV particles in T cells and macrophages. Here we identify the Rab11a-FIP1C/RCP protein as an essential cofactor for HIV-1 Env incorporation onto particles in relevant human cells. Depletion of FIP1C reduced Env incorporation in a cytoplasmic tail-dependent manner, and was rescued by replenishment of FIP1C. FIP1C was redistributed out of the endosomal recycling complex to the plasma membrane by wild type Env protein but not by CT-truncated Env. Rab14 was required for HIV-1 Env incorporation, and FIP1C mutants incapable of binding Rab14 failed to rescue Env incorporation. Expression of FIP1C and Rab14 led to an enhancement of Env incorporation, indicating that these trafficking factors are normally limiting for CT-dependent Env incorporation onto particles. These findings support a model for HIV-1 Env incorporation in which specific targeting to the particle assembly microdomain on the plasma membrane is mediated by FIP1C and Rab14. 	PLoS_Pathog.

16243787	20051026	Function of the ribosomal E-site: a mutagenesis study.	Ribosomes synthesize proteins according to the information encoded in mRNA. During this process, both the incoming amino acid and the nascent peptide are bound to tRNA molecules. Three binding sites for tRNA in the ribosome are known: the A-site for aminoacyl-tRNA, the P-site for peptidyl-tRNA and the E-site for the deacylated tRNA leaving the ribosome. Here, we present a study of Escherichia coli ribosomes with the E-site binding destabilized by mutation C2394G of the 23S rRNA. Expression of the mutant 23S rRNA in vivo caused increased frameshifting and stop codon readthrough. The progression of these ribosomes through the ribosomal elongation cycle in vitro reveals ejection of deacylated tRNA during the translocation step or shortly after. E-site compromised ribosomes can undergo translocation, although in some cases it is less efficient and results in a frameshift. The mutation affects formation of the P/E hybrid site and leads to a loss of stimulation of the multiple turnover GTPase activity of EF-G by deacylated tRNA bound to the ribosome. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.

24019865	20130911	Bacteria- and IMD pathway-independent immune defenses against Plasmodium falciparum in Anopheles gambiae.	The mosquito Anopheles gambiae uses its innate immune system to control bacterial and Plasmodium infection of its midgut tissue. The activation of potent IMD pathway-mediated anti-Plasmodium falciparum defenses is dependent on the presence of the midgut microbiota, which activate this defense system upon parasite infection through a peptidoglycan recognition protein, PGRPLC. We employed transcriptomic and reverse genetic analyses to compare the P. falciparum infection-responsive transcriptomes of septic and aseptic mosquitoes and to determine whether bacteria-independent anti-Plasmodium defenses exist. Antibiotic treated aseptic mosquitoes mounted molecular immune responses representing a variety of immune functions upon P. falciparum infection. Among other immune factors, our analysis uncovered a serine protease inhibitor (SRPN7) and Clip-domain serine protease (CLIPC2) that were transcriptionally induced in the midgut upon P. falciparum infection, independent of bacteria. We also showed that SRPN7 negatively and CLIPC2 positively regulate the anti-Plasmodium defense, independently of the midgut-associated bacteria. Co-silencing assays suggested that these two genes may function together in a signaling cascade. Neither gene was regulated, nor modulated, by infection with the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei, suggesting that SRPN7 and CLIPC2 are components of a defense system with preferential activity towards P. falciparum. Further analysis using RNA interference determined that these genes do not regulate the anti-Plasmodium defense mediated by the IMD pathway, and both factors act as agonists of the endogenous midgut microbiota, further demonstrating the lack of functional relatedness between these genes and the bacteria-dependent activation of the IMD pathway. This is the first study confirming the existence of a bacteria-independent, anti-P. falciparum defense. Further exploration of this anti-Plasmodium defense will help clarify determinants of immune specificity in the mosquito, and expose potential gene and/or protein targets for malaria intervention strategies based on targeting the parasite in the mosquito vector.

27754403	20161019	Label-Free Differential Proteomics and Quantification of Exoenzymes from Isolates of the Entomopathogenic Fungus Beauveria bassiana.	 Beauveria bassiana is an entomopathogenic fungus that grows both in vivo and in vitro. In vivo it can colonize live insect hosts, and tissue digestion occurs by secreted hydrolytic exoenzymes. It can also colonize dead insect tissue provided this is free from competing microorganisms. Depending on whether the host is alive or dead the expression (quality/quantity) of the exoenzymes may vary. We have grown several isolates ofB. bassianain shaking flasks for 120 h at 25 ?C in order to evaluate the maximal exoenzyme production using two diet regimes. As sole carbon, nitrogen, and phosphate sources we used 1% shrimp chitin and either 0.5%w/vof dead intact American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) or their isolated cuticles. This is the first report of a differential proteomics ofB. bassianaexoenzymes performed by label-free nano-LC MS/MS. Total proteolytic enzyme activity was mainly due to Pr1A or Pr1B depending on the isolate and the diet regime. The most differentially secreted enzymes were: the cuticle-degrading subtilisin Pr1A, GH13 alpha-glycosidase, glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase, subtilisin-like proteinase Spm1, lipase 1, beta-1,3 exoglucanase, and endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase. Among theB. bassianaisolates analyzed, Bb 678 and Bb BG were the most active in Pr1A secretion. 	Insects	D016428
7789275	19950501	The Drosophila E74 gene is required for metamorphosis and plays a role in the polytene chromosome puffing response to ecdysone.	The steroid hormone ecdysone initiates Drosophila metamorphosis by reprogramming gene expression during late larval and prepupal development. The ecdysone-inducible gene E74, a member of the ets proto-oncogene family, has been proposed to play a key role in this process. E74 is encoded within the 74EF early puff and consists of two overlapping transcription units, E74A and E74B. To assess the function(s) of E74 during metamorphosis, we have isolated and characterized recessive loss-of-function mutations specific to each transcription unit. We find that mutations in E74A and E74B are predominantly lethal during prepupal and pupal development, consistent with a critical role for their gene products in metamorphosis. Phenotypic analysis reveals that E74 function is required for both pupariation and pupation, and for the metamorphosis of both larval and imaginal tissues. E74B mutants are defective in puparium formation and head eversion and die as prepupae or cryptocephalic pupae, while E74A mutants pupariate normally and die either as prepupae or pharate adults. We have also investigated the effects of the E74 mutations on gene expression by examining the puffing pattern of the salivary gland polytene chromosomes in newly formed mutant prepupae. Most puffs are only modestly affected by the E74B mutation, whereas a subset of late puffs are sub-maximally induced in E74A mutant prepupae. These observations are consistent with Ashburner's proposal that early puff proteins induce the formation of late puffs, and define E74A as a regulator of late puff activity. They also demonstrate that E74 plays a wide role in reshaping the insect during metamorphosis, affecting tissues other than the salivary gland in which it was originally identified.

22110593	20111124	Activation of c-MET induces a stem-like phenotype in human prostate cancer.	Prostate cancer consists of secretory cells and a population of immature cells. The function of immature cells and their mutual relation with secretory cells are still poorly understood. Immature cells either have a hierarchical relation to secretory cells (stem cell model) or represent an inducible population emerging upon appropriate stimulation of differentiated cells. Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) receptor c-MET is specifically expressed in immature prostate cells. Our objective is to determine the role of immature cells in prostate cancer by analysis of the HGF/c-MET pathway.Gene-expression profiling of DU145 prostate cancer cells stimulated with HGF revealed induction of a molecular signature associated with stem cells, characterized by up-regulation of CD49b, CD49f, CD44 and SOX9, and down-regulation of CD24 ('stem-like signature'). We confirmed the acquisition of a stem-like phenotype by quantitative PCR, FACS analysis and Western blotting. Further, HGF led to activation of the stem cell related Notch pathway by up-regulation of its ligands Jagged-1 and Delta-like 4. Small molecules SU11274 and PHA665752 targeting c-MET activity were both able to block the molecular and biologic effects of HGF. Knock-down of c-MET by shRNA infection resulted in significant reduction and delay of orthotopic tumour-formation in male NMRI mice. Immunohistochemical analysis in prostatectomies revealed significant enrichment of c-MET positive cells at the invasive front, and demonstrated co-expression of c-MET with stem-like markers CD49b and CD49f.In conclusion, activation of c-MET in prostate cancer cells induced a stem-like phenotype, indicating a dynamic relation between differentiated and stem-like cells in this malignancy. Its mediation of efficient tumour-formation in vivo and predominant receptor expression at the invasive front implicate that c-MET regulates tumour infiltration in surrounding tissues putatively by acquisition of a stem-like phenotype.

26126975	20150702	Directed altruistic living donation: what is wrong with the beauty contest?	This paper explores the specific criticism of directed altruistic living organ donation that it creates a 'beauty contest' between potential recipients of organs. The notion of the beauty contest in transplantation was recently used by Neidich et al who stated that '[a]ltruism should be the guiding motivation for all donations, and when it [is], there is no place for a beauty contest'. I examine this beauty contest objection from two perspectives. First, I argue that, when considered against the behaviour of donors, this objection cannot be consistently raised without also objecting to other common aspects of organ donation. I then explore the beauty contest objection from the perspective of recipients, and argue that if the beauty contest is objectionable, it is because of a tension between recipient behaviour and the altruism that supposedly underpins the donation system. I conclude by briefly questioning the importance of this tension in light of the organ shortage. 	J_Med_Ethics	D016428 D013485
24990759	20140704	Characterization of T gene sequence variants and germline duplications in familial and sporadic chordoma.	Chordoma is a rare bone cancer that is believed to originate from notochordal remnants. We previously identified germline T duplication as a major susceptibility mechanism in several chordoma families. Recently, a common genetic variant in T (rs2305089) was significantly associated with the risk of sporadic chordoma. We sequenced all T exons in 24 familial cases and 54 unaffected family members from eight chordoma families (three with T duplications), 103 sporadic cases, and 160 unrelated controls. We also measured T copy number variation in all sporadic cases. We confirmed the association between the previously reported variant rs2305089 and risk of familial [odds ratio (OR) = 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.93, 7.25, P = 0.067] and sporadic chordoma (OR = 2.85, 95% CI = 1.89, 4.29, P &lt; 0.0001). We also identified a second common variant, rs1056048, that was strongly associated with chordoma in families (OR = 4.14, 95% CI = 1.43, 11.92, P = 0.0086). Among sporadic cases, another common variant (rs3816300) was significantly associated with risk when jointly analyzed with rs2305089. The association with rs3816300 was significantly stronger in cases with early age onset. In addition, we identified three rare variants that were only observed among sporadic chordoma cases, all of which have potential functional relevance based on in silico predictions. Finally, we did not observe T duplication in any sporadic chordoma case. Our findings further highlight the importance of the T gene in the pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic chordoma and suggest a complex susceptibility related to T. 	Hum._Genet.

12574339	20030208	Protective mucosal immunity in aging is associated with functional CD4+ T cells in nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoreticular tissue.	Our previous studies showed that mucosal immunity was impaired in 1-year-old mice that had been orally immunized with OVA and native cholera toxin (nCT) as mucosal adjuvant. In this study, we queried whether similar immune dysregulation was also present in mucosal compartments of mice immunized by the nasal route. Both 1-year-old and young adult mice were immunized weekly with three nasal doses of OVA and nCT or with a nontoxic chimeric enterotoxin (mutant cholera toxin-A E112K/B subunit of native labile toxin) from Brevibacillus choshinensis. Elevated levels of OVA-specific IgG Abs in plasma and secretory IgA Abs in mucosal secretions (nasal washes, saliva, and fecal extracts) were noted in both young adult and 1-year-old mice given nCT or chimeric enterotoxin as mucosal adjuvants. Significant levels of OVA-specific CD4(+) T cell proliferative and OVA-induced Th1- and Th2-type cytokine responses were noted in cervical lymph nodes and spleen of 1-year-old mice. In this regard, CD4(+), CD45RB(+) T cells were detected in greater numbers in the nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoreticular tissues of 1-year-old mice than of young adult mice, but the same did not hold true for Peyer's patches or spleen. One-year-old mice given nasal tetanus toxoid plus the chimeric toxin as adjuvant were protected from lethal challenge with tetanus toxin. This result reinforced our findings that age-associated immune alterations occur first in gut-associated lymphoreticular tissues, and thus nasal delivery of vaccines for nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoreticular tissue-based mucosal immunity offers an attractive possibility to protect the elderly.

22451649	20120328	The role of ERp44 in maturation of serotonin transporter protein.	In heterologous and endogenous expression systems, we studied the role of ERp44 and its complex partner endoplasmic reticulum (ER) oxidase 1-? (Ero1-L?) in mechanisms regulating disulfide bond formation for serotonin transporter (SERT), an oligomeric glycoprotein. ERp44 is an ER lumenal chaperone protein that favors the maturation of disulfide-linked oligomeric proteins. ERp44 plays a critical role in the release of proteins from the ER via binding to Ero1-L?. Mutation in the thioredoxin-like domain hampers the association of ERp44C29S with SERT, which has three Cys residues (Cys-200, Cys-209, and Cys-109) on the second external loop. We further explored the role of the protein chaperones through shRNA knockdown experiments for ERp44 and Ero1-L?. Those efforts resulted in increased SERT localization to the plasma membrane but decreased serotonin (5-HT) uptake rates, indicating the importance of the ERp44 retention mechanism in the proper maturation of SERT proteins. These data were strongly supported with the data received from the N-biotinylaminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA-biotin) labeling of SERT on ERp44 shRNA cells. MTSEA-biotin only interacts with the free Cys residues from the external phase of the plasma membrane. Interestingly, it appears that Cys-200 and Cys-209 of SERT in ERp44-silenced cells are accessible to labeling by MTSEA-biotin. However, in the control cells, these Cys residues are occupied and produced less labeling with MTSEA-biotin. Furthermore, ERp44 preferentially associated with SERT mutants (C200S, C209S, and C109A) when compared with wild type. These interactions with the chaperone may reflect the inability of Cys-200 and Cys-209 SERT mutants to form a disulfide bond and self-association as evidenced by immunoprecipitation assays. Based on these collective findings, we hypothesize that ERp44 together with Ero1-L? plays an important role in disulfide formation of SERT, which may be a prerequisite step for the assembly of SERT molecules in oligomeric form.

21233210	20110115	ARF-like protein 16 (ARL16) inhibits RIG-I by binding with its C-terminal domain in a GTP-dependent manner.	Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) recognizes RNA virus-derived nucleic acids, which leads to the production of type I interferon (IFN) in most cell types. Tight regulation of RIG-I activity is important to prevent ultra-immune responses. In this study, we identified an ARF-like (ARL) family member, ARL16, as a protein that interacts with RIG-I. Overexpression of ARL16, but not its homologous proteins ARL1 and ARF1, inhibited RIG-I-mediated downstream signaling and antiviral activity. Knockdown of endogenous ARL16 by RNAi potentiated Sendai virus-induced IFN-? expression and vesicular stomatitis virus replication. ARL16 interacted with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RIG-I to suppress the association between RIG-I and RNA. ARL16 (T37N) and ARL16?45-54, which were restricted to the GTP-disassociated form, did not interact with RIG-I and also lost the inhibitory function. Furthermore, we suggest that endogenous ARL16 changes to GTP binding status upon viral infection and binds with the RIG-I CTD to negatively control its signaling activity. These findings suggested a novel innate immune function for an ARL family member, and a GTP-dependent model in which RIG-I is regulated. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
20969765	20101026	Shenqi fuzheng, an injection concocted from Chinese medicinal herbs, combined with platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review.	Platinum-based chemotherapy has been a standard therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but it has high toxicity. In China, Shenqi Fuzheng, a newly developed injection concocted from Chinese medicinal herbs has been reported that may increase efficacy and reduce toxicity when combined with platinum-based chemotherapy, but little is known about it outside of China. The aim of this study was to systematically review the existing clinical evidence on Shenqi Fuzheng Injection(SFI) combined with platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC. Pubmed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CNKI, and CBM search were organized for all documents published, in English and Chinese, until April 2010. The randomized controlled clinical trials were selected based on specific criteria, in which a SFI plus platinum-based chemotherapy treatment group was compared with a platinum-based chemotherapy control group for patients with advanced NSCLC. The quality of studies was assessed by modified Jadad's scale, and Revman 4.2 software was used for data syntheses and analyses. Twenty nine studies were included in this review based on our selection criteria. Of them, ten studies were of high quality and the rest were of low quality, according to the modified Jadad scale. The meta-analysis showed there was a statistically significant higher tumor response (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.32; P = 0.001) and performance status ((RR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.45 to 1.70; P &lt; 0.00001); but lower severe toxicity for WBC (RR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.47; P &lt; 0.00001), PLT (RR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.52; P &lt; 0.00001), HB (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.66; P &lt; 0.0001) and nausea and vomiting (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.47; P &lt; 0.00001), when the SFI plus platinum-based chemotherapy treatment group was compared with the platinum-based chemotherapy control group. Sensitivity analysis was restricted to studies with the high quality, and the result was similar when the studies with low quality were excluded. Asymmetry was observed in a funnel plot analysis, and Egger's test also indicated an evidence of publication bias (P = 0.016). SFI intervention appears to be useful to increase efficacy and reduce toxicity when combined with platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC, although this result needs to be further verified by more high-quality trials.

23360725	20130131	Association study of neuregulin-1 gene polymorphisms in a North Indian schizophrenia sample.	Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) gene polymorphisms have been proposed as risk factors for several common disorders. Associations with cognitive variation have also been tested. With regard to schizophrenia (SZ) risk, studies of Caucasian ancestry samples indicate associations more consistently than East Asian samples, suggesting heterogeneity. To exploit the differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure across ethnic groups, we conducted a SZ case-control study (that included cognitive evaluations) in a sample from the north Indian population. NRG1 variants (n=35 SNPs, three microsatellite markers) were initially analyzed among cases (DSM IV criteria, n=1007) and controls (n=1019, drawn from two groups) who were drawn from the same geographical region in North India. Nominally significant associations with SZ were next analyzed in relation to neurocognitive measures estimated with a computerized neurocognitive battery in a subset of the sample (n=116 cases, n=170 controls). Three variants and one microsatellite showed allelic association with SZ (rs35753505, rs4733263, rs6994992, and microsatellite 420M9-1395, p?0.05 uncorrected for multiple comparisons). A six marker haplotype 221121 (rs35753505-rs6994992-rs1354336-rs10093107-rs3924999-rs11780123) showed (p=0.0004) association after Bonferroni corrections. Regression analyses with the neurocognitive measures showed nominal (uncorrected) associations with emotion processing and attention at rs35753505 and rs6994992, respectively. Suggestive associations with SZ and SZ-related neurocognitive measures were detected with two SNPs from the NRG1 promoter region in a north Indian cohort. The functional role of the alleles merits further investigation. 	Schizophr._Res.	D016428
15468071	20041007	Mass spectrometric analysis of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1 ubiquitination mediated by cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2.	Signaling complexes formed on tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNF-R2) contain adaptor proteins TNF-R-associated factors (TRAFs) 1 and 2, and cellular inhibitors of apoptosis (cIAPs) 1 and 2 which function as regulators of programmed cell death. TRAF2, cIAP1 and cIAP2 all have RING finger domains known to possess E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, implying that ubiquitination may play an important role in the TNF signaling pathway. In this report, we have shown that cIAP2 specifically mediated ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of TRAF1. To identify the sites for cIAP2-mediated ubiquitination of TRAF1, we used high pressure liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Lys185 and Lys193 of TRAF1 were found to be modified with ubiquitin chains. Mutation of Lys185 and Lys193 to Arg almost completely blocked cIAP2-mediated ubiquitination of TRAF1, indicating that they are the major, if not the only, sites of TRAF1 ubiquitination. Our data suggest that cIAP2 may regulate the turnover of TRAF1 by adding polyubiquitin chains on Lys185 or Lys193 following its recruitment to TNF-R signaling complexes. 	Proteomics	D016428 D013485
24058521	20130924	Biological evaluation of the copper/low-density polyethylene nanocomposite intrauterine device.	Devices and materials intended for clinical applications as medical and implant devices should be evaluated to determine their biocompatibility in physiological systems. This article presents results from cytotoxicity assay of L929 mouse fibroblasts culture, tests for skin irritation, intracutaneous reactivity and sensitization, and material implantation tests for the novel copper/low-density polyethylene nanocomposite intrauterine device (nano-Cu/LDPE IUD) with potential for future clinical utilization. Cytotoxicity test in vitro was conducted to evaluate the change in morphology, growth and proliferation of cultured L929 mouse fibroblasts, which in vivo examination for skin irritation (n = 6) and intracutaneous reactivity (n = 6) were carried out to explore the irritant behavior in New Zealand White rabbits. Skin sensitization was implemented to evaluate the potential skin sensitizing in Hartley guinea pigs (n = 35). The materials were implanted into the spinal muscle of rabbits (n = 9). The cytotoxicity grade of the nano-Cu/LDPE IUD was 0-1, suggested that the composite was nontoxic or mildly cytotoxic; no irritation reaction and skin sensitization were identified in any animals of specific extracts prepared from the material under test; similarly to the control sides, the inflammatory reaction was observed in the rabbits living tissue of the implanted material in intramuscular implantation assay. They indicated that the novel composite intrauterine device presented potential for this type of application because they meet the requirements of the standard practices recommended for evaluating the biological reactivity. The nano-Cu/LDPE IUD has good biocompatibility, which is biologically safe for the clinical research as a novel contraceptive device. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
12523629	20030114	Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli isolates obtained from healthy children in Spain.	Antibiotic resistance and mechanisms involved were studied in Escherichia coli isolates from fecal samples of healthy children. Fifty fecal samples were analyzed, and one colony per sample was recovered and identified by biochemical and molecular tests. Forty-one E. coli isolates were obtained (82%). MIC testing was performed by agar dilution with 18 antibiotics, and the mechanisms of resistance were analyzed. Ampicillin resistance was detected in 24 isolates (58.5%), and blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaOXA type genes were studied by PCR and sequencing. The following beta-lactamases were detected (number of isolates): TEM (20), SHV-1 (1), and OXA-30 (1). The number of aminoglycoside-resistant isolates detected was as follows: streptomycin (15), tobramycin (1), gentamicin (1), and kanamycin (4). The aac(3)-IV gene was detected in the only gentamicin-resistant isolate. Nine (22%) and 2 (5%) isolates showed nalidixic acid (NALR) and ciprofloxacin resistance (CIPR), respectively. Mutations in GyrA and ParC proteins were shown in both NAL(R)-CIP(R) isolates and were the following: (1) GyrA (S83L + D87N), ParC (S801); and (2) GyrA (S83L + A84P), ParC (S80I + A108V). A single mutation in the S83 codon of the gyrA gene was found in the remaining seven NAL(R)-CIP(S) isolates. Tetracycline resistance was identified in 21 isolates (51%) and the following resistance genes were found (number of isolates): tetA (12), tetB (5), and tetD (1). Chloramphenicol resistance was detected in five isolates (12%). These results show that the intestinal tract of healthy children constitutes a reservoir of resistant bacteria and resistance genes.

21962599	20111004	Carrier frequency of a common mutation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A deficiency and long-term follow-up in Finland.	To assess the long-term clinical course of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) deficiency, caused by the c.1364A&gt;C (p.K455T) mutation, and the carrier frequency of this mutation in Finland. This was a long-term follow-up of patients in whom the common mutation was detected. Between 1999 and 2010, 6 cases of CPT1A deficiency were diagnosed and treated with a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet. The patients experienced their first symptoms during the first years of life, provoked by viral illness and/or fasting. The clinical features included hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hepatopathy, and loss of consciousness, ranging from transient unconsciousness to prolonged hyperlipidemic coma. Five cases carried a homozygous c.1364A&gt;C (p.K455T) mutation, whereas 1 case had a compound c.1364A&gt;C/c.1493A&gt;C (p.Y498S) mutation. During dietary therapy, the patients had few transient decompensations. No carriers of mutation c.1364A&gt;C were detected by minisequencing of 150 control samples. Even though CPT1A deficiency may be life-threatening and lead to prolonged coma, the long-term prognosis is good. A genotype-phenotype correlation implies that the mutations detected are disease-causing. Despite Finland's location close to the Arctic polar region, the carrier frequency of the c.1364A&gt;C mutation in Finland is far lower than that of the variants found in Alaskan, Canadian, and Greenland native populations.

24498195	20140206	ERK MAP kinase activation in spinal cord regulates phosphorylation of Cdk5 at serine 159 and contributes to peripheral inflammation induced pain/hypersensitivity.	Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase and its activity participates in the regulation of nociceptive signaling. Like binding with the activators (P35 or P25), the phosphorylation of Cdk5 plays a critical role in Cdk5 activation. However, it is still unclear whether Cdk5 phosphorylation (p-Cdk5) contributes to pain hyperalgesia. The aim of our current study was to identify the roles of p-Cdk5 and its upstream regulator in response to peripheral inflammation. Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) injection induced acute peripheral inflammation and heat hyperalgesia, which was accompanied by sustained increases in phospho-ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) and phospho-Cdk5(S159) (p-Cdk5(S159)) in the spinal cord dorsal horn (SCDH). CFA-induced p-ERK primarily colocalized with p-Cdk5(S159) in superficial dorsal horn neurons. Levels in p-ERK and p-Cdk5 were also increased in the 2(nd) phase of hyperalgesia induced by formalin injection, which can produce acute and tonic inflammatory pain. MAP kinase kinase inhibitor U0126 intrathecal delivery significantly suppressed the elevation of p-Cdk5(S159), Cdk5 activity and pain response behavior (Heat hyperalgesia, Spontaneous flinches) induced by CFA or formalin injection. Cdk5 inhibitor roscovitine intrathecal administration also suppressed CFA-induced heat hyperalgesia and Cdk5 phosphorylation, but did not attenuate ERK activation. All these findings suggested that p-Cdk5(S159) regulated by ERK pathway activity may be a critical mechanism involved in the activation of Cdk5 in nociceptive spinal neurons contributes to peripheral inflammatory pain hypersensitivity.

10350460	19990603	Mechanistic studies of the folding of human lysozyme and the origin of amyloidogenic behavior in its disease-related variants.	The unfolding and refolding properties of human lysozyme and two amyloidogenic variants (Ile56Thr and Asp67His) have been studied by stopped-flow fluorescence and hydrogen exchange pulse labeling coupled with mass spectrometry. The unfolding of each protein in 5.4 M guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) is well described as a two-state process, but the rates of unfolding of the Ile56Thr variant and the Asp67His variant in 5.4 M GuHCl are ca. 30 and 160 times greater, respectively, than that of the wild type. The refolding of all three proteins in 0.54 M GuHCl at pH 5.0 proceeds through persistent intermediates, revealed by multistep kinetics in fluorescence experiments and by the detection of well-defined populations in quenched-flow hydrogen exchange experiments. These findings are consistent with a predominant mechanism for refolding of human lysozyme in which one of the structural domains (the alpha-domain) is formed in two distinct steps and is followed by the folding of the other domain (the beta-domain) prior to the assembly of the two domains to form the native structure. The refolding kinetics of the Asp67His variant are closely similar to those of the wild-type protein, consistent with the location of this mutation in an outer loop of the beta-domain which gains native structure only toward the end of the refolding process. By contrast, the Ile56Thr mutation is located at the base of the beta-domain and is involved in the domain interface. The refolding of the alpha-domain is unaffected by this substitution, but the latter has the effect of dramatically slowing the folding of the beta-domain and the final assembly of the native structure. These studies suggest that the amyloidogenic nature of the lysozyme variants arises from a decrease in the stability of the native fold relative to partially folded intermediates. The origin of this instability is different in the two variants, being caused in one case primarily by a reduction in the folding rate and in the other by an increase in the unfolding rate. In both cases this results in a low population of soluble partially folded species that can aggregate in a slow and controlled manner to form amyloid fibrils. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485
10952219	20000822	Sex brings transposons and genomes into conflict.	Given that transposons are so abundant in mammalian genomes, it is natural to assume that through their maintenance the host gains some net benefit. This need not be true; sexual reproduction allows a transposon to go to fixation if the reduction in fitness of the host is anything less than two-fold. Obligate outcrossing sexual reproduction therefore favors the evolution of aggressive transposons, which in turn select for the evolution of host mechanisms that suppress transposon activity. Hosts that have asexual or self-fertilizing generations will select for transposons that are more benign and self-limiting than those of obligate sexuals, and obligate asexuals and uniparental organelle genomes will be free of active transposons if these impose any fitness penalty. We are interested in host mechanisms that suppress transposons in sexuals and have found that mammals (all of which are obligate sexuals) control their large populations of potentially active retroposons by methylating the five position of cytosine residues within promoter elements. This causes strong transcriptional repression and assembly of the affected sequences into the condensed state. Methylation also causes permanent inactivation in the germline by driving C--&gt;T transition mutations at methylated sites. It is now known that methylation remains in place for the large majority of the life of germ cells and is essential for control of the very large transposon burden. There is pressure on transposons to evolve mechanisms that overcome host suppression, and over evolutionary time, the balance swings back and forth between parasite and host. The ability of the mammalian genome to absorb and accumulate additional transposons has caused the amount of reverse transcriptase coding sequence in the human genome to far exceed the sum total of all cellular coding sequence. While transposons could, in principle, contribute functions useful to the host, the fact that asexual species and uniparental organelle genomes lack transposons is strong evidence that transposons have a net deleterious effect even in genomes that might be thought to require an additional source of plasticity. The abundance of transposons in many genomes cannot be taken as evidence of a mutualistic relationship, and the conflict between transposons and genomes may have actually retarded rather than accelerated evolution. It is suggested that the relationship between sex and transposons is as follows: (i) Obligate sexuals will tend to harbor aggressive transposons limited largely by host suppressive mechanisms, which in mammals involve methylation of transposon promoters. (ii) The aggressiveness of transposons in facultative sexuals and self-fertilizing sexuals will be in part self-limited and will be proportional to the relative frequency of asexual and outcrossing sexual generations. (iii) Obligate asexuals arid organelles transmitted in a uniparental manner will have no active transposons if these have a net negative effect on host fitness. 	Genetica	D016428 D013485 D013487
26524019	20151103	[Relation of MBL ExonI 54 and NF?B1-94ins/del ATTG Polymorphism with Fever during Neutropenia in Patients with Acute Leukaemia after Chemotherapy].	To explore the correlation between MBL ExonI 54 and NF?B1-94ins/del ATTG polymorphism and fever during neutropenia in patients with acute leukaemia (AL) (except M3) after first chemotherapy in Chinese Han population. Blood samples obtained from 76 fever patients with AL during neutropenia episodes were detected to analyse single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the MBL ExonI 54 and NF?B1-94ins/del ATTG gene, and analyse the correlation between above-mentioned 2 polymorphisms and fever during neutropenia of AL patients after chemotherapy. In 76 patients, no correlation were found between MBL ExonI 54 and NF?B1-94ins/del ATTG polymorphism and fever during neutropenia in patients with acute leukaemia after chemotherapy (P &gt; 0.05). No significant relation were found in sex, age, underlying disease, disease status or degrees of neutropenia in febrile neutropenia between MBL ExonI 54 and NF?B1-94ins/del ATTG polymorphism (P &gt; 0.05). However, patients with MBL ExonI 54 mutation presented longer febrile duration with a median of 5 days compared to 3 days of patients with wildtype MBL ExonI 54 genotype (P &lt; 0.05). There is no clear correlation between MBL ExonI 54 and NF?B1-94ins/del ATTG polymorphism and fever during neutropenia in patients with acute leukaemia after chemotherapy. However, the patients with MBL ExonI 54 mutation have been observed to present a longer febrile duration. 	Zhongguo_Shi_Yan_Xue_Ye_Xue_Za_Zhi	D004740 D016428
12725029	20030503	[K-ras gene mutations of asbestos and welding-fumes related human lung cancer].	To investigate the K-ras gene mutations in asbestos and welding-fumes related human lung cancer (hLC), comparing with the mutational spectrum of K-ras gene in non-occupational hLC, 8 cases of non-occupational hLC, 9 cases of asbestos-related hLC and 4 cases of welding-fumes related hLC were collected. The techniques of genomic DNA extraction, nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and DNA direct sequencing were employed. showed the mutation frequencies of K-ras gene were 25% in non-occupational hLC and welding-fumes related hLC, whereas 44.4% in asbestos-related hLC. Mutations mainly occurred in codons 12 and 15. A mutation of codon 13 was detected in welding-fumes related hLC. The type of base substitution was principally G--&gt;T transversion in non-occupational hLC, whereas mainly G--&gt;A transition in asbestos and welding-fumes related hLC. THE RESULTS suggested there were obvious differences of K-ras gene mutations among non-occupational hLC, asbestos and silica related hLC. Therefore, different mechanisms of carcinogenesis were implicated among them. However, no speific spectrum of K-ras gene mutation can be derived from welding-fumes related hLC because of the limitation of samples. 	Wei_Sheng_Yan_Jiu	D004740 D016428 D013485
870028	19770503	Evidence for topographical analogy between methionine-enkephalin and morphine derivatives.	Analogues of the endogenous opiate-receptor ligand [5-methionine]enkephalin (H-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-OH) were designed and synthesized for the purpose of testing the proposed similarity in spatial structure between this peptide and morphine derivatives. In the bioassay (inhibition of electrically induced contractions of the mouse vas deferens) [1-O-methyltyrosine,5-methionine]enkephalin, [1-N-methyltyrosine,5-methionine]enkephalin, [4-tryptophan,5-methionine]enkephalin, and [5-methionine sulfoxide]enkephalin possess, respectively, 0.4, 21, 27, and 67% activity of [5-methionine]enkephalin. These morphinomimetic activities correlate well with the opiate receptor affinities determined by displacement of [3H]naloxone in a guinea pig brain membrane preparation. The effects of O-methylation of the tyrosine residue and N-methylation of the terminal amino group on biological activity and receptor affinity support the hypothesis that the latter two moieties in the peptide correspond to the phenol group and the tertiary nitrogen, respectively, in morphine. Determination of the efficiency of energy transfer from tyrosine in position 1 to tryptophan in position 4 in [4-tryptophan,5-methionine]enkephalin from both tyrosine fluorescence quenching and relative enhancement of tryptophan fluorescence by means of a modified procedure permitted the calculation of an average intramolecular tyrosine-tryptophan separation of 10.0 +/- 1.1 A. Inspection of CPK models showed excellent agreement between this value and both the intrafluorophore distance in the 4 leads to 1 and 5 leads to 2 hydrogen bonded betaI-bend models of [4-tryptophan,5-methionine]enkephalin (9-11 A) and the phenol-phenyl separation in the potent morphine derivative 7alpha-(1(R)-hydroxy-1-methyl-3-phenylpropyl)-6,14-endo-ethenotetrahydrooripavine (8-10.5 A). The ensemble of these findings suggests an analogous topography for [5-methionine]enkephalin and morphine-oripavine derivatives. 	Biochemistry	D003160 D016428
24941200	20140619	Mechanisms of U87 astrocytoma cell uptake and trafficking of monomeric versus protofibril Alzheimer's disease amyloid-? proteins.	A significant hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the formation of senile plaques in the brain due to the unbalanced levels of amyloid-beta (A?). However, although how A? is produced from amyloid precursor proteins is well understood, little is known regarding the clearance and metabolism of various A? aggregates from the brain. Similarly, little is known regarding how astrocytes internalize and degrade A?, although astrocytes are known to play an important role in plaque maintenance and A? clearance. The objective of this study is to investigate the cellular mechanisms that mediate the internalization of soluble monomeric versus oligomeric A? by astrocytes. We used a combination of laser confocal microscopy and genetic and pharmacological experiments to dissect the internalization of sA?42 and oA?42 and their postendocytic transport by U87 human brain astrocytoma cell line. Both A?42 species were internalized by U87 cells through fluid phase macropinocytosis, which required dynamin 2. Depleting LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) decreased sA?42 uptake more significantly than that of oA?42. We finally show that both A?42 species were rapidly transported to lysosomes through an endolytic pathway and subjected to proteolysis after internalization, which had no significant toxic effects to the U87 cells under relatively low concentrations. We propose that macropinocytic sA?42 and oA?42 uptake and their subsequent proteolytic degradation in astroglial cells is a significant mechanism underlying A? clearance from the extracellular milieu. Understanding the molecular events involved in astrocytic A? internalization may identify potential therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
24932547	20140617	Active-state model of a dopamine D2 receptor-G?i complex stabilized by aripiprazole-type partial agonists.	Partial agonists exhibit a submaximal capacity to enhance the coupling of one receptor to an intracellular binding partner. Although a multitude of studies have reported different ligand-specific conformations for a given receptor, little is known about the mechanism by which different receptor conformations are connected to the capacity to activate the coupling to G-proteins. We have now performed molecular-dynamics simulations employing our recently described active-state homology model of the dopamine D2 receptor-G?i protein-complex coupled to the partial agonists aripiprazole and FAUC350, in order to understand the structural determinants of partial agonism better. We have compared our findings with our model of the D2R-G?i-complex in the presence of the full agonist dopamine. The two partial agonists are capable of inducing different conformations of important structural motifs, including the extracellular loop regions, the binding pocket and, in particular, intracellular G-protein-binding domains. As G-protein-coupling to certain intracellular epitopes of the receptor is considered the key step of allosterically triggered nucleotide-exchange, it is tempting to assume that impaired coupling between the receptor and the G-protein caused by distinct ligand-specific conformations is a major determinant of partial agonist efficacy.

18405391	20080415	Expression of estrogen receptor beta in the breast carcinoma of BRCA1 mutation carriers.	Breast cancers (BC) in women carrying mutations in BRCA1 gene are more frequently estrogen receptor negative than the nonhereditary BC. Nevertheless, tamoxifen has been found to have a protective effect in preventing contralateral tumors in BRCA1 mutation carriers. The identification of the second human estrogen receptor, ERbeta, raised a question of its role in hereditary breast cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of ERalpha, ERbeta, PgR (progesterone receptor) and HER-2 expression in breast cancer patients with mutated BRCA1 gene and in the control group. The study group consisted of 48 women with BRCA1 gene mutations confirmed by multiplex PCR assay. The patients were tested for three most common mutations of BRCA1 affecting the Polish population (5382insC, C61G, 4153delA). Immunostaining for ERalpha, ERbeta and PgR (progesterone receptor) was performed using monoclonal antibodies against ERalpha, PgR (DakoCytomation), and polyclonal antibody against ERbeta (Chemicon). The EnVision detection system was applied. The study population comprised a control group of 120 BC operated successively during the years 1998-99. The results of our investigation showed that BRCA1 mutation carriers were more likely to have ERalpha-negative breast cancer than those in the control group. Only 14.5% of BRCA1-related cancers were ERalpha-positive compared with 57.5% in the control group (P &lt; 0.0001). On the contrary, the expression of ERbeta protein was observed in 42% of BRCA1-related tumors and in 55% of the control group. An interesting finding was that most hereditary cancers (75% of the whole group) were triple-negative: ERalpha(-)/PgR(-)/HER-2(-) but almost half of this group (44.4%) showed the expression of ERbeta. In the case of BRCA1-associated tumors the expression of ERbeta was significantly higher than the expression of ERalpha. This may explain the effectiveness of tamoxifen in preventing contralateral breast cancer development in BRCA1 mutation carriers. 	BMC_Cancer	D016428
8621570	19960419	Essential amino acids for substrate binding and catalysis of human flap endonuclease 1.	Human flap endonuclease 1 (FEN-1) is a member of the structure-specific endonuclease family and is involved in DNA repair. Eight restrictively conserved amino acids in FEN-1 have been converted individually to an alanine to elucidate their roles in specific DNA substrate binding and catalysis. Flap endonuclease activity of the wild type and mutant enzymes was measured by kinetic flow cytometry. Mutants D34A, D86A, and D181A lost their cleavage activity completely but retained substrate binding ability, as measured by their ability to inhibit the wild type enzyme in a competition assay. This indicates that these amino acids contribute to integrity of the enzyme active site. Loss of both binding and cleavage competency for the flap substrate by mutants E156A, G231A, and D233A suggests that these amino acids are involved in substrate binding. Mutants R103A and D179A retained wild type-like enzyme activity. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485 D013486 D013487
17490420	20070511	Genetic variation within the APPL locus is not associated with metabolic or inflammatory traits in a healthy White population.	APPL1 (adaptor protein containing PH domain, PTB domain and leucine zipper motif 1) is the first identified cytosolic protein that directly binds to adiponectin receptors and mediates cellular responses to adiponectin. We set out to determine whether genetic variation within the APPL locus (encoding APPL1) contributes to insulin resistance, changes in lipid metabolism or inflammatory parameters in a healthy White population. We genotyped 640 healthy subjects with and without a family history of diabetes for the four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs6774584, rs3087684, rs17791685 and rs528035 and performed correlational analyses with metabolic and inflammatory traits. SNPs rs6774584, rs3087684, rs17791685 and rs528035 are representative of the four blocks of high linkage disequilibrium covering a 78-kb genomic locus that harbours the APPL gene. None of these SNPs correlated with anthropometric data (gender, age, body mass index, body fat, waist-hip ratio) or with family history of diabetes. Furthermore, no correlations were found with parameters of insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion. None of the SNPs was correlated with ectopic lipid content or with plasma lipids (non-esterified fatty acids, glycerol, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol). Moreover, no correlations were detected with leucocyte measures or plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, interleukin 6 or tumour necrosis factor-alpha. Finally, diplotypes derived from these SNPs did not reveal correlations with insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, lipid measures or inflammatory parameters either. We conclude that genetic variation within the APPL locus may not play a major role in the development of prediabetes phenotypes. 	Diabet._Med.	D016428 D013485
24262586	20131123	Human leucocyte antigen-G polymorphisms are associated with cervical squamous cell carcinoma risk in Taiwanese women.	The mere presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) is not enough for cervical cancer development and immunogenetic background may play an important role. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-G acts as a negative regulator of immune responses and its expression in tumour cells may enable them to avoid immune attack. We aim to study if polymorphisms in the HLA-G gene are associated with cervical cancer risk in Taiwanese women. +1537 A/C, 14-bp deletion/insertion (Del/Ins), and +3142 G/C polymorphisms were genotyped in a hospital-based study of 317 women with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and 400 healthy control women frequency matched by age. The presence and genotypes of HPV in CSCC were determined. We found the +3142 C/C genotype and C allele were associated with increased risk for CSCC (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.78, P=0.004; adjusted OR=1.31, P=0.014, respectively). In subgroup analysis based on HPV type 16 positivity, significant associations with higher adjusted ORs were found in +3142 C/C genotype and C allele (adjusted OR=2.19, P=0.001; adjusted OR=1.48, P=0.003, respectively) and +1537 C/C genotype and C allele frequencies increased significantly (adjusted OR=2.88, P=0.004; adjusted OR=1.69, P=0.0005, respectively). Furthermore, the C-Del-C haplotype conferred increased risk of both CSCC and HPV-16 positive CSCC women (adjusted OR=1.41, P=0.009; adjusted OR=1.94, P=0.0001, respectively). These findings suggest that HLA-G gene is involved in the susceptibility to CSCC. 	Eur._J._Cancer	D016428 D013485
1438164	19920901	Selection of a thermostable variant of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (Cat-86).	The moderate thermophile Bacillus stearothermophilus was used as a host in which to detect more thermostable variants of the B.pumilus chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (Cat-86) protein. Seventeen mutants were isolated and detected by their ability to grow in the presence of chloramphenicol at a previously restrictive temperature (58 degrees C). The genes encoding these proteins were sequenced; all 17 mutants carried the same C to T transition that conferred an amino acid substitution of alanine by valine at position 203 of the protein sequence. The wild-type and one mutant Cat-86 protein were purified to homogeneity using affinity chromatography, and kinetic and thermal stability studies were undertaken. Both enzymes had similar sp. act. in the region of 215 U/mg, with Km values for chloramphenicol in the range 13.8-15.4 microM and for acetyl CoA in the range 13.6-15.5 microM. The A203V mutant shows greater stability than the wild-type Cat-86 protein at temperatures above 50 degrees C and appears to pass through a transition state between 48 and 50 degrees C. 	Protein_Eng.

19172179	20090128	The ubiquitin ligase RPM-1 and the p38 MAPK PMK-3 regulate AMPA receptor trafficking.	Ubiquitination occurs at synapses, yet its role remains unclear. Previous studies demonstrated that the RPM-1 ubiquitin ligase organizes presynaptic boutons at neuromuscular junctions in C. elegans motorneurons. Here we find that RPM-1 has a novel postsynaptic role in interneurons, where it regulates the trafficking of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor GLR-1 from synapses into endosomes. Mutations in rpm-1 cause the aberrant accumulation of GLR-1 in neurites. Moreover, rpm-1 mutations enhance the endosomal accumulation of GLR-1 observed in mutants for lin-10, a Mint2 ortholog that promotes GLR-1 recycling from Syntaxin-13 containing endosomes. As in motorneurons, RPM-1 negatively regulates the pmk-3/p38 MAPK pathway in interneurons by repressing the protein levels of the MAPKKK DLK-1. This regulation of PMK-3 signaling is critical for RPM-1 function with respect to GLR-1 trafficking, as pmk-3 mutations suppress both lin-10 and rpm-1 mutations. Positive or negative changes in endocytosis mimic the effects of rpm-1 or pmk-3 mutations, respectively, on GLR-1 trafficking. Specifically, RAB-5(GDP), an inactive mutant of RAB-5 that reduces endocytosis, mimics the effect of pmk-3 mutations when introduced into wild-type animals, and occludes the effect of pmk-3 mutations when introduced into pmk-3 mutants. By contrast, RAB-5(GTP), which increases endocytosis, suppresses the effect of pmk-3 mutations, mimics the effect of rpm-1 mutations, and occludes the effect of rpm-1 mutations. Our findings indicate a novel specialized role for RPM-1 and PMK-3/p38 MAPK in regulating the endosomal trafficking of AMPARs at central synapses. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061 D013485
27529213	20160817	The Potential Role of Kallistatin in the Development of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.	Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a vascular condition that causes permanent dilation of the abdominal aorta, which can lead to death due to aortic rupture. The only treatment for AAA is surgical repair, and there is no current drug treatment for AAA. Aortic inflammation, vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis, angiogenesis, oxidative stress and vascular remodeling are implicated in AAA pathogenesis. Kallistatin is a serine proteinase inhibitor, which has been shown to have a variety of functions, potentially relevant in AAA pathogenesis. Kallistatin has been reported to have inhibitory effects on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-?) signaling induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. Kallistatin also inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Wnt canonical signaling, which promote inflammation, angiogenesis, and vascular remodeling in various pre-clinical experimental models. This review explores the potential protective role of kallistatin in AAA pathogenesis. 	Int_J_Mol_Sci	D016428 D016454
23706069	20130528	The 372 T/C genetic polymorphism of TIMP-1 is associated with serum levels of TIMP-1 and survival in patients with severe sepsis.	Previous studies have found higher circulating levels of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 in nonsurviving septic patients than in surviving septic patients, and an association between the 372 T/C genetic polymorphism of TIMP-1 and the risk of developing certain diseases. However, the relationship between genetic polymorphisms of TIMP-1, circulating TIMP-1 levels and survival in patients with severe sepsis has not been examined, and this was the objective of the study. This multicentre, prospective, observational study was carried out in six Spanish ICUs. We determined the 372 T/C genetic polymorphism of TIMP-1 (rs4898), serum levels of TIMP-1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, MMP-10, TNF?, IL-10 and plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Survival at 30 days from ICU admission was the endpoint assessed. The association between continuous variables was carried out using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient or Spearman's rho coefficient. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to determine the association between the 372 T/C genetic polymorphism and survival 30 days from ICU admission. Of 275 patients with severe sepsis, 80 had genotype CC, 55 had genotype CT and 140 had genotype TT of the 372 T/C genetic polymorphism of TIMP-1. Patients with the T allele showed higher serum levels of TIMP-1 than patients without the T allele (P=0.004). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the T allele was associated with higher mortality at 30 days (odds ratio=2.08; 95% confidence interval=1.06 to 4.09; P=0.03). Survival analysis showed that patients with the T allele presented lower 30-day survival than patients without the T allele (?2=5.77; P=0.016). We found an association between TIMP-1 levels and levels of MMP-9 (?=-0.19; P=0.002), MMP-10 (?=0.55; P&lt;0.001), TNF? (?=0.56; P&lt;0.001), IL-10 (?=0.48; P&lt;0.001) and PAI-1 (?=0.49; P&lt;0.001). The novel findings of our study are that septic patients with the T allele in the 372 T/C genetic polymorphism of TIMP-1 showed higher serum TIMP-1 levels and lower survival rate. The determination of the 372 T/C genetic polymorphism of TIMP-1 thus has prognostic implications and could help in the selection of patients who may benefit from modulation of the MMP/TIMP balance.

24124051	20131015	Instruction of haematopoietic lineage choices, evolution of transcriptional landscapes and cancer stem cell hierarchies derived from an AML1-ETO mouse model.	The t(8;21) chromosomal translocation activates aberrant expression of the AML1-ETO (AE) fusion protein and is commonly associated with core binding factor acute myeloid leukaemia (CBF AML). Combining a conditional mouse model that closely resembles the slow evolution and the mosaic AE expression pattern of human t(8;21) CBF AML with global transcriptome sequencing, we find that disease progression was characterized by two principal pathogenic mechanisms. Initially, AE expression modified the lineage potential of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), resulting in the selective expansion of the myeloid compartment at the expense of normal erythro- and lymphopoiesis. This lineage skewing was followed by a second substantial rewiring of transcriptional networks occurring in the trajectory to manifest leukaemia. We also find that both HSC and lineage-restricted granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) acquired leukaemic stem cell (LSC) potential being capable of initiating and maintaining the disease. Finally, our data demonstrate that long-term expression of AE induces an indolent myeloproliferative disease (MPD)-like myeloid leukaemia phenotype with complete penetrance and that acute inactivation of AE function is a potential novel therapeutic option.

26300531	20150825	Phylogenetic characterization and promoter expression analysis of a novel hybrid protein disulfide isomerase/cargo receptor subfamily unique to plants and chromalveolates.	Protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) play critical roles in protein folding by catalyzing the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds in nascent secretory proteins. There are six distinct PDI subfamilies in terrestrial plants. A unique feature of PDI-C subfamily members is their homology to the yeast retrograde (Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum) cargo receptor proteins, Erv41p and Erv46p. Here, we demonstrate that plant Erv41p/Erv46p-like proteins are divided into three subfamilies: ERV-A, ERV-B and PDI-C, which all possess the N-proximal and C-proximal conserved domains of yeast Erv41p and Erv46p. However, in PDI-C isoforms, these domains are separated by a thioredoxin domain. The distribution of PDI-C isoforms among eukaryotes indicates that the PDI-C subfamily likely arose through an ancient exon-shuffling event that occurred before the divergence of plants from stramenopiles and rhizarians. Arabidopsis has three PDI-C genes: PDI7, PDI12, and PDI13. PDI12- and PDI13-promoter: ?-glucuronidase (GUS) gene fusions are co-expressed in pollen and stipules, while PDI7 is distinctly expressed in the style, hydathodes, and leaf vasculature. The PDI-C thioredoxin domain active site motif CxxS is evolutionarily conserved among land plants. Whereas PDI12 and PDI13 retain the CxxS motif, PDI7 has a CxxC motif similar to classical PDIs. We hypothesize that PDI12 and PDI13 maintain the ancestral roles of PDI-C in Arabidopsis, while PDI7 has undergone neofunctionalization. The unusual PDI/cargo receptor hybrid arrangement in PDI-C isoforms has no counterpart in animals or yeast, and predicts the need for pairing redox functions with cargo receptor processes during protein trafficking in plants and other PDI-C containing organisms.

24340836	20131218	Association of the M3151 variant in the transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor-1 (TRPV1) gene with type 1 diabetes in an Ashkenazi Jewish population.	Type 1 diabetes in humans is an autoimmune disease in which Tcells target pancreatic islets of Langerhans, leading to the progressive destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of autoimmune diabetes. The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of human type 1 diabetes demonstrates two missense mutations in the transient receptor potentialvanilloid receptor-1 (TRPVi) gene. To investigate whether polymorphism in the TRPV1 gene may play a role in the predisposition to human type 1 diabetes. We genotyped 146 Ashkenazi Jewish type 1 diabetic patients and 205 Ashkenazi Jewish healthy controls for the rs222747 (M3151), rs224534 (T4691) and rs8065080 (1585V) variants of the TRPV1 gene. There was a significant increase in the rs222747 (M3151) variant of the TRPV1 gene in the type 1 diabetes cohort compared to the control: rs222747 (M3151) homozygous: (61% vs. 48.3%, P = 0.02). Logistic regression analysis revealed that type 1 diabetes was significantly associated with rs222747 (M3151), such that having diabetes increased the odds of rs222747 homozygosity (M3151) by 67.2%, odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.08-2.57, P &lt; 0.02. No difference was found in the rs224534 (T4691) and rs8065080 (1585V) allelic variants. There was no difference in any of the TRPV1 variants by gender, age when type 1 diabetes was diagnosed, body mass index, glycemic control, blood pressure, positive autoantibodies (ICA, GAD, IAA), and other autoimmune diseases. Our study demonstrates that TRPV1 may be a susceptible gene for type 1 diabetes in an Ashkenazi Jewish population. These results should be replicated in the same ethnic group and in other ethnic groups. 	Isr._Med._Assoc._J.	D016428 D016448
21152082	20101215	Codon preference optimization increases heterologous PEDF expression.	Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is widely known for its neurotrophic and antiangiogenic functions. Efficacy studies of PEDF in animal models are limited because of poor heterologous protein yields. Here, we redesigned the human PEDF gene to preferentially match codon frequencies of E coli without altering the amino acid sequence. Following de novo synthesis, codon optimized PEDF (coPEDF) and the wtPEDF genes were cloned into pET32a containing a 5' thioredoxin sequence (Trx) and the recombinant Trx-coPEDF or Trx-wtPEDF fusion constructs expressed in native and two tRNA augmented E coli hosts - BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL and BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RP, carrying extra copies of tRNAarg,ile,leu and tRNAarg,pro genes, respectively. Trx-PEDF fusion proteins were isolated using Ni-NTA metal affinity chromatography and PEDF purified after cleavage with factor X?. Protein purity and identity were confirmed by western blot, MALDI-TOF, and UV/CD spectral analyses. Expression of the synthetic gene was ?3.4 fold greater (212.7 mg/g; 62.1 mg/g wet cells) and purified yields ?4 fold greater (41.1 mg/g; 11.3 mg/g wet cell) than wtPEDF in the native host. A small increase in expression of both genes was observed in hosts supplemented with rare tRNA genes compared to the native host but expression of coPEDF was ?3 fold greater than wtPEDF in both native and codon-bias-adjusted E coli strains. ?Gs at -3 to +50 of the Trx site of both fusion genes were -3.9 kcal/mol. Functionally, coPEDF was equally as effective as wtPEDF in reducing oxidative stress, promoting neurite outgrowth, and blocking endothelial tube formation. These findings suggest that while rare tRNA augmentation and mRNA folding energies can significantly contribute to increased protein expression, preferred codon usage, in this case, is advantageous to translational efficiency of biologically active PEDF in E coli. This strategy will undoubtedly fast forward studies to validate therapeutic utility of PEDF in vivo. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
27271461	20160609	Freehand three-dimensional ultrasound to assess semitendinosus muscle morphology.	In several neurological disorders and muscle injuries, morphological changes of the m. semitendinosus (ST) are presumed to contribute to movement limitations around the knee. Freehand three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US), using position tracking of two-dimensional US images to reconstruct a 3D voxel array, can be used to assess muscle morphology in?vivo. The aims of this study were: (i) to introduce a newly developed 3D US protocol for ST; and (ii) provide a first comparison of morphological characteristics determined by 3D US with those measured on dissected cadaveric muscles. Morphological characteristics of ST (e.g. muscle belly length, tendon length, fascicle length and whole muscle volume, and volumes of both compartments) were assessed in six cadavers using a 3D US protocol. Subsequently, ST muscles were removed from the body to measure the same morphological characteristics. Mean differences between morphological characteristics measured by 3D US and after dissection were smaller than 10%. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were higher than 0.75 for all variables except for the lengths of proximal fascicles (ICC?=?0.58). Measurement of the volume of proximal compartment by 3D US was not feasible, due to low US image quality proximally. We conclude that the presented 3D US protocol allows for reasonably accurate measurements of key morphological characteristics of ST muscle. 	J._Anat.	D016428 D013485
23634980	20130503	Activating mutations and senescence secretome: new insights into HER2 activation, drug sensitivity and metastatic progression.	HER2 amplification and overexpression is observed in approximately 20% of breast cancers and is strongly associated with poor prognosis and therapeutic responsiveness to HER2 targeted agents. A recent study by Bose and colleagues suggests that another subset of breast cancer patients without HER2 amplification but with activating HER2 mutation might also benefit from existing HER2-targeted agents and the authors functionally characterize these somatic mutations in experimental models. In a second study on HER2-driven breast cancer, Angelini and colleagues investigate how the constitutively active, truncated carboxy-terminal fragment of HER2, p95HER2, promotes metastatic progression through non-cellautonomous secretion of factors from senescent cells. These new findings advance our understanding of HER2 biology in the context of HER2 activation as well as offer new insights into our understanding of drug sensitivity and metastatic progression.

2775212	19890701	Changes in collagen stability and folding in lethal perinatal osteogenesis imperfecta. The effect of alpha 1 (I)-chain glycine-to-arginine substitutions.	The effect of glycine-to-arginine mutations in the alpha 1 (I)-chain on collagen triple-helix structure in lethal perinatal osteogenesis imperfecta was studied by determination of the helix denaturation temperature and by computerized molecular modelling. Arginine substitutions at glycine residues 391 and 667 resulted in similar small decreases in helix stability. Molecular modelling suggested that the glycine-to-arginine-391 mutant resulted in only a relatively small localized disruption to the helix structure. Thus the glycine-to-arginine substitutions may lead to only a small structural abnormality of the collagen helix, and it is most likely that the over-modification of lysine, poor secretion, increased degradation and other functional sequelae result from a kinetic defect in collagen helix formation resulting from the mutation.

19890389	20091106	Improvements of sound localization abilities by the facial ruff of the barn owl (Tyto alba) as demonstrated by virtual ruff removal.	When sound arrives at the eardrum it has already been filtered by the body, head, and outer ear. This process is mathematically described by the head-related transfer functions (HRTFs), which are characteristic for the spatial position of a sound source and for the individual ear. HRTFs in the barn owl (Tyto alba) are also shaped by the facial ruff, a specialization that alters interaural time differences (ITD), interaural intensity differences (ILD), and the frequency spectrum of the incoming sound to improve sound localization. Here we created novel stimuli to simulate the removal of the barn owl's ruff in a virtual acoustic environment, thus creating a situation similar to passive listening in other animals, and used these stimuli in behavioral tests. HRTFs were recorded from an owl before and after removal of the ruff feathers. Normal and ruff-removed conditions were created by filtering broadband noise with the HRTFs. Under normal virtual conditions, no differences in azimuthal head-turning behavior between individualized and non-individualized HRTFs were observed. The owls were able to respond differently to stimuli from the back than to stimuli from the front having the same ITD. By contrast, such a discrimination was not possible after the virtual removal of the ruff. Elevational head-turn angles were (slightly) smaller with non-individualized than with individualized HRTFs. The removal of the ruff resulted in a large decrease in elevational head-turning amplitudes. The facial ruff a) improves azimuthal sound localization by increasing the ITD range and b) improves elevational sound localization in the frontal field by introducing a shift of iso-ILD lines out of the midsagittal plane, which causes ILDs to increase with increasing stimulus elevation. The changes at the behavioral level could be related to the changes in the binaural physical parameters that occurred after the virtual removal of the ruff. These data provide new insights into the function of external hearing structures and open up the possibility to apply the results on autonomous agents, creation of virtual auditory environments for humans, or in hearing aids.

26239045	20150805	Impact of cytochrome P450 2C19 polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus when coadministered with voriconazole.	This study evaluated the effects of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 polymorphisms on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics when coadministered with voriconazole. Eighteen healthy volunteers, including 6 individuals in each CYP2C19 genotype (extensive metabolizers [EMs], intermediate metabolizers [IMs], and poor metabolizers [PMs]), received a single oral dose of 3?mg tacrolimus alone or in combination with 200?mg voriconazole twice daily at steady state. When tacrolimus was coadministered with voriconazole, a significant increase in area under its concentration-time curve (AUC0-24 ) was observed for all genotypes. AUC0-12 of voriconazole in IMs and PMs were significantly higher than that in EMs (P?&lt;?.05 and P?&lt;?.01, respectively). Consequently, AUC0-24 of tacrolimus in combination with voriconazole in IMs and PMs were also significantly higher than that in EMs (P?&lt;?.05). These results demonstrate that CYP2C19 genotypes influenced the exposure of tacrolimus when coadministered with voriconazole, although tacrolimus is mainly metabolized by CYP3A.

18387740	20080405	Serotonin receptor 1A-1019C/G variant: impact on antidepressant pharmacoresponse in melancholic depression?	Previous studies on the effects of serotonin receptor 1A (5-HT1A) gene variation on treatment response in depression revealed inconsistent results with studies pointing towards a detrimental influence of the 5-HT1A-1019G allele on antidepressant treatment response, while others did not discern any involvement of 5-HT1A variants. In order to further delineate the impact of 5-HT1A gene variation on pharmacoresponse in depression over 6 weeks of antidepressant treatment, the influence of the 5-HT1A-1019C/G (rs6295) polymorphism was investigated in 340 Caucasian patients with a Major Depressive Episode (DSM-IV) with particular attention to the subtype of depression (major depression and melancholic depression). Antidepressant treatment response across 5-HT1A-1019C/G genotype groups showed no differences in either Major Depressive Episode or major depression between genotype groups, whereas stratification for the melancholic subtype of depression revealed a significantly worse treatment response as conferred by the -1019CC genotype (p=0.02). The poorer treatment response in melancholic depression could first be detected in week 2 (p=0.03), continuing until week 6 and showing a maximum effect in week 3 (p=0.01). The present study adds to the clarification of the role of 5-HT1A variation in treatment response in major depression by providing preliminary support for poor treatment response mediated by the 5-HT1A-1019C allele repressing 5-HT1A activity specifically in the melancholic subtype of depression.

20975911	20101027	Interaction of CTX-M-15 enzyme with cefotaxime: a molecular modelling and docking study.	Extended-spectrum ?-lactamases (ESBLs) are the bacterial enzymes that make them resistant to advanced-generation cephalosporins. CTXM enzymes (the most prevalent ESBL-type) target cefotaxime. Aims of the study were: Modelling of CTX-M enzyme from bla(CTX-M) sequences of clinical Escherichia coli isolatesDocking of cefotaxime with modelled CTX-M enzymes to identify amino acid residues crucial to their interaction To hypothesize a possible relationship between 'interaction energy of the docked enzyme-antibiotic complex' and 'minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the antibiotic against the bacteria producing that enzyme'. Seven E. coli strains of clinical origin which were confirmed as PCR-positive for bla(CTX-M) were selected for the study. C600 cells harboring cloned bla(CTX-M) were tested for ESBL-production by double-disk-synergy test. BLAST analysis confirmed all the bla(CTX-M) genes as blaCTX-M-15. Four of the 7 strains were found to be clonally related. Modelling was performed using Swiss Model Server. Discovery Studio 2.0 (Accelrys) was used to prepare Ramachandran plots for the modelled structures. Ramachandran Z-scores for modelled CTX-M enzymes from E. coli strains D8, D183, D253, D281, D282, D295 and D296 were found to be -0.449, 0.096, 0.027, 0.043, 0.032, -1.249 and -1.107, respectively. Docking was performed using Hex 5.1 and the results were further confirmed by Autodock 4.0. The amino acid residues Asn 104, Asn132, Gly 227, Thr 235, Gly 236, and Ser237 were found to be responsible for positioning cefotaxime into the active site of the CTX-M-15 enzyme. It was found that cefotaxime MICs for the CTX-M-15-producers increased with the increasing negative interaction energy of the enzyme-antibiotic complex. 	Bioinformation	D016428
27121693	20160429	Insights into enzyme point mutation effect by molecular simulation: phenylethylamine oxidation catalyzed by monoamine oxidase A.	The I335Y point mutation effect on the kinetics of phenylethylamine decomposition catalyzed by monoamine oxidase A was elucidated by means of molecular simulation. The established empirical valence bond methodology was used in conjunction with the free energy perturbation sampling technique and a classical force field representing the state of reactants and products. The methodology allows for the simulation of chemical reactions, in the present case the breaking of the ?-C-H bond in a phenylethylamine substrate and the subsequent hydrogen transfer to the flavin cofactor, resulting in the formation of the N-H bond on flavin. The empirical parameters were calibrated against the experimental data for the simulated reaction in a wild type protein and then used for the calculation of the reaction free energy profile in the I335Y mutant. In very good agreement with the measured kinetic data, mutation increases the free energy barrier for the rate limiting step by slightly more than 1 kcal mol(-1) and consequently decreases the rate constant by about an order of magnitude. The magnitude of the computed effect slightly varies with simulation settings, but always remains in reasonable agreement with the experiment. Analysis of trajectories reveals a major change in the interaction between phenyl rings of the substrate and the neighboring Phe352 residue upon the I335Y mutation due to the increased local polarity, leading to an attenuated quadrupole interaction between the rings and destabilization of the transition state. Additionally, the increased local polarity in the mutant allows for a larger number of water molecules to be present near the active site, effectively shielding the catalytic effect of the enzyme and contributing to the increased barrier.

26718436	20160101	Association between functional CD24 polymorphisms and susceptibility to autoimmune diseases: A meta-analysis.	This study aimed to explore whether the functional CD24 A57V and TG/del polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. A meta-analysis was conducted on the associations between the CD24 A57V and TG/del polymorphisms and autoimmune diseases using (1) allele contrast, and (2) the recessive, (3) dominant, and (4) co-dominant models. Twenty-six comparative studies with 7,507 patients and 8,803 controls were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed a significant association between autoimmune disease and the CD24 Val allele (OR = 1.285, 95% CI = 1.177-1.403, p = 1.0 ? 10-9). Meta-analysis by autoimmune disease type showed a significant association between the CD24 Val allele and multiple sclerosis (MS) (OR = 1.420, 95% CI = 1.239-1.628, p = 4.7 ? 10-8) and systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) (OR = 1.282, 95% CI = 1.081-1.521, p = 0.004), but not Crohn's disease (CD) (OR = 1.003, 95% CI = 0.826-1.218, p = 0.974). Meta-analysis of the CD24 Val/Val genotype showed an association with ulcerative colitis (OR = 1.778, 95% CI = 1.148-2.753, p = 0.010). In addition, meta-analysis by autoimmune disease type revealed a significant association between the CD24 TG-deletion allele and MS (OR = 0.596, 95% CI = 0.415-0.856, p = 0.005) and CD (OR = 1.594, 95% CI = 1.175-2.161, p = 0.003). This meta-analysis indicates that the functional CD24 A57V and TG/del polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to multiple autoimmune diseases including SLE, MS, UC and CD.

23835473	20130710	Production of ACAT1 56-kDa isoform in human cells via trans-splicing involving the ampicillin resistance gene.	Trans-splicing, a process involving the cleavage and joining of two separate transcripts, can expand the transcriptome and proteome in eukaryotes. Chimeric RNAs generated by trans-splicing are increasingly described in literatures. The widespread presence of antibiotic resistance genes in natural environments and human intestines is becoming an important challenge for public health. Certain antibiotic resistance genes, such as ampicillin resistance gene (Amp(r)), are frequently used in recombinant plasmids. Until now, trans-splicing involving recombinant plasmid-derived exogenous transcripts and endogenous cellular RNAs has not been reported. Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) is a key enzyme involved in cellular cholesterol homeostasis. The 4.3-kb human ACAT1 chimeric mRNA can produce 50-kDa and 56-kDa isoforms with different enzymatic activities. Here, we show that human ACAT1 56-kDa isoform is produced from an mRNA species generated through the trans-splicing of an exogenous transcript encoded by the antisense strand of Amp(r) (asAmp) present in common Amp(r)-plasmids and the 4.3-kb endogenous ACAT1 chimeric mRNA, which is presumably processed through a prior event of interchromosomal trans-splicing. Strikingly, DNA fragments containing the asAmp with an upstream recombined cryptic promoter and the corresponding exogenous asAmp transcripts have been detected in human cells. Our findings shed lights on the mechanism of human ACAT1 56-kDa isoform production, reveal an exogenous-endogenous trans-splicing system, in which recombinant plasmid-derived exogenous transcripts are linked with endogenous cellular RNAs in human cells, and suggest that exogenous DNA might affect human gene expression at both DNA and RNA levels.

25268351	20141001	Diagnostic value of a Rec-ELISA using Toxoplasma gondii recombinant SporoSAG, BAG1, and GRA1 proteins in murine models infected orally with tissue cysts and oocysts.	Toxoplasma gondii causes congenital toxoplasmosis in newborns resulting with fetal anomalies. Determining the initiation time of infection is very important for pregnant women and current serological assays have drawbacks in distinguishing the recently acute toxoplasmosis. Diagnosis of recently acute infection may be improved by using stage specific antigens in serological assays. In the present study, the diagnostic value of sporozoite specific SporoSAG, bradyzoite specific BAG1 proteins and GRA1 protein expressed by all forms of the parasite have been evaluated ELISA using sera systematically collected from mice administered orally with tissue cyst and oocysts. The anti-SporoSAG IgM antibodies in sera obtained from mice infected with oocysts peaked significantly at days 1, 10, and 15 (P&lt;0.01). The anti-BAG1 IgM antibodies in sera obtained from mice infected with tissue cysts peaked significantly at days 15, 40, and 120 (P&lt;0.05). The anti-GRA1 IgM antibodies in sera obtained from mice infected with oocysts peaked significantly at days 2, 10, and 40 (P&lt;0.01). The anti-GRA1 IgM antibodies in sera obtained from mice infected with tissue cysts peaked significantly only at day 40 (P&lt;0.05). The anti-SporoSAG, anti-BAG1, and anti-GRA1 IgG titers of mice showed significant increases at day 40 (P&lt;0.05) and decrement started for only anti-GRA1 IgG at day 120. The presence of anti-SporoSAG IgM and IgG antibodies can be interpreted as recently acute infection between days 10-40 because IgM decreases at day 40. Similarly, presence of anti-BAG1 IgM and absence of IgG can be evaluated as a recently acute infection that occurred 40 days before because IgG peaks at day 40. A peak in anti-GRA1 antibody level at first testing and reduction in consecutive sample can be considered as an infection approximately around day 40 or prior. Overall, recombinant SporoSAG, BAG1 and GRA1 proteins can be accepted as valuable diagnostic markers of recently acute toxoplasmosis. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
23209591	20121205	Characterization of oligomers of heterogeneous size as precursors of amyloid fibril nucleation of an SH3 domain: an experimental kinetics study.	Understanding the earliest molecular events during nucleation of the amyloid aggregation cascade is of fundamental significance to prevent amyloid related disorders. We report here an experimental kinetic analysis of the amyloid aggregation of the N47A mutant of the ?-spectrin SH3 domain (N47A Spc-SH3) under mild acid conditions, where it is governed by rapid formation of amyloid nuclei. The initial rates of formation of amyloid structures, monitored by thioflavine T fluorescence at different protein concentrations, agree quantitatively with high-order kinetics, suggesting an oligomerization pre-equilibrium preceding the rate-limiting step of amyloid nucleation. The curves of native state depletion also follow high-order irreversible kinetics. The analysis is consistent with the existence of low-populated and heterogeneous oligomeric precursors of fibrillation that form by association of partially unfolded protein monomers. An increase in NaCl concentration accelerates fibrillation but reduces the apparent order of the nucleation kinetics; and a double mutant (K43A, N47A) Spc-SH3 domain, largely unfolded under native conditions and prone to oligomerize, fibrillates with apparent first order kinetics. On the light of these observations, we propose a simple kinetic model for the nucleation event, in which the monomer conformational unfolding and the oligomerization of an amyloidogenic intermediate are rapidly pre-equilibrated. A conformational change of the polypeptide chains within any of the oligomers, irrespective of their size, is the rate-limiting step leading to the amyloid nuclei. This model is able to explain quantitatively the initial rates of aggregation and the observed variations in the apparent order of the kinetics and, more importantly, provides crucial thermodynamic magnitudes of the processes preceding the nucleation. This kinetic approach is simple to use and may be of general applicability to characterize the amyloidogenic intermediates and oligomeric precursors of other disease-related proteins.

21819526	20110809	Major but differential decline in the incidence of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in HIV-infected individuals from 1995 to 2007: a nationwide cohort study*.	Incidence rates (IRs) of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) are known to be higher in HIV-infected individuals than in the general population, but have not been assessed in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. From 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2007, all Danish HIV-infected individuals (n=4871) and population controls (n=92 116) matched on age and sex were enrolled in a cohort and all cases of SAB were registered. IRs and risk factors were estimated using time-updated Poisson regression analysis. We identified 329 cases of SAB in 284 individuals, of whom 132 individuals were infected with HIV and 152 were not [crude IR ratio (IRR) 24.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) 19.5-30.0, for HIV-infected vs. non-HIV-infected individuals]. Over time, IR declined for HIV-infected individuals (IRR 0.40). Injecting drug users (IDUs) had the highest incidence and the smallest decline in IR, while men who have sex with men (MSM) had the largest decline over time. Among HIV-infected individuals, a latest CD4 count &lt;100 cells/?L was the strongest independent predictor of SAB (IRR 10.2). Additionally, HIV transmission group was associated with risk of SAB. MSM were more likely to have hospital-acquired SAB, a low CD4 cell count and AIDS at the time of HIV acquisition compared with IDUs. We found that the incidence of SAB among HIV-infected individuals declined during the study period, but remained higher than that among HIV-uninfected individuals. There was an unevenly distributed burden of SAB among HIV transmission groups (IDU&gt;MSM). Low CD4 cell count and IDU were strong predictors of SAB among HIV-infected individuals. 	HIV_Med.

24376688	20131231	The Frequency and clinical significance of IDH1 mutations in Chinese acute myeloid leukemia patients.	Mutations in the gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenease 1 (IDH1) occur in various hematopoietic tumors including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myeloproliferative neoplasms and myelodysplastic syndromes. IDH1 mutations are significant in both diagnosis and prognosis of these conditions. In the present study we determined the prevalence and clinical significance of IDH1 mutations in 349 samples from newly diagnosed AML patients. Of the 349 AML patient specimens analyzed, 35 (10.03%) were found to have IDH1 mutations including 4 IDH1 R132 mutations and 31 non-R132 mutations. IDH1 non-R132 mutations were largely concentrated within AML-M1 (35.72%, p&lt;0.01). We identified five IDH1 mutations that were novel to AML: (1) c.299 G&gt;A, p.R100Q; (2) c.311G&gt;T, p.G104V; (3) c.322T&gt;C, p.F108L; (4) c.356G&gt;A, p.R119Q; and (5) c.388A&gt;G, p.I130V. In addition, we identified three IDH1 mutations that were previously described in AML. The frequency of IDH1 mutations in AML patients with normal karyotype was 9.9%. IDH1 non-R132 mutations were concurrent with mutations in FLT3-ITD (p&lt;0.01), CEBPA (p&lt;0.01), and NRAS (p&lt;0.01), as well as the overexpression of MN1 (p&lt;0.01) and WT1(p&lt;0.01). The overall survival (OS) in the patients with IDH1 non-R132 mutations compared to patients without IDH1 mutations don't reach statistically significance (median 521 days vs median: not reached; n.s.). IDH1 non-R132 mutations occurred frequently in newly diagnosed adult Chinese AML patients, and these mutations were associated with genetic alterations. The OS was not influenced by IDH1 non-R132 mutations in the present study. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428
10422843	19990728	Effects of tryptophan to phenylalanine substitutions on the structure, stability, and enzyme activity of the IIAB(Man) subunit of the mannose transporter of Escherichia coli.	The hydrophilic subunit of the mannose transporter (IIAB(Man)) of Escherichia coli is a homodimer that contains four tryptophans per monomer, three in the N-terminal domain (Trp12, Trp33, and Trp69) and one in the C-terminal domain (Trp182). Single and double Trp-Phe mutants of IIABMan and of the IIA domain were produced. Fluorescence emission studies revealed that Trp33 and Trp12 are the major fluorescence emitters, Trp69 is strongly quenched in the native protein and Trp182 strongly blue shifted, indicative of a hydrophobic environment. Stabilities of the Trp mutants of dimeric IIA(Man) and IIAB(Man) were estimated from midpoints of the GdmHCl-induced unfolding transitions and from the amount of dimers that resisted dissociation by SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), respectively. W12F exhibited increased stability, but only 6% of the wild-type phosphotransferase activity, whereas W33F was marginally and W69F significantly destabilized, but fully active. Second site mutations W33F and W69F in the background of the W12F mutation reduced protein stability and suppressed the functional defect of W12F. These results suggest that flexibility is required for the adjustments of protein-protein contacts necessary for the phosphoryltransfer between the phosphorylcarrier protein HPr, IIA(Man), IIB(Man), and the incoming mannose bound to the transmembrane IIC(Man)-IID(Man) complex.

11080236	20001118	Steroid responsive polyneuropathy in a family with a novel myelin protein zero mutation.	To report a novel hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) phenotype, with partial steroid responsiveness, caused by a novel dominant mutation in the myelin protein zero (MPZ) gene. Most MPZ mutations lead to the HMSN type I phenotype, with recent reports of D?j?rine-Sottas, congenital hypomyelination, and HMSN II also ascribed to MPZ mutations. Differing phenotypes may reflect the effect of particular mutations on MPZ structure and adhesivity. Clinical, neurophysiological, neuropathological, and molecular genetic analysis of a family presenting with an unusual hereditary neuropathy. Progressive disabling weakness, with positive sensory phenomena and areflexia, occurred in the proband with raised CSF protein and initial steroid responsiveness. Nerve biopsy in a less severely affected sibling disclosed a demyelinating process with disruption of compacted myelin. The younger generation were so far less severely affected, becoming symptomatic only after 30 years. All affected family members were heterozygous for a novel MPZ mutation (Ile99Thr), in a conserved residue. This broadens the range of familial neuropathy associated with MPZ mutations to include steroid responsive neuropathy, initially diagnosed as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.

To identify self-perceived problems in managing science information needs of U.S. primary practitioners and their opinion leaders. A two-stage random sample of the American Medical Association's &quot;Masterlist of Physicians&quot; to identify 625 office-based physicians, including general practice, family practice, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics, and 100 physician opinion leaders. A formal telephone survey was completed for 79% of practitioners and 90% of opinion leaders sampled, using a pretested instrument applied by trained telephone surveyors. Both practitioners and opinion leaders claimed that published reviews were the most useful means of identifying their information needs. When asked about use of six recent clinical advances, that is, &quot;markers,&quot; for example, hemoglobin-A1C for diabetic control, as many as one fifth to one half were not using or were not aware of such an advance. Less than 1 in 3 practitioners personally searched the literature when information was needed; 2 in 3 claimed literature volume was unmanageable; 9 of 10 practitioners and opinion leaders assessed the scientific value of literature obtained, primarily from their own experience, with less than 1 in 10 contacting research methods specialists. Respondents suggested various innovations to better manage their science information needs in the future. Primary practitioners require substantial help in meeting current science information needs. Increase in such resources as &quot;validated reviews&quot; or &quot;expert networks&quot; might help meet these needs. 	Ann._Intern._Med.	D016428 D013485 D013486

24953981	20140624	Higher ferritin levels, but not serum iron or transferrin saturation, are associated with Type 2 diabetes mellitus in adult men and women free of genetic haemochromatosis.	Iron overload predisposes to diabetes and higher ferritin levels have been associated with diabetes. However, it is unclear whether ferritin reflects differences in iron-related parameters between diabetic and nondiabetic persons. We examined associations of serum ferritin, iron and transferrin saturation with Type 2 diabetes in adults without genetic predisposition to iron overload. Cross-sectional analysis of community-dwelling men and women aged 17-97?years from the Busselton Health Survey, Western Australia. Men and women carrying genotypes associated with haemochromatosis (C282Y/C282Y or C282Y/H63D) were excluded. Serum ferritin, iron and transferrin saturation were assayed. There were 1834 men (122 with diabetes, 6?6%) and 2351 women (141 with diabetes, 6%). In men, higher serum ferritin was associated with diabetes after adjusting for age, smoking, alcohol, cardiovascular history, body mass index (BMI), waist, blood pressure, lipids, C-reactive protein (CRP), adiponectin, alanine transaminase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) [odds ratio (OR): 1?29 per 1?unit increase log ferritin, 95% confidence interval (CI)?=?1?01-1?65, P?=?0?043]. In women, higher serum ferritin was associated with diabetes [fully adjusted OR: 1?31 per 1?unit increase log ferritin, 95% CI?=?1?04-1?63, P?=?0?020; 1?84 for tertile (T) 3 vs T1, 95% CI?=?1?09-3?11]. Neither iron levels nor transferrin saturation were associated with diabetes risk in men or women. Higher ferritin was not associated with insulin resistance in nondiabetic adults. In adults, higher ferritin levels are independently associated with prevalent diabetes while iron and transferrin saturation are not. Ferritin is a robust biomarker for diabetes risk, but further investigation is needed to clarify whether this relationship is mediated via iron metabolism. 	Clin._Endocrinol._(Oxf)	D016428 D013485
20721988	20100820	Cycling through metabolism.	Since the discovery of cyclins, the role of cell cycle regulators in the control of cell proliferation has been extensively studied. It is clear that proliferation requires an adapted metabolic response of the cells; hence the regulation of cell cycle must be linked to metabolic control. While at a much slower pace, the impact that the activities of cell cycle regulators such as cyclins, cyclin dependent kinases or E2F factor, transcription factor have on cell metabolism are also being uncovered. Here we will focus on recent data implicating cell cycle regulators in metabolic control, with particular attention to studies performed using mouse models. Furthermore, we will discuss the possible relevance of these findings in the context of metabolic disorders such as obesity or diabetes. 	EMBO_Mol_Med	D016428 D013485 D016454
8620863	19960401	Glycosylation of recombinant ancrod from Agkistrodon rhodostoma after expression in mouse epithelial cells.	The thrombin-like serine protease ancrod from the Malayan pit viper Agkistrodon rhodostoma was expressed in mouse epithelial cells (C127). Oligosaccharide constituents were liberated from tryptic glycopeptides by treatment with peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase F. Neutral oligosaccharide alditols obtained after reduction and enzymic desialylation were separated by two-dimensional HPLC and characterized by methylation analysis, liquid secondary-ion mass spectrometry, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and sequential degradation with exoglycosidases. In contrast to natural ancrod, the recombinant glycoprotein carries exclusively diantennary, triantennary and tetraantennary N-glycans with Gal beta 4 GlcNAc beta (type-2) antennae which were, in part, further substituted by host-cell-specific structural elements such as Gal alpha 3 residues or N-acetyllactosamine repeats. As a characteristic feature, a substantial proportion of the oligosaccharides bears a GalNAc beta 4Glc-NAc antenna. Studies at the level of individual N-glycosylation sites demonstrated that glycans with N, N'-diacetyllactosediamine units are not specifically attached but occur at all sites in varying amounts. Hence, the putative recognition signal (Pro70-Lys-Lys) for glycoprotein hormone N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, present in this glycoprotein in close proximity to Asn79, does not convey site-specific transfer of GalNAc residues in these cells.

8300580	19940128	Reverse transphosphorylation by ribonuclease A needs an intact p2-binding site. Point mutations at Lys-7 and Arg-10 alter the catalytic properties of the enzyme.	Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A interacts with RNA along multiple binding subsites that essentially recognize the negatively charged phosphates of the substrate. This work gives additional strong support to the existence of the postulated phosphate-binding subsite p2 (Par?s, X., Llorens, R., Ar?s, C., and Cuchillo, C. M. (1980) Eur. J. Biochem. 105, 571-579) and confirms the central role of Lys-7 and Arg-10 in establishing an electrostatic interaction with a phosphate group of the substrate. The effects of charge elimination by Lys-7--&gt;Gln (K7Q) and/or Arg-10--&gt;Gln (R10Q) substitutions in catalytic and ligand-binding properties of ribonuclease A have been studied. The values of Km for cytidine 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and cytidylyl-3',5'-adenosine are not altered but are significantly increased for poly(C). In all cases, kcat values are lower. Synthetic activity, i.e. the reversion of the transphosphorylation reaction, is reduced for K7Q and R10Q mutants and is practically abolished in the double mutant. Finally, the extent of the reaction of the mutants with 6-chloropurine-9-beta-D-ribofuranosyl 5'-monophosphate indicates that the phosphate ionic interaction in p2 is weakened. Thus, p2 modification alters both the catalytic efficiency and the extent of the processes in which an interaction of the phosphate group of the substrate or ligand with the p2-binding subsite is involved.

17726075	20070830	Exon splice enhancer mutation (GH-E32A) causes autosomal dominant growth hormone deficiency.	Alteration of exon splice enhancers (ESE) may cause autosomal dominant GH deficiency (IGHD II). Disruption analysis of a (GAA) (n) ESE motif within exon 3 by introducing single-base mutations has shown that single nucleotide mutations within ESE1 affect pre-mRNA splicing. Confirming the laboratory-derived data, a heterozygous splice enhancer mutation in exon 3 (exon 3 + 2 A--&gt;C) coding for GH-E32A mutation of the GH-1 gene was found in two independent pedigrees, causing familial IGHD II. Because different ESE mutations have a variable impact on splicing of exon 3 of GH and therefore on the expression of the 17.5-kDa GH mutant form, the GH-E32A was studied at the cellular level. The splicing of GH-E32A, assessed at the protein level, produced significantly increased amounts of 17.5-kDa GH isoform (55% of total GH protein) when compared with the wt-GH. AtT-20 cells coexpressing both wt-GH and GH-E32A presented a significant reduction in cell proliferation as well as GH production after forskolin stimulation when compared with the cells expressing wt-GH. These results were complemented with confocal microscopy analysis, which revealed a significant reduction of the GH-E32A-derived isoform colocalized with secretory granules, compared with wt-GH. GH-E32A mutation found within ESE1 weakens recognition of exon 3 directly, and therefore, an increased production of the exon 3-skipped 17.5-kDa GH isoform in relation to the 22-kDa, wt-GH isoform was found. The GH-E32A mutant altered stimulated GH production as well as cell proliferation, causing IGHD II. 	J._Clin._Endocrinol._Metab.	D002363 D016428 D013485
8118463	19940101	DNA mutational analysis of type 1 and type 3 Gaucher patients: how well do mutations predict phenotype?	The wide spectrum of clinical manifestations resulting from glucocerebrosidase deficiency complicates genetic counseling for Gaucher disease. The identification of mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene has enabled studies of genotype-phenotype correlation. However, a genotypic analysis of 60 type 1 and type 3 Gaucher patients reveals that the 5 most common Gaucher mutations, N370S, L444P, R463C, 84insG, and IVS2 + 1 G--&gt;A, can be found both in patients with and without neurologic manifestations. Moreover, although some generalizations can be made about mutations that are more frequently encountered in particular patient populations, Gaucher patients sharing identical genotypes can exhibit considerable clinical heterogeneity. Thus in considering rationale for population screening one cannot rely solely on PCR determined DNA mutation analysis to reliably predict prognosis in Gaucher disease. 	Hum._Mutat.	D002363 D016428
18230842	20080131	Mowat-Wilson syndrome affecting 3 siblings.	We herein report 3 cases of Mowat-Wilson syndrome, characterized by distinct facial features, severe psychomotor retardation, and epilepsy, recurring in 3 siblings from the same parents. The proband was a 15-month-old boy, the youngest of 3 children (2 elder sisters), who was referred to our hospital for the treatment of severe seizures. The clinical features and course of these 3 siblings were compatible with those of previously reported Mowat-Wilson syndrome patients, and all siblings had the same E87X nonsense mutation in ZFHX1B, whereas their mother did not show the mutation. Because Mowat-Wilson syndrome has been caused by de novo mutation in ZFHX1B, germ-line mosaicism should be considered if recurrence in siblings is observed. 	J._Child_Neurol.	D002363 D016428
26734097	20160107	Recent highlights in biosynthesis research using stable isotopes.	The long and successful history of isotopic labeling experiments within natural products research has both changed and deepened our understanding of biosynthesis. As demonstrated in this article, the usage of isotopes is not at all old-fashioned, but continues to give important insights into biosynthetic pathways of secondary metabolites. This review with 85 cited references is structured by separate discussions of compounds from different classes including polyketides, non-ribosomal peptides, their hybrids, terpenoids, and aromatic compounds formed via the shikimate pathway. The text does not aim at a comprehensive overview, but instead a selection of recent important examples of isotope usage within biosynthetic studies is presented, with a special emphasis on mechanistic surprises.

10980578	20000912	APOE promoter polymorphisms do not confer independent risk for Alzheimer's disease in a French population.	The apolipoprotein E (APOE, gene; apoE, protein) isoforms are associated with differential risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). An additional involvement of APOE promoter polymorphisms in AD risk has recently been suggested by several studies. Indeed, three polymorphisms of the APOE regulatory region (-219 G/T, -427 C/T and -491 A/T) have been found associated with AD even after adjustment on the apoE status. We analysed these three promoter region polymorphisms in a large French case-control study (388 AD cases and 386 controls). We found that the -427 T and -491 A alleles were associated with an increased risk of developing AD, but not the -219 G/T alleles. However, a strong linkage disequilibrium was observed between the alleles of these promoter region polymorphisms and the APOE coding region alleles. We therefore retested association after adjustment on apoE status and found that the sole association which remained significant was the association with the -427 T allele. The alpha level was equal to 0.03 (0.09 after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). Analysis of promoter haplotypes also yielded non-significant results. Thus our study does not reinforce the hypothesis of an independent involvement of the APOE promoter region polymorphisms in AD risk. 	Eur._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
23355107	20130129	The genetic contribution to severe post-traumatic osteoarthritis.	to compare the combined role of genetic variants loci associated with risk of knee or hip osteoarthritis (OA) in post-traumatic (PT) and non-traumatic (NT) cases of clinically severe OA leading to total joint replacement. A total of 1590 controls, 2168 total knee replacement (TKR) cases (33.2% PT) and 1567 total hip replacement (THR) cases (8.7% PT) from 2 UK cohorts were genotyped for 12 variants previously reported to be reproducibly associated with risk of knee or hip OA. A genetic risk score was generated and the association with PT and NT TKR and THR was assessed adjusting for covariates. For THR, each additional genetic risk variant conferred lower risk among PT cases (OR=1.07, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.19; p=0.24) than NT cases (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.17; p=1.55?10??). In contrast, for TKR, each risk variant conferred slightly higher risk among PT cases (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.19; p=1.82?10??) than among NT cases (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.1; p=0.00063). Based on the variants reported to date PT TKR cases have at least as high a genetic contribution as NT cases. 	Ann._Rheum._Dis.	D016428 D016448 D013485
27166176	20160512	PTPN22 polymorphisms, but not R620W, were associated with the genetic susceptibility of systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis in a Chinese Han population.	The present study aimed to detect a possible association between PTPN22 gene polymorphisms and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a Chinese Han population. 7 PTPN22 SNPs were genotyped in 358 patients with RA and 713 patients with SLE, as well as 564 RA controls and 672 SLE controls by Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP). Association analyses were conducted on the whole data set. Significant relationships were also examined between clinical features and SNPs for both RA and SLE. Rs2476601 was lack of polymorphism with a ?0.1% frequency in both SLE and RA patients and healthy controls in our study. The two SNPs rs1217414 and rs3811021 of PTPN22 shown strong association with both SLE (rs1217414T: padj?=?6.07e-004, OR=0.57; rs3811021C: padj?=?4.68e-005, OR=0.65) and RA (rs1217414T: padj?=?2.01e-008, OR=0.26; rs3811021C: padj?=?0.028, OR=0.70). And the rs3765598 revealed a strong risk factor for SLE (p=9.38e-009, padj?=?6.57e-008, OR=1.93), but not for RA (p=0.48, OR=1.12). Moreover, protective haplotype ACTTC in RA (p=7.73e-016, padj?=?5.51-015, OR[95%CI]=0.02[0.002-0.10]) and SLE (p=8.29e-018, padj?=?5.80e-017, OR[95%CI]=0.11[0.06-0.21]) were observed. In addition, the distribution of risk haplotypes ACGTC and GCTTT in RA (ACGTC: p=0.0006, padj?=?0.004, OR[95%CI]=1.85[1.29-2.63]; GCTTT: p=2.62e-005, padj?=?1.85e-004, OR[95%CI]=2.40[1.57-3.65]) and SLE (ACGTC: p=0.0006, padj?=?0.004, OR[95%CI]=1.85[1.29-2.63]; ACGTC: p=7.74e-011, padj?=?6.81e-010, OR[95%CI]=2.21[1.12-3.34]; GCTTT: p=2.40[1.57-3.65], padj?=?2.26e-006, OR[95%CI]=2.64[1.79-3.87]) were significant different from that in controls. Furthermore, significant association was observed between the PTPN22 rs3765598 and antinuclear antibodies 1 (ANA1) in SLE. Our data provide strong evidence that the rs1217414 and rs3811021 in PTPN22 gene might be common protective factors contributed to SLE and RA susceptibility in the Chinese Han population. While, the rs3765598 might increase the genetic susceptibility of SLE, but not RA. 	Hum._Immunol.	D016428
1575743	19920430	Site-specific mutagenesis of two histidine residues in fatty acid ethyl ester synthase-III.	Human myocardial fatty acid ethyl ester synthase-III is a newly described acidic glutathione S-transferase that metabolizes both ethanol and carcinogens. Structure-function studies have not been performed relating these two distinct enzymatic activities. Since there are only two histidine residues in fatty acid ethyl ester synthase-III (His 72 and His 163), the role of each was examined by site-specific mutagenesis. Fatty acid ethyl ester synthase-III mutagenized at position 72 to contain either Gln, Pro or Ala had less than 5% of control glutathione S-transferase activity but retained fatty acid ethyl ester synthase activity under standard assay conditions. In contrast, substitution of histidine 163 with proline had no effect on glutathione S-transferase activity, but it slightly increased synthase activity. Thus, this study indicates that histidine plays a differential role in fatty acid ethyl ester synthase III depending on the nucleophilic substrate. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.

8675648	19951201	A unique genetic and biochemical presentation of fish-eye disease.	This paper describes a novel genetic defect which causes fish-eye disease in four homozygous probands and its biochemical presentation in 34 heterozygous siblings. The male index patient presented with premature coronary artery disease, corneal opacification, HDL deficiency, and a near total loss of plasma lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity. Sequencing of the LCAT gene revealed homozygosity for a novel missense mutation resulting in an Asp131 - Asn (N131D) substitution. Heterozygotes showed a highly significant reduction of HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels as compared with controls which was associated with a specific decrease of LpA-I:A-II particles. Functional assessment of this mutation revealed loss of specific activity of recombinant LCAT(N131D) against proteoliposomes. Unlike other mutations causing fish-eye disease, recombinant LCAT(N131D) also showed a 75% reduction in specific activity against LDL. These unique biochemical characteristics reveal the heterogeneity of phenotypic expression of LCAT gene defects within a range specified by complete loss of LCAT activity and the specific loss of activity against HDL. The impact of this mutation on HDL levels and HDL subclass distribution may be related to the premature coronary artery disease observed in the male probands. 	J._Clin._Invest.

12771201	20030529	The phage T4 restriction endoribonuclease RegB: a cyclizing enzyme that requires two histidines to be fully active.	The regB gene, from the bacteriophage T4, codes for an endoribonuclease that controls the expression of a number of phage early genes. The RegB protein cleaves its mRNA substrates with an almost absolute specificity in the middle of the tertranucleotide GGAG, making it a unique well-defined restriction endoribonuclease. This striking protein has no homology to any known RNase and its catalytic mechanism has never been investigated. Here, we show, using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), that RegB produces a cyclic 2',3'-phosphodiester product. In order to determine the residues crucial for its activity, we prepared all the histidine-to- alanine point mutants of RegB. The activity of these mutants was characterized both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, their binding capability was quantified by surface plasmon resonance and their structural integrity was probed by 1H/15N NMR correlation spectroscopy. The results obtained show that only the H48A and the H68A substitutions significantly reduce RegB activity without changing its ability to bind the substrate or affecting its overall structure. Altogether, our results define RegB as a new cyclizing RNase and present His48 and His68 as potent catalytic residues. The effect of the in vivo selected R52L mutation is also described and discussed. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D013485

In the title compound, C14H19BrN2O2S, the 1,2,4-thia-diazinane ring adopts an envelope conformation with the N atom (attached to the sulfonyl group) as the flap, while the cyclo-hexane ring adopts a chair conformation. The mean plane of the cyclo-hexane ring is almost normal to the benzene ring and the mean plane of the 1,2,4-thia-diazinane ring, making dihedral angles of 70.4?(2) and 71.43?(19)?, respectively. Furthermore, the dihedral angle between the benzene ring and the mean plane of the 1,2,4-thia-diazinane ring is 4.91?(18)?. The mol-ecular structure is stabilized by an intra-molecular C-H?O hydrogen bond, which encloses an S(6) ring motif. In the crystal, mol-ecules are linked by N-H?O hydrogen bonds into chains along [10-1], forming a C(6) graph-set motif. These chains are inter-connected via C-H?? inter-actions, leading to chains along [-101], so finally forming sheets parallel to (010). 	Acta_Crystallogr_Sect_E_Struct_Rep_Online	D016428

23637972	20130503	Targeting photoreceptors via intravitreal delivery using novel, capsid-mutated AAV vectors.	Development of viral vectors capable of transducing photoreceptors by less invasive methods than subretinal injection would provide a major advancement in retinal gene therapy. We sought to develop novel AAV vectors optimized for photoreceptor transduction following intravitreal delivery and to develop methodology for quantifying this transduction in vivo. Surface exposed tyrosine (Y) and threonine (T) residues on the capsids of AAV2, AAV5 and AAV8 were changed to phenylalanine (F) and valine (V), respectively. Transduction efficiencies of self-complimentary, capsid-mutant and unmodified AAV vectors containing the smCBA promoter and mCherry cDNA were initially scored in vitro using a cone photoreceptor cell line. Capsid mutants exhibiting the highest transduction efficiencies relative to unmodified vectors were then injected intravitreally into transgenic mice constitutively expressing a Rhodopsin-GFP fusion protein in rod photoreceptors (Rho-GFP mice). Photoreceptor transduction was quantified by fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) by counting cells positive for both GFP and mCherry. To explore the utility of the capsid mutants, standard, (non-self-complementary) AAV vectors containing the human rhodopsin kinase promoter (hGRK1) were made. Vectors were intravitreally injected in wildtype mice to assess whether efficient expression exclusive to photoreceptors was achievable. To restrict off-target expression in cells of the inner and middle retina, subsequent vectors incorporated multiple target sequences for miR181, an miRNA endogenously expressed in the inner and middle retina. Results showed that AAV2 containing four Y to F mutations combined with a single T to V mutation (quadY-F+T-V) transduced photoreceptors most efficiently. Robust photoreceptor expression was mediated by AAV2(quadY-F+T-V) -hGRK1-GFP. Observed off-target expression was reduced by incorporating target sequence for a miRNA highly expressed in inner/middle retina, miR181c. Thus we have identified a novel AAV vector capable of transducing photoreceptors following intravitreal delivery to mouse. Furthermore, we describe a robust methodology for quantifying photoreceptor transduction from intravitreally delivered AAV vectors. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061 D013485
22558325	20120505	Ultra-rapid warming yields high survival of mouse oocytes cooled to -196?c in dilutions of a standard vitrification solution.	Intracellular ice is generally lethal. One way to avoid it is to vitrify cells; that is, to convert cell water to a glass rather than to ice. The belief has been that this requires both the cooling rate and the concentration of glass-inducing solutes be very high. But high solute concentrations can themselves be damaging. However, the findings we report here on the vitrification of mouse oocytes are not in accord with the first belief that cooling needs to be extremely rapid. The important requirement is that the warming rate be extremely high. We subjected mouse oocytes in the vitrification solution EAFS 10/10 to vitrification procedures using a broad range of cooling and warming rates. Morphological survivals exceeded 80% when they were warmed at the highest rate (117,000?C/min) even when the prior cooling rate was as low as 880?C/min. Functional survival was &gt;81% and 54% with the highest warming rate after cooling at 69,000 and 880?C/min, respectively. Our findings are also contrary to the second belief. We show that a high percentage of mouse oocytes survive vitrification in media that contain only half the usual concentration of solutes, provided they are warmed extremely rapidly; that is, &gt;100,000?C/min. Again, the cooling rate is of less consequence. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061
25792649	20150321	Epidemiological and clinical study of diabetes in immigrants from Bangladesh in Athens versus Greek patients.	Greece has experienced a large wave of immigration from Bangladesh. The purpose of this study was to determine whether Bangladeshi immigrants with diabetes have poorer preventive follow-up and diabetes self-care compared to Greek patients. A total of 166 patients from Bangladesh and 123 patients from Greece were recruited. Interviews were conducted, a physical examination followed and blood and urine samples were collected. Patients from Bangladesh had worse glycemic control (A1C=7.74?1.6 vs. 7.55?1.7%; p=0.3), and lower high-density lipoprotein levels (33.99?9.4 vs. 44.05?10.43 mg/dl; p=0.037). They were less likely to regularly take their medication for diabetes mellitus, or to follow dietary recommendations. However, fewer of them smoked, and had a significantly lower body mass index than Greek patients. Bangladeshi immigrants are less likely to engage self-care behaviors and have worse glycemic control and less access to medication, laboratory test and healthcare Units. 	In_Vivo	D016428
26881128	20160217	Transcriptional Control of Synaptic Plasticity by Transcription Factor NF-?B.	Activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B) transcription factors is required for the induction of synaptic plasticity and memory formation. All components of this signaling pathway are localized at synapses, and transcriptionally active NF-?B dimers move to the nucleus to translate synaptic signals into altered gene expression. Neuron-specific inhibition results in altered connectivity of excitatory and inhibitory synapses and functionally in selective learning deficits. Recent research on transgenic mice with impaired or hyperactivated NF-?B gave important insights into plasticity-related target gene expression that is regulated by NF-?B. In this minireview, we update the available data on the role of this transcription factor for learning and memory formation and comment on cross-sectional activation of NF-?B in the aged and diseased brain that may directly or indirectly affect ?B-dependent transcription of synaptic genes.

8910299	19961101	Feline mucopolysaccharidosis type VI. Characterization of recombinant N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase and identification of a mutation causing the disease.	Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase (4S) leading to the lysosomal accumulation and urinary excretion of dermatan sulfate. MPS VI has also been described in the Siamese cat. As an initial step toward enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant feline 4S (rf4S) in MPS VI cats, the feline 4S cDNA was isolated and expressed in CHO-KI cells and rf4S was immunopurified from the culture medium. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the precursor form of immunopurified rf4S was a 66-kDa polypeptide that underwent maturation to a 43-44-kDa polypeptide. Endocytosis of rf4S by cultured feline MPS VI myoblasts was predominantly mediated by a mannose 6-phosphate receptor and resulted in the correction of dermatan sulfate storage. The mutation causing feline MPS VI was identified as a base substitution at codon 476, altering a leucine codon to a proline (L476P). The L476P allele displayed no detectable 4S activity when expressed in CHO-KI cells and was observed only as a &quot;precursor&quot; polypeptide that was not secreted into the medium. Identification of the mutation has allowed the development of a rapid PCR-based screening method to genotype individuals within the cat colony. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
26528356	20151104	Lack of association between polymorphisms of the DNA base excision repair genes MUTYH and hOGG1 and keratoconus in a Polish subpopulation.	Keratoconus (KC) is a non-inflammatory thinning of the cornea and a leading indication for corneal transplantation. Oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. The products of the hOGG1 and MUTYH genes play an important role in the repair of oxidatively modified DNA in the base excision repair pathway. We hypothesized that variability in these genes may change susceptibility to oxidative stress and predispose individuals to the development of KC. We investigated the possible association between the c.977C&gt;G polymorphism of the hOGG1 gene (rs1052133) and the c.972G&gt;C polymorphism of the MUTYH gene (rs3219489) and KC occurrence as well as the modulation of this association by some KC risk factors. A total of 205 patients with KC and 220 controls were included in this study. The polymorphisms were genotyped with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism and PCR-confronting two-pair primer techniques. Differences in genotype and allele frequency distributions were evaluated using the ?(2) test, and KC risk was estimated with an unconditional multiple logistic regression with and without adjustment for co-occurrence of visual impairment, allergies, sex and family history for KC. We did not find any association between the genotypes and combined genotypes of the c.977C&gt;G polymorphism of the hOGG1 gene and the c.972G&gt;C polymorphism of the MUTYH gene and the occurrence of KC. Our findings suggest that the c.977C&gt;G-hOGG1 polymorphism and the c.972G&gt;C-MUTYH polymorphism may not be linked with KC occurrence in this Polish subpopulation. 	Arch_Med_Sci	D016428
26597400	20151125	CYP2D6 Metabolism in Frail Elderly Compared to Non-Frail Elderly: A Pilot Feasibility Study.	Frailty is a clinical phenotype that is associated with adverse health outcomes. Since frail patients may be more prone for adverse drug events and about 15-20?% of commonly prescribed drugs are metabolized by CYP2D6, we hypothesized that CYP2D6 metabolism is decreased in frail patients compared with healthy subjects. The (13)C-dextromethorphan breath test (DM-BT) was used to determine CYP2D6 phenotype using (13)C-dextromethorphan ((13)C-DM) as a probe. Eleven frail and 22 non-frail (according to the Fried criteria) subjects aged 70-85?years were phenotyped for CYP2D6. Despite inequalities in CYP2D6 genotype between frail and non-frail subjects, the CYP2D6 gene activity score was equally distributed between the two groups (1.33???0.50 vs. 1.28???0.752). In male patients, no difference in total and free serum testosterone levels was observed between frail and non-frail men. Serum dehydroepiandrostenedione sulfate (DHEAS) levels were lower in frail subjects (1.56??mol/L) compared with non-frail subjects (2.36??mol/L), but the difference was not significant (p?=?0.15). Body mass index was significantly correlated to CYP2D6 phenotype, whereas frailty score and individual parameters of frailty, Karnofsky score, and activities of daily living score were not significantly correlated to CYP2D6 phenotype. Although there was no difference in CYP2D6 phenotype observed between frail mean???standard deviation (mean???SD) area under the curve for delta over baseline values (0-2?h) (AUCDOB2h) 319???169???min] and non-frail subjects (mean???SD AUCDOB2h 298???159???min), the present sample size is considered too small to draw any firm conclusions regarding a potential phenoconversion of CYP2D6 in frail elderly as compared with healthy subjects. Frail and non-frail subjects did not differ in CYP2D6 phenotype, taking into account that the precalculated sample size was not achieved. Further studies with more patients are needed in order to adequately understand a possible correlation. 	Drugs_Aging	D016428
25740433	20150306	Precise in-frame integration of exogenous DNA mediated by CRISPR/Cas9 system in zebrafish.	The CRISPR/Cas9 system provides a powerful tool for genome editing in various model organisms, including zebrafish. The establishment of targeted gene-disrupted zebrafish (knockouts) is readily achieved by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome modification. Recently, exogenous DNA integration into the zebrafish genome via homology-independent DNA repair was reported, but this integration contained various mutations at the junctions of genomic and integrated DNA. Thus, precise genome modification into targeted genomic loci remains to be achieved. Here, we describe efficient, precise CRISPR/Cas9-mediated integration using a donor vector harbouring short homologous sequences (10-40?bp) flanking the genomic target locus. We succeeded in integrating with high efficiency an exogenous mCherry or eGFP gene into targeted genes (tyrosinase and krtt1c19e) in frame. We found the precise in-frame integration of exogenous DNA without backbone vector sequences when Cas9 cleavage sites were introduced at both sides of the left homology arm, the eGFP sequence and the right homology arm. Furthermore, we confirmed that this precise genome modification was heritable. This simple method enables precise targeted gene knock-in in zebrafish. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D013485
19049562	20081204	The coding-synonymous polymorphism rs1045280 (Ser280Ser) in beta-arrestin 2 (ARRB2) gene is associated with tardive dyskinesia in Chinese patients with schizophrenia.	Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a severe and potentially irreversible adverse effect of long-term antipsychotic treatment. Typical antipsychotics are commonly binding to the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2), but the occurrence of antipsychotic-induced TD is rather delayed; therefore, the development of TD may be associated with mediators or signalling complexes behind DRD2, such as beta-arrestin 2 (ARRB2), an important mediator between DRD2 and serine-threonine protein kinase (AKT) signal cascade. A case-control study to evaluate the association between rs1045280 (Ser280Ser) and antipsychotic-induced TD was performed amongst 381 patients (TD/non-TD = 228/153). There was a significant difference in the genotype distribution between TD and non-TD groups (P = 0.025); furthermore, the allelic analysis indicated that patients with T allele had increased risk of TD occurrence (OR(T) = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.14-2.19, P = 0.007). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting a positive association between the SNP rs1045280 and TD in schizophrenic patients. 	Eur._J._Neurol.	D016428 D013485
27377031	20160706	Glycogen synthase kinase 3? suppresses polyglutamine aggregation by inhibiting Vaccinia-related kinase 2 activity.	Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an abnormal expansion of polyglutamine repeats in the N-terminal of huntingtin. The amount of aggregate-prone protein is controlled by various mechanisms, including molecular chaperones. Vaccinia-related kinase 2 (VRK2) is known to negatively regulate chaperonin TRiC, and VRK2-facilitated degradation of TRiC increases polyQ protein aggregation, which is involved in HD. We found that VRK2 activity was negatively controlled by glycogen synthase kinase 3? (GSK3?). GSK3? directly bound to VRK2 and inhibited the catalytic activity of VRK2 in a kinase activity-independent manner. Furthermore, GSK3? increased the stability of TRiC and decreased the formation of HttQ103-GFP aggregates by inhibiting VRK2. These results indicate that GSK3? signaling may be a regulatory mechanism of HD progression and suggest targets for further therapeutic trials for HD. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
25603310	20150121	Diabetes knowledge in young adults: associations with hemoglobin A1C.	The purpose of this study was to quantify associations between hemoglobin A1C (A1C) and diabetes knowledge score using an assessment tool developed to evaluate the level of diabetes knowledge in young adults with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and their parent/primary caregiver. Seventy-five participants with T1DM, ages 15-22 years, completed questionnaires. Two 25-item questionnaires were developed: one for patient and one for caregiver. Linear regression quantified associations between correct items on the tools and participant A1C and demographic characteristics. Mean age of participants was 16.7 ? 1.7 years, diabetes duration 5.9 ? 4.2 years, 46.7% male, 74.7% Caucasian, 69.3% on multiple daily injections, and 30.7% on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy; 78.7% of parents/caregivers completed the questionnaire. A significant interaction was observed between patient and caregiver scores with A1C by diabetes duration. Among patients with diabetes &lt;6 years, higher patient and caregiver scores were associated with lower A1C (-0.25 ? 0.11, p = .03 and -0.59 ? 0.19, p = .005, respectively) accounting for age, gender, race, therapy, and insurance. Neither patient nor caregiver score was associated with A1C in patients with diabetes duration ?6 years. Better performance on a diabetes knowledge assessment (for both patient and the caregiver) was found to be associated with more favorable levels of glycemic control among young adults with diabetes &lt;6 years. Additional evaluation of these questionnaires and novel interventions to enhance knowledge in this population are needed. 	Fam_Syst_Health	D016428
23639568	20130504	A novel GATA6 mutation leading to congenital heart defects and permanent neonatal diabetes: a case report.	Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus is a rare condition mostly due to heterozygous mutations in the KCNJ11, ABCC8 and INS genes. Neonatal diabetes due to pancreatic agenesis is extremely rare. Mutations in PDX1, PTF1A, HNF1B, EIF2AK3, RFX6 and GATA6 genes have been shown to result in pancreatic agenesis or hypoplasia. This report describes a 40-day-old male infant diagnosed with permanent neonatal diabetes associated with atrial septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, patent ductus arteriosus and a novel de novo heterozygous missense mutation (p.N466S) in the GATA6 gene with no evidence of exocrine pancreas insufficiency. In addition to permanent neonatal diabetes, the patient had transient idiopathic neonatal cholestasis and hypoglycaemic episodes unrelated to insulin treatment, features that are rarely described in children with permanent neonatal diabetes.

14701810	20040101	Real time analysis of STAT3 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling.	The transcription factor STAT3 is most important for the signal transduction of interleukin-6 and related cytokines. Upon stimulation cytoplasmic STAT3 is phosphorylated at tyrosine 705, translocates into the nucleus, and induces target genes. Notably, STAT proteins are also detectable in the nuclei of unstimulated cells. In this report we introduce a new method for the real time analysis of STAT3 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in living cells which is based on the recently established fluorescence localization after photobleaching (FLAP) approach. STAT3 was C-terminally fused with the cyan (CFP) and yellow (YFP) variants of the green fluorescent protein. In the resulting STAT3-CFP-YFP (STAT3-CY) fusion protein the YFP can be selectively bleached using the 514-nm laser of a confocal microscope. This setting allows studies on the dynamics of STAT3 nucleocytoplasmic transport by monitoring the subcellular distribution of fluorescently labeled and selectively bleached STAT3-CY. By this means we demonstrate that STAT3-CY shuttles continuously between the cytosol and the nucleus in unstimulated cells. This constitutive shuttling does not depend on the phosphorylation of tyrosine 705 because a STAT3(Y705F)-CY mutant shuttles to the same extent as STAT3-CY. Experiments with deletion mutants reveal that the N-terminal moiety of STAT3 is essential for shuttling. Further studies suggest that a decrease in STAT3 nuclear export contributes to the nuclear accumulation of STAT3 in response to cytokine stimulation. The new approach presented in this study is generally applicable to any protein of interest for analyzing nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanisms in real time. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
26178622	20150717	Locking GTPases covalently in their functional states.	GTPases act as key regulators of many cellular processes by switching between active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) states. In many cases, understanding their mode of action has been aided by artificially stabilizing one of these states either by designing mutant proteins or by complexation with non-hydrolysable GTP analogues. Because of inherent disadvantages in these approaches, we have developed acryl-bearing GTP and GDP derivatives that can be covalently linked with strategically placed cysteines within the GTPase of interest. Binding studies with GTPase-interacting proteins and X-ray crystallography analysis demonstrate that the molecular properties of the covalent GTPase-acryl-nucleotide adducts are a faithful reflection of those of the corresponding native states and are advantageously permanently locked in a defined nucleotide (that is active or inactive) state. In a first application, in vivo experiments using covalently locked Rab5 variants provide new insights into the mechanism of correct intracellular localization of Rab proteins.

27570633	20160830	Role of the host restriction factor APOBEC3 on papillomavirus evolution.	More than 270 different types of papillomaviruses have been discovered in a wide array of animal species. Despite the great diversity of papillomaviruses, little is known about the evolutionary processes that drive host tropism and the emergence of oncogenic genotypes. Although host defense mechanisms have evolved to interfere with various aspects of a virus life cycle, viruses have also coevolved copious strategies to avoid host antiviral restriction. Our and other studies have shown that the cytidine deaminase APOBEC3 family members edit HPV genomes and restrict virus infectivity. Thus, we hypothesized that host restriction by APOBEC3 served as selective pressure during papillomavirus evolution. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the relative abundance of all dinucleotide sequences in full-length genomes of 274 papillomavirus types documented in the Papillomavirus Episteme database (PaVE). Here, we report that TC dinucleotides, the preferred target sequence of several human APOBEC3 proteins (hA3A, hA3B, hA3F, and hA3H), are highly depleted in papillomavirus genomes. Given that HPV infection is highly tissue-specific, the expression levels of APOBEC3 family members were analyzed. The basal expression levels of all APOBEC3 isoforms, excluding hA3B, are significantly higher in mucosal skin compared with cutaneous skin. Interestingly, we reveal thatAlphapapillomaviruses(alpha-PVs), a majority of which infects anogenital mucosa, display the most dramatic reduction in TC dinucleotide content. Computer modeling and reconstruction of ancestral alpha-PV genomes suggest that TC depletion occurred after the alpha-PVs diverged from their most recent common ancestor. In addition, we found that TC depletion in alpha-PVs is greatly affected by protein coding potential. Taken together, our results suggest that PVs replicating in tissues with high APOBEC3 levels may have evolved to evade restriction by selecting for variants that contain reduced APOBEC3 target sites in their genomes.

25900475	20150423	Human furin Cys198 imposes dihedral and positional restraints on His194 for optimal Ser386-proton transfer.	Inhibitors of human furin may represent the clinical remedy for very aggressive cancer, viral, and bacterial infections. Most of the currently available inhibitors are weak in terms of potency, drug-likeness, and furin specificity thereby necessitating the development of newer compounds especially mechanism-based inhibitors. Here, the roles of active site Cys198 (C198), His194 (H194), and Ser386 (S386) were investigated using computational-site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Data were obtained from six (6) biosystems: wildtype (C198/S386), furin-C198G (S386), furin-S386G (C198), and their peptide (nascent hydrolyzed peptide H2N-RTRR-CO2) bound complexes. The results strongly supported that in wildtype furin but not S386G and C198G mutants, following S386/scissile carbon attack (4.0 ?), the peptide retracted from the active site, representing peptide release post hydrolysis. Furthermore, in S386G mutant, C194 side chain thiolate ion may act as the nucleophile replacement but competing electron-rich centers (H194, H364) and energetically unattainable geometric strain on the peptide may constitute the limiting factors. In biosystems not complexed with peptide (representative of pre-attack state), C198 preferentially engaged H194 imidazole moiety via sulfur-? bond system causing a dihedral and positional restraints on the imidazole ring for ultimate alignment of its NE2 hydrogen atom with the side chain enolate oxygen of S364 required for optimal proton transfer. In summary, small-molecular-weight compounds with dual serine and cysteine protease inhibitory actions may represent a new class of potent and furin-selective compounds for future clinical applications.

23255363	20121221	Deep determinism and the assessment of mechanistic interaction.	Given two variables that causally influence a binary response, we formalize the idea that their effects operate through a common mechanism, in which case we say that the two variables interact mechanistically. We introduce a mechanistic interaction relationship of &quot;interference&quot; that is asymmetric in the two causal factors. Conditions and assumptions under which such mechanistic interaction can be tested under a given regime of data collection, be it interventional or observational, are expressed in terms of conditional independence relationships between the problem variables, which can be manipulated with the aid of causal diagrams. The proposed method is able, under appropriate conditions, to test for interaction between direct effects, and to deal with the situation where one of the two factors is a dichotomized version of a continuous variable. The method is illustrated with the aid of a study on heart disease. 	Biostatistics	D016428 D013485
18385984	20080404	Interleukin 8 and susceptibility to coronary artery disease: a population genetics perspective.	Interleukin 8 is a strong chemoattractant factor for neutrophils and T lymphocytes. We investigated the potential influence of two common polymorphisms of the interleukin-8 gene, -251A/T, and 781C/T on susceptibility to coronary artery disease. The hypothesis was tested by screening for the prevalence of the above polymorphisms in 241 angiographically diagnosed coronary artery disease patients compared to 157 selected controls with negative coronary angiography. We found no significant differences between cases and controls concerning the allelic and genotypic frequencies of both the studied polymorphisms. Nevertheless, a statistically significant lower frequency of the AA containing genotypes was observed in cases presenting with acute coronary syndromes compared to asymptomatic subjects or patients with stable coronary artery disease (OR = 0.44, 95%CI: 0.2-0.98, p = 0.04). The strongest statistical significance was observed in the AA(251)TT(781) combined genotype (OR = 0.34, 95%CI: 0.14-0.85, p = 0.02). Our results suggest that the genetic diversity of the interleukin-8 gene influences the clinical manifestation of CAD. 	J._Clin._Immunol.	D016428
20181825	20100226	The protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B is required for efficient delivery of N-cadherin to the cell surface.	PTP1B bound to mature N-cadherin promotes the association of beta-catenin into the complex, the stable expression of the complex at cell surface, and cadherin-mediated adhesion. Here we show that PTP1B is also required for N-cadherin precursor trafficking through early stages of the secretory pathway. This function does not require association of PTP1B with the precursor. In PTP1B null cells, the N-cadherin precursor showed higher sensitivity to endoglycosidase H than in cells reconstituted with the wild-type enzyme. It also showed slower kinetics of ER-to-Golgi translocation and processing. Trafficking of the viral stomatitis vesicular glycoprotein, VSV-G, however, revealed no differences between PTP1B null and reconstituted cells. N-cadherin precursor complexes contained similar levels of alpha- and beta-catenin regardless of PTP1B expression. In contrast, the associated p120 catenin (p120) was significantly reduced in absence of PTP1B expression. An N-cadherin precursor construct defective in p120 binding, and expressed in PTP1B reconstituted cells, showed higher sensitivity to endoglycosidase H and slower kinetics of processing than the wild-type precursor. Our results suggest that PTP1B promotes the association of p120 to the N-cadherin precursor, facilitating the trafficking of the complex from the ER to the Golgi complex.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate associations of the CYP1A1 gene variant rs4646903 polymorphism with the risk of developing esophageal cancer (EC). A case-control study was carried out in Pashtun population of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan in which 140 hospital based EC cases and 196 population based healthy controls exposed to similar environmental conditions were included. A specific method based on the real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect genotypes in case and control groups and results were then analyzed with SPSS version 20. In our population, individuals with CC and TC genotypes of the CYP1A1 rs4646903 polymorphism had significantly higher risk of EC (adjusted odds (OR): 15.709, 95%CI: 6.065-40.686, OR: 3.256 95%CI: 1.902-5.574 respectively). The 'C' allele was strongly associated with the disease (p&lt; 0.0001). Adjusted OR was higher (1.5 times in C/C) in case of variant alleles that show the contribution of environmental and nutritional factors towards the development of EC. Our findings suggest that presence of the 'C' allele of rs4646903 (T&gt;C) may be one of the risk alleles for EC susceptibility in Pashtun population. 	Asian_Pac._J._Cancer_Prev.	D016428
16953232	20060906	Simultaneous downregulation of CDK inhibitors p18(Ink4c) and p27(Kip1) is required for MEN2A-RET-mediated mitogenesis.	Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A) is predisposed by mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. Low expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p27(Kip1) is present in thyroid tumors, and recent evidence demonstrates p27 downregulation by the active RET mutant, RET/PTC1, found in papillary thyroid carcinoma. This implicates decreased p27 activity as an important event during thyroid tumorigenesis. However, p27(-/-) mice develop MEN-like tumors only in combination with loss of another CDKI, p18(Ink4c). This suggests that p18 and p27 functionally collaborate in suppression of tumorigenesis, that loss of both is critical in the development of MEN tumors and that both p18 and p27 are regulated by RET. We report that induction of the constitutively active MEN2A-specific RET mutant, RET2A(C634R), correlates with reduced p18/p27, and elevated cyclin D protein levels, leading to increased CDK activity, increased pRb phosphorylation and proliferation under growth arrest conditions. Mechanistically, RET2A represses p18/p27 mRNA levels while elevating cyclin D1 mRNA levels. RET2A expression also correlates with decreased p27 protein stability. RET2A-mediated regulation of p18 and p27, but not of cyclins D1 and D2, requires functional mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Additionally, RET2A-dependent p18 repression is required and sufficient to increase cell proliferation. Perhaps most significantly, MEN2A adrenal tumors also display these changes in cell cycle expression profile, demonstrating the biological relevance of our cell culture studies. Our results demonstrate for the first time that RET2A regulates p18, and suggest that loss of not only p27 but also of p18 expression is a key step in MEN tumorigenesis. 	Oncogene	D016428 D013485
26056602	20150610	The Wnt/?-catenin pathway in human fibrotic-like diseases and its eligibility as a therapeutic target.	The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is involved in a variety of biological processes like cell proliferation, cell polarity, and cell fate determination. This pathway has been extensively investigated as its deregulation is linked to different diseases, including various types of cancer, skeletal defects, birth defect disorders (including neural tube defects), metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative disorders and several fibrotic diseases like desmoid tumors. In the &quot;on state&quot;, beta-catenin, the key effector of Wnt signaling, enters the nucleus where it binds to the members of the TCF-LEF family of transcription factors and exerts its effect on gene transcription. Disease development can be caused by direct or indirect alterations of the Wnt/?-catenin signaling. In the first case germline or somatic mutations of the Wnt components are associated to several diseases such as the familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) - caused by germline mutations of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) - and the desmoid-like fibromatosis, a sporadic tumor associated with somatic mutations of the ?-catenin gene (CTNNB1). In the second case, epigenetic modifications and microenvironmental factors have been demonstrated to play a key role in Wnt pathway activation. The natural autocrine Wnt signaling acts through agonists and antagonists competing for the Wnt receptors. Anomalies in this regulation, whichever is their etiology, are an important part in the pathogenesis of Wnt pathway linked diseases. An example is promoter hypermethylation of Wnt antagonists, such as SFRPs, that causes gene silencing preventing their function and consequently leading to the activation of the Wnt pathway. Microenvironmental factors, such as the extracellular matrix, growth factors and inflammatory mediators, represent another type of indirect mechanism that influence Wnt pathway activation. A favorable microenvironment can lead to aberrant fibroblasts activation and accumulation of ECM proteins with subsequent tissue fibrosis that can evolve in fibrotic disease or tumor. Since the development and progression of several diseases is the outcome of the Wnt pathway cross-talk with other signaling pathways and inflammatory factors, it is important to consider not only direct inhibitors of the Wnt signaling pathway but also inhibitors of microenvironmental factors as promising therapeutic approaches for several tumors of fibrotic origin.

19124933	20090107	Fasting plasma homocysteine levels are increased in young patients with acute myocardial infarction from Western India.	Fasting hyperhomocysteinemia is positively associated with atherothrombosis and acute myocardial infarction in several prospective and retrospective studies. In India folic acid deficiency is not uncommon, and subclinical folic acid deficiency is known to cause hyperhomocysteinemia without thrombocytopenia. To observe the prevalence of plasma hyperhomocysteinemia in a cohort of patients with acute myocardial infarction after 2 weeks of oral folic acid therapy. A cohort of 120 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction below the age of 40 years was tested for fasting hyperhomocysteinemia 8-10 weeks after AMI. Five hundred age and sex matched unrelated controls and 50 family controls were also studied for two mutations, MTHFR C677T and cystathionine Beta synthase (CBS) T833C mutations Parents of the AMI patients were also tested to see hyperhomocysteinemia in the family. The patients were given two weeks of oral folic acid therapy (folviteR - 5mg once daily) and fasting plasma homocysteine levels were measured again and the pattern of response was noted. Patients who responded partially or not responded at all to oral folic acid therapy received intramuscular injection of 1 mg of cyanoco-balamin ( NeurobionR,) and their level of plasma homocysteine were noted 1 week later. Sixty three out of 120 patients showed hyperhomocysteinemia compared to 9% of the age and sex matched controls. Fifty seven therapy percent of hyperhomocysteinemia patients responded completely to oral folvite. Subsequent vitamin B12 &amp; B6 therapy normalized homocysteine levels in only 2/12 partial responders with less than 50 microg/l of plasma homocysteine levels, but none of the folate non responders and partial responders having plasma homocysteine levels above 50 microgm/l responded to the therapy. Hyperhomocysteinemia is common amongst young acute myocardial infarction patients from western India. The major cause of hyperhomocysteinemia in young myocardial infarction cases is folic acid deficiency. However a fair number of patients who did not respond to folic acid, also did not respond to vitamin B12 and B6 parenterally suggesting existence of defect in other pathways of homocysteine metabolism in a subset of our patients.

24687779	20140402	No association between XRCC3 Thr241Met and XPD Lys751Gln polymorphisms and the risk of colorectal cancer in West Algerian population: a case-control study.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex and multifactorial disease, in which genetic and environmental factors both seem to play a part. Many epidemiological studies have explored the association between genetic polymorphisms of X-ray repair cross-complementing group 3 (XRCC3) (Thr241Met) and Xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) lysine to glutamine at codon 751 (Lys751Gln) and risk of CRC in various populations; however, the results are controversial. We conducted this case-control study in a West Algerian population to assess the potential role of this genetic polymorphism on the risk of CRC in this population. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples collected from 129 sporadic CRC patients and 148 normal controls. The polymorphisms were determined by pyrosequencing technique. The distribution of XRCC3 Thr241Met and XPD Lys751Gln genotypes among controls did not differ significantly from those predicted by the Hardy-Weinberg distribution (p &gt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in the genotypes distribution and allele frequencies between CRC patients and controls. A significant association was found between the combined heterozygous of XRCC3 and homozygous variant of XPD gene and CRC. This is the first study on DNA repair genetic polymorphisms in West Algerian population, and it suggests that the XRCC3 Thr241Met and XPD Lys751Gln polymorphisms may not be associated with the CRC risk in this population.

26603650	20151126	A mechanism of glucose tolerance and stimulation of GH1 ?-glucosidases.	?-Glucosidases are enzymes that hydrolyze ?-glycosidic bonds to release non-reducing terminal glucosyl residues from glycosides and oligosaccharides, and thus have significant application potential in industries. However, most ?-glucosidases are feedback inhibited by the glucose product, which restricts their application. Remarkably, some ?-glucosidases of the glycoside hydrolase (GH) 1 family are tolerant to or even stimulated by glucose. Elucidation of the mechanisms of glucose tolerance and stimulation of the GH1 ?-glucosidases will be crucial to improve their application through enzyme engineering. In this study, by comparing the primary and tertiary structures of two GH1 ?-glucosidases with distinct glucose dependence, some putative glucose-dependence relevant sites were mutated to investigate their exact roles. Both biochemical and structural characterization of the mutants suggested that some sites at the entrance and middle of the substrate channel regulate the effects of glucose, and the relative binding affinity/preference of these sites to glucose modulates the glucose dependence. A mechanism was therefore proposed to interpret the glucose dependence of GH1 ?-glucosidases. This research provides fresh insight into our current understanding of the properties and mechanisms of GH1 ?-glycosidases and related enzymes that modulate their activity via feedback control mechanism.

P3H1 provides the enzymatic activity of the complex and has a Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) ER-retrieval sequence at the carboxyl terminus. Loss of function mutations in LEPRE1 lead to the Pro986 residue remaining unmodified and lead to slow folding and excessive helical post-translational modification of type I collagen, which is seen in both dominant and recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Here, we present the case of siblings with non-lethal OI due to novel compound heterozygous mutations in LEPRE1 (c.484delG and c.2155dupC). The results of RNA analysis and real-time PCR suggest that mRNA with c.2155dupC escapes from nonsense-mediated RNA decay. Without the KDEL ER- retrieval sequence, the product of the c.2155dupC variant cannot be retained in the ER. This is the first report of a mutation in LEPRE1 that eliminates only the KDEL ER-retrieval sequence, whereas other functional domains remain intact. Our study shows, for the first time, that the KDEL ER- retrieval sequence is essential for P3H1 functionality and that a defect in KDEL is sufficient for disease onset. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
17018637	20061005	Common genetic variants in proinflammatory and other immunoregulatory genes and risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.	Profound disruption of immune function is an established risk factor for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We report here a large-scale evaluation of common genetic variants in immune genes and their role in lymphoma. We genotyped 57 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from 36 candidate immune genes in 1,172 non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases and 982 population-based controls from a US multicenter study. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the association between individual SNP and haplotypes with non-Hodgkin lymphoma overall and five well-defined subtypes. A haplotype comprising SNPs in two proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and lymphotoxin-alpha (rs1800629, rs361525, rs1799724, rs909253, and rs2239704), increased non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk overall (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.06-1.63; P = 0.01) and notably for diffuse large B cell (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.23-2.19; P = 0.0007). A functional nonsynonymous SNP in the innate immune gene Fc gamma receptor 2A (FCGR2A; rs1801274) was also associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma; AG and AA genotypes were associated with a 1.26-fold (95% CI, 1.01-1.56) and 1.41-fold (95% CI, 1.10-1.81) increased risk, respectively (P(trend) = 0.006). Among non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes, the association with FCGR2A was pronounced for follicular and small lymphocytic lymphomas. In conclusion, common variants in genes influencing proinflammatory and innate immune responses were associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk overall and their effects could vary by subtype. Our results require replication but potentially provide important clues for investigating common genetic variants as susceptibility factors and in disease outcomes, treatment responses, and immunotherapy targets.

26351475	20150910	Lack of Association between Interleukin-10 Gene Promoter Polymorphisms?with?HIV?Susceptibility and Progression to AIDS.	Interleukin (IL)-10 is an important anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokine. Some authors believe that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene have been associated with susceptibility to HIV infection and progression to AIDS, but its role is not clearly defined yet. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the association between HIV infection susceptibility and progression with SNP in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene. This study was carried out in 70 HIV infected patients (39 treatment na?ve and 31 under treatment) and 31 matched healthy controls. The biallelic polymorphisms in the IL-10 gene promoter (-592 ,-1082) were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. At position -1082, G/A was the most common genotype and A was the most prevalent allele and at position -592, A/C was the most prevalent genotype and -592 C was the most common allele in HIV positive patients; although there was not any significant difference between cases and controls regarding genotypes and alleles of these regions. Our study showed that genetic polymorphisms of IL-10 promoter region may not associate with HIV infection outcome and the lack of this association suggests that other genes may influence on HIV infection course.

25657809	20150207	Molecular aspect on the interaction of zinc-ofloxacin complex with deoxyribonucleic acid, proposed model for binding and cytotoxicity evaluation.	Recently, several studies have shown that the metal-fluoroquinolone complexes have more antibacterial and cytotoxic effects in comparison with free fluoroquinolones. These results may introduce new drugs for chemotherapy with fewer side effects. In this work a bidentated zinc (II) complex with ofloxacin (OZC) was synthesized and cytotoxicity activities and DNA binding of the resulted complex was studied. The in-vitro anti proliferative and cytotoxic effects of the free ofloxacin (OFL) and OZC against MCF-7, CaCo2 and SKNMC cell lines were tested by using Trypan blue and lactate dehyrogenase (LDH) assay methods. Results revealed that the OZC exhibits better anti proliferative and cytotoxic activities as compared with the OFL. This may be due to the more interaction of OZC with DNA. Therefore, the interaction of OZC with DNA was investigated by using voltammetry, UV-Vis, fluorescence, FT-IR and circular dichroism spectroscopy methods, and the equilibrium binding constant (Kb), binding site size, and thermodynamic parameters were measured. The results revealed that the OZC interacts with DNA via two modes: electrostatic and outside hydrogen binding. The proposed DNA binding modes may support the greater in-vitro cytotoxicity of OZC compared to OFL alone. 	Res_Pharm_Sci	D016428
17255768	20070127	Bone marrow phospho-STAT5 expression in non-CML chronic myeloproliferative disorders correlates with JAK2 V617F mutation and provides evidence of in vivo JAK2 activation.	The recently described JAK2 V617F mutation, present in a substantial proportion of nonchronic myelogenous leukemia chronic myeloproliferative disorders (non-CML CMPDs), is changing the way we conceptualize and diagnose these diseases. We hypothesized that the activation of this tyrosine kinase might result in activation of downstream mediators such as STAT5, which would be detectable in bone marrow biopsies. We examined the expression of activated STAT5 (nuclear phospho-STAT5) in 73 bone marrow biopsies from patients with CMPDs [20 essential thrombocythemia (ET), 26 chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF), and 27 polycythemia vera] and 39 controls. We compared the results with the JAK2 mutational status and clinical parameters. The frequency of the JAK2 V617F was 73% (85% in PV, 65% in ET, and 65% in CIMF). All patients with the JAK2 V617F showed abnormal nuclear megakaryocytic phospho-STAT5 (nMEG pSTAT5) expression. In the JAK2 wild-type group, nMEG pSTAT5 was observed in 2/7 ET, and 3/9 CIMF patients. nMEG pSTAT5 staining was 100% sensitive and 88% specific for JAK2 V617F. Clinically, nMEG pSTAT5+ patients seemed to require cytoreductive therapy more often than those without nMEG p-STAT expression. pSTAT5 immunohistochemistry is a useful diagnostic test in bone marrow biopsies from suspected non-CML CMPD patients. It identifies most of the patients with the JAK2 V617F but also other JAK2 wild-type CMPD patients. The presence of nMEG pSTAT5 in a subset of CMPD patients lacking the mutation suggests that alternate tyrosine kinase/phosphatase pathways may be involved and warrant further investigation. Phosphoprotein detection represents a new area for diagnostic pathology that exploits specific functional characteristics of cells within the context of a tissue section. 	Am._J._Surg._Pathol.

26809274	20160127	Germline Genetic Variants in the Wnt/?-Catenin Pathway as Predictors of Colorectal Cancer Risk.	The Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway plays a key role in stem cell maintenance in the colorectum. Rare high-penetrance genetic mutations in components of this pathway result in familial colorectal cancer, yet the impact of common, germline variants remains unknown. We assessed 172 variants in 26 genes from the Wnt/?-catenin pathway in 809 colorectal cancer cases and 814 healthy controls, followed by replication of the top findings in another 691 cases and 775 controls. In silico informatic tools were used to predict functional effects of variants. Eighteen SNPs in the pathway were significantly associated with colorectal cancer risk (P &lt; 0.05) in the discovery phase. We observed a significant dose-response increase in colorectal cancer risk by number of risk genotypes carried (P = 4.19 ? 10(-8)). Gene-based analysis implicated CSNK1D (P = 0.014), FZD3 (P = 0.023), and APC (P = 0.027) as significant for colorectal cancer risk. In the replication phase, FZD3:rs11775139 remained significantly associated with reduced risk with a pooled OR of 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.76-0.94, P = 0.001]. Although borderline significant in the replication population, APC:rs2545162 was highly significant in the pooled analysis-OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.16-1.74; P = 0.00085. Functional assessment identified several potential biologic mechanisms underlying these associations. Our findings suggest that common germline variants in the Wnt/?-catenin pathway may be involved in colorectal cancer development. These variants may be informative in colorectal cancer risk assessment to identify individuals at increased risk who would be candidates for screening. 	Cancer_Epidemiol._Biomarkers_Prev.

23874591	20130723	Comprehensive gene expression profiling reveals synergistic functional networks in cerebral vessels after hypertension or hypercholesterolemia.	Atherosclerotic stenosis of cerebral arteries or intracranial large artery disease (ICLAD) is a major cause of stroke especially in Asians, Hispanics and Africans, but relatively little is known about gene expression changes in vessels at risk. This study compares comprehensive gene expression profiles in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) of New Zealand White rabbits exposed to two stroke risk factors i.e. hypertension and/or hypercholesterolemia, by the 2-Kidney-1-Clip method, or dietary supplementation with cholesterol. Microarray and Ingenuity Pathway Analyses of the MCA of the hypertensive rabbits showed up-regulated genes in networks containing the node molecules: UBC (ubiquitin), P38 MAPK, ERK, NFkB, SERPINB2, MMP1 and APP (amyloid precursor protein); and down-regulated genes related to MAPK, ERK 1/2, Akt, 26 s proteasome, histone H3 and UBC. The MCA of hypercholesterolemic rabbits showed differentially expressed genes that are surprisingly, linked to almost the same node molecules as the hypertensive rabbits, despite a relatively low percentage of 'common genes' (21 and 7%) between the two conditions. Up-regulated common genes were related to: UBC, SERPINB2, TNF, HNF4A (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A) and APP, and down-regulated genes, related to UBC. Increased HNF4A message and protein were verified in the aorta. Together, these findings reveal similar nodal molecules and gene pathways in cerebral vessels affected by hypertension or hypercholesterolemia, which could be a basis for synergistic action of risk factors in the pathogenesis of ICLAD.

23716723	20130530	The relationship between angiotensinogen gene polymorphisms and essential hypertension in a Northern Han Chinese population.	Gene polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin system are involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension. We genotyped 4 polymorphisms of angiotensinogen (AGT) gene A-20C (rs5050), A-6G (rs5051), C3889T (rs4762), and C4072T (rs699) by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 652 patients and 780 controls to examine the association of AGT and hypertension in a Northern Han Chinese population. There were significant differences in the distribution of genotypes and allele frequencies at C4072T between the patients and the controls (both P &lt; .01); patients with CC genotype had a higher risk of hypertension (odds ratio = 1.7, 95% confidence interval 1.4-2.1). The distribution of genotypes at A-6G was significantly different between patients and controls (P &lt; .05). No other significant differences in genotypes or frequencies were observed. No association was observed between the haplotypes of AGT and hypertension. The AGT-6A and 4072C alleles are associated with susceptibility to hypertension in this population.

25931959	20150502	Identification guide to some Diaptomid species (Crustacea, Copepoda, Calanoida, Diaptomidae) of &quot;de la Plata&quot; River Basin (South America).	An identification guide is presented for species of calanoid copepod family Diaptomidae from &quot;de la Plata&quot; River Basin (Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay). It was based on material collected during the summer and winter of 2010 from 43 sites across the eastern part and the lower stretches of this basin, the second largest in South America and the fourth in the world. The guide contains identification keys and species diagnoses for males and females, richly supported by scanning electronic micrographs and/or line drawings of 19 species. It also includes some general remarks on the taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships of these species. The key was adjusted to be useful for these species only, with separate keys for each sex, and is the first for females of South America. One species classified herein as incertae sedis was not included in the analysis. At least ten other species have previously been recorded in the basin but were not present in our samples. This is the first attempt to compile comprehensive taxonomic information on this group of copepods in this region, and it is expected to become a useful tool for biologists and young taxonomists interested in the crustacean biota of the Neotropical region.

23189182	20121129	Variations of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 in Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric carcinomas from Guangzhou, southern China.	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) is the only viral protein consistently expressed in all EBV-associated malignancies, and play a critical role in the onset, progression, and/or maintenance of these tumors. Based on the signature changes at amino acid residue 487, EBNA1 is classified into five distinct subtypes: P-ala, P-thr, V-leu, V-val and V-pro. In the present study, the sequence variations of EBNA1 in EBV-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC) and throat washing (TW) samples of healthy EBV carriers in Guangzhou, southern China, where nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is endemic, were analyzed by PCR and DNA sequencing. V-val subtype was the most predominant (53.6%, 15/28) in EBVaGC, followed by P-ala (42.9%, 12/28) and V-leu (32.1%, 9/28) subtypes. In TWs of healthy EBV carriers, V-val subtype was also predominant (85.7%, 18/21). The sequence variations of EBNA1 in EBVaGC were similar to those in TW of healthy EBV carriers (p&gt;0.05), suggesting that the EBV strains in EBVaGC might originate from the viral strains prevalent within the background population. The predominance of V-val subtype in EBVaGC in Guangzhou was similar to that in EBVaGC in northern China and Japan, but was different from that in EBVaGC in America, suggesting that the variations of EBNA1 in EBVaGC represent geographic-associated polymorphisms rather than tumor-specific mutations. In addition, the EBNA1 variations in EBVaGC in gastric remnant carcinoma were also determined. V-leu subtype was detected in all 4 (100%) cases, although 2 cases occurred as mixed infection with P-ala subtype. This is different from the predominant V-val subtype in EBVaGC in conventional gastric carcinoma, suggesting that V-leu might be a subtype that adapts particularly well to the microenvironment within the gastric stump and enters the remnant gastric mucosa epithelia easily. This, to our best knowledge, is the first investigation of EBNA1 polymorphisms in EBVaGC from endemic area of NPC. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
24865593	20140529	Schizophrenia-risk variant rs6994992 in the neuregulin-1 gene on brain developmental trajectories in typically developing children.	The neuregulin-1 (NRG1) gene is one of the best-validated risk genes for schizophrenia, and psychotic and bipolar disorders. The rs6994992 variant in the NRG1 promoter (SNP8NRG243177) is associated with altered frontal and temporal brain macrostructures and/or altered white matter density and integrity in schizophrenic adults, as well as healthy adults and neonates. However, the ages when these changes begin and whether neuroimaging phenotypes are associated with cognitive performance are not fully understood. Therefore, we investigated the association of the rs6994992 variant on developmental trajectories of brain macro- and microstructures, and their relationship with cognitive performance. A total of 972 healthy children aged 3-20 years had the genotype available for the NRG1-rs6994992 variant, and were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological tests. Age-by-NRG1-rs6994992 interactions and genotype effects were assessed using a general additive model regression methodology, covaried for scanner type, socioeconomic status, sex and genetic ancestry factors. Compared with the C-carriers, children with the TT-risk-alleles had subtle microscopic and macroscopic changes in brain development that emerge or reverse during adolescence, a period when many psychiatric disorders are manifested. TT-children at late adolescence showed a lower age-dependent forniceal volume and lower fractional anisotropy; however, both measures were associated with better episodic memory performance. To our knowledge, we provide the first multimodal imaging evidence that genetic variation in NRG1 is associated with age-related changes on brain development during typical childhood and adolescence, and delineated the altered patterns of development in multiple brain regions in children with the T-risk allele(s).

24008407	20130907	Clonal mast cell proliferation in pruriginous skin in hypereosinophilic syndrome.	Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is defined as a high eosinophilic granulocyte count in peripheral blood and other tissues. It can be associated with clonal and non-clonal haematological neoplastic diseases. Here we present a patient with a 27-year history of pruritus, urticarial lesions, recurrent diarrhoea, depression and a monoclonal gammopathy in the setting of HES. The patient presented with erythemas, disseminated plaques, papules and scaling. Eosinophils continuously increased from 14% in 2002 to 65% in 2011. Tryptase levels were &gt;20 ?g/l. Skin biopsies were unspecific. In the bone marrow biopsy 30% of eosinophilic differentiated precursors and 10% plasma cells were noticed. Skin and bone marrow initially not indicative for mast cell proliferation were investigated for clonal mast cell proliferation. By immunostaining, single tryptase-, CD117c- and CD25-positive mast cells were detected not only in bone marrow, but also in the skin. Molecular investigations revealed a D816V exon 17 mutation of the c-KIT gene in bone marrow and skin biopsies. In this patient HES was associated with high tryptase levels with 2 underlying clonal cell populations - IgG?-positive plasma cells and single clonal mast cells with a high percentage of eosinophils in the bone marrow with symptoms of a clonal mast cell activation syndrome. Because of 3 minor criteria the patient finally fulfilled the criteria for systemic mastocytosis (according to the WHO). Patients with high tryptase levels and symptoms of mast cell activation syndrome should be investigated for clonal mast cell disease even in the absence of increased mast cells in the skin and bone marrow.

14764823	20040207	Insulin promoter factor-1 mutations and diabetes in Trinidad: identification of a novel diabetes-associated mutation (E224K) in an Indo-Trinidadian family.	This study investigated the prevalence of insulin promoter factor-1(IPF-1) mutations in familial early-onset diabetes mellitus in Trinidad. We screened 264 unrelated subjects with type 2 diabetes diagnosed before 40 yr of age and a family history of diabetes for mutations in the minimal promoter and coding region of the IPF-1 gene (IPF1). This study population included 169 patients of East Indian descent (Indo-Trinidadians), 66 of African descent (Afro-Trinidadians), and 29 of mixed ancestry. We identified five IPF1 variants, including one new missense mutation E224K, the previously described diabetes-associated duplication P242 P243dupP, two silent mutations in the codons for Leu54 (c.162G&gt;A) and Ala256 (c.768C&gt;A), and a substitution in the 5'-untranslated region (c.-18C&gt;T). The E224K mutation was found in two unrelated diabetic Indo-Trinidadians and 0 of 60 controls. It was present on the same haplotype in both patients suggesting a founder effect. The E224K mutation cosegregated with early-onset diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance in a large family, suggestive of the type 4 form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young rather than type 2 diabetes. Functional studies of E224K showed reduced transactivation activity. IPF1 mutations leading to synthesis of a mutant protein may contribute to the development of familial early-onset diabetes/maturity-onset diabetes of the young in Indo-Trinidadians.

16172043	20050921	Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome in association with follicular occlusion triad.	Keratitis-Ichthyosis-Deafness syndrome is a rare congenital disorder of the ectoderm caused by mutations in the connexin-26 gene (GJB2) on chromosome 13q11-q12, giving rise to keratitis, erythrokeratoderma and neurosensory deafness. We report the case of a 31-year-old black male diagnosed as having KID syndrome. Sequencing analysis showed a heterozygous missense mutation D50N (148G &gt; A) in the GJB2 gene. In addition to the classical features of vascularizing keratitis, erythrokeratoderma and congenital deafness, our patient presented a follicular occlusion triad with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS, alias acne inversa), acne conglobata and dissecting cellulitis of the scalp, leading to cicatricial alopecia and disfiguring, inflammatory vegetations of his scalp. Conservative therapy such as a keratolytic, rehydrating and antiseptic external therapy, antibiotic, antimycotic and retinoids were only of moderate benefit, so we finally chose the curative possibility of surgery therapy of the axillar papillomas and of the scalp. The inflammatory papillomatous regions of the axillae and of the scalp were radically debrided. Clean granulation was awaited and covered in a second session with a mesh graft from the thigh, achieving a satisfactory result. To our knowledge, only one case of KID syndrome occurring in association with follicular occlusion triad has been reported before. 	Eur_J_Dermatol	D002363 D016428 D013485
26516307	20151031	Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in IL-10, IL-12p40, and IL-13 Genes and Susceptibility to Glioma.	Glioma is one of the most aggressive and most common tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) in humans. The exact causes of glioma are not well known, but evidence suggests the involvement of genetic factors in addition to environmental risk factors. The present study aimed to determine whether polymorphisms in IL-10-1082A/G, IL-12p40 1188C/A, and IL-13+2044G/A (rs20541) are associated with the incidence of glioma in Iraqi patients. Ninety-six patients with different grades of glioma and 40 apparently healthy individuals were recruited. A blood sample and genomic DNA were collected from all subjects. The amplification refractory mutation system and sequence-specific primer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used for genotyping of IL-10-1082A/G and IL-12p40 1188C/A, respectively; whereas, the IL-13+2044G/A was detected by DNA sequencing after amplification of the genes by PCR. All SNPs were within Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and each appeared in three genotypes in patients and controls. In IL-10-1082A/G, these genotypes frequencies were AA (75%), AG (22.93%) and GG (2.07%) in patients as compared to similar frequencies (62.5%), (27.5%) and (10%) respectively, in controls. The variant IL-12p40 1188C/A genotype was AA (72.92%), AC (23.96%), and CC (3.13%%) in patients as compared to 65%, 30%, and 5%, respectively, in controls. The frequencies of IL-13+2044G/A genotypes (GG, GA, and AA) were 89.58%, 9.37%, and 1.04% among patients versus 47.5%, 32.5% and 20%, respectively, among controls. These results suggest a protective role of mutant alleles G and A in IL-10-1082A/G and IL-13+2044G/A against gliomas. Further studies with more rigorous parameter designs will be needed to confirm the current findings. 	Int_J_Med_Sci	D016428
11437266	20010705	Mutants of tobacco mosaic virus with temperature-sensitive coat proteins induce heat shock response in tobacco leaves.	We analyzed, with respect to heat shock proteins (HSPs), systemically reacting tobacco leaves inoculated with Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), wild-type vulgare, and temperature-sensitive coat protein (CP) mutants Ni 118 (P20L) and flavum (D19A), kept at 23 or 30 degrees C. HSP18 and HSP70 mRNAs and proteins were induced with temperature-sensitive CP mutants after 1 to 2 days at 30 degrees C. After 4 to 6 days, HSP70 was also induced at 23 degrees C. The induction of HSPs paralleled the amount of insoluble TMV CP in leaf extracts, indicating that denatured TMV CP by itself induces a heat-shock response. 	Mol._Plant_Microbe_Interact.	D016428
27598769	20160907	Proteolytic Activation of Bacillus thuringiensis Cry2Ab through a Belt-and-Braces Approach.	Proteolytic processing of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crystal toxins by insect midgut proteases plays an essential role in their insecticidal toxicities against target insects. In the present study, proteolysis of Bt crystal toxin Cry2Ab by Plutella xylostella L. midgut proteases (PxMJ) was evaluated. Both trypsin and chymotrypsin were identified involving the proteolytic activation of Cry2Ab and cleaving Cry2Ab at Arg(139) and Leu(144), respectively. Three Cry2Ab mutants (R139A, L144A, and R139A-L144A) were constructed by replacing residues Arg(139), Leu(144), and Arg(139)-Leu(144) with alanine. Proteolysis assays revealed that mutants R139A and L144A but not R139A-L144A could be cleaved into 50 kDa activated toxins by PxMJ. Bioassays showed that mutants R139A and L144A were highly toxic against P. xylostella larvae, while mutant R139A-L144A was almost non-insecticidal. Those results demonstrated that proteolysis by PxMJ was associated with the toxicity of Cry2Ab against P. xylostella. It also revealed that either trypsin or chymotrypsin was enough to activate Cry2Ab protoxin. This characteristic was regarded as a belt-and-braces approach and might contribute to the control of resistance development in target insects. Our studies characterized the proteolytic processing of Cry2Ab and provided new insight into the activation of this Bt toxin. 	J._Agric._Food_Chem.	D016428
27677167	20160928	Hydroxytyrosol: a new class of microbicide displaying broad anti-HIV-1 activity.	To investigate the toxicity and activity against HIV of 5-hydroxytyrosol as a potential microbicide. The anti-HIV-1 activity of 5-hydroxytyrosol, a polyphenolic compound, was tested against wild-type HIV-1 and viral clones resistant to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors and integrase inhibitors. In addition to its activity against founder viruses, different viral subtypes and potential synergy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine and emtricitabine was also tested. 5-Hydroxytyrosol toxicity was evaluated in vivo in rabbit vaginal mucosa. We have cloned pol gene from drug-resistant HIV-1 isolated from infected patients and env gene from Fiebeg III/IV patients or A, C, D, E, F and G subtypes in the NL4.3-Ren backbone. 5-Hydroxytyrosol anti-HIV-1 activity was evaluated in infections of MT-2, U87-CCR5 or peripheral blood mononuclear cells preactivated with phytohemagglutinin?+?interleukin-2 with viruses obtained through 293T transfections. Inhibitory concentration 50% and cytotoxic concentration 50% were calculated. Synergy was analysed according to Chou and Talalay method. In-vivo toxicity was evaluated for 14 days in rabbit vaginal mucosa. 5-Hydroxytyrosol inhibited HIV-1 infections of recombinant or wild-type viruses in all the target cells tested. Moreover, 5-hydroxytyrosol showed similar inhibitory concentration 50% values for infections with NRTIs, NNRTIs, protease inhibitors and INIs resistant viruses; founder viruses and all the subtypes tested. Combination of 5-hydroxytyrosol with tenofovir was found to be synergistic, whereas it was additive with lamivudine and emtricitabine. In-vivo toxicity of 5-hydroxytyrosol was very low even at the highest tested doses. 5-Hydroxytyrosol displayed a broad anti-HIV-1 activity in different cells systems in the absent of in-vivo toxicity, therefore supporting its candidacy as a potential new class of microbicides.

19796535	20091003	Toll-like-receptor gene polymorphisms in a Tunisian population with Beh?et's disease.	The manifestations of BD are considered to have developed as a result of immunological dysfunction, which is suggested to be induced by microbial pathogens. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) genes were known to be associated with a variety of infectious diseases due to their central role in both innate and adaptive immunity. In this report, we investigated the possible association between BD patients and genetic variations within the TLR 2, 4 and 9 genes in a Tunisian population. 135 Tunisian BD patients and 159 healthy blood donors from the same geographical area were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction for the TLR polymorphisms. Among the TLR polymorphisms, only the distribution of TLR9 1486 T/C genotype (p=0.07; chi2=3.30; OR=1.54; 95% CI=0.94-2.51) and allele (p=0.08; chi2=2.91; OR=1.34; 95% CI=0.94-1.92) frequencies was different between BD patients and healthy controls, but did not reach statistical significance. For the TLR9 1237 T/C, the distribution of genotypes and alleles were not significantly different comparing total patients with controls. There were no associations between the studied polymorphisms and the main clinical manifestations of BD. The G, T and A allele of the TLR4 1896 A/G, TLR4 11196 C/T and TLR2 12408 G/A polymorphisms were uncommon and absent in the Tunisian population. Our results showed that SNPs in the TLR2, 4 and 9 genes were not significantly associated with susceptibility to BD. 	Clin._Exp._Rheumatol.	D016428 D013485
20186689	20100227	Functional PMS2 hybrid alleles containing a pseudogene-specific missense variant trace back to a single ancient intrachromosomal recombination event.	Sequence exchange between PMS2 and its pseudogene PMS2CL, embedded in an inverted duplication on chromosome 7p22, has been reported to be an ongoing process that leads to functional PMS2 hybrid alleles containing PMS2- and PMS2CL-specific sequence variants at the 5'-and the 3'-end, respectively. The frequency of PMS2 hybrid alleles, their biological significance, and the mechanisms underlying their formation are largely unknown. Here we show that overall hybrid alleles account for one-third of 384 PMS2 alleles analyzed in individuals of different ethnic backgrounds. Depending on the population, 14-60% of hybrid alleles carry PMS2CL-specific sequences in exons 13-15, the remainder only in exon 15. We show that exons 13-15 hybrid alleles, named H1 hybrid alleles, constitute different haplotypes but trace back to a single ancient intrachromosomal recombination event with crossover. Taking advantage of an ancestral sequence variant specific for all H1 alleles we developed a simple gDNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that can be used to identify H1-allele carriers with high sensitivity and specificity (100 and 99%, respectively). Because H1 hybrid alleles harbor missense variant p.N775S of so far unknown functional significance, we assessed the H1-carrier frequency in 164 colorectal cancer patients. So far, we found no indication that the variant plays a major role with regard to cancer susceptibility. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428 D013485
25210493	20140912	KRAS and DAXX/ATRX gene mutations are correlated with the clinicopathological features, advanced diseases, and poor prognosis in Chinese patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.	Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET) is a clinically rare and heterogeneous group of tumors; its pharmacogenetic characteristics are not fully understood. This study was designed to examine the relationship between key gene variations and disease development and prognosis among Chinese patients with pNET. Various pNET associated genes such as DAXX/ATRX, KRAS, MEN1, PTEN, TSC2, SMAD4/DPC, TP53 and VHL were analyzed in high-throughput sequencing. The links between the gene mutations and the clinicopathological features and prognosis of the patients were determined. The somatic mutation frequencies of the DAXX/ATRX, KRAS, MEN1, mTOR pathway genes (PTEN and TSC2), SMAD4/DPC, TP53, and VHL in Chinese pNET patients were 54.05%, 10.81%, 35.14%, 54.05%, 2.70%, 13.51%, and 40.54%, respectively, while the same figures in Caucasians pNET patients were 43%, 0%, 44%, 15%, 0%, 3%, and 0%, respectively. The numbers of mutated genes were from 0 to 6; 4 patients with more than 3 mutated genes had higher proliferation (Ki-67) index or nerve vascular invasion or organ involvement, but only 9 of 27 patients with 3 or few mutated genes had such features. Mutations in KRAS and DAXX/ATRX, but not other genes analyzed, were associated with a shortened survival. The mutation rates of these genes in Chinese pNET patients are different from those in Caucasians. A higher number of gene mutations and the DAXX/ATRX and KRAS gene mutations are correlated with a poor prognosis of patients with pNET. 	Int._J._Biol._Sci.	D016428 D013485
21990613	20111013	The structure of an unconventional HD-GYP protein from Bdellovibrio reveals the roles of conserved residues in this class of cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterases.	Cyclic-di-GMP is a near-ubiquitous bacterial second messenger that is important in localized signal transmission during the control of various processes, including virulence and switching between planktonic and biofilm-based lifestyles. Cyclic-di-GMP is synthesized by GGDEF diguanylate cyclases and hydrolyzed by EAL or HD-GYP phosphodiesterases, with each functional domain often appended to distinct sensory modules. HD-GYP domain proteins have resisted structural analysis, but here we present the first structural representative of this family (1.28 ?), obtained using the unusual Bd1817 HD-GYP protein from the predatory bacterium Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus. Bd1817 lacks the active-site tyrosine present in most HD-GYP family members yet remains an excellent model of their features, sharing 48% sequence similarity with the archetype RpfG. The protein structure is highly modular and thus provides a basis for delineating domain boundaries in other stimulus-dependent homologues. Conserved residues in the HD-GYP family cluster around a binuclear metal center, which is observed complexed to a molecule of phosphate, providing information on the mode of hydroxide ion attack on substrate. The fold and active site of the HD-GYP domain are different from those of EAL proteins, and restricted access to the active-site cleft is indicative of a different mode of activity regulation. The region encompassing the GYP motif has a novel conformation and is surface exposed and available for complexation with binding partners, including GGDEF proteins. It is becoming apparent that many bacteria use the signaling molecule cyclic-di-GMP to regulate a variety of processes, most notably, transitions between motility and sessility. Importantly, this regulation is central to several traits implicated in chronic disease (adhesion, biofilm formation, and virulence gene expression). The mechanisms of cyclic-di-GMP synthesis via GGDEF enzymes and hydrolysis via EAL enzymes have been suggested by the analysis of several crystal structures, but no information has been available to date for the unrelated HD-GYP class of hydrolases. Here we present the multidomain structure of an unusual member of the HD-GYP family from the predatory bacterium Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus and detail the features that distinguish it from the wider structural family of general HD fold hydrolases. The structure reveals how a binuclear iron center is formed from several conserved residues and provides a basis for understanding HD-GYP family sequence requirements for c-di-GMP hydrolysis.

20949585	20101016	Assessment of fungicide resistance and pathogen diversity in Erysiphe necator using quantitative real-time PCR assays.	Management of grapevine powdery mildew Erysiphe necator Schw. requires fungicide treatments such as sterol demethylation inhibitors (DMIs) or mitochondrial inhibitors (QoIs). Recently, reduction in the efficacy of DMIs or QoIs was reported in Europe and the United States. The aim of the present study was to develop real-time qPCR tools to detect and quantify several CYP51 gene variants of E. necator: (i) A versus B groups (G37A) and (ii) sensitive versus resistant to sterol demethylase inhibitor fungicides (Y136F). The efficacy of the qPCR tools developed was better than the CAPS method, with a limit of 2 pg for E necator DNA, 0.06 ng for genetic group A and 1.4 ng for the DMI-resistant allele. The detection limits of qPCR protocols (LOD) ranged from 0.72 to 0.85%, and the quantification limits (LOQ) ranged from 2.4 to 2.85% for the two alleles G47A and Y136F respectively. The application of qPCR to field isolates from French vineyards showed the presence of DMI-resistant and/or QoI-resistant alleles in French pathogen populations, linked to genetic group B. The real-time PCR assay developed in this study provides a potentially useful tool for efficient quantification of different alleles of interest for fungicide monitoring and for population structure of E. necator.

17303804	20070217	Genetic influences of adiponectin on insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.	Recent evidence points to molecules secreted by the adipose tissue, or adipokines, as possible links between increased adipose mass and metabolic abnormalities. Among these molecules, adiponectin has drawn much attention because of its insulin-sensitizing and antiatherogenic actions, suggesting that genetic deficits in its production or action may contribute to insulin resistance and coronary artery disease (CAD). A meta-analysis of the data published to date supports this hypothesis. Two independent effects, corresponding to the two linkage disequilibrium blocks that can be identified at the adiponectin locus, appear to be present. In the 5' block, the g.-11391G--&gt;A variant has a modest but significant effect on adiponectinemia, with a mean difference between genotypes of 1.64 ng/ml (95% CI 0.88-2.41). In the 3' block, the g.+276G--&gt;T variant is a strong determinant of insulin resistance and CAD, with minor allele homozygotes having a lower homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA(IR)) index (-0.36 units, 95% CI 0.24-0.47) and a lower cardiovascular risk (odds ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.38-0.80) than carriers of other genotypes. No consistent effect on BMI or risk of type 2 diabetes is evident. Polymorphisms in the genes coding for the adiponectin receptors may also influence the risk of insulin resistance and CAD, but data on these genes are still too sparse to draw firm conclusions. In summary, the studies published to date indicate that polymorphisms at the adiponectin locus are indeed predictors of circulating adiponectin levels, insulin sensitivity, and atherosclerosis, highlighting the pivotal role of this adipokine in the modulation of metabolism and atherogenesis.

21864647	20110826	Sphingosine-1-phosphate rapidly increases cortisol biosynthesis and the expression of genes involved in cholesterol uptake and transport in H295R adrenocortical cells.	In the acute phase of adrenocortical steroidogenesis, adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) activates a cAMP/PKA-signaling pathway that promotes the transport of free cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane. We have previously shown that ACTH rapidly stimulates the metabolism of sphingolipids and the secretion of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in H295R cells. In this study, we examined the effect of S1P on genes involved in the acute phase of steroidogenesis. We show that S1P increases the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). S1P-induced StAR mRNA expression requires G?(i) signaling, phospholipase C (PLC), Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CamKII), and ERK1/2 activation. S1P also increases intracellular Ca(2+), the phosphorylation of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) at Ser(563), and cortisol secretion. Collectively, these findings identify multiple roles for S1P in the regulation of glucocorticoid biosynthesis. 	Mol._Cell._Endocrinol.	D016428 D052061 D013485
26932718	20160303	Monoamine Oxidase A (MAOA) and Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) Gene Polymorphisms Interact with Maternal Parenting in Association with Adolescent Reactive Aggression but not Proactive Aggression: Evidence of Differential Susceptibility.	To date, whether and how gene-environment (G ? E) interactions operate differently across distinct subtypes of aggression remains untested. More recently, in contrast with the diathesis-stress hypothesis, an alternative hypothesis of differential susceptibility proposes that individuals could be differentially susceptible to environments depending on their genotypes in a &quot;for better and for worse&quot; manner. The current study examined interactions between monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) T941G and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met polymorphisms with maternal parenting on two types of aggression: reactive and proactive. Moreover, whether these potential G ? E interactions would be consistent with the diathesis-stress versus the differential susceptibility hypothesis was tested. Within the sample of 1399 Chinese Han adolescents (47.2 % girls, M age = 12.32 years, SD = 0.50), MAOA and COMT genes both interacted with positive parenting in their associations with reactive but not proactive aggression. Adolescents with T alleles/TT homozygotes of MAOA gene or Met alleles of COMT gene exhibited more reactive aggression when exposed to low positive parenting, but less reactive aggression when exposed to high positive parenting. These findings provide the first evidence for distinct G ? E interaction effects on reactive versus proactive aggression and lend further support for the differential susceptibility hypothesis.

25684475	20150217	Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD Val-9Ala) gene polymorphism and susceptibility to gastric cancer.	Oxidative stress caused by the generation of reactive oxygen species plays an important role in human carcinogenesis. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) Val-9Ala in the mitochondrial target sequence is the best known polymorphism of this enzyme. The purpose of the current research was to assess the association of MnSOD Val-9Ala genotypes with the risk of gastric cancer. This case- control study covered 54 gastric cancer patients compared to 100 cancer free subjects as controls. Extraction of DNA was performed on bioptic samples and genotypes were identified with a polymerase chain reaction- restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The frequencies of MnSOD Ala/Ala, Ala/Val and Val/Val genotypes in healthy individuals were 24.3, 66.7 and 9%, respectively. However, in gastric cancer patients, Ala/Ala, Ala/Val and Val/Val were observed in 24.0, 48.0 and 28.0% (p=0.01). In patients the frequency of MnSOD Val allele was higher (52%) compared to that in controls (42%). The results of this study show a positive association between MnSOD Val-9Ala gene polymorphism and risk of gastric cancer disease in Iranian population. 	Asian_Pac._J._Cancer_Prev.	D003160 D016428
18793692	20080917	Association of antipsychotic induced weight gain and body mass index with GNB3 gene: a meta-analysis.	It has been reported that C825T variant in the gene encoding the G-protein subunit beta3 (GNB3) is associated with antipsychotic-induced weight gain and obesity. We investigated the association of the GNB3 and antipsychotic-induced weight gain as well as body mass index (BMI) using meta-analytical techniques. Our analysis of 402 schizophrenia subjects showed a trend (p=0.072) only under a fixed-model. As it was observed heterogeneity among the studies (p=0.007), we re-analyzed using a random-effects framework and no significance was found (p=0.339). No evidence for bias publication was reported (p=0.868). Our analysis of 18,903 subjects showed a trend (p=0.053) associating CC and lower BMI under a fixed model. Although no significant association was found, the same pattern (CC and lower antipsychotic-induced weight gain) was observed. Our meta-analysis indicates that firmly establishing the role of pharmacogenetics in clinical psychiatry requires much larger sample sizes that have been reported.

26267233	20150813	Adult-onset congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura caused by a novel compound heterozygous mutation of the ADAMTS13 gene.	Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life-threatening disease, characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia, resulting in neurologic and/or renal abnormalities. We report a 49-year-old patient with a history of thrombotic events, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. Blood analysis demonstrated no ADAMTS13 activity in the absence of antibodies against ADAMTS13. The complete ADAMTS13 gene was sequenced, and two mutations were identified: one mutation on exon 24 (Arg1060Asp), which had previously been described, and a mutation on exon 27 (Met1260IlefsX34), which has not been reported. For these mutations, compound heterozygosity appears to be necessary to cause TTP, as family members of the patient display only one of the mutations and all displayed normal ADAMTS13 activity.

21127715	20101204	Clinical, molecular, and environmental risk factors for hodgkin lymphoma.	Epidemiological studies suggest unique occurrence patterns of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) worldwide. In most Western countries there is a clear bimodal age distribution with an early peak in young adults followed by a second peak in older adults, particularly among males. In the Middle East and Asia, HL is more common in early childhood. There also are marked racial differences in the presentations of HL and HL subtypes, and particular single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified as etiological factors suggesting that gene-gene and gene-environment interactions are involved. Personal health choices such as exercise and smoking may modify an individual's chances of developing HL. Numerous studies highlight the impact that exposure to Epstein-Barr virus and other environmental factors have on HL risk. Understanding the relative importance of each of these findings and their links to HL development and survival will help clinical researchers expand curative therapies and create preventative strategies for HL.

27198223	20160521	PKC? and HMGB1 antagonistically control hydrogen peroxide-induced poly-ADP-ribose formation.	Harmful oxidation of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids is observed when reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced excessively and/or the antioxidant capacity is reduced, causing 'oxidative stress'. Nuclear poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) formation is thought to be induced in response to oxidative DNA damage and to promote cell death under sustained oxidative stress conditions. However, what exactly triggers PAR induction in response to oxidative stress is incompletely understood. Using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) and in-depth analysis of key stress signaling components, we observed that PAR formation induced by H2O2 was mediated by the PLC/IP3R/Ca(2+)/PKC? signaling axis. Mechanistically, H2O2-induced PAR formation correlated with Ca(2+)-dependent DNA damage, which, however, was PKC?-independent. In contrast, PAR formation was completely lost upon knockdown of PKC?, suggesting that DNA damage alone was not sufficient for inducing PAR formation, but required a PKC?-dependent process. Intriguingly, the loss of PAR formation observed upon PKC? depletion was overcome when the chromatin structure-modifying protein HMGB1 was co-depleted with PKC?, suggesting that activation and nuclear translocation of PKC? releases the inhibitory effect of HMGB1 on PAR formation. Together, these results identify PKC? and HMGB1 as important co-regulators involved in H2O2-induced PAR formation, a finding that may have important relevance for oxidative stress-associated pathophysiological conditions.

15880573	20050510	Lactase persistence and ovarian carcinoma risk in Finland, Poland and Sweden.	Ovarian carcinoma is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in women. The cause and pathogenesis of this disease has remained obscure. Galactose, the hydrolyzing product of the milk sugar lactose, has been hypothesized to be toxic to ovarian epithelial cells and consumption of dairy products and lactase persistence has been suggested to be a risk factor for ovarian carcinoma. In adults, downregulation of lactase depends on a variant C/T-13910 at the 5' end of the lactase gene. To explore whether lactase persistence is related to the risk of ovarian carcinoma we determined the C/T-13910 genotype in a cohort of 782 women with ovarian carcinoma. The C/T-13910 genotype was defined by solid phase minisequencing from 327 Finnish, 303 Polish, 152 Swedish patients and 938 Finnish, 296 Polish and 97 Swedish healthy individuals served as controls. Lactase persistence did not associate significantly with increased risk for ovarian carcinoma in the Finnish (odds ratio [OR]=0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.57-1.05, p=0.097), in the Polish (OR=0.95, 95% CI=0.68-1.33, p=0.75), or in the Swedish populations (OR=1.63, 95% CI=0.65-4.08, p=0.29). Our results do not support the hypothesis that lactase persistence increases the ovarian carcinoma risk. On the contrary, lactase persistence may decrease the ovarian carcinoma risk at least in the Finnish population. 	Int._J._Cancer	D003160 D016428 D016448 D013485

10386878	19990701	Real-time NMR studies on a transient folding intermediate of barstar.	The refolding of barstar, the intracellular inhibitor of barnase, is dominated by the slow formation of a cis peptidyl prolyl bond in the native protein. The triple mutant C40/82A P27A in which two cysteine residues and one trans proline were replaced by alanine was used as model system to investigate the kinetics and structural consequences of the trans/cis interconversion of Pro48. One- and two-dimensional real-time NMR spectroscopy was used to follow the trans/cis interconversion after folding was initiated by rapid dilution of the urea denatured protein. Series of 1H, 15N HSQC spectra acquired with and without the addition of peptidyl prolyl isomerase unambiguously revealed the accumulation of a transient trans-Pro48 intermediate within the dead time of the experiment. Subtle chemical shift differences between the native state and the intermediate spectra indicate that the intermediate is predominantly native-like with a local rearrangement in the Pro48 loop and in the beta-sheet region including residues Tyr47, Ala82, Thr85, and Val50.

18361425	20080326	Analysis of X chromosome inactivation in autism spectrum disorders.	Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are complex genetic disorders more frequently observed in males. Skewed X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is observed in heterozygous females carrying gene mutations involved in several X-linked syndromes. In this study, we aimed to estimate the role of X-linked genes in ASD susceptibility by ascertaining the XCI pattern in a sample of 543 informative mothers of children with ASD and in a sample of 163 affected girls. The XCI pattern was also determined in two control groups (144 adult females and 40 young females) with a similar age distribution to the mothers sample and affected girls sample, respectively. We observed no significant excess of skewed XCI in families with ASD. Interestingly, two mothers and one girl carrying known mutations in X-linked genes (NLGN3, ATRX, MECP2) showed highly skewed XCI, suggesting that ascertainment of XCI could reveal families with X-linked mutations. Linkage analysis was carried out in the subgroup of multiplex families with skewed XCI (&gt; or = 80:20) and a modest increased allele sharing was obtained in the Xq27-Xq28 region, with a peak Z-score of 1.75 close to rs719489. In summary, our results suggest that there is no major X-linked gene subject to XCI and expressed in blood cells conferring susceptibility to ASD. However, the possibility that rare mutations in X-linked genes could contribute to ASD cannot be excluded. We propose that the XCI profile could be a useful criteria to prioritize families for mutation screening of X-linked candidate genes. 	Am._J._Med._Genet._B_Neuropsychiatr._Genet.

25902052	20150423	Genome-wide negative feedback drives transgenerational DNA methylation dynamics in Arabidopsis.	Epigenetic variations of phenotypes, especially those associated with DNA methylation, are often inherited over multiple generations in plants. The active and inactive chromatin states are heritable and can be maintained or even be amplified by positive feedback in a transgenerational manner. However, mechanisms controlling the transgenerational DNA methylation dynamics are largely unknown. As an approach to understand the transgenerational dynamics, we examined long-term effect of impaired DNA methylation in Arabidopsis mutants of the chromatin remodeler gene DDM1 (Decrease in DNA Methylation 1) through whole genome DNA methylation sequencing. The ddm1 mutation induces a drastic decrease in DNA methylation of transposable elements (TEs) and repeats in the initial generation, while also inducing ectopic DNA methylation at hundreds of loci. Unexpectedly, this ectopic methylation can only be seen after repeated self-pollination. The ectopic cytosine methylation is found primarily in the non-CG context and starts from 3' regions within transcription units and spreads upstream. Remarkably, when chromosomes with reduced DNA methylation were introduced from a ddm1 mutant into a DDM1 wild-type background, the ddm1-derived chromosomes also induced analogous de novo accumulation of DNA methylation in trans. These results lead us to propose a model to explain the transgenerational DNA methylation redistribution by genome-wide negative feedback. The global negative feedback, together with local positive feedback, would ensure robust and balanced differentiation of chromatin states within the genome. 	PLoS_Genet.	D016428 D013485

21527061	20110430	East meets West: ethnic differences in epidemiology and clinical behaviors of lung cancer between East Asians and Caucasians.	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with large variation of the incidence and mortality across regions. Although the mortality of lung cancer has been decreasing, or steady in the US, it has been increasing in Asia for the past two decades. Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, and other risk factors such as indoor coal burning, cooking fumes, and infections may play important roles in the development of lung cancer among Asian never smoking women. The median age of diagnosis in Asian patients with lung cancer is generally younger than Caucasian patients, particularly among never-smokers. Asians and Caucasians may have different genetic susceptibilities to lung cancer, as evidenced from candidate polymorphisms and genome-wide association studies. Recent epidemiologic studies and clinical trials have shown consistently that Asian ethnicity is a favorable prognostic factor for overall survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), independent of smoking status. Compared with Caucasian patients with NSCLC, East Asian patients have a much higher prevalence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (approximately 30% vs. 7%, predominantly among patients with adenocarcinoma and never-smokers), a lower prevalence of K-Ras mutation (less than 10% vs. 18%, predominantly among patients with adenocarcinoma and smokers), and higher proportion of patients who are responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The ethnic differences in epidemiology and clinical behaviors should be taken into account when conducting global clinical trials that include different ethnic populations.

In an attempt to monitor ?m-level trace constituents, we applied here (1)H-{(13)C-(15)N} triple-resonance nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to (13)C/(15)N-enriched l-Dopa as the inevitable precursor of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain. The perfect selectivity (to render endogenous components silent) and ?m-level sensitivity (700?MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic probe) of triple-resonance allowed the unambiguous and quantitative metabolic and pharmacokinetic analyses of administered l-Dopa/dopamine in the brain and liver of mice. The level of dopamine generated in the brain (within the range 7-76??m, which covers the typical stimulated level of ?30??m) could be clearly monitored ex vivo, but was slightly short of the detection limit of a 7?T MR machine for small animals. This work suggests that ?m-level trace constituents are potential targets of ex vivo monitoring as long as they contain N atom(s) and their appropriate (13)C/(15)N-enrichment is synthetically accessible.

The methylenetetrahydrafolate reductase (MTHFR) enzyme may influence cancer development by affecting DNA methylation, synthesis and repair. The MTHFR 677C--&gt;T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been associated with decreased enzyme activity and has therefore been implicated in cancer development. We analyzed the MTHFR 677C--&gt;T SNP in 2,777 incident prostate cancer cases and 1,639 population controls from the CAncer Prostate in Sweden study (CAPS). No significant association was found overall between prostate cancer risk and the 677C--&gt;T SNP (p = 0.27) with heterozygote (CT) and homozygote (TT) allele carriers showing ORs of 1.12 (95% CI: 0.98-1.27) and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.80-1.30), respectively. In the subgroup of low risk prostate cancer, heterozygote-but not homozygote-allele carriers displayed a slight over-risk with an OR of 1.21 (95% CI: 1.03-1.41). Among men under 65 years of age, the 677C--&gt;T SNP was associated with prostate cancer risk (p = 0.007), with odds ratios of 1.33 (95% CI: 1.09-1.63) for heterozygote allele carriers and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.6-1.24) for homozygote allele carriers. However, this association was attributed to a shift in the genotype distribution in the young controls. In conclusion, our results do not provide strong support for the hypothesis that the MTHFR 677C--&gt;T polymorphism is related to prostate cancer risk. 	Cancer_Causes_Control	D016428 D013485
25550508	20150101	Nitric oxide negatively regulates abscisic acid signaling in guard cells by S-nitrosylation of OST1.	The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays important roles in plant development and adaptation to environmental stress. ABA induces the production of nitric oxide (NO) in guard cells, but how NO regulates ABA signaling is not understood. Here, we show that NO negatively regulates ABA signaling in guard cells by inhibiting open stomata 1 (OST1)/sucrose nonfermenting 1 (SNF1)-related protein kinase 2.6 (SnRK2.6) through S-nitrosylation. We found that SnRK2.6 is S-nitrosylated at cysteine 137, a residue adjacent to the kinase catalytic site. Dysfunction in the S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) reductase (GSNOR) gene in the gsnor1-3 mutant causes NO overaccumulation in guard cells, constitutive S-nitrosylation of SnRK2.6, and impairment of ABA-induced stomatal closure. Introduction of the Cys137 to Ser mutated SnRK2.6 into the gsnor1-3/ost1-3 double-mutant partially suppressed the effect of gsnor1-3 on ABA-induced stomatal closure. A cysteine residue corresponding to Cys137 of SnRK2.6 is present in several yeast and human protein kinases and can be S-nitrosylated, suggesting that the S-nitrosylation may be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for protein kinase regulation.

25324304	20141018	Critical role of DNA intercalation in enzyme-catalyzed nucleotide flipping.	Nucleotide flipping is a common feature of DNA-modifying enzymes that allows access to target sites within duplex DNA. Structural studies have identified many intercalating amino acid side chains in a wide variety of enzymes, but the functional contribution of these intercalating residues is poorly understood. We used site-directed mutagenesis and transient kinetic approaches to dissect the energetic contribution of intercalation for human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase, an enzyme that initiates repair of alkylation damage. When AAG flips out a damaged nucleotide, the void in the duplex is filled by a conserved tyrosine (Y162). We find that tyrosine intercalation confers 140-fold stabilization of the extrahelical specific recognition complex, and that Y162 functions as a plug to slow the rate of unflipping by 6000-fold relative to the Y162A mutant. Surprisingly, mutation to the smaller alanine side chain increases the rate of nucleotide flipping by 50-fold relative to the wild-type enzyme. This provides evidence against the popular model that DNA intercalation accelerates nucleotide flipping. In the case of AAG, DNA intercalation contributes to the specific binding of a damaged nucleotide, but this enhanced specificity comes at the cost of reduced speed of nucleotide flipping.

27541683	20160820	Population-level diversity in the association of genetic polymorphisms of one-carbon metabolism with breast cancer risk.	Aberrations in one-carbon metabolism were reported to increase breast cancer risk by influencing the DNA synthesis and methylation of DNA and catecholamines. However, the results of these association studies remain inconclusive. We have explored the contribution of eight genetic polymorphisms in modulating the susceptibility to breast cancer by performing a meta-analysis of worldwide studies. In total, 62 case-control studies representing 17 different populations involving 18,117 breast cancer cases and 23,573 healthy controls were included in this meta-analysis. Out of the eight polymorphisms analyzed, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T exhibited positive association with the breast cancer risk in both fixed effects (OR 1.14, 95?% CI 1.10-1.17) and random effects (OR 1.10, 95?% CI 1.02-1.18) models. Solute carrier family 19 (folate transporter), member 1 (SLC19A1) G80A exhibited positive association (OR 1.16, 95?% CI 1.03-1.31) while MTR A2756G exhibited an inverse association (OR 0.78, 95?% CI 0.75-0.82) with the breast in fixed effect model alone. Significant heterogeneity was observed in the association of MTHFR C677T with breast cancer even between studies from the same geographical area, specifically among Chinese, Indians, and Turks. Subgroup analysis revealed MTHFR C677T-mediated breast cancer risk in post-menopausal women and women with low dietary intake of folate. Geographical area wise segregation of data revealed MTHFR-mediated increased breast cancer risk in populations who consume methionine-rich diet. Altitude-level variations were observed in the association of SHMT1 C1420T with breast cancer. India and Brazil of same altitude showed an inverse association with this polymorphism, while USA and China that share similar altitude showed a null association. MTHFR C677T and SLC19A1 G80A are the two polymorphisms of one-carbon metabolic pathway that increase breast cancer in the worldwide population. Dietary patterns and altitudinal variations are the likely risk modulators that are contributing toward ethnic- and population-level variations in genetic associations. 	J_Community_Genet	D016428
22417621	20120316	Depolymerized chitosans functionalized with bPEI as carriers of nucleic acids and tuftsin-tethered conjugate for macrophage targeting.	Development of efficient and safe nucleic acid carriers (vectors) is one of the essential requirements for the success of gene therapy. Here, we have evaluated the gene transfer capability of chitosan-PEI (CP) conjugates prepared by conjugating low molecular weight branched polyethylenimine (LMWP) with depolymerized chitosans (7 and 10 kDa) via their terminal aldehyde/keto groups. The CP conjugates interacted efficiently with nucleic acids and also showed higher cellular uptake. These conjugates on complexation with DNA yielded nanoparticles in the size range of 100-130 nm (in case of C7P) and 115-160 nm (in case of C10P), which exhibited significantly higher transfection efficiency (~2-42 folds) in vitro compared to chitosans (high and low mol. wt.) and the commercially available transfection reagents retaining cell viability almost comparable to the native chitosan. Of the two CP conjugates, chitosan 7 kDa-LMWP (C7P) displayed higher gene transfer ability in the presence and absence of serum. Luciferase reporter gene analysis in male Balb/c mice receiving intravenous administration of C7P3/DNA polyplex showed the maximum expression in their spleen. Further, tuftsin, a known macrophage targeting molecule, was tethered to C7P3 and the resulting complex, i.e., C7P3-T/DNA, exhibited significantly higher gene expression in cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages as compared to unmodified C7P3/DNA complex without any cytotoxicity demonstrating the suitability of the conjugate for targeted applications. Conclusively, the study demonstrates the potential of the projected conjugates for gene delivery for wider biomedical applications. 	Biomaterials	D016428 D013485
25583416	20150114	Mutation screening of the Kr?ppel-like factor 1 gene using single-strand conformational polymorphism in a cohort of Iranian ?-thalassemia patients.	The Kr?ppel-like factor 1 (KLF1) is an essential erythroid-specific transcription factor. Mutations in the human KLF1 gene have different phenotypic effects, ranging from increased Hb F levels to the disruption of erythropoiesis. Here, we screened 227 Iranian ?-thalassemia (?-thal) patients for the presence of KLF1 mutations by using the single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) approach. Our aim was to assess the potential effect of these mutations on the ?-thal disease severity. After screening, two variants were found. One patient carried a potentially deleterious variant (Polyphen-2) in exon 2 (p.F182L). Another patient was homozygous for a previously unreported intronic variant (KLF1: c.911 + 84A &gt; G). The patient with the p.F182L variant (KLF1: c.544T &gt; C) had noticeably high Hb A2 levels (7.6%), consistent with the phenotypic effect of several previously characterized KLF1 mutations in the same exonic region. In addition, he had higher platelet counts (1,069,000/?L) compared to other patients in the cohort. 	Hemoglobin	D016428 D013485
17367769	20070321	Association between plasma lipid parameters and APOC3 genotypes in Brazilian subjects: effect of gender, smoking and APOE genotypes.	APOC3 polymorphisms were associated with lipid parameters and coronary artery disease in several populations but not all. Considering the multifactorial inheritance and environmental factors that underlie the determination of triglyceride (TG) and HDL-C levels, the aims of the present study were to perform association analyses of APOC3 polymorphisms and these lipids in a southern Brazilian population of European descent to investigate possible interactions with other genetic and/or environmental factors. Six hundred and seventy-three subjects participated in the study. -482C&gt;T, -455T&gt;C and 3238C&gt;G polymorphisms genotyping were carried out by PCR followed by restriction enzyme digestion. In female subjects the APOC3-APOE genotype combinations had a significant effect on triglyceride levels (ANOVA, P=0.009). Post hoc analysis showed that the observed differences were between APOC3 S(*)2 carriers and S(*)1S(*)1 homozygotes in individuals with an APOE(*)3/3 genotype (Tukey HSD post hoc test, P=0.027). In APOE(*)3/(*)3 subjects, the raising effect of APOC3 S(*)2 allele on TG concentrations was more pronounced in female smokers (+59.4%) than in nonsmokers (+18.8%, P of S(*)2-smoking interaction=0.009). Among APOE(*)3/(*)3 subjects, male carriers of the less common alleles -482T and -455C had significant lower levels of HDL-C compared to homozygotes -482C/C and -455T/T (P=0.02 and P=0.006, respectively). APOC3 polymorphisms were associated with lipid variables, but the magnitude of these associations was modulated by additional genetic, biologic and/or environmental factors.

12493839	20021221	Leucine 145 of the ribotoxin alpha-sarcin plays a key role for determining the specificity of the ribosome-inactivating activity of the protein.	Secreted fungal RNases, represented by RNase T1, constitute a family of structurally related proteins that includes ribotoxins such as alpha-sarcin. The active site residues of RNase T1 are conserved in all fungal RNases, except for Phe 100 that is not present in the ribotoxins, in which Leu 145 occupies the equivalent position. The mutant Leu145Phe of alpha-sarcin has been recombinantly produced and characterized by spectroscopic methods (circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, and NMR). These analyses have revealed that the mutant protein retained the overall conformation of the wild-type alpha-sarcin. According to the analyses performed, Leu 145 was shown to be essential to preserve the electrostatic environment of the active site that is required to maintain the anomalous low pKa value reported for the catalytic His 137 of alpha-sarcin. Enzymatic characterization of the mutant protein has revealed that Leu 145 is crucial for the specific activity of alpha-sarcin on ribosomes. 	Protein_Sci.	D016428 D013485
11279334	20010330	Role of thrombotic vascular risk factors in inflammatory bowel disease.	Thromboembolic disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is recognized that a hypercoagulable state exists in IBD which involves all components of the clotting system. It has been suggested that this hypercoagulable state is closely linked to the disease pathogenesis. Recent studies have shown that genetic defects such as factor V Leiden mutation and C677T methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphism associated with hyperhomocysteinemia seem to interfere in the thrombotic manifestations of IBD. Acquired factors such as antiphospholipid antibodies could also participate in the development of the thrombotic process. Deficiencies of other anticoagulant factors play a less important role in the thrombosis, and therefore it is not surprising that the results on these factors in IBD are contradictory. In conclusion the resultant gene-gene and gene-environment interactions between risk factors are the key to the understanding of why an IBD patient develops thrombosis at a specific point in time.

18490989	20080521	Taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships of nine species of Hypocrea with anamorphs assignable to Trichoderma section Hypocreanum.	Morphological studies and phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the nuclear ribosomal gene repeat, a partial sequence of RNA polymerase II subunit (rpb2), and a partial sequence of the large exon of tef1 (LEtef1) were used to investigate the taxonomy and systematics of nine Hypocrea species with anamorphs assignable to Trichoderma sect. Hypocreanum. Hypocrea corticioides and H. sulphurea are reevaluated. Their Trichoderma anamorphs are described and the phylogenetic positions of these species are determined. Hypocrea sulphurea and H. subcitrina are distinct species based on studies of the type specimens. Hypocrea egmontensis is a facultative synonym of the older name H. subcitrina. Hypocrea with anamorphs assignable to Trichoderma sect. Hypocreanum formed a well-supported clade. Five species with anamorphs morphologically similar to sect.

22481925	20120407	Molecular Analysis of TTF-1 and TTF-2 Genes in Patients with Early Onset Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma.	Two common variants, close from TTF-1 and TTF-2, were shown to predispose to thyroid cancer (TC) in European populations. We aimed to investigate whether TTF-1 and TTF-2 variants might contribute to TC early onset (EO). Tumor samples from eighteen patients with papillary TC (PTC), who underwent total thyroidectomy at an age of ?21, were screened for TTF-1 and TTF-2 variants. No TTF-1 variants were documented; two novel germinal TTF-2 variants, c.200C&gt;G (p.A67G) and c.510C&gt;A (p.A170A), were identified in two patients. Two already described TTF-2 variants were also documented; the allelic frequency among patients was not different from that observed among controls. Moreover, RET/PTC rearrangements and the BRAFV600E mutation were identified in 5/18 and 2/18 PTCs, respectively. Thyroglobulin (TG) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) expression was found to be significantly decreased in tumors, and the lowest level of TPO expression occurred in a tumor harboring both the p.A67GTTF-2 variant and a RET/PTC3 rearrangement.

2493241	19890301	Determinants of urea nitrogen production in sepsis. Muscle catabolism, total parenteral nutrition, and hepatic clearance of amino acids.	The major determinants of urea production were investigated in 26 patients with multiple trauma (300 studies). The body clearances (CLRs) of ten amino acids (AAs) were estimated as a ratio of muscle-released AAs plus total parenteral nutrition-infused AAs to their extracellular pool. While clinically septic trauma (ST) patients without multiple-organ failure syndrome (MOFS) had a higher level of urea nitrogen production (25.6 +/- 13.4 g of N per day) compared with nonseptic trauma (NST) patients (14 +/- 7.5 g of N per day) and with ST patients with MOFS (4.28 +/- 1.5 g of N per day), in all groups urea N production was found to be a function of muscle protein degradation (catabolism), total parenteral nutrition-administered AAs, and the ratio between leucine CLR and tyrosine CLR (L/T) (r2 = .82, P less than .0001). Since tyrosine is cleared almost exclusively by the liver, the L/T ratio may be regarded as an index of hepatic function. The significant differences between urea N production in ST and NST patients lay in an increased positive dependence on muscle catabolism and increased negative correlation with L/T in the ST group. At any L/T ratio, urea N production was increased in ST patients over NST patients, but in ST patients with MOFS, it fell to or below levels of NST patients. These data show that the ST process is associated with enhancement of ureagenesis, due to increased hepatic CLR of both exogenous and endogenous AAs. In sepsis with MOFS, a marked inhibition of urea synthesis occurs, partially explained by a decreased hepatic CLR of non-branched-chain AAs. 	Arch_Surg	D016428 D013485
16076400	20050804	The influence of acetyl phosphate on DspA signalling in the Cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803.	The dspA (hik33) gene, coding for a putative sensory histidine kinase, is conserved in plastids (ycf26) and cyanobacteria. It has been linked with a number of different stress responses in cyanobacteria. We constructed an insertional mutant of dspA (ycf26) in Synechocystis 6803. We found little phenotypic effect during nitrogen starvation. However, when the mutation was combined with deletion of the pta gene coding for phosphotransacetylase, a more significant phenotype was observed. Under nitrogen starvation, the pta/dspA double mutant degrades its phycobilisomes less than the wild type and still has about half of its chlorophyll-protein complexes. Our data indicates that acetyl-phosphate-dependent phosphorylation of response regulator(s) overlaps with DspA-dependent signalling of the degradation of chlorophyll-protein complexes (and to a lesser extent phycobilisomes) in Synechocystis 6803.

25165739	20140829	Effects of L-theanine on posttraumatic stress disorder induced changes in rat brain gene expression.	Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by the occurrence of a traumatic event that is beyond the normal range of human experience. The future of PTSD treatment may specifically target the molecular mechanisms of PTSD. In the US, approximately 20% of adults report taking herbal products to treat medical illnesses. L-theanine is the amino acid in green tea primarily responsible for relaxation effects. No studies have evaluated the potential therapeutic properties of herbal medications on gene expression in PTSD. We evaluated gene expression in PTSD-induced changes in the amygdala and hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were assigned to PTSD-stressed and nonstressed groups that received either saline, midazolam, L-theanine, or L-theanine + midazolam. Amygdala and hippocampus tissue samples were analyzed for changes in gene expression. One-way ANOVA was used to detect significant difference between groups in the amygdala and hippocampus. Of 88 genes examined, 17 had a large effect size greater than 0.138. Of these, 3 genes in the hippocampus and 5 genes in the amygdala were considered significant (P &lt; 0.05) between the groups. RT-PCR analysis revealed significant changes between groups in several genes implicated in a variety of disorders ranging from PTSD, anxiety, mood disorders, and substance dependence.

15525785	20041105	Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta phosphorylates Bax and promotes its mitochondrial localization during neuronal apoptosis.	Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) is a critical activator of neuronal apoptosis induced by a diverse array of neurotoxic insults. However, the downstream substrates of GSK-3beta that ultimately induce neuronal death are unknown. Here, we show that GSK-3beta phosphorylates and regulates the activity of Bax, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member that stimulates the intrinsic (mitochondrial) death pathway by eliciting cytochrome c release from mitochondria. In cerebellar granule neurons undergoing apoptosis, inhibition of GSK-3beta suppressed both the mitochondrial translocation of an expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Bax(alpha) fusion protein and the conformational activation of endogenous Bax. GSK-3beta directly phosphorylated Bax(alpha) on Ser163, a residue found within a species-conserved, putative GSK-3beta phosphorylation motif. Coexpression of GFP-Bax(alpha) with a constitutively active mutant of GSK-3beta, GSK-3beta(Ser9Ala), enhanced the in vivo phosphorylation of wild-type Bax(alpha), but not a Ser163Ala mutant of Bax(alpha), in transfected human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. Moreover, cotransfection with constitutively active GSK-3beta promoted the localization of Bax(alpha) to mitochondria and induced apoptosis in both transfected HEK293 cells and cerebellar granule neurons. In contrast, neither a Ser163Ala point mutant of Bax(alpha) nor a naturally occurring splice variant that lacks 13 amino acids encompassing Ser163 (Bax(sigma)) were driven to mitochondria in HEK293 cells coexpressing constitutively active GSK-3beta. In a similar manner, either mutation or deletion of the identified GSK-3beta phosphorylation motif prevented the localization of Bax to mitochondria in cerebellar granule neurons undergoing apoptosis. Our results indicate that GSK-3beta exerts some of its pro-apoptotic effects in neurons by regulating the mitochondrial localization of Bax, a key component of the intrinsic apoptotic cascade.

19779722	20090926	Single-nucleotide polymorphisms p53 G72C and Mdm2 T309G in patients with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and SAPHO syndrome.	Psoriasis (Ps), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and SAPHO syndrome are diseases of unknown etiology that share common clinical features; however, family studies support the hypothesis of a genetic background for each of these diseases. To study the two common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the murine-double-minute-2-(Mdm2) and p53 genes in patients with Ps, PsA, and SAPHO syndrome. Genomic DNA was obtained from 187 patients with Ps, 50 with PsA, and 36 with SAPHO as well as 478 healthy controls. Mdm2-gene SNP T309G and p53-gene SNP G72C genotypes were determined by the polymerase chain reaction. Genotype and allele frequencies were analyzed with chi(2)-tests. Among the patients with Ps and PsA, no differences in allele or genotype frequencies of the p53-gene SNP G72C and Mdm2-gene SNP T309G were detected. However, in the SAPHO patients group, the frequencies of the Mdm2 SNP309 G allele and the genotype SNP 309 GG were significantly increased compared with the controls (G allele: 51.4 vs. 38.7%, P = 0.034; genotype GG: 36.1 vs. 14.2%, P = 0.002). In addition, the frequencies of the p53 SNP72 C allele and the genotype SNP 72 CC were also increased in the SAPHO patients cohort (C allele: 36.1 vs. 25.6%, P = 0.05; genotype CC: 16.7 vs. 6.3%, P = 0.05). SAPHO syndrome may be linked to an imbalance between MDM2 and p53 regulation with a &quot;weak&quot; p53-response associated with the Mdm2 SNP 309 G allele. In contrast, the p53 network does not seem to play a major role in pathogenesis of Ps or PsA. 	Rheumatol._Int.	D016428 D013485
16616458	20060418	Genetic analysis of the human ENTH (Epsin 4) gene and schizophrenia.	Numerous linkage studies suggest that chromosome 5q may be one of the important cytogenetic regions containing risk loci for schizophrenia susceptibility. Recently, genetic variations (rs254664 and rs10046055) in the intron 1 and 5' flanking regions of the ENTH (also known as Epsin 4) gene, which is located in 5q 33.3, have been demonstrated to be significantly associated with schizophrenia. The present study investigates whether this finding could be replicated in a population of Han Chinese, consisting of 269 patients with schizophrenia and 236 normal controls, by analyzing 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) ranging from the 5' upstream region to intron 8 of the ENTH gene and covering 96 kb. The results showed that we failed to identify the associations of rs1186922 and rs10046055 with schizophrenia. Although another genetic variation (rs1186922) showed a weak association with schizophrenia (uncorrected p value for alleles = 0.038), the significance did not survive after Bonferroni correction. This study thus fails to support an association of genetic variations in the ENTH gene and schizophrenia. 	Schizophr._Res.	D016428 D013485
22022446	20111025	Age-related impairment of ultrasonic vocalization in Tau.P301L mice: possible implication for progressive language disorders.	Tauopathies, including Alzheimer's Disease, are the most frequent neurodegenerative diseases in elderly people and cause various cognitive, behavioural and motor defects, but also progressive language disorders. For communication and social interactions, mice produce ultrasonic vocalization (USV) via expiratory airflow through the larynx. We examined USV of Tau.P301L mice, a mouse model for tauopathy expressing human mutant tau protein and developing cognitive, motor and upper airway defects. At age 4-5 months, Tau.P301L mice had normal USV, normal expiratory airflow and no brainstem tauopathy. At age 8-10 months, Tau.P301L mice presented impaired USV, reduced expiratory airflow and severe tauopathy in the periaqueductal gray, Kolliker-Fuse and retroambiguus nuclei. Tauopathy in these nuclei that control upper airway function and vocalization correlates well with the USV impairment of old Tau.P301L mice. In a mouse model for tauopathy, we report for the first time an age-related impairment of USV that correlates with tauopathy in midbrain and brainstem areas controlling vocalization. The vocalization disorder of old Tau.P301L mice could be, at least in part, reminiscent of language disorders of elderly suffering tauopathy. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061 D013485
24988209	20140703	Assessment of still and moving images in the diagnosis of gastric lesions using magnifying narrow-band imaging in a prospective multicenter trial.	Magnifying narrow-band imaging (M-NBI) is more accurate than white-light imaging for diagnosing small gastric cancers. However, it is uncertain whether moving M-NBI images have additional effects in the diagnosis of gastric cancers compared with still images. A prospective multicenter cohort study. To identify the additional benefits of moving M-NBI images by comparing the diagnostic accuracy of still images only with that of both still and moving images. Still and moving M-NBI images of 40 gastric lesions were obtained by an expert endoscopist prior to this prospective multicenter cohort study. Thirty-four endoscopists from ten different Japanese institutions participated in the prospective multicenter cohort study. Each study participant was first tested using only still M-NBI images (still image test), then tested 1 month later using both still and moving M-NBI images (moving image test). The main outcome was a difference in the diagnostic accuracy of cancerous versus noncancerous lesions between the still image test and the moving image test. Thirty-four endoscopists were analysed. There were no significant difference of cancerous versus noncancerous lesions between still and moving image tests in the diagnostic accuracy (59.9% versus 61.5%), sensitivity (53.4% versus 55.9%), and specificity (67.0% versus 67.6%). And there were no significant difference in the diagnostic accuracy between still and moving image tests of demarcation line (65.4% versus 65.5%), microvascular pattern (56.7% versus 56.9%), and microsurface pattern (48.1% versus 50.9%). Diagnostic accuracy showed no significant difference between the still and moving image tests in the subgroups of endoscopic findings of the lesions. The addition of moving M-NBI images to still M-NBI images does not improve the diagnostic accuracy for gastric lesions. It is reasonable to concentrate on taking sharp still M-NBI images during endoscopic observation and use them for diagnosis. Umin.ac.jp UMIN-CTR000008048. 	PLoS_ONE	D016430 D003160 D016428 D016448

Zoonotic West Nile virus (WNV) circulates in natural transmission cycles involving certain mosquitoes and birds, horses, humans, and a range of other vertebrates are incidental hosts. Clinical infections in humans can range in severity from uncomplicated WNV fever to fatal meningoencephalitis. Since its introduction to the Western Hemisphere in 1999, WNV had spread across North America, Central and South America and the Caribbean, although the vast majority of severe human cases have occurred in the United States of America (USA) and Canada. By 2002-2003, the WNV outbreaks have involved thousands of patients causing severe neurologic disease (meningoencephalitis and poliomyelitis-like syndrome) and hundreds of associated fatalities in USA. The purpose of this review is to present recent information on the epidemiology and pathogenicity of WNV since its emergence in North America. 	Vet._Res.	D016428 D013485 D013486 D016454

Interleukin (IL)-1 is markedly overexpressed in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to evaluate the relationship between three polymorphisms of the IL1 gene (IL-1beta promoter -511T/C, IL-1beta exon 5 E1/E2 and IL-1-RA) and late onset AD in Taiwan Chinese. Forty-six late onset AD patients and 103 unrelated, age-matched, healthy controls living in the same area were included. PCR was used to resolve the two IL-1beta polymorphisms and the IL-1Ra intron 2 polymorphism. The -511T/T type of the IL-1beta promoter (unlike IL-1beta exon 5 and IL-1-RA) was more frequently found in AD than in healthy patients (-511C/C type versus T/T type, OR = 0.944, CI = 0.393, 2.269, P = 0.898; -511C/T type versus T/T type, OR = 0.375, CI = 0.156, 0.902, P = 0.028). The -511T/T genotype (unlike the other two polymorphisms) is a marker demonstrating that late onset AD in Chinese patients in Taiwan is genetically determined. 	Eur._J._Neurol.	D003160 D016428
12135986	20020724	A developmental conundrum: a stabilized form of beta-catenin lacking the transcriptional activation domain triggers features of hair cell fate in epidermal cells and epidermal cell fate in hair follicle cells.	Wnt signaling orchestrates morphogenetic processes in which changes in gene expression are associated with dramatic changes in cell organization within developing tissue/organs. Upon signaling, excess beta-catenin not utilized at cell-cell junctions becomes stabilized, where it can provide the transcriptional activating domain for Lef/Tcf DNA binding proteins. In skin epithelium, forced stabilization of beta-catenin in epidermis promotes hair follicle morphogenesis, whereas conditional removal of beta-catenin in hair progenitor cells specifies an epidermal fate. We now report that a single protein, a stabilized version of beta-catenin lacking the COOH-terminal transactivation domain, acts in epidermis to promote hair fates and in hair cells to promote epidermal fate. This reveals fundamental differences in ways that epidermal and hair cells naturally respond to beta-catenin signaling. In exploring the phenotype, we uncovered mechanistic insights into the complexities of Lef1/Tcf/beta-catenin signaling. Importantly, how a cell will respond to the transgene product, where it will be localized, and whether it can lead to activation of endogenous beta-catenin/Tcf/Lef complexes is specifically tailored to skin stem cells, their particular lineage and their relative stage of differentiation. Finally, by varying the level of beta-catenin signaling during a cell fate program, the skin cell appears to be pliable, switching fates multiple times. 	J._Cell_Biol.	D016428 D013487
19209008	20090212	The p53 codon 72 exon 4 BstUI polymorphism and endometrial cancer in Caucasian women.	Studies on the association between the p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and endometrial cancer have reported contrasting conclusions. With the exception of Asian subjects, data demonstrating the influence of this polymorphism on endometrial carcinogenesis in other races/ethnic groups, including Caucasians, are scarce. Thus, we aimed to investigate its role in the development of endometrial cancer and its association with prognostic markers. A case-control study examining the p53 codon 72 polymorphism in a total of 451 samples (121 cancer patients, 330 healthy controls) using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing techniques was conducted. Genotypes were correlated with clinico-pathological factors and age. Logistic regression analyses were used to adjust for possible confounding variables, and data were evaluated using the Pearson chi(2) test. We found the Pro allele and genotype frequency to be insignificantly higher in cases than controls (Pro allele: 24.8 and 22.3%, respectively; genotypes: Arg/Pro 36.36 and 34.24%, Pro/Pro 6.61 and 5.15%, respectively). Logistic regression analysis revealed an increased risk for disease in carriers of the Pro allele, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.13 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73-1.76] for heterozygotes and an OR of 1.36 (95% CI 0.56-3.30) for homozygotes. Furthermore, we noted a trend for Arg/Pro + Pro/Pro towards poor tumour differentiation, angioinvasion, pelvic lymph node spread and type II carcinomas, with ORs of 1.27 (95% CI 0.60-2.66), 1.24 (95% CI 0.67-2.30), 1.21 (95% CI 0.53-2.75) and 1.69 (95% CI 0.70-4.10), respectively. Additionally, the Pro genotype was associated with a lower risk for cancer in women with early menarche (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.60-2.28) and late menopause (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.30-1.63). Despite the increased or decreased risk observed for some variables, none of these trends were significant. Our data did not demonstrate any significant difference in the prevalence of the p53 Arg72Pro genotype between patients and controls, providing evidence that this polymorphism is only weakly associated with the risk of endometrial cancer and prognostic factors in Caucasian women.

19175781	20090130	Mutation of GJB2 in a Chinese patient with keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome and brain malformation.	Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome (KID) is a rare congenital disorder. Mutations in the GJB2 gene have recently been identified as the causative mutations of KID. To define the GJB2 mutation in a Chinese patient with KID and brain malformation. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and used to amplify the GJB2 gene. Direct sequencing and endonuclease digestion were used for mutation analysis. We identified a heterozygous missense mutation (D50N) in the GJB2 gene in this patient. These results indicate that KID syndrome in this patient was caused by a dominant mutation of GJB2.

24886710	20140603	JMJD2A contributes to breast cancer progression through transcriptional repression of the tumor suppressor ARHI.	Breast cancer is a worldwide health problem and the leading cause of cancer death among females. We previously identified Jumonji domain containing 2A (JMJD2A) as a critical mediator of breast cancer proliferation, migration and invasion. We now report that JMJD2A could promote breast cancer progression through transcriptional repression of the tumor suppressor aplasia Ras homolog member I (ARHI). Immunohistochemistry was performed to examine protein expressions in 155 cases of breast cancer and 30 non-neoplastic tissues. Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between JMJD2A expression and clinical parameters as well as several tumor regulators in 155 cases of breast cancer. Gene and protein expressions were monitored by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot. Results from knockdown of JMJD2A, overexpression of JMJD2A, Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay, dual luciferase reporter gene assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) elucidated molecular mechanisms of JMJD2A action in breast cancer progression. Furthermore, the effects of ARHI overexpression on JMJD2A-mediated tumor progression were investigated in vitro and in vivo. For in vitro experiments, cell proliferation, wound-healing, migration and invasion were monitored by cell counting, scratch and Boyden Chamber assays. For in vivo experiments, control cells and cells stably expressing JMJD2A alone or together with ARHI were inoculated into mammary fat pads of mice. Tumor volume, tumor weight and metastatic nodules were measured by caliper, electronic balance and nodule counting, respectively. JMJD2A was highly expressed in human breast cancers and positively correlated with tumor progression. Knockdown of JMJD2A increased ARHI expression whereas overexpression of JMJD2A decreased ARHI expression at both protein and mRNA levels. Furthermore, E2Fs and histone deacetylases were involved in the transcriptional repression of ARHI expression by JMJD2A. And the aggressive behavior of JMJD2A in breast cancers could be reversed by re-expression of ARHI in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated a cancer-promoting effect of JMJD2A and defined a novel molecular pathway contributing to JMJD2A-mediated breast cancer progression. 	Breast_Cancer_Res.	D016428 D013485
27096222	20160421	No evidence of an association between MIR137 rs1625579 and schizophrenia in Asians: a meta-analysis in 30?843 individuals.	Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder with high heritability. A single nucleotide polymorphism rs1625579 in the miR-137 gene has recently been reported to confer risk of schizophrenia by a genome-wide association study in populations of European ancestry. However, subsequent association studies in Asian populations yielded inconsistent results. To carry out a systematic meta-analysis of rs1625579 with schizophrenia in Asian populations, we collected phenotypic and genetic data from individual replication samples of up to 11?887 schizophrenic patients, 16?660 normal controls, and 579 families. The results from analysis after pooling all the eligible case-control and family-based samples suggest that rs1625579 was not associated with schizophrenia in Asian populations (P=0.161, odds ratio=1.074). Moderate genetic heterogeneity was found between individual samples (P=0.130, I=34.7%). 'Leave-one-out' sensitivity analysis showed that removal of any of the individual samples did not lead to significant associations. We could not confirm the significant association of rs1625579 with schizophrenia in Asian samples, which may have resulted from potential genetic heterogeneity on this locus between continental populations.

17283177	20070207	Genetic variation in base excision repair genes and the prevalence of advanced colorectal adenoma.	Base excision repair (BER) corrects DNA damage caused by oxidative stress and low folate intake, which are putative risk factors for colorectal neoplasia. To examine the relationship between genetic variation in BER genes and colorectal adenoma risk, we conducted a case-control study of 767 cases of advanced colorectal adenoma and 773 controls from the baseline screening exam of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Cases included participants diagnosed with advanced left-sided adenoma, and controls were subjects without evidence of a left-sided polyp by sigmoidoscopy, frequency-matched to cases on race and gender. Twenty single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in four BER genes (APEX1, PARP1, POLB, and XRCC1), and conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the association with colorectal adenoma. Two variants with possible functional significance were associated with risk. The APEX1 51H variant was associated with a borderline significant decreased risk of colorectal adenoma (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44-1.00), and the XRCC1 399Q variant was inversely associated with risk among Caucasians (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64-0.99). Homozygotes at two PARP1 loci (A284A and IVS13+118G&gt;A) were also associated with a decreased risk of colorectal adenoma compared with wild-type carriers (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.49-0.98 for both), which was restricted to advanced adenomas displaying histologically aggressive characteristics (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.33-0.78, P = 0.002 for PARP1 A284A). This study suggests that polymorphisms in APEX1, XRCC1, and PARP1 may be associated with advanced colorectal adenoma. 	Cancer_Res.	D016428 D016449 D052060
24421780	20140115	Estimating the diversity, completeness, and cross-reactivity of the T cell repertoire.	In order to recognize and combat a diverse array of pathogens the immune system has a large repertoire of?T cells having unique?T cell receptors (TCRs) with only a few clones specific for any given antigen. We discuss how the number of different possible TCRs encoded in the genome (the potential repertoire) and the number of different TCRs present in an individual (the realized repertoire) can be measured. One puzzle is that the potential repertoire greatly exceeds the realized diversity of na?ve?T cells within any individual. We show that the existing hypotheses fail to explain why the immune system has the potential to generate far more diversity than is used in an individual, and propose an alternative hypothesis of &quot;evolutionary sloppiness.&quot; Another immunological puzzle is why mice and humans have similar repertoires even though humans have over 1000-fold more?T cells. We discuss how the idea of the &quot;protecton,&quot; the smallest unit of protection, might explain this discrepancy and estimate the size of &quot;protecton&quot; based on available precursor frequencies data. We then consider?T cell cross-reactivity - the ability of a?T cell clone to respond to more than one epitope. We extend existing calculations to estimate the extent of expected cross-reactivity between the responses to different pathogens. Our results are consistent with two observations: a low probability of observing cross-reactivity between the immune responses to two randomly chosen pathogens; and the ensemble of memory cells being sufficiently diverse to generate cross-reactive responses to new pathogens.

15310993	20040818	Effects of systematic 12-core biopsy on the performance of percent free prostate specific antigen for prostate cancer detection.	The performance characteristics of percent free (f) prostate specific antigen (PSA) for differentiating between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer were originally established using primarily sextant biopsy. We determined whether the addition of 6 laterally directed cores to the traditional sextant prostate biopsy affects the performance of percent fPSA. We retrospectively evaluated a cohort of 350 consecutive biopsies in men with negative digital rectal examinations and PSA between 4 and 10 ng/ml who underwent systematic 12 core biopsy (S12C) biopsy at Scott Department of Urology between March 1999 and January 2003. The effects of 6 additional, laterally directed biopsies on the sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve for percent fPSA was evaluated in the 277 men in whom percent fPSA was measured. Cancers detected exclusively in the 6 laterally directed cores were associated with percent fPSA values similar to those in patients with a benign S12C biopsy. This resulted in a modest and yet predictable decrease in the sensitivity of percent fPSA at each biopsy threshold value without affecting specificity. There was a nonstatistically significant decrease in the area under the ROC curve with the addition of 6 laterally directed cores to sextant biopsy (medial sextant cores 0.66 vs S12C 0.60). The 12 core biopsy strategies have a higher cancer detection rate than sextant biopsies and they are gaining widespread acceptance. The addition of 6 laterally directed cores to traditional sextant biopsy may result in a modest decrease in the sensitivity of percent fPSA at each selected biopsy threshold without affecting specificity.

18556510	20080617	Fate mapping and lineage analyses demonstrate the production of a large number of striatal neuroblasts after transforming growth factor alpha and noggin striatal infusions into the dopamine-depleted striatum.	Infusion of transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha) into the adult dopamine (DA)-depleted striatum generates a local population of nestin(+)/proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)(+) newborn cells. The precise origin and fate of these new striatal cells are unknown, making it difficult to direct them for neural repair in Parkinson's disease. Experiments in rats using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to label neural progenitor cells showed that during TGFalpha infusion in the DA-depleted striatum, newborn striatal cells formed a homogeneous population of precursors, with the majority coexpressing nestin, Mash1, Olig2, and epidermal growth factor receptor, consistent with the phenotype of multipotent C cells. Upon TGFalpha pump withdrawal, the subventricular zone (SVZ) was repopulated by neuroblasts. Strikingly, during this period, numerous clusters of doublecortin(+)/polysialylated neuronal cell adhesion molecule(+) neuroblasts were also produced in the ipsilateral medial striatum. In parallel, striatal BrdU(+)/glial fibrillary acidic protein(+) astrocytes were generated, but no BrdU(+)/O4(+)/CNPase(+) oligodendrocytes were generated. Infusion of the neuralizing bone morphogenetic protein antagonist noggin after TGFalpha pump withdrawal increased the neuroblast-to-astrocyte ratio among new striatal cells by blocking glial differentiation but did not alter striatal neurogenesis. At no time or treatment condition were differentiated neurons generated, including DA neurons. Using 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned nestin-CreER(T2)/R26R-YFP mice that allow genetic fate-mapping of SVZ nestin(+) cells, we show that TGFalpha-generated striatal cells originate from SVZ nestin(+) precursors that confirmed data from the rats on the phenotype and fate of striatal nestin(+)/PCNA(+) cells upon TGFalpha withdrawal. This work demonstrates that a large population of multipotent striatal C-like cells can be generated in the DA-depleted striatum that do not spontaneously differentiate into DA neurons.

Whole-cell microbial biosensors are one of the newest molecular tools used in environmental monitoring.

There have been many reports of the applications of biosensors, particularly their use in assaying pollutant toxicity and bioavailability. This paper reviews the basic concepts behind the construction of whole-cell microbial biosensors for pollutant monitoring, and describes the applications of two such biosensors for detecting the bioavailability and biodegradation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).

12667054	20030402	Phe 771 of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) is the major site for the interaction with the template overhang and the stabilization of the pre-polymerase ternary complex.	To identify the sites in the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I that interact with the ssDNA overhang of the template strand in the pre-polymerase ternary complex, we carried out UV-mediated photo-cross-linking of the enzyme-DNA-dNTP ternary complex. The template strand contained a nine-nucleotide overhang and was radiolabeled at the 5'-end. Since the enzyme-TP-dNTP ternary complex but not the E-TP binary complex is stable at high ionic strengths, the cross-linking was carried out in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl. The cross-linked E-TP-dNTP complex was purified and subjected to trypsin digestion. The radiolabeled TP cross-linked peptide was further purified by DEAE-Sepharose and C18 column chromatography and subjected to amino acid sequencing. The release of radiolabeled DNA during each sequencing cycle was also monitored. The sequencing results as well as the radioactivity release pattern show that F771, contained in a peptide spanning amino acids 759-775 of pol I, is the unequivocal site of the template cross-linking. A qualitative assessment of the cross-linking efficiency of the template overhang containing a TT sequence at different positions in the ternary complex further suggests that the major cross-linking site within the template overhang is at the second and/or third nucleotide. An examination of the F771A mutant enzyme showed that it was able to form the E-TP binary as well as E-TP-dNTP ternary complex; however, it could not cross-link to the template-primer in the ternary complex. Furthermore, the ternary complex with F771A was qualitatively defective and exhibited some salt sensitivity. These results suggest that F771 participates in the stabilization of the pre-polymerase ternary complex. 	Biochemistry	D003160 D016428 D013487
24745147	20140422	FASN gene polymorphism in indigenous cattle breeds of Turkey.	The aim of this study was to determine the variants of the thioesterase (TE) beta-ketoacyl reductase (KR) domains of the Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN) gene, in the East Anatolian Red (EAR) and South Anatolian Red (SAR) cattle breeds. It has been suggested that the FASN gene is effective on fatty acid composition of meat in cattle. In this study, the genotype and allele frequencies of g.17924 A&gt;G, g.18440 G&gt;A and g.16024 G&gt;A, g.16039 T&gt;C in TE and KR domains, respectively, were detected by using polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The g.18663 T&gt;C polymorphism of the TE domain was determined by direct sequencing. The GG genotype of the g.17924 A&gt;G polymorphism, which affects unsaturated fatty acid composition positively, has a high frequency in EAR and SAR breeds. The frequencies of the two haplotypes g.16024 G&gt;A and g.16039 T&gt;C in the KR domain were found to be significantly high in both breeds. These haplotypes also have positive effects on unsaturated fatty acid composition. The AA genotype of the g. 18440 G&gt;A polymorphism, which is suggested to be absent in Bos taurus breeds, was detected in SAR and EAR breeds with frequencies close to those in Bos indicus breeds. In conclusion, we suggest that SAR and EAR cattle breeds have an advantage in terms of genotype and haplotype distribution of the polymorphisms in TE and KR domains of the FASN gene. Additionally g.18440 G&gt;A polymorphism might be a potential marker for breed discrimination. 	Folia_Biol._(Krakow)	D016428 D013485

21531158	20110503	Binding modes of diketo-acid inhibitors of HIV-1 integrase: a comparative molecular dynamics simulation study.	HIV-1 integrase (IN) has become an attractive target since drug resistance against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR) has appeared. Diketo acid (DKA) inhibitors are potent and selective inhibitors of HIV-1 IN: however the action mechanism is not well understood. Here, to study the inhibition mechanism of DKAs we performed 10 ns comparative molecular dynamics simulations on HIV-1 IN bound with three most representative DKA inhibitors: Shionogi inhibitor, S-1360 and two Merck inhibitors L-731,988 and L-708,906. Our simulations show that the acidic part of S-1360 formed salt bridge and cation-? interactions with Lys159. In addition, the catalytic Glu152 in S-1360 was pushed away from the active site to form an ion-pair interaction with Arg199. The Merck inhibitors can maintain either one or both of these ion-pair interaction features. The difference in potencies of the DKA inhibitors is thus attributed to the different binding modes at the catalytic site. Such structural information at atomic level, not only demonstrates the action modes of DKA inhibitors but also provides a novel starting point for structural-based design of HIV-1 IN inhibitors.

19467307	20090527	Development and formulation of a 0.2% oral solution of midazolam containing gamma-cyclodextrin.	In absence of dedicated children formulation, intravenous formulations of midazolam, which exhibit strong bitterness, are occasionally used for oral or sublingual administration. In order to improve the quality and the acceptance by children of a midazolam anesthesia premedication, a new 0.2% (w/v) aqueous solution for oral administration has been prepared. The final formulation was obtained by the adjunction of a sweetener (sucralose), an aroma (orange aroma) and gamma-cyclodextrin to a citric acid solution of midazolam. The gamma-cyclodextrin forms an inclusion complex with the hydrophobic midazolam as evidenced using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (stoichiometry 1:1, K=283 M(-1)). A sterile filtration method was selected for the formulation microbial preservation using liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Finally, a routine high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method is proposed for the quantitative determination of global midazolam amount in the pharmaceutical preparation.

26776497	20160119	Assessing methanotrophy and carbon fixation for biofuel production by Methanosarcina acetivorans.	Methanosarcina acetivorans is a model archaeon with renewed interest due to its unique reversible methane production pathways. However, the mechanism and relevant pathways implicated in (co)utilizing novel carbon substrates in this organism are still not fully understood. This paper provides a comprehensive inventory of thermodynamically feasible routes for anaerobic methane oxidation, co-reactant utilization, and maximum carbon yields of major biofuel candidates by M. acetivorans. Here, an updated genome-scale metabolic model of M. acetivorans is introduced (iMAC868 containing 868 genes, 845 reactions, and 718 metabolites) by integrating information from two previously reconstructed metabolic models (i.e., iVS941 and iMB745), modifying 17 reactions, adding 24 new reactions, and revising 64 gene-protein-reaction associations based on newly available information. The new model establishes improved predictions of growth yields on native substrates and is capable of correctly predicting the knockout outcomes for 27 out of 28 gene deletion mutants. By tracing a bifurcated electron flow mechanism, the iMAC868 model predicts thermodynamically feasible (co)utilization pathway of methane and bicarbonate using various terminal electron acceptors through the reversal of the aceticlastic pathway. This effort paves the way in informing the search for thermodynamically feasible ways of (co)utilizing novel carbon substrates in the domain Archaea. 	Microb._Cell_Fact.	D016428 D013485
17268813	20070203	Estrogen receptor alpha haplotypes and breast cancer risk in older Caucasian women.	Life-long exposure to estrogen is an established risk factor for breast cancer development. The underlying mechanism has been suggested to be the binding of estrogen-to-estrogen receptors in mammary tissue, which in turn promotes the proliferation and differentiation of breast tissue. Polymorphisms and haplotypes in estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) have been reportedly associated with breast cancer risk; however, the results are not fully consistent. In this study, we investigated breast cancer risk associated with genotypes and haplotypes resulting from four ESR1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs746432, rs2234693, rs9340799, and rs1801132. Genotyping has been performed on 393 breast cancer cases and 790 randomly selected controls in 1,183 Caucasian women over age 65 from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF). We observed an allelic protective effect for SNP rs9340799 with an estimated odds ratio (OR) of 0.82 (95% CI = 0.68-1.00; P = 0.04) after adjustment for age, BMI and hip BMD. A protective effect of this SNP has been reported before in several different studies. We did not replicate the previously reported C-C-A-G haplotype association to breast cancer-the C-C-A-G haplotype from these SNPs was rare in this study (estimated frequency below 0.001% in cases and controls). No other statistically significant associations were observed between ESR1 haplotypes from the same four SNPs and the risk of breast cancer in older Caucasian women. 	Breast_Cancer_Res._Treat.

20859243	20100923	Role of organic cation transporter 3 (SLC22A3) and its missense variants in the pharmacologic action of metformin.	The goals of this study were to determine the role of organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) in the pharmacological action of metformin and to identify and functionally characterize genetic variants of OCT3 with respect to the uptake of metformin and monoamines. For pharmacological studies, we evaluated metformin-induced activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, a molecular target of metformin. We used quantitative PCR and immunostaining to localize the transporter and isotopic uptake studies in cells transfected with OCT3 and its nonsynonymous genetic variants for functional analyses. Quantitative PCR and immunostaining showed that OCT3 was expressed high on the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle and liver, target tissues for metformin action. Both the OCT inhibitor, cimetidine, and OCT3-specific short hairpin RNA significantly reduced the activating effect of metformin on AMP-activated protein kinase. To identify genetic variants in OCT3, we used recent data from the 1000 Genomes and the Pharmacogenomics of Membrane Transporters projects. Six novel missense variants were identified. In functional assays, using various monoamines and metformin, three variants, T44M (c.131C&gt;T), T400I (c.1199C&gt;T) and V423F (c.1267G&gt;T) showed altered substrate specificity. Notably, in cells expressing T400I and V423F, the uptakes of metformin and catecholamines were significantly reduced, but the uptakes of metformin, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium and histamine by T44M were significantly increased more than 50%. Structural modeling suggested that these two variants may be located in the pore lining (T400) or proximal (V423) membrane-spanning helixes.

26108647	20150626	The Spectrum of Krabbe Disease in Greece: Biochemical and Molecular Findings.	Krabbe disease is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease caused by the deficiency of ?-galactocerebrosidase. This deficiency results in the impaired degradation of ?-galactocerebroside, a major myelin lipid, and of galactosylsphingosine. Based on the age of onset of neurological symptoms, an infantile form (90% patients) and late-onset forms (10% patients) of the disease are recognized. Over 130 disease-causing mutations have been identified in the ?-galactocerebrosidase gene. We present the biochemical and molecular findings in 19 cases of Krabbe disease, 17 of them unrelated, diagnosed in Greece over the last 30 years. ?-Galactocerebrosidase activity assayed in leukocyte homogenates using either the tritium-labeled or the fluorescent substrate was diagnostic for all. Increased plasma chitotriosidase activity was found in 11/15 patients.Mutational analysis, carried out in 11 unrelated cases, identified seven different mutations, four previously described (p.I250T, c.1161+6532_polyA+9kbdel, p.K139del, p.D187V) and three novel mutations (p.D610A, c.583-1 G&gt;C, p.W132X), and seven distinct genotypes. The most prevalent mutation was mutation p.I250T, first described in a patient of Greek origin. It accounted for 36.4% (8/22) of the mutant alleles. The second most frequent mutation was c.1161+6532_polyA+9kbdel that accounted for 22.7% (5/22) of the mutant alleles. The observed frequency was lower than that described in Northern European countries and closer to that described in Italian patients. 	JIMD_Rep	D016428
22363326	20120225	Tracing lifestyle adaptation in prokaryotic genomes.	Lifestyle adaptation of microbes due to changes in their ecological niches or acquisition of new environments is a major driving force for genetic changes in their respective genomes. Moving into more specialized niches often results in the acquisition of new gene sets via horizontal gene transfer to utilize previously unavailable metabolites, while genetic ballast is shed by gene loss and/or gene inactivation. In some cases, larger genome rearrangements can be observed, such as the incorporation of whole genetic islands, providing a range of new phenotypic capabilities. Until recently these changes could not be comprehensively followed and identified due to the lack of complete microbial genome sequences. The advent of high-throughput DNA sequencing has dramatically changed the scientific landscape and today microbial genomes have become increasingly abundant. Currently, more than 2,900 genomes are published and more than 11,000 genome projects are listed in the Genomes Online Database. Although this wealth of information provides many new opportunities to assess microbial functionality, it also creates a new array of challenges when a comparison between multiple microbial genomes is required. Here, functional genome distribution (FGD) is introduced, analyzing the diversity between microbes based on their predicted ORFeome. FGD is therefore a comparative genomics approach, emphasizing the assessments of gene complements. To further facilitate the comparison between two or more genomes, degrees of amino-acid similarities between ORFeomes can be visualized in the Artemis comparison tool, graphically depicting small and large scale genome rearrangements, insertion and deletion events, and levels of similarity between individual open reading frames. FGD provides a new tool for comparative microbial genomics and the interpretation of differences in the genetic makeup of bacteria. 	Front_Microbiol	D016428
27938668	20161213	Cellular encoding of Cy dyes for single-molecule imaging.	A general method is described for the site-specific genetic encoding of cyanine dyes as non-canonical amino acids (Cy-ncAAs) into proteins. The approach relies on an improved technique for nonsense suppression with in vitro misacylated orthogonal tRNA. The data show that Cy-ncAAs (based on Cy3 and Cy5) are tolerated by the eukaryotic ribosome in cell-free and whole-cell environments and can be incorporated into soluble and membrane proteins. In the context of theXenopus laevisoocyte expression system, this technique yields ion channels with encoded Cy-ncAAs that are trafficked to the plasma membrane where they display robust function and distinct fluorescent signals as detected by TIRF microscopy. This is the first demonstration of an encoded cyanine dye as a ncAA in a eukaryotic expression system and opens the door for the analysis of proteins with single-molecule resolution in a cellular environment.

22303291	20120204	Identification of genetic determinants and enzymes involved with the amidation of glutamic acid residues in the peptidoglycan of Staphylococcus aureus.	The glutamic acid residues of the peptidoglycan of Staphylococcus aureus and many other bacteria become amidated by an as yet unknown mechanism. In this communication we describe the identification, in the genome of S. aureus strain COL, of two co-transcribed genes, murT and gatD, which are responsible for peptidoglycan amidation. MurT and GatD have sequence similarity to substrate-binding domains in Mur ligases (MurT) and to the catalytic domain in CobB/CobQ-like glutamine amidotransferases (GatD). The amidation of glutamate residues in the stem peptide of S. aureus peptidoglycan takes place in a later step than the cytoplasmic phase--presumably the lipid phase--of the biosynthesis of the S. aureus cell wall precursor. Inhibition of amidation caused reduced growth rate, reduced resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and increased sensitivity to lysozyme which inhibited culture growth and caused degradation of the peptidoglycan.

22356131	20120224	The crystal structure of the FAD/NADPH-binding domain of flavocytochrome P450 BM3.	We report the crystal structure of the FAD/NADPH-binding domain (FAD domain) of the biotechnologically important Bacillus megaterium flavocytochrome P450 BM3, the last domain of the enzyme to be structurally resolved. The structure was solved in both the absence and presence of the ligand NADP(+), identifying important protein interactions with the NADPH 2'-phosphate that helps to dictate specificity for NADPH over NADH, and involving residues Tyr974, Arg966, Lys972 and Ser965. The Trp1046 side chain shields the FAD isoalloxazine ring from NADPH, and motion of this residue is required to enable NADPH-dependent FAD reduction. Multiple binding interactions stabilize the FAD cofactor, including aromatic stacking with the adenine group from the side chains of Tyr860 and Trp854, and several interactions with FAD pyrophosphate oxygens, including bonding to tyrosines 828, 829 and 860. Mutagenesis of C773 and C999 to alanine was required for successful crystallization, with C773A predicted to disfavour intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonding. Multiangle laser light scattering analysis showed wild-type FAD domain to be near-exclusively dimeric, with dimer disruption achieved on treatment with the reducing agent dithiothreitol. By contrast, light scattering showed that the C773A/C999A FAD domain was monomeric. The C773A/C999A FAD domain structure confirms that Ala773 is surface exposed and in close proximity to Cys810, with this region of the enzyme's connecting domain (that links the FAD domain to the FMN-binding domain in P450?BM3) located at a crystal contact interface between FAD domains. The FAD domain crystal structure enables molecular modelling of its interactions with its cognate FMN (flavodoxin-like) domain within the BM3 reductase module. 	FEBS_J.	D016428 D013485
22007150	20111019	Synthesis and physical properties of estolide ester using saturated Fatty Acid and ricinoleic Acid.	A study was conveyed to produce estolide ester using ricinoleic acid as the backbone. The ricinoleic acid reacted with saturated fatty acid from C8-C18. These reactions were conducted under vacuum at 60?C for 24?h without solvent. The reaction used acid catalyst, sulphuric acid. The new saturate ricinoleic estolide esters show superior low-temperature properties (-52 ? 0.08?C) and high flash point (&gt;300?C). The yield of the neat estolide esters ranged from 52% to 96%. The viscosity range was 51 ? 0.08 to 86 ? 0.01?cp. These new saturated estolide esters were also compared with saturated branched estolide esters. 	J_Autom_Methods_Manag_Chem	D016428
27000019	20160323	Osteocalcin gene polymorphism and bone density in Hungarian athletes.	Osteoporosis, a public health problem, is mainly determined on the basis of bone mineral density (BMD). The rs1800247 polymorphism of the osteocalcin gene is associated with BMD. The results of one recent Polish study led us to the examination of a possible connection between polymorphism and bone ultrasound parameters in the Hungarian population, including elite athletes. A total of 302 subjects participated in the study. Genotype analysis was carried out via a DNA chip, and anthropometric measurements were taken according to the International Biological Program. Sixty-three (63) of the participants were also measured by ultrasound bone densitometer. The genotype frequencies of osteocalcin polymorphism in the total sample were: 59.9% for hh; 36.1% for Hh; and 3.97% for HH. We separated the 63 subjects by the presence or absence of H allele, and there were no significant differences between the two groups, either in the anthropometric, or in the ultrasound parameters. In grouping the sample by genotypes, no differences were detectable in any of the bone characteristics. Compared to the controls, athletes had significantly higher results in all of the bone ultrasound values. The polymorphism of the osteocalcin gene showed no effect on bone quantity in the examined Hungarian population. 	Anthropol_Anz	D016428
11390493	20010608	Transgenic cystic fibrosis mice exhibit reduced early clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the respiratory tract.	The cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) has been proposed to be an epithelial cell receptor for Pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in bacterial internalization and clearance from the lung. We evaluated the role of CFTR in clearing P. aeruginosa from the respiratory tract using transgenic CF mice that carried either the DeltaF508 Cftr allele or an allele with a Cftr stop codon (S489X). Intranasal application achieved P. aeruginosa lung infection in inbred C57BL/6 DeltaF508 Cftr mice, whereas DeltaF508 Cftr and S489X Cftr outbred mice required tracheal application of the inoculum to establish lung infection. CF mice showed significantly less ingestion of LPS-smooth P. aeruginosa by lung cells and significantly greater bacterial lung burdens 4.5 h postinfection than C57BL/6 wild-type mice. Microscopy of infected mouse and rhesus monkey tracheas clearly demonstrated ingestion of P. aeruginosa by epithelial cells in wild-type animals, mostly around injured areas of the epithelium. Desquamating cells loaded with P. aeruginosa could also be seen in these tissues. No difference was found between CF and wild-type mice challenged with an LPS-rough mucoid isolate of P. aeruginosa lacking the CFTR ligand. Thus, transgenic CF mice exhibit decreased clearance of P. aeruginosa and increased bacterial burdens in the lung, substantiating a key role for CFTR-mediated bacterial ingestion in lung clearance of P. aeruginosa.

23497844	20130319	Association of complement factor H tyrosine 402 histidine genotype with posterior involvement in sarcoid-related uveitis.	To determine whether the complement factor H (CFH) tyrosine 402 histidine (Y402H) variant, recently shown to be associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and multifocal choroiditis, is associated with specific ocular sarcoidosis clinical phenotypes in black and white persons. Case-control study. The CFH Y402H polymorphism (rs1061170) was genotyped in 41 subjects with ocular sarcoidosis and 393 control subjects. Allele frequencies in the ocular sarcoidosis cases were compared with controls using chi-square score tests. Genotypic model-based (dominant, recessive, and additive) associations of the rs1061170 allele were tested using multivariate logistic regression. Bayesian information criteria were used to formalize model?selection. Genotypes were correlated with disease characteristics and severity of ocular inflammation. The C allele (rs1061170) was found in 35% of controls, but occurred with a significantly higher frequency (48.7%) in ocular sarcoidosis cases (odds ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 2.78; P?= .018). Logistic regression demonstrated an association between rs1061170 and ocular sarcoidosis in 2 of 3 genetic models (additive, P?= .0078; recessive, P?= .0018). Posterior uveitis and panuveitis were overrepresented significantly in cases with the homozygous variant genotype (CC, 91%; P?= .047). The population-attributable risk related to this CFH risk variant was 20%. The Y402H polymorphism of CFH seems to be associated with ocular sarcoidosis in black and white persons. Carriage of the CFH Y402H polymorphism in both alleles is associated with an increased risk for posterior uveitis and panuveitis presentation. The prognostic importance of this genotype will require prolonged follow-up studies. 	Am._J._Ophthalmol.	D016428 D052060
20805241	20100901	Modular pathways for editing non-cognate amino acids by human cytoplasmic leucyl-tRNA synthetase.	To prevent potential errors in protein synthesis, some aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases have evolved editing mechanisms to hydrolyze misactivated amino acids (pre-transfer editing) or misacylated tRNAs (post-transfer editing). Class Ia leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) may misactivate various natural and non-protein amino acids and then mischarge tRNA(Leu). It is known that the fidelity of prokaryotic LeuRS depends on multiple editing pathways to clear the incorrect intermediates and products in the every step of aminoacylation reaction. Here, we obtained human cytoplasmic LeuRS (hcLeuRS) and tRNA(Leu) (hctRNA(Leu)) with high activity from Escherichia coli overproducing strains to study the synthetic and editing properties of the enzyme. We revealed that hcLeuRS could adjust its editing strategy against different non-cognate amino acids. HcLeuRS edits norvaline predominantly by post-transfer editing; however, it uses mainly pre-transfer editing to edit ?-amino butyrate, although both amino acids can be charged to tRNA(Leu). Post-transfer editing as a final checkpoint of the reaction was very important to prevent mis-incorporation in vitro. These results provide insight into the modular editing pathways created to prevent genetic code ambiguity by evolution. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D013485
12683830	20030410	The involvement of metal-to-CO charge transfer and ligand-field excited states in the spectroscopy and photochemistry of mixed-ligand metal carbonyls. A theoretical and spectroscopic study of [W(CO)(4)(1,2-ethylenediamine)] and [W(CO)(4)(N,N'-bis-alkyl-1,4-diazabutadiene)].	A new interpretation of the electronic spectroscopy, photochemistry, and photophysics of group 6 metal cis-tetracarbonyls [M(CO)(4)L(2)] is proposed, that is based on an interplay between M --&gt; L and M --&gt; CO MLCT excited states. TD-DFT and resonance Raman spectroscopy show that the lowest allowed electronic transition of [W(CO)(4)(en)] (en = 1,2-ethylenediamine) has a W(CO(eq))(2) --&gt; CO(ax) charge-transfer character, whereby the electron density is transferred from the equatorial W(CO(eq))(2) moiety to pi orbitals of the axial CO ligands, with a net decrease of electron density on the W atom. The lowest, emissive excited state of [W(CO)(4)(en)] was identified as a spin-triplet W(CO(eq))(2) --&gt; CO(ax) CT excited state both computationally and by picosecond time-resolved IR spectroscopy. This state undergoes 1.5 ps vibrational relaxation/solvation and decays to the ground state with a approximately 160 ps lifetime. The nu(CO) wavenumbers and IR intensity pattern calculated by DFT for the triplet W(CO(eq))(2) --&gt; CO(ax) CT excited state match well the experimental time-resolved spectrum. For [W(CO)(4)(R-DAB)] (R-DAB = N,N'-bis-alkyl-1,4-diazabutadiene), the W(CO(eq))(2) --&gt; CO(ax) CT transition follows in energy the W --&gt; DAB MLCT transition, and the emissive W(CO(eq))(2) --&gt; CO(ax) CT triplet state occurs just above the manifold of triplet W --&gt; DAB MLCT states. No LF electronic transitions were calculated to occur in a relevant energetic range for either complex. Molecular orbitals of both complexes are highly delocalized. The 5d(W) character is distributed over many molecular orbitals, while neither of them contains a predominant metal-ligand sigma 5d(W) component, contrary to predictions of the traditional ligand-field approach. The important spectroscopic, photochemical, and photophysical roles of M(CO(eq))(2) --&gt; CO(ax) CT excited states and the limited validity of ligand field arguments can be generalized to other mixed-ligand carbonyl complexes.

10772652	20000420	Molecular dissection of cardiac repolarization by in vivo Kv4.3 gene transfer.	Heart failure leads to marked suppression of the Ca(2+)-independent transient outward current (I(to1)), but it is not clear whether I(to1) downregulation suffices to explain the concomitant action potential prolongation. To investigate the role of I(to1) in cardiac repolarization while circumventing culture-related action potential alterations, we injected adenovirus vectors in vivo to overexpress or to suppress I(to1) in guinea pigs and rats, respectively. Myocytes were isolated 72 hours after intramyocardial injection and stimulation of the ecdysone-inducible vectors with intraperitoneal injection of an ecdysone analog. Kv4.3-infected guinea pig myocytes exhibited robust transient outward currents. Increasing density of I(to1) progressively depressed the plateau potential in Kv4. 3-infected guinea pig myocytes and abbreviated action potential duration (APD). In vivo infection with a dominant-negative Kv4. 3-W362F construct suppressed peak I(to1) in rat ventriculocytes, elevated the plateau height, significantly prolonged the APD, and resulted in a prolongation by about 30% of the QT interval in surface electrocardiogram recordings. These results indicate that I(to1) plays a crucial role in setting the plateau potential and overall APD, supporting a causative role for suppression of this current in the electrophysiological alterations of heart failure. The electrocardiographic findings indicate that somatic gene transfer can be used to create gene-specific animal models of the long QT syndrome. 	J._Clin._Invest.	D016428 D013485 D013487
27070834	20160413	Made to measure - keeping Rho kinase at a distance.	The Rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinases (ROCK) were first identified as effectors of the small GTPase RhoA, hence their nomenclature. Since their discovery, two decades ago, scientists have sought to unravel the structure, regulation, and function of these essential kinases. During that time, a consensus model has formed, in which ROCK activity is regulated via both Rho-dependent and independent mechanisms. However, recent findings have raised significant questions regarding this model. In their recent publication in Nature Communications, Truebestein and colleagues present the structure of a full-length Rho kinase for the first time. In contrast to previous reports, the authors could find no evidence for autoinhibition, RhoA binding, or regulation of kinase activity by phosphorylation. Instead, they propose that ROCK functions as a molecular ruler, in which the central coiled-coil bridges the membrane-binding regulatory domains to the kinase domains at a fixed distance from the plasma membrane. Here, we explore the consequences of the new findings, re-examine old data in the context of this model, and emphasize outstanding questions in the field. 	Small_GTPases	D016428 D016454
25567748	20150109	Novel HSAN1 mutation in serine palmitoyltransferase resides at a putative phosphorylation site that is involved in regulating substrate specificity.	1-Deoxysphingolipids (1-deoxySL) are atypical sphingolipids that are formed by the enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) due to a promiscuous use of L-alanine over its canonical substrate L-serine. Several mutations in SPT are associated with the hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type I (HSAN1). The current hypothesis is that these mutations induce a permanent shift in the affinity from L-serine toward L-alanine which results in a pathologically increased 1-deoxySL formation in HSAN1 patients. Also, wild-type SPT forms 1-deoxySL under certain conditions, and elevated levels were found in individuals with the metabolic syndrome and diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms which control the substrate shift of the wild-type enzyme are not understood. Here, we report a novel SPTLC2-S384F variant in two unrelated HSAN1 families. Affected patients showed elevated plasma 1-deoxySL levels and expression of the S384F mutant in HEK293 cells increased 1-deoxySL formation. Previously, S384 has been reported as one of the two (S384 and Y387) putative phosphorylation sites in SPTLC2. The phosphorylation of wild-type SPTLC2 was confirmed by isoelectric focusing. The impact of an S384 phosphorylation on SPT activity was tested by creating mutants mimicking either a constitutively phosphorylated (S384D, S384E) or non-phosphorylated (S384A, Y387F, Y387F+S384A) protein. The S384D but not the S384E variant was associated with increased 1-deoxySL formation. The other mutations had no influence on activity and substrate affinity. In summary, our data show that S384F is a novel mutation in HSAN1 and that the substrate specificity of wild-type SPT might by dynamically regulated by a phosphorylation at this position.

23935534	20130813	Genome wide association identifies novel loci involved in fungal communication.	Understanding how genomes encode complex cellular and organismal behaviors has become the outstanding challenge of modern genetics. Unlike classical screening methods, analysis of genetic variation that occurs naturally in wild populations can enable rapid, genome-scale mapping of genotype to phenotype with a medium-throughput experimental design. Here we describe the results of the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) used to identify novel loci underlying trait variation in a microbial eukaryote, harnessing wild isolates of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. We genotyped each of a population of wild Louisiana strains at 1 million genetic loci genome-wide, and we used these genotypes to map genetic determinants of microbial communication. In N. crassa, germinated asexual spores (germlings) sense the presence of other germlings, grow toward them in a coordinated fashion, and fuse. We evaluated germlings of each strain for their ability to chemically sense, chemotropically seek, and undergo cell fusion, and we subjected these trait measurements to GWAS. This analysis identified one gene, NCU04379 (cse-1, encoding a homolog of a neuronal calcium sensor), at which inheritance was strongly associated with the efficiency of germling communication. Deletion of cse-1 significantly impaired germling communication and fusion, and two genes encoding predicted interaction partners of CSE1 were also required for the communication trait. Additionally, mining our association results for signaling and secretion genes with a potential role in germling communication, we validated six more previously unknown molecular players, including a secreted protease and two other genes whose deletion conferred a novel phenotype of increased communication and multi-germling fusion. Our results establish protein secretion as a linchpin of germling communication in N. crassa and shed light on the regulation of communication molecules in this fungus. Our study demonstrates the power of population-genetic analyses for the rapid identification of genes contributing to complex traits in microbial species. 	PLoS_Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013486
22083803	20111116	Catechol-O-methyltransferase Val158Met and the risk of dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease.	The A-allele of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism is associated with decreased enzymatic activity and higher dopamine availability. We studied 219 patients with PD who were free of dyskinesias at baseline and underwent thorough annual examinations. The A-allele of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism was related to an increased risk of developing dyskinesias during follow-up, in a dose-dependent manner (adjusted hazard ratios for the AG and AA genotypes [compared to GG]: 2.09 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-4.06] and 2.81 [CI, 1.43-5.54], respectively). This finding suggests that genetic factors may affect susceptibility to dyskinesias in PD. 	Mov._Disord.	D016428 D013485
169239	19750825	Studies of individual carbon sites of proteins in solution by natural abundance carbon 13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Relaxation behavior.	The aromatic regions in proton-decoupled natural abundance 13C Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (at 14.2 kG) of small native proteins contain broad methine carbon bands and narrow nonprotonated carbon resonances. Some factors that affect the use of natural abundance 13C Fourier transform NMR spectroscopy for monitoring individual nonprotonated aromatic carbon sites of native proteins in solution are discussed. The effect of protein size is evaluated by comparing the 13C NMR spectra of horse heart ferrocytochrome c, hen egg white lysozyme, horse carbon monoxide myoglobin, and human adult carbon monoxide hemoglobin. Numerous single carbon resonances are observed in the aromatic regions of 13C NMR spectra of cytochrome c, lysozyme, and myoglobin. The much larger hemoglobin yields few resolved individual carbon resonances. Theoretical and some experimental values are presented for the natural linewidths (W), spin-lattice relaxation times (T1), and nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOE) of nonprotonated aromatic carbons and Czeta of arginine residues. In general, the 13C-1H dipolar mechanism dominates the relaxation of these carbons. 13C-14N dipolar relaxation contributes significantly to 1/T1 of C epsilon2 of tryptophan residues and Czeta of arginine residues of proteins in D2O. The NOE of each nonprotonated aromatic carbon is within experimental error of the calculated value of about 1.2. As a result, integrated intensities can be used for making a carbon count. Theoretical results are presented for the effect of internal rotation on W, T1, and the NOE. A comparison with the experimental T1 and NOE values indicates that if there is internal rotation of aromatic amino acid side chains, it is not fast relative to the over-all rotational motion of the protein.

4056364	19850901	Meiotic nondisjunction and translocation segregation in dwarf (dw/dw) and control T(1;13)70H heterozygous mice.	The meiotic behavior of translocation heterozygous T70 (1;13)H/+ male mice with a Snell dwarf (dw/dw) genotype was compared with that of nondwarf T70H/+ controls. A four-fold increase in the nondisjunction frequency of the normal bivalents occurred as a consequence of the dwarf genotype. This increase is identical to that seen in karyologically normal dwarf males. No effect of the dwarf condition on the segregation of the translocation multivalent could be noted. Thus, translocation heterozygosity does not enhance the meiotic instability caused by the hypopituitary dwarf condition. From a small sample of oocytes from T70H/+ and chromosomally normal dwarf females it is concluded that nondisjunction in females is not increased by the dwarf condition. In general we conclude that animals with higher spontaneous nondisjunction levels are not necessarily more sensitive to factors increasing nondisjunction. 	J._Hered.	D003160 D016428
19027924	20081126	Generalized muscle pseudo-hypertrophy and stiffness associated with the myotilin Ser55Phe mutation: a novel myotilinopathy phenotype?	Myotilinopathies are a group of muscle disorders caused by mutations in the MYOT gene. It was first described in two families suffering from limb girdle muscle dystrophy type 1 (LGMD 1A), and later identified in a subset of dominant or sporadic patients suffering from myofibrillar myopathy, as well as in a family with spheroid body myopathy. Disease phenotypes associated with MYOT mutations are clinically heterogeneous and include pure LGMD forms as well as late-onset distal myopathies. We report here on a 53-year-old male suffering from a unique clinical profile characterized by generalized symmetrical increase in muscle bulk leading to a Herculean appearance. Muscle weakness and stiffness in the lower extremities were the patient's main complaints. Muscle MRI showed extensive fatty infiltration in the thigh and leg muscles and a muscle biopsy showed a myofibrillar myopathy with prominent protein aggregates. Gene sequencing revealed a Ser55Phe missense mutation in the myotilin gene. The mutation was identified in his older brother, who presented a mild hypertrophic appearance and had a myopathic pattern in EMG, despite not presenting any of the complaints of the proband and having normal muscle strength. This finding, and his deceased father and paternal aunt's similar gait disorders, suggest that this is in fact a new autosomal dominant kindred. The present observations further expand the spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with mutations in the myotilin gene. 	J._Neurol._Sci.	D002363 D016428 D013485
19220734	20090218	Malignant hyperthermia associated with ryanodine receptor 1 (C7360G) mutation in Quarter Horses.	Anesthetic-induced malignant hyperthermia (MH) has been documented in Quarter Horses with a single point mutation in the ryanodine receptor 1 gene (RyR1) at nucleotide C7360G, generating a R2454G amino acid substitution. However, there have been no reports of nonanesthetic manifestations of MH in horses with the C7360G mutation. To describe clinical manifestations of Quarter Horses with the C7360G mutation. Eleven Quarter Horses with the RyR1 C7360G mutation. This prospective study included horses with suspected MH, undetermined etiology of sudden death, death within hours of onset of rhabdomyolysis, muscle rigidity, stiffness, intermittent sweating, and persistent increases in serum muscle enzyme activities. Whole blood in EDTA and skeletal muscle were processed for genetic and histochemical analysis. Medical records and pedigrees were collected when available. Both anesthetic- and non-anesthetic-associated myopathic manifestations of MH occurred in halter Quarter Horses with mutation of RyR1. The disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Clinical and laboratory abnormalities were similar in both forms. Rhabdomyolysis was a common finding in both groups of horses. Skeletal muscle histochemical findings were nonspecific and compatible with a noninflammatory myopathic process. MH is a potentially fatal disease of Quarter Horses that could be triggered by halogenated anesthetics and other nonanesthetic factors that may include exercise, stress, breeding, illnesses, and concurrent myopathies.

27641744	20160920	Circulating tumor DNA detection in lung cancer patients before and after surgery.	Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in peripheral blood is a &quot;liquid biopsy&quot; that contains representative tumor information including gene mutations. Additionally, repeated ctDNA samples can be easily obtained to monitor response to treatment and disease progression, which may be especially valuable to lung cancer patients with tumors that cannot be easily biopsied or removed. To investigate the changes in ctDNA after surgical tumor resection, tumor and blood samples obtained before and after surgery were collected prospectively from 41 non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Somatic driver mutations in tumor DNA (tDNA) and pre- and post-op plasma ctDNA sample pairs were identified by targeted sequencing in several genes including EGFR, KRAS, and TP53 with an overall study concordance of 78.1% and sensitivity and specificity of 69.2% and 93.3%, respectively. Importantly, the frequency of 91.7% of ctDNA mutations decreased after surgery and these changes were observed as little as 2 days post-op. Moreover, the presence of ctDNA had a higher positive predictive value than that of six tumor biomarkers in current clinical use. This study demonstrates the use of targeted sequencing to reliably identify ctDNA changes in response to treatment, indicating a potential utility of this approach in the clinical management of NSCLC.

26367176	20150915	Synthesis and characterization of the amyloid ?40 dimer model with a linker at position 30 adjacent to the intermolecular ?-sheet region.	Amyloid fibrils in senile plaque mainly consist of the 40-mer and 42-mer amyloid ?-proteins (A?40 and A?42). Although A?42 plays more important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), A?40 could be involved in the progression of AD pathology because of its large amount. Recent studies revealed that variable sizes of A? oligomers contributed to the neuronal death and cognitive dysfunction. However, how large oligomeric species are responsible for AD pathogenesis remains unclear. We previously proposed a toxic dimer model of A? with turn structure at positions 22 and 23 using solid-state NMR and systematic proline replacement. Based on this model, we herein show the synthesis and biological activities of an E22P-A?40 dimer at position 30, which was connected to l,l-2,6-diaminopimeric acid. The E22P-A?40 dimer formed stable 6?8-mer oligomers without amyloid fibrils, but was not neurotoxic on human neuroblastoma cells. On the other hand, E22P-A?40 generated high molecular-weight oligomers into fibrils, and showed the neurotoxicity. These results suggest that such kind of A?40 dimer with a parallel ?-sheet might not be pathological. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.	D016428 D013485
19673052	20090813	Genetic and environmental influence on attachment disorganization.	Empirical studies demonstrate that maternal sensitivity is associated with attachment security in infancy, while maternal frightening/frightened behavior is related to attachment disorganization. However, attachment disorganization is also predicted by individual dispositions in infancy. Indeed, recent studies indicate a link between attachment disorganization and DRD4 gene polymorphisms, thus suggesting a genetic vulnerability for attachment disorganization. The aims of our study were twofold, to test a) a possible direct link between molecular genetic variations and attachment disorganization, and b) a possible gene-environment interaction with a moderating effect of early maternal caregiving. Attachment security and disorganization, as well as quality of maternal behavior were assessed in the infants of the Regensburg Longitudinal Study IV (N = 106) at the age of 12 months. DNA samples were collected in order to assess the exon III repeat polymorphism in the coding region and the -521 C/T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the regulatory region of the DRD4 gene and a repeat polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene. Significant associations were found between attachment disorganization and the short polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene. Also, a gene-environment interaction indicated that this genetic association was only valid for infants of mothers exhibiting low responsiveness. No other significant genetic associations with attachment disorganization were apparent. The study suggests a gene-environment interaction whereby biological determinants of attachment disorganization are moderated by social experiences. Different pathways of the development of attachment disorganization are discussed based on a bio-behavioral model of development. 	J_Child_Psychol_Psychiatry	D016428 D013485
22260053	20120121	[Phylogenetic and degrading genes analysis of a PAH-degrading bacterium TVG9-VII from deep-sea hydrythermal environment].	The aim of this study is to identify a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)-degrading bacterium isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal environment, including its taxonomy, characteristics and mechanism involved in PAH degradation. The phylogeny was studied by 16S rRNA gene clone, and the degradation rates against different PAHs were determined by GC-MS. Meanwhile, PAH-degrading gene cluster was cloned by the genomic Fosmid library construction; the function of the key degrading-gene expression was examined by RT-PCR and qPCR to observe gene expression in the response to different PAHs. A PAH-degrading strain TVG9-VII was isolated from the hydrothermal chimney sample of the Lau basin in Southwest Pacific Ocean. It showed 99.7% similarities with 16S rRNA gene of Novosphingobium indicum strain H25(T). The degradation rates of this strain against phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene were 95.2%, 57.3% and 69.6% in 21 days, respectively. A gene cluster, containing PAHs initial dioxygenase genes pheA1a and pheA1b, was obtained from genomic fosmid library, with the insertion size of 12.522 kb. The gene pheA1a was enhanced by 4.2 folds in mRNA expression in presence of phenanthrene, but expression enhancement was not observed in other tested PAHs including naphthalene, pyrene and fluoranthene. Strain TVG9-VII is isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal environment in genus Novosphingobium. It can degrade many kinds of PAHs, especially the high-weight-molecular PAHs.

23145031	20121113	The hepatitis B virus x protein inhibits thymine DNA glycosylase initiated base excision repair.	The hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome encodes the X protein (HBx), a ubiquitous transactivator that is required for HBV replication. Expression of the HBx protein has been associated with the development of HBV infection-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previously, we generated a 3D structure of HBx by combined homology and ab initio in silico modelling. This structure showed a striking similarity to the human thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), a key enzyme in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. To further explore this finding, we investigated whether both proteins interfere with or complement each other's functions. Here we show that TDG does not affect HBV replication, but that HBx strongly inhibits TDG-initiated base excision repair (BER), a major DNA repair pathway. Inhibition of the BER pathway may contribute substantially to the oncogenic effect of HBV infection. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
15262940	20040721	A type II protein secretory pathway required for levansucrase secretion by Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus.	The endophytic diazotroph Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus secretes a constitutively expressed levansucrase (LsdA, EC 2.4.1.10) to utilize plant sucrose. LsdA, unlike other extracellular levansucrases from gram-negative bacteria, is transported to the periplasm by a signal-peptide-dependent pathway. We identified an unusually organized gene cluster encoding at least the components LsdG, -O, -E, -F, -H, -I, -J, -L, -M, -N, and -D of a type II secretory system required for LsdA translocation across the outer membrane. Another open reading frame, designated lsdX, is located between the operon promoter and lsdG, but it was not identified in BLASTX searches of the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases. The lsdX, -G, and -O genes were isolated from a cosmid library of strain SRT4 by complementation of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutant unable to transport LsdA across the outer membrane. The downstream genes lsdE, -F, -H, -I, -J, -L, -M, -N, and -D were isolated through chromosomal walking. The high G+C content (64 to 74%) and the codon usage of the genes identified are consistent with the G+C content and codon usage of the standard G. diazotrophicus structural gene. Sequence analysis of the gene cluster indicated that a polycistronic transcript is synthesized. Targeted disruption of lsdG, lsdO, or lsdF blocked LsdA secretion, and the bacterium failed to grow on sucrose. Replacement of Cys(162) by Gly at the C terminus of the pseudopilin LsdG abolished the protein functionality, suggesting that there is a relationship with type IV pilins. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed conservation of the type II secretion operon downstream of the levansucrase-levanase (lsdA-lsdB) locus in 14 G. diazotrophicus strains representing 11 genotypes recovered from four different host plants in diverse geographical regions. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a type II pathway for protein secretion in the Acetobacteraceae. 	J._Bacteriol.	D016428

17520051	20070524	The OECD program to validate the rat Hershberger bioassay to screen compounds for in vivo androgen and antiandrogen responses: phase 2 dose-response studies.	The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has completed phase 2 of an international program to validate the rodent Hershberger bioassay. The Hershberger bioassay is designed to identify suspected androgens and antiandrogens based on changes in the weights of five androgen-responsive tissues (ventral prostate, paired seminal vesicles and coagulating glands, the levator ani and bulbocavernosus muscles, the glans penis, and paired Cowper's or bulbourethral glands). Protocol sensitivity and reproducibility were tested using two androgen agonists (17alpha-methyl testosterone and 17beta-trenbolone), four antagonists [procymi-done, vinclozolin, linuron, and 1,1-dichoro-2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE)], and a 5alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride). Sixteen laboratories from seven countries participated in phase 2. In 40 of 41 studies, the laboratories successfully detected substance-related weight changes in one or more tissues. The one exception was with the weakest antiandrogen, linuron, in a laboratory with reduced sensitivity because of high coefficients of variation in all tissue weights. The protocols performed well under different experimental conditions (e.g., strain, diet, housing protocol, bedding, vehicle). There was good agreement and reproducibility among laboratories with regard to the lowest dose inducing significant effects on tissue weights. The results show that the OECD Hershberger bioassay protocol is reproducible and transferable across laboratories with androgen agonists, weak androgen antagonists, and a 5alpha-reductase inhibitor. The next validation phase will employ coded test substances, including positive substances and negative substances having no androgenic or antiandrogenic activity. 	Environ._Health_Perspect.	D016428
18776889	20080909	Quantitative exploration of the catalytic landscape separating divergent plant sesquiterpene synthases.	Throughout molecular evolution, organisms create assorted chemicals in response to varying ecological niches. Catalytic landscapes underlie metabolic evolution, wherein mutational steps alter the biosynthetic properties of enzymes. Here we report the first systematic quantitative characterization of the catalytic landscape underlying the evolution of sesquiterpene chemical diversity. On the basis of our previous discovery of a set of nine naturally occurring amino acid substitutions that functionally interconverted orthologous sesquiterpene synthases from Nicotiana tabacum and Hyoscyamus muticus, we created a library of all possible residue combinations (2(9) = 512) in the N. tabacum enzyme. The product spectra of 418 active enzymes revealed a rugged landscape where several minimal combinations of the nine mutations encode convergent solutions to the interconversions of parental activities. Quantitative comparisons indicated context dependence for mutational effects--epistasis--in product specificity and promiscuity. These results provide a measure of the mutational accessibility of phenotypic variability in a diverging lineage of terpene synthases. 	Nat._Chem._Biol.	D016428 D052061 D013485
24574395	20140228	An unbiased genetic screen reveals the polygenic nature of the influenza virus anti-interferon response.	Influenza A viruses counteract the cellular innate immune response at several steps, including blocking RIG I-dependent activation of interferon (IFN) transcription, interferon (IFN)-dependent upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and the activity of various ISG products; the multifunctional NS1 protein is responsible for most of these activities. To determine the importance of other viral genes in the interplay between the virus and the host IFN response, we characterized populations and selected mutants of wild-type viruses selected by passage through non-IFN-responsive cells. We reasoned that, by allowing replication to occur in the absence of the selection pressure exerted by IFN, the virus could mutate at positions that would normally be restricted and could thus find new optimal sequence solutions. Deep sequencing of selected virus populations and individual virus mutants indicated that nonsynonymous mutations occurred at many phylogenetically conserved positions in nearly all virus genes. Most individual mutants selected for further characterization induced IFN and ISGs and were unable to counteract the effects of exogenous IFN, yet only one contained a mutation in NS1. The relevance of these mutations for the virus phenotype was verified by reverse genetics. Of note, several virus mutants expressing intact NS1 proteins exhibited alterations in the M1/M2 proteins and accumulated large amounts of deleted genomic RNAs but nonetheless replicated to high titers. This suggests that the overproduction of IFN inducers by these viruses can override NS1-mediated IFN modulation. Altogether, the results suggest that influenza viruses replicating in IFN-competent cells have tuned their complete genomes to evade the cellular innate immune system and that serial replication in non-IFN-responsive cells allows the virus to relax from these constraints and find a new genome consensus within its sequence space. In natural virus infections, the production of interferons leads to an antiviral state in cells that effectively limits virus replication. The interferon response places considerable selection pressure on viruses, and they have evolved a variety of ways to evade it. Although the influenza virus NS1 protein is a powerful interferon antagonist, the contributions of other viral genes to interferon evasion have not been well characterized. Here, we examined the effects of alleviating the selection pressure exerted by interferon by serially passaging influenza viruses in cells unable to respond to interferon. Viruses that grew to high titers had mutations at many normally conserved positions in nearly all genes and were not restricted to the NS1 gene. Our results demonstrate that influenza viruses have fine-tuned their entire genomes to evade the interferon response, and by removing interferon-mediated constraints, viruses can mutate at genome positions normally restricted by the interferon response.

23516366	20130322	Novel positive regulatory role for the SPL6 transcription factor in the N TIR-NB-LRR receptor-mediated plant innate immunity.	Following the recognition of pathogen-encoded effectors, plant TIR-NB-LRR immune receptors induce defense signaling by a largely unknown mechanism. We identify a novel and conserved role for the SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN (SBP)-domain transcription factor SPL6 in enabling the activation of the defense transcriptome following its association with a nuclear-localized immune receptor. During an active immune response, the Nicotiana TIR-NB-LRR N immune receptor associates with NbSPL6 within distinct nuclear compartments. NbSPL6 is essential for the N-mediated resistance to Tobacco mosaic virus. Similarly, the presumed Arabidopsis ortholog AtSPL6 is required for the resistance mediated by the TIR-NB-LRR RPS4 against Pseudomonas syringae carrying the avrRps4 effector. Transcriptome analysis indicates that AtSPL6 positively regulates a subset of defense genes. A pathogen-activated nuclear-localized TIR-NB-LRR like N can therefore regulate defense genes through SPL6 in a mechanism analogous to the induction of MHC genes by mammalian immune receptors like CIITA and NLRC5.

20478923	20100519	Associations between NBS1 polymorphisms, haplotypes and smoking-related cancers.	Constituents of tobacco smoke can cause DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), leading to tumorigenesis. The NBS1 gene product is a vital component in DSB detection and repair, thus genetic variations may influence cancer development. We examined the associations between NBS1 polymorphisms and haplotypes and newly incident smoking-related cancers in three case-control studies (Los Angeles: 611 lung and 601 upper aero-digestive tract (UADT) cancer cases and 1040 controls; Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center: 227 bladder cancer cases and 211 controls and Taixing, China: 218 esophagus, 206 stomach, 204 liver cancer cases and 415 controls). rs1061302 was associated with cancers of the lung [adjusted odds ratio (OR(adj)) = 1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2, 2.4], larynx (OR(adj) = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.97) and liver (OR(adj) = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0, 2.9). Additionally, positive associations were found for rs709816 with bladder cancer (OR(adj) = 4.2, 95% CI: 1.4, 12) and rs1063054 with lung cancer (OR(adj) = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0, 2.3). Some associations in lung and stomach cancers varied with smoking status. CAC haplotype was positively associated with smoking-related cancers: lung (OR(adj) = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.9) and UADT (OR(adj) = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.1, 3.7), specifically, oropharynx (OR(adj) = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.0, 4.2) and larynx (OR(adj) = 4.8, 95% CI: 1.7, 14). Bayesian false-discovery probabilities were calculated to assess Type I error. It appears that NBS1 polymorphisms and haplotypes may be associated with smoking-related cancers and that these associations may differ by smoking status. Our findings also suggest that single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the binding region of the MRE-RAD50-NBS1 complex or microRNA targeted pathways may influence tumor development. These hypotheses should be further examined in functional studies. 	Carcinogenesis	D016428 D052061 D013485
15603709	20041218	Inhibition of tumor growth in xenografted nude mice with adenovirus-mediated endostatin gene comparison with recombinant endostatin protein.	Inhibition of tumor growth by endostatin has been shown to be an effective strategy in cancer therapy in mice. However, its widespread application has been hampered by difficulties in a large-scale production of the recombinant endostatin protein, rapid loss bioactivity of the protein, and the cumbersome daily administration. These limitations could be resolved by in vivo delivery and expression of the endostatin gene. In this study, we observed the effect and advantage of endostatin gene therapy mediated by a recombinant adenoviral vector (Ad/hEndo) on the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma BEL-7402 xenografted tumors, comparison with recombinant endostatin protein. Hepatocellular carcinoma BEL-7402 cells were inoculated subcutaneously in the flank of Balb/c nude mice. Nine days after tumor cell inoculation, animals were given a cycle of four courses of intra-tumoral injections of Ad/hEndo of 5 x 10(8) pfu (low-dose group) and 1 x 10(9) pfu (high-dose group) at intervals of six days, respectively. Recombinant human endostatin protein (rhEndo) was administrated daily subcutaneously at a dose of 10 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) at a site nearby the tumor for ten days. The expression of endostatin mRNA in tumor tissue was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) after Ad/hEndo injection. Dynamic changes of concentration of endostatin protein in tumor tissue were quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After 4 courses of treatment, the tumor growth rates of high-dose treated group with 1 x 10(9) pfu of Ad/hEndo were inhibited by 42.26% compared with the Ad/LacZ control group (P = 0.001) and by 46.26% compared with the NIH buffer control group (P = 0.003), respectively. However, in this study, Ad/hEndo at low dose of 5 x 10(8) pfu failed to demonstrate significant inhibition of tumor growth, compared with control groups. After daily administration of recombinant human endostatin protein (rhEndo) for 9 days, the ratio of T/C (rhEndo group versus PBS group) was less than 47%. However, two days after rhEndo treatment ceased, the ratio of T/C was more than 50%. The peak of expression of endostatin mRNA in tumor tissue was at 2 or 3 days after administration intratumorally with Ad/hEndo of 1 x 10(9) pfu and gradually dropped undetectable by day 7. Dynamic analysis of endostatin concentration in tumor tissue showed that the highest level of mRNA is up at the third day after injection, and dropped to basal level three weeks later. Endostatin gene therapy mediated by a recombinant adenoviral vector had significantly inhibited the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma BEL-7402 xenografted tumors at a high dose of 1 x 10(9) pfu compared with other groups. The analysis of dynamic expression of endostatin in vivo indicated that Ad/hEndo had acquired a high-level, relatively long-term expression in vivo and bioactivity capability. 	Chin._Med._J.

8254659	19931205	Operator sequence context influences amino acid-base-pair interactions in 434 repressor-operator complexes.	The 434 repressor binds more tightly to OR1 than it does to OR3. The repressor makes several specific contacts with the symmetrically arrayed outer four base-pairs of the 14 base-pair site, and no specific contacts to the central six base-pairs. The sequence of the outer base-pairs of OR1 and OR3 differs only by an A--&gt;G substitution at position 4 in one half-site of OR3, while that of central bases is very different. As expected from sequence analysis of wild-type operators, the data show repressor prefers an A.T base-pair at position 4. The magnitude of this preference depends on operator sequence context and solution conditions. Position 4 changes in the context of OR1 have a greater effect on operator affinity for 434 repressor than do similar changes in OR3. Although OR1 and OR3 display different affinities for 434 repressor, their repressor-operator complexes are similarly insensitive to changes in salt concentration and temperature. By contrast, complexes formed between repressor and position 4 mutant OR1, bearing an A.T--&gt;G.C change, and OR3, which bears a G.C--&gt;A.T change, are affected greatly, and to similar extents, by changes in ionic strength and temperature. Nuclease protection experiments show that 434 repressor protects the DNA phosphate backbone of wild-type operators from cleavage more efficiently than those of mutant operators. These data show that the biochemical and structural properties of a repressor-operator complex, while affected by position 4 base sequence, are independent of the identity of this base. The ability of repressor to recognize the base at position 4 depends on the sequence context at operator positions 5 to 7. Apparently there is an interplay between the bases at operator positions 4 to 7 which has a global effect on the structure of the repressor-operator complex. 	J._Mol._Biol.	D003160 D016428 D013487
25297602	20141010	[Lack of association of COMT Val158Met polymorphism with attention and executive function in patients with schizophrenia].	To explore the association of a functional polymorphism Val158Met of COMT gene and attention and executive function in first-episode treatment-naive patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Trail making test (TMT) and clinical performances were evaluated in 103 first-episode treatment-naive patients with schizophrenia and 99 healthy controls. Polymorphism of COMT Val158Met was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. A general linear model was used to investigate the effect of genotype subgroups on the attention and executive function. There was a significant difference between control subjects and patients with schizophrenia on the TMT-A and B. However, no significant difference among Val/Val, Val/Met and Met/Met on the TMT-A and B in control subjects and patients with schizophrenia was detected. The association among COMT Met variant and trail making testing (attention and executive function) has been replicated. However, no association of COMT Met variant with disruption of dopaminergic influence on neurocognitive function was detected. This may be due to the heterogeneity of population.

21698130	20110624	Multiple regulatory mechanisms to inhibit untimely initiation of DNA replication are important for stable genome maintenance.	Genomic instability is a hallmark of human cancer cells. To prevent genomic instability, chromosomal DNA is faithfully duplicated in every cell division cycle, and eukaryotic cells have complex regulatory mechanisms to achieve this goal. Here, we show that untimely activation of replication origins during the G1 phase is genotoxic and induces genomic instability in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our data indicate that cells preserve a low level of the initiation factor Sld2 to prevent untimely initiation during the normal cell cycle in addition to controlling the phosphorylation of Sld2 and Sld3 by cyclin-dependent kinase. Although untimely activation of origin is inhibited on multiple levels, we show that deregulation of a single pathway can cause genomic instability, such as gross chromosome rearrangements (GCRs). Furthermore, simultaneous deregulation of multiple pathways causes an even more severe phenotype. These findings highlight the importance of having multiple inhibitory mechanisms to prevent the untimely initiation of chromosome replication to preserve stable genome maintenance over generations in eukaryotes.

3131144	19880516	Potentiation and suppression of mouse liver cytochrome P-450 isozymes during the acute-phase response induced by bacterial endotoxin.	Infection and inflammation are known to affect the metabolism and disposition of drugs and carcinogens. We report a detailed study of the effects of bacterial endotoxin on the constitutive and inducible expression and activities of cytochrome P-450 isozymes from families P-450I, P-450IIB, P-450IIC and P-450III. In general high doses of high endotoxin caused very marked suppression of P-450 isozymes and associated activities. However, this effect was differential, the expression of certain isozymes being only slightly reduced whereas others were suppressed to almost undetectable levels. Low doses of endotoxin also gave differential effects on cytochrome P-450 expression. Of particular interest was the very marked potentiation of the inductive effect of both 3-methylcholanthrene and phenobarbital. In the case of 3-methylcholanthrene the 10-fold induction of activity was increased to 24-fold by concomitant endotoxin administration. In this regard it was interesting that 3-methylcholanthrene was an effective inducer of a wide variety of acute-phase proteins including metallothionein, serum amyloid A, fibrinogen and hemopexin. These data show that endotoxin, and therefore bacterial infection and inflammation, can have profound and differential effects on components of the cytochrome-P-450 monooxygenase system which could result in significant changes in susceptibility to the effects of drugs, chemical toxins and carcinogens.

21234696	20110115	Low levels of the omega-3 index are associated with sudden cardiac arrest and remain stable in survivors in the subacute phase.	In previous studies, low blood levels of n-3 fatty acids (FA) have been associated with increased risk of cardiac death, and the omega-3 index (red blood cell (RBC) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) expressed as weight percentage of total FA) has recently been proposed as a new risk factor for death from coronary artery disease, especially following sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). As blood samples often haven been harvested after the event, the aim of our study was to evaluate the stability of RBC fatty acids following SCA. The total FA profile, including the omega-3 index, was measured three times during the first 48 h in 25 survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), in 15 patients with a myocardial infarction (MI) without SCA and in 5 healthy subjects. We could not demonstrate significant changes in the FA measurements in any of the groups, this also applied to the omega-6/omega-3 ratio and the arachidonic acid (AA)/EPA ratio. Furthermore, we compared the omega-3 index in 14 OHCA-patients suffering their first MI with that of 185 first-time MI-patients without SCA; mean values being 4.59% and 6.48%, respectively (p = 0.002). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, a 1% increase of the omega-3 index was associated with a 58% (95% CI: 0.25-0.76%) reduction in risk of ventricular fibrillation (VF). In conclusion, the omega-3 index remained stable after an event of SCA and predicted the risk of VF. 	Lipids	D016428 D013485
16938571	20060830	hCDC4 variation in osteosarcoma.	The hCDC4 gene (also known as Fbw7 or Archipelago) encodes an F-box protein that is responsible for targeting cyclin E for Skp1-cullin-F box protein (SCF) ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. Disruption of this pathway has been associated with chromosomal instability and aneuploidy in several cancer cell lines and primary tumors. This study aimed to examine whether hCDC4 mutations contribute to aneuploidy in osteosarcoma. We analyzed 147 primary high-grade osteosarcoma specimens and 6 osteosarcoma cell lines. The protein truncation test (PTT) and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis with subsequent sequencing were performed to detect alterations of the hCDC4 gene. All specimens exhibited the same PTT pattern of normal bands with less intense common bands. Two shifts were detected by SSCP, and subsequent DNA analysis identified one in-frame three-base GAG (424-426) deletion and one silent nucleotide substitution (C1261T). We conclude that somatic hCDC4 mutations are infrequent in osteosarcoma, and are unlikely to play an important role in aneuploidy of this tumor. 	Cancer_Genet._Cytogenet.	D016428 D013485
21619609	20110531	Predictors of low cervical cancer screening among immigrant women in Ontario, Canada.	Disparities in cervical cancer screening are known to exist in Ontario, Canada for foreign-born women. The relative importance of various barriers to screening may vary across ethnic groups. This study aimed to determine how predictors of low cervical cancer screening, reflective of sociodemographics, the health care system, and migration, varied by region of origin for Ontario's immigrant women. Using a validated billing code algorithm, we determined the proportion of women who were not screened during the three-year period of 2006-2008 among 455,864 identified immigrant women living in Ontario's urban centres. We created eight identical multivariate Poisson models, stratified by eight regions of origin for immigrant women. In these models, we adjusted for various sociodemographic, health care-related and migration-related variables. We then used the resulting adjusted relative risks to calculate population-attributable fractions for each variable by region of origin. Region of origin was not a significant source of effect modification for lack of recent cervical cancer screening. Certain variables were significantly associated with lack of screening across all or nearly all world regions. These consisted of not being in the 35-49 year age group, residence in the lowest-income neighbourhoods, not being in a primary care patient enrolment model, a provider from the same region, and not having a female provider. For all women, the highest population-attributable risk was seen for not having a female provider, with values ranging from 16.8% [95% CI 14.6-19.1%] among women from the Middle East and North Africa to 27.4% [95% CI 26.2-28.6%] for women from East Asia and the Pacific. To increase screening rates across immigrant groups, efforts should be made to ensure that women have access to a regular source of primary care, and ideally access to a female health professional. Efforts should also be made to increase the enrolment of immigrant women in new primary care patient enrolment models. 	BMC_Womens_Health	D016428 D013485
25343477	20141025	Characterization of the binding interaction between the oncoprotein gankyrin and a grafted S6 ATPase.	A complex with the C-terminal portion of the proteosomal subunit S6 ATPase is the only available structure of a protein-protein interaction involving the oncoprotein gankyrin. However, difficulties associated with recombinant expression of S6 ATPase alone, or truncations thereof, have limited our understanding of this assembly. We replaced the C-terminal portion of FtsH from Escherichia coli with the structurally homologous C-terminal portion of S6 ATPase and used this grafted protein to characterize the gankyrin-S6 ATPase binding interaction by isothermal titration calorimetry.

26866891	20160212	Longitudinal analytical approaches to genetic data.	Longitudinal phenotypic data provides a rich potential resource for genetic studies which may allow for greater understanding of variants and their covariates over time. Herein, we review 3 longitudinal analytical approaches from the Genetic Analysis Workshop 19 (GAW19). These contributions investigated both genome-wide association (GWA) and whole genome sequence (WGS) data from odd numbered chromosomes on up to 4 time points for blood pressure-related phenotypes. The statistical models used included generalized estimating equations (GEEs), latent class growth modeling (LCGM), linear mixed-effect (LME), and variance components (VC). The goal of these analyses was to test statistical approaches that use repeat measurements to increase genetic signal for variant identification. Two analytical methods were applied to the GAW19: GWA using real phenotypic data, and one approach to WGS using 200 simulated replicates. The first GWA approach applied a GEE-based model to identify gene-based associations with 4 derived hypertension phenotypes. This GEE model identified 1 significant locus, GRM7, which passed multiple test corrections for 2 hypertension-derived traits. The second GWA approach employed the LME to estimate genetic associations with systolic blood pressure (SBP) change trajectories identified using LCGM. This LCGM method identified 5 SBP trajectories and association analyses identified a genome-wide significant locus, near ATOX1 (p = 1.0E(-8)). Finally, a third VC-based model using WGS and simulated SBP phenotypes that constrained the ? coefficient for a genetic variant across each time point was calculated and compared to an unconstrained approach. This constrained VC approach demonstrated increased power for WGS variants of moderate effect, but when larger genetic effects were present, averaging across time points was as effective. In this paper, we summarize 3 GAW19 contributions applying novel statistical methods and testing previously proposed techniques under alternative conditions for longitudinal genetic association. We conclude that these approaches when appropriately applied have the potential to: (a) increase statistical power; (b) decrease trait heterogeneity and standard error; 	BMC_Genet.	D016428 D052061
25674047	20150213	Bone morphogenetic protein signaling in vertebrate motor neurons and neuromuscular communication.	An accurate communication between motor neurons and skeletal muscle fibers is required for the proper assembly, growth and maintenance of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Several signaling and extracellular matrix molecules play stimulatory and inhibitory roles on the assembly of functional synapses. Studies in Drosophila have revealed crucial functions for early morphogens, such as members of the Wnt and Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMP) signaling pathways, during the assembly and maturation of the NMJ. Here, we bring together recent findings that led us to propose that BMPs also work in vertebrate organisms as diffusible cues to communicate motor neurons and skeletal muscles.

26736037	20160107	Single nucleotide polymorphism near CREB1, rs7591784, is associated with pretreatment methamphetamine use frequency and outcome of outpatient treatment for methamphetamine use disorder.	Although stimulant dependence is highly heritable, few studies have examined genetic influences on methamphetamine dependence. We performed a candidate gene study of 52 SNPs and pretreatment methamphetamine use frequency among 263 methamphetamine dependent Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White participants of several methamphetamine outpatient clinical trials in Los Angeles. One SNP, rs7591784 was significantly associated with pretreatment methamphetamine use frequency following Bonferroni correction (p &lt; 0.001) in males but not females. We then examined rs7591784 and methamphetamine urine drug screen results during 12 weeks of outpatient treatment among males with treatment outcome data available (N = 94) and found rs7591784 was significantly associated with methamphetamine use during treatment controlling for pretreatment methamphetamine use. rs7591784 is near CREB1 and in a linkage disequilibrium block with rs2952768, previously shown to influence CREB1 expression. The CREB signaling pathway is involved in gene expression changes related to chronic use of multiple drugs of abuse including methamphetamine and these results suggest that variability in CREB signaling may influence pretreatment frequency of methamphetamine use as well as outcomes of outpatient treatment. Medications targeting the CREB pathway, including phosphodiesterase inhibitors, warrant investigation as pharmacotherapies for methamphetamine use disorders.

27465491	20160729	Role of SUMO activating enzyme in cancer stem cell maintenance and self-renewal.	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have key roles in treatment resistance, tumour metastasis and relapse. Using colorectal cancer (CC) cell lines, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tissues and patient tissues, here we report that CC CSCs, which resist chemoradiation, have higher SUMO activating enzyme (E1) and global SUMOylation levels than non-CSCs. Knockdown of SUMO E1 or SUMO conjugating enzyme (E2) inhibits CC CSC maintenance and self-renewal, while overexpression of SUMO E1 or E2 increases CC cell stemness. We found that SUMOylation regulates CSCs through Oct-1, a transcription factor for aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs). ALDH activity is not only a marker for CSCs but also important in CSC biology. SUMO does not modify Oct-1 directly, but regulates the expression of TRIM21 that enhances Oct-1 ubiquitination and, consequently, reducing Oct-1 stability. In summary, our findings suggest that SUMOylation could be a target to inhibit CSCs and ultimately to reduce treatment resistance, tumour metastasis and relapse. 	Nat_Commun	D016428
25007157	20140710	Association of Megsin gene polymorphism with IgA nephropathy risk.	This meta-analysis was conducted to assess the association of Megsin 2093C/T, 2180C/T, C25663G gene polymorphism with the risk of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). The association literatures were identified from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and CBM-disc (China Biological Medicine Database) on 1 January 2014, and eligible reports were recruited and synthesized. Seven eligible reports were recruited into this meta-analysis for the association of Megsin 2093C/T, 2180C/T, C25663G gene polymorphism with IgAN risk. In this meta-analysis, the association of Megsin 2093C/T TT genotype with IgAN risk in Asians was found. Interestingly, Megsin C25663G G allele and GG genotype were associated with the risk of IgAN in Asian population. However, Megsin 2180C/T gene polymorphism was not associated with IgAN risk in Asians. In conclusion, Megsin 2093C/T TT genotype, and C25663G G allele and GG genotype were associated with the risk of IgAN in Asian population. However, more studies should be performed in the future to confirm this association. 	J._Recept._Signal_Transduct._Res.	D016428 D017418 D013485
21072067	20101113	BEST1-related autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy: a degenerative disease with a range of developmental ocular anomalies.	To describe the spectrum of phenotypic characteristics of BEST1-related autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy (ADVIRC) in a family with p.V86M mutation. A retrospective review of the clinical, psychophysical, and electrophysiological phenotypes of six subjects with ADVIRC. Five family members were sequenced for mutations in the BEST1 gene. A heterozygous change, p.V86M (c.256G &gt; A), was identified in the BEST1 gene in the three affected subjects tested, and was shown to segregate with the disease phenotype. The distance visual acuity ranged from ? 20/25 to absent perception of light. Clinical features observed included angle closure glaucoma (n = 2), microcornea with shallow anterior chamber (n = 1), iris dysgenesis (n = 2), cataracts (n = 4), classical peripheral concentric band of retinal hyperpigmentation (n = 5), and optic nerve dysplasia (n = 1). Full-field electroretinogram response amplitudes ranged from low normal (two cases; 27 and 32 years) to non-recordable (two cases; 42 and 63 years). Goldmann fields were normal in two (27 and 28 years) but were abnormal in two older subjects. Optical coherence tomography showed macular thinning in the proband, whereas his affected daughter had normal macular thickness. Electro-oculography showed borderline Arden's ratio (1.50) in the lone case tested (27 years). ADVIRC is a slowly progressive vitreoretinal degeneration that demonstrates marked intra-familial phenotypic variability. Optic nerve dysplasia and iris dysgenesis are novel observations that extend the ocular phenotype of ADVIRC. 	Eye_(Lond)	D016428
20169157	20100220	Regulation of CCR5 expression in human placenta: insights from a study of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Malawi.	Human promoter polymorphisms in the chemokine co-receptor 5 gene (CCR5) have been noted for association with mother-to-child transmission of HIV (HIV MTCT) as well as reduced receptor expression in vitro, but have not been clearly associated with CCR5 expression in vivo. Placental expression of CCR5 may be influenced by such polymorphisms as well as other in vivo regulatory factors. We evaluated the associations between infant CCR5 polymorphisms, measures of maternal infection, and placental expression of CCR5 among mother-infant pairs in Blantyre, Malawi. RNA was extracted from placental tissue and used in multiplex real-time PCR to quantify gene expression. Through linear regression, we observed that CCR5-2554T (beta = -0.67, 95% CI = -1.23, -0.11) and -2132T (beta = -0.75, 95% CI = -0.131, -0.18) were significantly associated with reduced placental expression of CCR5. An incremental increase in CCR5 expression was observed for incremental increases in expression of two heparan sulfate genes involved in viral infection, HS3ST3A1 (beta = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.18, 0.35) and HS3ST3B1 (beta = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.06, 0.18). Among HIV infected mothers, an incremental increase in maternal HIV viral load was also associated with higher CCR5 expression (beta = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.12, 1.39). Maternal HIV status had no overall effect (beta = 0.072, 95% CI = -0.57, -0.72). Higher CCR5 expression was observed for mothers with malaria but was not statistically significant (beta = 0.37, 95% CI = -0.43, 1.18). These results provide in vivo evidence for genetic and environmental factors involved in the regulation of CCR5 expression in the placenta. Our findings also suggest that the measurement of placental expression of CCR5 alone is not an adequate indicator of the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

22957257	20120908	A novel Myosin essential light chain mutation causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with late onset and low expressivity.	Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is caused by mutations in genes encoding sarcomere proteins. Mutations in MYL3, encoding the essential light chain of myosin, are rare and have been associated with sudden death. Both recessive and dominant patterns of inheritance have been suggested. We studied a large family with a 38-year-old asymptomatic HCM-affected male referred because of a murmur. The patient had HCM with left ventricular hypertrophy (max WT?21?mm), a resting left ventricular outflow gradient of 36?mm?Hg, and left atrial dilation (54?mm). Genotyping revealed heterozygosity for a novel missense mutation, p.V79I, in MYL3. The mutation was not found in 300 controls, and the patient had no mutations in 10 sarcomere genes. Cascade screening revealed a further nine heterozygote mutation carriers, three of whom had ECG and/or echocardiographic abnormalities but did not fulfil diagnostic criteria for HCM. The penetrance, if we consider this borderline HCM the phenotype of the p.V79I mutation, was 40%, but the mean age of the nonpenetrant mutation carriers is 15, while the mean age of the penetrant mutation carriers is 47. The mutation affects a conserved valine replacing it with a larger isoleucine residue in the region of contact between the light chain and the myosin lever arm. In conclusion, MYL3 mutations can present with low expressivity and late onset. 	Biochem_Res_Int	D016428
23638029	20130503	A novel beta-defensin antimicrobial peptide in Atlantic cod with stimulatory effect on phagocytic activity.	A novel defensin antimicrobial peptide gene was identified in Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua. This three exon/two intron defensin gene codes for a peptide precursor consisting of two domains: a signal peptide of 26 amino acids and a mature peptide of 40 residues. The mature cod defensin has six conserved cysteine residues that form 1-5, 2-4 and 3-6 disulphide bridges. This pattern is typical of beta-defensins and this gene was therefore named cod beta-defensin (defb). The tertiary structure of Defb exhibits an ?/? fold with one ? helix and ?1?2?3 sheets. RT-PCR analysis indicated that defb transcripts were present mainly in the swim bladder and peritoneum wall but could also be detected at moderate to low levels in skin, head- and excretory kidneys. In situ hybridisation revealed that defb was specifically expressed by cells located in the swim bladder submucosa and the oocytes. During embryonic development, defb gene transcripts were detectable from the golden eye stage onwards and their expression was restricted to the swim bladder and retina. Defb was differentially expressed in several tissues following antigenic challenge with Vibrio anguillarum, being up-regulated up to 25-fold in head kidney. Recombinant Defb displayed antibacterial activity, with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.4-0.8 ?M and 25-50 ?M against the Gram-(+) bacteria Planococcus citreus and Micrococcus luteus, respectively. In addition, Defb stimulated phagocytic activity of cod head kidney leucocytes in vitro. These findings imply that beta-defensins may play an important role in the innate immune response of Atlantic cod. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
25918668	20150429	Mitochondrial Dysfunction and ?-Synuclein Synaptic Pathology in Parkinson's Disease: Who's on First?	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder. Its characteristic neuropathological features encompass the loss of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal system and the presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. These are intraneuronal and intraneuritic proteinaceous insoluble aggregates whose main constituent is the synaptic protein ?-synuclein. Compelling lines of evidence indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction and ?-synuclein synaptic deposition may play a primary role in the onset of this disorder. However, it is not yet clear which of these events may come first in the sequel of processes leading to neurodegeneration. Here, we reviewed data supporting either that ?-synuclein synaptic deposition precedes and indirectly triggers mitochondrial damage or that mitochondrial deficits lead to neuronal dysfunction and ?-synuclein synaptic accumulation. The present overview shows that it is still difficult to establish the exact temporal sequence and contribution of these events to PD. 	Parkinsons_Dis	D016428 D016454
11146721	20010207	Survey of patients with granular, lattice, avellino, and Reis-B?cklers corneal dystrophies for mutations in the BIGH3 and gelsolin genes.	To search for novel mutations that cause corneal stromal dystrophies and to confirm or revise the clinical diagnosis of patients with these mutations. Through review of the records of the Cogan Eye Pathology Laboratory at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Boston, and of clinical records, we ascertained 14 unrelated patients with the clinical or histopathologic diagnosis of granular (3 cases), Avellino (5 cases), lattice (5 cases), or Reis-B?cklers (1 case) corneal dystrophy. Clinical records and histopathologic findings of the index patients and their relatives were reviewed. Patients and selected relatives donated a blood sample from which leukocyte DNA was purified and assayed for mutations in the BIGH3 gene and, in 2 patients, the gelsolin gene, using the polymerase chain reaction and direct genomic sequencing. All index patients with the diagnosis of granular dystrophy or Avellino dystrophy had the missense mutation Arg555Trp or Arg124His, respectively, previously reported in the BIGH3 gene. Of the 5 index patients with a prior diagnosis of lattice dystrophy, 2 had the originally reported lattice mutation (Arg124Cys) in the BIGH3 gene, 1 had a more recently reported missense mutation (His626Arg) in the same gene, 1 had the missense mutation Asp187Asn in the gelsolin gene, and 1 had no detected mutation in either gene. Affected members of the family with Reis-B?cklers dystrophy did not carry the previously reported mutations Arg555Gln or Arg124Leu but instead carried a novel missense mutation Gly623Asp in the BIGH3 gene. Molecular genetic analysis can improve the accuracy of diagnosis of patients with corneal dystrophies. Two patients with a prior diagnosis of lattice corneal dystrophy had their diagnosis changed to gelsolin-related amyloidosis (1 case) or secondary, nonhereditary localized amyloidosis (1 case). A novel mutation in the BIGH3 gene that causes Reis-B?cklers dystrophy was uncovered through this analysis, and another recently reported novel mutation was encountered. These findings serve to expand our knowledge of the spectrum of pathogenic mutations in BIGH3. 	Arch._Ophthalmol.	D016428 D013485 D013487
8601739	19960201	Four novel mutations in the ferrochelatase gene among erythropoietic protoporphyria patients.	A novel mutation was identified by direct sequencing of genomic polymerase chain reaction products in each of four Finnish erythropoietic protoporphyria families. All four mutations, including two deletions (751delGAGAA and the first de novo mutation, 1122delT) and two point mutations (286C--&gt;T and 343C--&gt;T), resulted in a dramatically decreased steady-state level of the allelic transcript, since none of the mutations could be demonstrated by direct sequencing of the amplified cDNAs synthesized from total RNA extracted from patients' lymphoblast cell lines. Because the assays of the ferrochelatase activity and erythrocyte protoporphyrin identify asymptomatic patients poorly, the DNA-based demonstration of a mutation is the only reliable way to screen individuals for the disease-associated mutation.

22472004	20120405	Redox regulation of SERCA2 is required for vascular endothelial growth factor-induced signaling and endothelial cell migration.	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) increases angiogenesis by stimulating endothelial cell (EC) migration. VEGF-induced nitric oxide ((?)NO) release from (?)NO synthase plays a critical role, but the proteins and signaling pathways that may be redox-regulated are poorly understood. The aim of this work was to define the role of (?)NO-mediated redox regulation of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) in VEGF-induced signaling and EC migration. VEGF-induced EC migration was prevented by the (?)NO synthase inhibitor, N (G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (LNAME). Either VEGF or (?)NO stimulated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (45)Ca(2+) uptake, a measure of SERCA activity, and knockdown of SERCA2 prevented VEGF-induced EC migration and (45)Ca(2+) uptake. S-glutathione adducts on SERCA2b, identified immunochemically, were increased by VEGF, and were prevented by LNAME or overexpression of glutaredoxin-1 (Glrx-1). Furthermore, VEGF failed to stimulate migration of ECs overexpressing Glrx-1. VEGF or (?)NO increased SERCA S-glutathiolation and stimulated migration of ECs in which wild-type (WT) SERCA2b was overexpressed with an adenovirus, but did neither in those overexpressing a C674S SERCA2b mutant, in which the reactive cysteine-674 was mutated to a serine. Increased EC Ca(2+) influx caused by VEGF or (?)NO was abrogated by overexpression of Glrx-1 or the C674S SERCA2b mutant. ER store-emptying through the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and Ca(2+) entry through Orai1 were also required for VEGF- and (?)NO-induced EC Ca(2+) influx. These results demonstrate that (?)NO-mediated activation of SERCA2b via S-glutathiolation of cysteine-674 is required for VEGF-induced EC Ca(2+) influx and migration, and establish redox regulation of SERCA2b as a key component in angiogenic signaling.

20587330	20100701	Kinetic analysis of Drosophila Vnd protein containing homeodomain with its target sequence.	Homeodomain (HD) is a highly conserved DNA-binding domain composed of helix-turn-helix motif. Drosophila Vnd (Ventral nervous system defective) containing HD acts as a regulator to either enhance or suppress gene expression upon binding to its target sequence. In this study, kinetic analysis of Vnd binding to DNA was performed. The result demonstrates that DNA-binding affinity of the recombinant protein containing HD and NK2-specific domain (NK2-SD) was higher than that of the full-length Vnd. To access whether phosphorylation sites within HD and NK2-SD affect the interaction of the protein with the target sequence, alanine substitutions were introduced. The result shows that S631A mutation within NK2-SD does not contribute significantly to the DNA-binding affinity. However, S571A and T600A mutations within HD showed lower affinity for DNA binding. In addition, DNA-binding analysis using embryonic nuclear protein also demonstrates that Vnd interacts with other nuclear proteins, suggesting the existence of Vnd as a complex.

17662697	20070731	Cell autonomy, receptor autonomy, and thermodynamics in nicotine receptor up-regulation.	Chronic nicotine exposure, in smokers or in experimental rodents administered nicotine, produces elevated levels of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in several brain regions. However, there are few data on up-regulation of receptors in specific neuronal subtypes. We tested whether functional up-regulation of nicotinic responses occurs in cultured GABAergic neurons of the ventral midbrain. Fura-2 measurements of nicotinic responses were made on ventral midbrain neurons from knock-in mice heterozygous for the alpha4-M2 domain Leu9'Ala mutation, which confers nicotine hypersensitivity. Chronic nicotine exposure at a concentration (10 nM for 3 days) that activates only the hypersensitive alpha4* (Leu9'Ala) receptors, but not wild-type receptors, resulted in significant potentiation of ACh (100 microM)-elicited responses. Experiments were also performed on midbrain neuronal cultures heterozygous for the alpha4* (Leu9'Ala) mutation as well as for a GFP protein fused to a GABA transporter that reliably reveals GABAergic neurons. In cultures chronically treated with 10nM nicotine, there was significantly increased alpha4* nicotinic-induced Ca(2+) influx elicited by low concentration of ACh (3 microM). Furthermore, chronic exposure to the competitive antagonist dihydro-beta-erythroidine, but not to the noncompetitive antagonist mecamylamine, induced up-regulation of ACh elicited nicotinic responses. These results suggest that occupation of alpha4* nicotinic receptor binding site(s), at the interface between two subunits, is sufficient to promote assembly and/or up-regulation of functional receptors in GABAergic neurons. Up-regulation in neurons is both &quot;cell-autonomous&quot;, occurring at the cell itself, and &quot;receptor autonomous&quot;, occurring at the receptor itself, and may be a thermodynamic necessity of ligand-protein interactions.

22806444	20120719	Comparative analysis of MRSA strains isolated from cases of mupirocin ointment treatment in which eradication was successful and in which eradication failed.	Nasal decolonization in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriers using mupirocin (MUP) is a strategy that complements barrier precautions and contact isolation. However, eradication failure cases have been observed despite isolates being susceptible to MUP. This would suggest that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) alone is not the only determinant of successful eradication. In this study, we undertook a comparative analysis of MRSA isolates from cases of successful and unsuccessful MUP-eradication treatment. The analyses we carried out were: determination of mupirocin MICs, sequencing of the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (ileS) gene, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec typing, and the assessment of slime production. MICs for all 14 of the successful nasal decolonization cases showed susceptibility to MUP, whereas 21 (87.5?%) of the 24 unsuccessful cases were MUP-susceptible, with low-level resistance seen in 3 (12.5?%) strains. In the analysis of mutations in the ileS gene, one strain with an MIC of 4??g/ml exhibited a G1778A point mutation that has not been previously reported. In the 14 successful nasal decolonization cases, only 1 strain (7.1?%) was an MRSA slime-producer, compared with 19 (79.7?%) of the 24 MRSA strains that could not be eradicated after MUP treatment (p?&lt;?0.05). For the eradication of MRSA by MUP, it is possible that slime may affect drug penetration. In conclusion, slime production was the only significant difference between isolates recovered from successful and unsuccessful eradication cases. 	J._Infect._Chemother.	D003160 D016428

23308249	20130112	Musashi-1 post-transcriptionally enhances phosphotyrosine-binding domain-containing m-Numb protein expression in regenerating gastric mucosa.	Upregulation of the RNA-binding protein Musashi-1 (Msi1) has been shown to occur in rat gastric corpus mucosa after ethanol-induced mucosal injury. However, there is no direct evidence linking Msi1 with gastric regeneration. We examined the process of tissue repair after acute gastric mucosal injury with Msi1-knock-out (KO) mice to clarify the role of Msi1 and Msi1-dependent regulation of m-Numb expression in regenerating gastric mucosa. Acute gastric injury was induced in Msi1-KO and wild-type ICR mice by administering absolute ethanol. Expression of the splicing variants of m-Numb mRNA and protein in the gastric mucosa were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. We demonstrated that phosphotyrosine-binding domain-containing m-Numb expression was significantly upregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in wild-type mice at 3 h after ethanol-induced acute gastric injury. In contrast, in Msi1-KO mice, the m-Numb protein was expressed weakly, and was associated with delayed regeneration of the injured gastric mucosal epithelium. In the Msi1-KO mouse, the ratio of m-Numb mRNA to total m-Numb mRNA in the heavy polysome fractions was lower than that in the wild-type mouse. Further, we showed that m-Numb-enhancement in gastric mucous cells induced the expression of prostate stem cell antigen and metallothionein-2. Under the m-Numb enhancing condition, the gastric cells exhibited enhanced cell proliferation and were significantly more resistant to H(2)O(2)-induced cell death than control cells. Msi1-dependent post-transcriptional enhancement of m-Numb is crucial in gastric epithelial regeneration. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485

27242725	20160601	Unearthing the Ecology of Soil Microorganisms Using a High Resolution DNA-SIP Approach to Explore Cellulose and Xylose Metabolism in Soil.	We explored microbial contributions to decomposition using a sophisticated approach to DNA Stable Isotope Probing (SIP). Our experiment evaluated the dynamics and ecological characteristics of functionally defined microbial groups that metabolize labile and structural C in soils. We added to soil a complex amendment representing plant derived organic matter substituted with either (13)C-xylose or (13)C-cellulose to represent labile and structural C pools derived from abundant components of plant biomass. We found evidence for (13)C-incorporation into DNA from (13)C-xylose and (13)C-cellulose in 49 and 63 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), respectively. The types of microorganisms that assimilated (13)C in the (13)C-xylose treatment changed over time being predominantly Firmicutes at day 1 followed by Bacteroidetes at day 3 and then Actinobacteria at day 7. These (13)C-labeling dynamics suggest labile C traveled through different trophic levels. In contrast, microorganisms generally metabolized cellulose-C after 14 days and did not change to the same extent in phylogenetic composition over time. Microorganisms that metabolized cellulose-C belonged to poorly characterized but cosmopolitan soil lineages including Verrucomicrobia, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes. 	Front_Microbiol	D016428
19340307	20090403	New population and phylogenetic features of the internal variation within mitochondrial DNA macro-haplogroup R0.	R0 embraces the most common mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineage in West Eurasia, namely, haplogroup H (approximately 40%). R0 sub-lineages are badly defined in the control region and therefore, the analysis of diagnostic coding region polymorphisms is needed in order to gain resolution in population and medical studies. We sequenced the first hypervariable segment (HVS-I) of 518 individuals from different North Iberian regions. The mtDNAs belonging to R0 (approximately 57%) were further genotyped for a set of 71 coding region SNPs characterizing major and minor branches of R0. We found that the North Iberian Peninsula shows moderate levels of population stratification; for instance, haplogroup V reaches the highest frequency in Cantabria (north-central Iberia), but lower in Galicia (northwest Iberia) and Catalonia (northeast Iberia). When compared to other European and Middle East populations, haplogroups H1, H3 and H5a show frequency peaks in the Franco-Cantabrian region, declining from West towards the East and South Europe. In addition, we have characterized, by way of complete genome sequencing, a new autochthonous clade of haplogroup H in the Basque country, named H2a5. Its coalescence age, 15.6+/-8 thousand years ago (kya), dates to the period immediately after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). In contrast to other H lineages that experienced re-expansion outside the Franco-Cantabrian refuge after the LGM (e.g. H1 and H3), H2a5 most likely remained confined to this area till present days.

22611470	20120522	Akt blocks the tumor suppressor activity of LKB1 by promoting phosphorylation-dependent nuclear retention through 14-3-3 proteins.	The survival kinase Akt and the tumor suppressor LKB1 elicit opposite effects on cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. The present study demonstrates that Akt acts as an upstream kinase of LKB1 to promote the phosphorylation at Ser334 and facilitate its binding to 14-3-3 proteins, resulting in a decreased interaction with STE20-related adaptor protein ? (STRAD?) and an enhanced nuclear accumulation of LKB1. The S334A mutant of LKB1 exhibits impaired binding with 14-3-3 proteins and is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, whereas the phosphorylation-mimic mutant, S334D, is sequestrated in the nuclei and unable to elicit the tumor suppressor function. On the other hand, S334A exerts more potent activity than wild type LKB1 in inhibiting the breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in mice. These findings suggest that Akt blocks the anti-growth signal of LKB1 by triggering a phosphorylation-dependent nuclear sequestration of LKB1 through 14-3-3 proteins. 	Am_J_Transl_Res	D016428
21520058	20110427	SH2B1? regulates N-cadherin levels, cell-cell adhesion and nerve growth factor-induced neurite initiation.	Little is known regarding the role of inter-cellular interaction during neuronal differentiation. Homophilic N-cadherin engagement between cells contributes to neuronal migration. However, its function in neurite initiation is not clear. In this study, we provide the first evidence that the adaptor protein SH2B1? regulated N-cadherin levels and neurite initiation. Overexpression of SH2B1? reduces N-cadherin levels and increased phosphotyrosine 654 ?-catenin, leading to increased nerve growth factor-induced neurite initiation in PC12 cells, an established model for neuronal differentiation. In contrast, overexpression of the dominant-negative mutant SH2B1?(R555E) increases N-cadherin expression, cell-cell aggregation, and reduces neurite initiation. Moreover, SH2B1? binds directly or indirectly to N-cadherin indicative of its involvement in regulating the levels of N-cadherin. Taken together, these findings provide significant new insights into how N-cadherin-mediated inter-cellular interactions may influence neurite initiation and how SH2B1? may regulate these processes.

18511872	20080531	Meta-analysis of genetic studies from journals published in China of ischemic stroke in the Han Chinese population.	The aim of this study was to confirm the nature and number of genes contributing to stroke risk and qualify the genetic risk of each susceptibility gene in the Han Chinese population. After collecting all case-control studies related to DNA polymorphism of any candidate gene for ischemic stroke in Han Chinese, strict selection criteria and exclusion criteria were determined and different effect models were used according to the difference in heterogeneity. Meta-analyses were carried out by Revman 4.0 software and the publication bias was further evaluated through calculation of fail-safe numbers in the included gene polymorphisms. Seventy-six studies were included in the meta-analyses which were all published in mainland China and referred to 6 candidate genes and 7 polymorphisms. Among the gene polymorphisms tested in the study, association of gene polymorphisms with increasing risk of ischemic stroke was confirmed in 6 polymorphisms including angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D; OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.45-2.42), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.26-1.90), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) 4G/5G (OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.20-2.67), beta-fibrinogen (beta-Fg) -455A/G (OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.14-1.92), beta-Fg -148T/C (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.42-2.07), apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon2-4 (OR = 2.39, 95% CI = 1.94-2.95). Because of the obvious publication bias, the association between paraoxonase 1 (PON-1) polymorphisms and stroke risk was not established although the OR of the meta-analysis suggested a positive result (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.01-1.35). ACE D/I, MTHFR C677T, beta-Fg -455A/G, beta-Fg -148T/C, PAI-1 4G/5G, and ApoE epsilon2-4 were associated with risk of ischemic stroke in Han Chinese. 	Cerebrovasc._Dis.	D016428 D017418 D013485
11927379	20020403	Signalling, cycling and desensitisation of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptors.	Sustained stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) typically causes receptor desensitisation, which is mediated by phosphorylation, often within the C-terminal tail of the receptor. The consequent binding of beta-arrestin not only prevents the receptor from activating its G protein (causing desensitisation), but can also target it for internalisation via clathrin-coated vesicles and can mediate signalling to proteins regulating endocytosis and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. GnRH acts via phospholipase C (PLC)-coupled GPCRs on pituitary gonadotrophs to stimulate a Ca(2+)-mediated increase in gonadotrophin secretion. The type I GnRH receptors (GnRH-Rs), found only in mammals, are unique in that they lack C-terminal tails and apparently do not undergo agonist-induced phosphorylation or bind beta-arrestin; they are therefore resistant to receptor desensitisation and internalise slowly. In contrast, the type II GnRH-Rs, found in numerous vertebrates, possess such tails and show rapid desensitisation and internalisation, with concomitant receptor phosphorylation (within the C-terminal tails) or binding of beta-arrestin, or both. The association with beta-arrestin may also be important for regulation of dynamin, a GTPase that controls separation of endosomes from the plasma membrane. Using recombinant adenovirus to express GnRH-Rs in Hela cells conditionally expressing a dominant negative mutant of dynamin (K44A), we have found that blockade of dynamin-dependent endocytosis inhibits internalisation of type II (xenopus) GnRH-Rs but not type I (human) GnRH-Rs. In these cells, blockade of dynamin-dependent internalisation also inhibited GnRH-R-mediated MAPK activation, but this effect was not receptor specific and therefore not dependent upon dynamin-regulated GnRH-R internalisation. Although type I GnRH-Rs do not desensitise, sustained activation of GnRH-Rs causes desensitisation of gonadotrophin secretion, and we have found that GnRH can cause down-regulation of inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate receptors and desensitisation of Ca(2+) mobilisation in pituitary cells. The atypical resistance of the GnRH-R to desensitisation may underlie its atypical efficiency at provoking this downstream adaptive response. GnRH-Rs are also expressed in several extrapituitary sites, and these may mediate direct inhibition of proliferation of hormone-dependent cancer cells. Infection with type I GnRH-R-expressing adenovirus facilitated expression of high-affinity, PLC-coupled GnRH-R in mammary and prostate cancer cells, and these mediated pronounced antiproliferative effects of receptor agonists. No such effect was seen in cells transfected with a type II GnRH-R, implying that it is mediated most efficiently by a non-desensitising receptor. Thus it appears that the mammalian GnRH-Rs have undergone a period of rapidly accelerated molecular evolution that is of functional relevance to GnRH-Rs in pituitary and extrapituitary sites.

26650356	20151210	A K(+)-selective CNG channel orchestrates Ca(2+) signalling in zebrafish sperm.	Calcium in the flagellum controls sperm navigation. In sperm of marine invertebrates and mammals, Ca(2+) signalling has been intensely studied, whereas for fish little is known. In sea urchin sperm, a cyclic nucleotide-gated K(+) channel (CNGK) mediates a cGMP-induced hyperpolarization that evokes Ca(2+) influx. Here, we identify in sperm of the freshwater fish Danio rerio a novel CNGK family member featuring non-canonical properties. It is located in the sperm head rather than the flagellum and is controlled by intracellular pH, but not cyclic nucleotides. Alkalization hyperpolarizes sperm and produces Ca(2+) entry. Ca(2+) induces spinning-like swimming, different from swimming of sperm from other species. The &quot;spinning&quot; mode probably guides sperm into the micropyle, a narrow entrance on the surface of fish eggs. A picture is emerging of sperm channel orthologues that employ different activation mechanisms and serve different functions. The channel inventories probably reflect adaptations to species-specific challenges during fertilization. 	Elife	D016428
26245207	20150807	Potentiators of Defective ?F508-CFTR Gating that Do Not Interfere with Corrector Action.	Combination drug therapies under development for cystic fibrosis caused by the ?F508 mutation in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) include a &quot;corrector&quot; to improve its cellular processing and a &quot;potentiator&quot; to improve its chloride channel function. Recently, it was reported that the approved potentiator N-(2,4-di-tert-butyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide (Ivacaftor) reduces ?F508-CFTR cellular stability and the efficacy of investigational correctors, including 3-(6-[([1-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)cyclopropyl]carbonyl) amino]-3-methyl-2-pyridinyl)-benzoic acid and 1-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-N-(1-[(2R)-2,3-dihydroxypropyl]-6-fluoro-2-(2-hydroxy-1,1-dimethylethyl)-1H-indol-5-yl), which might contribute to the modest reported efficacy of combination therapy in clinical trials. Here, we report the identification and characterization of potentiators that do not interfere with ?F508-CFTR stability or corrector action. High-throughput screening and structure-activity analysis identified several classes of potentiators that do not impair corrector action, including tetrahydrobenzothiophenes, thiooxoaminothiazoles, and pyrazole-pyrrole-isoxazoles. The most potent compounds have an EC(50) for ?F508-CFTR potentiation down to 18 nM and do not reduce corrector efficacy in heterologous ?F508-CFTR-expressing cells or primary cultures of ?F508/?F508 human bronchial epithelia. The ?F508-CFTR potentiators also activated wild-type and G551D CFTR, albeit weakly. The efficacy of combination therapy for cystic fibrosis caused by the ?F508 mutation may be improved by replacement of Ivacaftor with a potentiator that does not interfere with corrector action.

27833557	20161112	Immune Responses to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Their Application for Cancer Treatment.	Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a prototypic cell-surface receptor belonging to the ErbB/HER onocogene family. Overexpression or somatic mutations of EGFR have been reported to play an important role in tumorigenesis in various types of epithelial cancers. Therefore, targeting of EGFR with specific blocking antibodies or inhibitors have been developing for treatment for EGFR-associated tumors. Immune responses to HER2, another molecule of the ErbB/HER onocogene family, have been well studied, but only limited information on the immune responses to EGFR in cancer has been currently available. In this review, we have summarized the available data and discussed potential clinical importance of the anti-EGFR immune responses and EGFR-mediated immune regulation in cancer. Several lines of evidence suggest that cellular and humoral immune responses to EGFR might be useful as a marker and/or target for cancer therapy against EGFR-associated tumors. In addition, recent studies suggest the critical roles of EGFR-mediated signaling in regulation of expression of an immune checkpoint molecule, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumor cells. Further studies are warranted to clarify the impact of the anti-EGFR immune responses and EGFR-mediated immunomodulation for clinical application for cancer treatment.

18806787	20080923	Jade-1 inhibits Wnt signalling by ubiquitylating beta-catenin and mediates Wnt pathway inhibition by pVHL.	The von Hippel-Lindau protein pVHL suppresses renal tumorigenesis in part by promoting the degradation of hypoxia-inducible HIF-alpha transcription factors; additional mechanisms have been proposed. pVHL also stabilizes the plant homeodomain protein Jade-1, which is a candidate renal tumour suppressor that may correlate with renal cancer risk. Here we show that Jade-1 binds the oncoprotein beta-catenin in Wnt-responsive fashion. Moreover, Jade-1 destabilizes wild-type beta-catenin but not a cancer-causing form of beta-catenin. Whereas the well-established beta-catenin E3 ubiquitin ligase component beta-TrCP ubiquitylates only phosphorylated beta-catenin, Jade-1 ubiquitylates both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated beta-catenin and therefore regulates canonical Wnt signalling in both Wnt-off and Wnt-on phases. Thus, the different characteristics of beta-TrCP and Jade-1 may ensure optimal Wnt pathway regulation. Furthermore, pVHL downregulates beta-catenin in a Jade-1-dependent manner and inhibits Wnt signalling, supporting a role for Jade-1 and Wnt signalling in renal tumorigenesis. The pVHL tumour suppressor and the Wnt tumorigenesis pathway are therefore directly linked through Jade-1. 	Nat._Cell_Biol.	D016428 D052061 D013485
25584856	20150114	The role of active site tyrosine 58 in Citrobacter freundii methionine ?-lyase.	In the spatial structure of methionine ?-lyase (MGL, EC 4.4.1.11) from Citrobacter freundii, Tyr58 is located at H-bonding distance to the oxygen atom of the phosphate &quot;handle&quot; of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). It was replaced for phenylalanine by site-directed mutagenesis. The X-ray structure of the mutant enzyme was determined at 1.96? resolution. Comparison of spatial structures and absorption spectra of wild-type and mutant holoenzymes demonstrated that the replacement did not result in essential changes of the conformation of the active site Tyr58Phe MGL. The Kd value of PLP for Tyr58Phe MGL proved to be comparable to the Kd value for the wild-type enzyme. The replacement led to a decrease of catalytic efficiencies in both ?- and ?-elimination reactions of about two orders of magnitude as compared to those for the wild-type enzyme. The rates of exchange of C-?- and C-?- protons of inhibitors in D2O catalyzed by the mutant form are comparable with those for the wild-type enzyme. Spectral data on the complexes of the mutant form with the substrates and inhibitors showed that the replacement led to a change of rate the limiting step of the physiological reaction. The results allowed us to conclude that Tyr58 is involved in an optimal positioning of the active site Lys210 at some stages of ?- and ?-elimination reactions.

27122458	20160429	[Mutation screening of 433 families with Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy].	Mutation analysis of unrelated families with Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) was performed to investigate the characteristic of DMD gene mutation, especially the distribution pattern of point mutation of DMD gene in Chinese population. A total of 433 unrelated DMD/BMD families were collected at the Center of Prenatal Diagnosis of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from March 2010 to December 2014. The deletions or duplications in 79 exons of DMD gene were screened using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Any single-exon deletion detected by MLPA was further validated by PCR amplification. In the 117 unrelated Chinese families in which large-scale deletions and duplications had been excluded by MLPA, the point mutation in 79 exons of DMD gene were tested in the propositus using next-generation sequencing (NGS), and further verified the point mutation using Sanger sequencing. In the 433 unrelated DMD/BMD families, 316 families with DMD deletions/duplications were identified by MLPA. Out of 57 single-exon deletions detected by MLPA, 3 were found as point mutations by PCR and Sanger sequencing, including 2 nonsense mutation (c.1729G&gt;T [p.Glu577X], c. 3346A&gt;T [p.Lys1116X]) and 1 frame-shift mutation (c.8605_8606delGT [p.Val2869ThrfsX25]). Direct sequencing with Ion PGM and Sanger sequencing in 117 families with negative results in MLPA detected 92 different point mutations in 96 families, including 46 novel mutations, 42 previously reported ones, and 4 possible polymorphisms (rs189143447, rs202008454, rs200213555, rs187617705). The 46 novel mutations consisted of 16 nonsense mutations (c.100A&gt;T [p.Lys34X], c. 1201C&gt;T [p.Gln401X], c. 1707C&gt;A [p.Cys569X], c. 1831G&gt;T [p.Glu611X], c. 1912C&gt;T [p.Gln638X], c. 2213C&gt;G [p.Ser738X], c. 3673_3673delA [p.Ile1225X], c. 3774C&gt;A [p.Cys1258X], c. 4858G&gt;T [p.Glu1620X], c. 5764A&gt;T [p.Lys1922X], c. 6035T&gt;G [p.Leu2012X], c. 6408G&gt;A [p.Trp2136X], c. 7717C&gt;T [p.Gln2573X], c. 7864G&gt;T [p.Glu2622X], c. 8184_8185insT [p.Lys2729X], c. 8215C&gt;T [p.Gln2739X]), 5 missense mutations (c.139G&gt;A [p.Gly47Arg], c. 238G&gt;C [p.Ala80Pro], c. 335G&gt;T [p.Trp112Leu], c. 804A&gt;C [p.Leu268Phe], c. 1149G&gt;T [p.Glu383Asp]), 6 splice-site mutations (c.2293-3C&gt;A, c. 2380+ 1G&gt;T, c. 3277-1G&gt;C, c.4519-7A&gt;G, c. 5740-15G&gt;T, c. 7661-1G&gt;C), 16 small deletions (c.688_688delA [p.Met230CysfsX14], c.1760_1791del32 [p.Thr587IlefsX37], c. 2271_2271delA [p.Asp774ThrfsX22], c. 2281_2285delGAAAA [p.Glu761SerfsX10], c. 2527_2527delG [p.Glu843SerfsX3], c. 3405_3405delC [p.Asn1135LysfsX18], c. 4450_4450delC [p.His1484ThrfsX14], c. 4770_4770delA [p.Thr1590ThrfsX5], c. 4937_4937delA [p.Glu1646GlyfsX11], c. 5253_5256delATTA [p.Lys1751LysfsX2], c. 5654_5654delA [p.Gln1885ArgfsX6], c. 7441_7441delG [p.Glu2481AsnfsX13], c. 7860_7860delC [p.Ile2620IlefsX18], c. 8668-8668delG /c.8668+ 1-8668+ 1delG, c. 9009_9009delC [p.Thr3003ThrfsX18], c. 9021_9021delT [p.Ile3007IlefsX14]), and 3 small insertions (c.305_306insG [p.Gly102GlyfsX4], c. 3116_3117insA [p.His1039GlufsX11], c. 9197_9198insATCTC [p.Ser3066SerfsX25]). And 87.4% (83/95) of the pathologic point mutations disrupted the translational reading frame (46 nonsense mutations, 24 frame-shift mutations, and 13 splice-site mutations). Inexpensive and efficient genetic/prenatal diagnosis of DMD/BMD may be plausible by MLPA analysis, NGS, and Sanger sequencing. Most of the mutations identified in this study led to a predictable premature stop codon or splicing defects, resulting in defective function of dystrophin. 	Zhonghua_Yi_Xue_Za_Zhi	D016428
23285110	20130104	Neuronal categorization and discrimination of social behaviors in primate prefrontal cortex.	It has been implied that primates have an ability to categorize social behaviors between other individuals for the execution of adequate social-interactions. Since the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) is involved in both the categorization and the processing of social information, the primate LPFC may be involved in the categorization of social behaviors. To test this hypothesis, we examined neuronal activity in the LPFC of monkeys during presentations of two types of movies of social behaviors (grooming, mounting) and movies of plural monkeys without any eye- or body-contacts between them (no-contacts movies). Although the monkeys were not required to categorize and discriminate the movies in this task, a subset of neurons sampled from the LPFC showed a significantly different activity during the presentation of a specific type of social behaviors in comparison with the others. These neurons categorized social behaviors at the population level and, at the individual neuron level, the majority of the neurons discriminated each movie within the same category of social behaviors. Our findings suggest that a fraction of LPFC neurons process categorical and discriminative information of social behaviors, thereby contributing to the adaptation to social environments.

8448134	19930209	Recombinant human hemoglobin: modification of the polarity of the beta-heme pocket by a valine67(E11)--&gt;threonine mutation.	Using the mutagenesis and a gene expression system previously described [Fronticelli et al. (1991) J. Protein Chem. 10, 495-501], we have replaced Val67E11 in the distal heme pocket of the beta-chains of hemoglobin with Thr. The valine to threonine substitution is isosteric and only modifies the polarity of the beta-heme environment. The absorption and CD spectra of the resultant mutant hemoglobin were essentially the same as that of wild-type protein, indicating that the mutation did not cause any large conformational changes and that a water molecule was not coordinated to the ferrous iron atom. Equilibrium measurements of oxygen binding to the mutant indicate a 2-fold decrease in overall affinity relative to native or wild-type human hemoglobin. Thermodynamic analyses of O2 binding curves, based either on the sequential Adair model or on the MWC two-state model, indicated that the overall decrease of O2 affinity in the system was due to a lower association equilibrium constant for the intermediates of oxygenation, particularly those involved at the third ligation step. The functional characteristics of the mutant hemoglobin in either the T- or R-state were not modified greatly by the mutation; however, the Bohr effect and sensitivity to C1- were increased, suggesting a role of the intermediates of oxygenation in the modulation of these parameters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485 D013487
26464934	20151015	Real-Time RT-PCR for the Detection of Lyssavirus Species.	The causative agents of rabies are single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses in the genus Lyssavirus of Rhabdoviridae, consisting of twelve classified and three as yet unclassified species including classical rabies virus (RABV). Highly neurotropic RABV causes rapidly progressive encephalomyelitis with nearly invariable fatal outcome. Rapid and reliable diagnosis of rabies is highly relevant for public and veterinary health. Due to growing variety of the genus Lyssavirus observed, the development of suitable molecular assays for diagnosis and differentiation is challenging. This work focused on the establishment of a suitable real-time RT-PCR technique for rabies diagnosis as a complement to fluorescent antibody test and rabies tissue culture infection test as gold standard for diagnosis and confirmation. The real-time RT-PCR was adapted with the goal to detect the whole spectrum of lyssavirus species, for nine of which synthesized DNA fragments were used. For the detection of species, seven probes were developed. Serial dilutions of the rabies virus strain CVS-11 showed a 100-fold higher sensitivity of real-time PCR compared to heminested RT-PCR. Using a panel of thirty-one lyssaviruses representing four species, the suitability of the protocol could be shown. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences obtained by heminested PCR allowed correct classification of all viruses used. 	J_Vet_Med	D016428

The spermatogenesis was arrested at prophase or early metaphase I stages during the first meiotic division. The exocrine and endocrine testicular functions of azoospermic males (T 145 H/+) were compared with those of normal male littermates (+/+) at 63 days of age. Testis and epididymis weights in T 145 H/+ were significantly lower than those in +/+. By histological examination, the interstitial cells appeared preponderant but this was probably illusory due to the decrease in seminiferous tubular size and diminished testicular size. Moreover, androgen activity in T 145 H/+ seemed normal judging by weights of androgen target tissues (prostate, seminal vesicles), and plasma testosterone level. 	C._R._Seances_Soc._Biol._Fil.

9535809	19980516	Selective pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone produced by expression of a mutant thyroid hormone receptor beta gene in the pituitary gland of transgenic mice.	Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) has been subdivided into generalized resistance (GRTH) and pituitary resistance (PRTH) based on the clinical impression of absence or presence of thyrotoxicosis. However, due to lack of objective clinical and genetic criteria, the existence of PRTH as a distinct entity became controversial. To determine what the phenotype would be if RTH was confined to the pituitary, a transgenic mouse was developed in which expression of the mutant thyroid hormone receptor (TR) beta (G345R) was targeted to the pituitary thyrotrophs by placing it downstream of the mouse thyrotropin beta promoter. This construct exhibited an antagonistic effect on the thyroid hormone-dependent transactivation, mediated through the wild-type TRbeta1, only when cotransfected with the thyrotroph embryonic factor in a heterologous cell line. As expected the transgene was transcribed predominantly in the pituitary gland but not in liver. These mice showed a significant, though modest, increase in serum T4 concentration.

Glycogen storage disease type IV (GSD-IV) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a deficient glycogen branching enzyme (GBE), encoded by the GBE1 gene, resulting in the accumulation of abnormal glycogen deposits in the liver and other tissues. We treated a 20-month-old girl who presented with progressive liver cirrhosis and was diagnosed with GSD-IV, as confirmed by GBE1 gene mutation analysis, and underwent living related heterozygous donor liver transplantation. Direct sequencing of the GBE1 gene revealed that the patient was compound heterozygous for a known c.1571G&gt;A (p.Gly264Glu) mutation a novel c.791G&gt;A (Arg524Gln) mutation. This is the first report of a Korean patient with GSD-IV confirmed by mutation analysis, who was treated successfully by liver transplantation. 	Gut_Liver	D016428
23447704	20130301	An analogue-sensitive approach identifies basal body rotation and flagellum attachment zone elongation as key functions of PLK in Trypanosoma brucei.	Polo-like kinases are important regulators of cell division, playing diverse roles in mitosis and cytoskeletal inheritance. In the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, the single PLK homologue TbPLK is necessary for the assembly of a series of essential organelles that position and adhere the flagellum to the cell surface. Previous work relied on RNA interference or inhibitors of undefined specificity to inhibit TbPLK, both of which have significant experimental limitations. Here we use an analogue-sensitive approach to selectively and acutely inhibit TbPLK. T. brucei cells expressing only analogue-sensitive TbPLK (TbPLK(as)) grow normally, but upon treatment with inhibitor develop defects in flagellar attachment and cytokinesis. TbPLK cannot migrate effectively when inhibited and remains trapped in the posterior of the cell throughout the cell cycle. Using synchronized cells, we show that active TbPLK is a direct requirement for the assembly and extension of the flagellum attachment zone, which adheres the flagellum to the cell surface, and for the rotation of the duplicated basal bodies, which positions the new flagellum so that it can extend without impinging on the old flagellum. This approach should be applicable to the many kinases found in the T. brucei genome that lack an ascribed function. 	Mol._Biol._Cell	D016428 D013485
21763322	20110719	Relationships between genetic polymorphisms of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 and inflammatory bowel diseases in the Korean population.	Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) has been shown to play a crucial role in the propagation of inflammatory responses. Recent studies have reported that TREM-1 expression is up-regulated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therefore, we investigated the associations between TREM-1 genetic polymorphisms and IBD development and its phenotypes in the Korean population. Three TREM-1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, rs2234237, rs3789205, and rs9471535) were genotyped by Taqman technology on 202 Crohn's disease (CD), 265 ulcerative colitis (UC), 138 with intestinal Behcet's disease (BD), and 234 healthy controls and the relationships between these SNPs and IBD development and phenotypes were evaluated. We found that TREM-1 SNPs are significantly associated with the development of intestinal Behcet's disease (rs9471535: odds ratio [OR]=1.637, P=0.025; rs3789205: OR=1.668, P=0.019; rs2234237: OR=1.691, P=0.016), and in particular with skin involvement (rs9471535: OR=2.723, P=0.009; rs3789205: OR=2.477, P=0.017; rs2234237: OR=2.278, P=0.030) and the risk of azathioprine use (rs9471535: OR=2.722, P=0.021; rs3789205: OR=2.493, P=0.032; rs2234237: OR=2.638, P=0.026). However, TREM-1 SNPs were not significantly associated with the development of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The results of our study suggest that TREM-1 SNPs may play a significant role in the development of intestinal Behcet's disease and may have modest effects on disease severity. 	Life_Sci.

15382274	20040924	NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 null genotype is not associated with pediatric de novo acute leukemia.	NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase1 (NQO1) is a two-electron reductase that detoxifies quinones derived from the oxidation of phenolic metabolites of benzene. Exposure to benzene metabolites increases the risk of hematotoxicity and leukemia. NQO1 enzyme activity protects the cells against metabolites of benzene. C to T base substitution at nucleotide 609 of NQO1 cDNA (C609T) results in loss of enzyme activity. Low NQO1 activity may play a role in etiology of acute leukemia. We analyzed NQO1 C609T gene polymorphism using the PCR-RFLP method in 273 patients with de novo acute leukemia (189 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 84 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 286 healthy volunteers to investigate the role of NQO1 polymorphism in the etiology of acute leukemia. The frequency of homozygosity for NOQ1 C609T polymorphism was 3.5% in the healthy control population and 2.5% in pediatric acute leukemia. The NQO1 C609T allele frequency was not statistically different in the children with acute leukemia in comparison to the controls (odds ratio (OR), 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.58-1.01; P = 0.06). The distribution of NQO1 genotypes among children with acute leukemia was not statistically different from the control group (P = 0.13). These findings do not support the role of NQO1 C609T polymorphism in the etiology of de novo pediatric acute leukemia. 	Pediatr_Blood_Cancer	D016428 D013485
21921092	20110917	Identification of FGF7 as a novel susceptibility locus for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	Traditional genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of large cohorts of subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have successfully identified novel candidate genes, but several other plausible loci do not meet strict criteria for genome-wide significance after correction for multiple testing. The authors hypothesise that by applying unbiased weights derived from unique populations we can identify additional COPD susceptibility loci. Methods The authors performed a homozygosity haplotype analysis on a group of subjects with and without COPD to identify regions of conserved homozygosity haplotype (RCHHs). Weights were constructed based on the frequency of these RCHHs in case versus controls, and used to adjust the p values from a large collaborative GWAS of COPD. The authors identified 2318 RCHHs, of which 576 were significantly (p&lt;0.05) over-represented in cases. After applying the weights constructed from these regions to a collaborative GWAS of COPD, the authors identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a novel gene (fibroblast growth factor-7 (FGF7)) that gained genome-wide significance by the false discovery rate method. In a follow-up analysis, both SNPs (rs12591300 and rs4480740) were significantly associated with COPD in an independent population (combined p values of 7.9E-7 and 2.8E-6, respectively). In another independent population, increased lung tissue FGF7 expression was associated with worse measures of lung function. Weights constructed from a homozygosity haplotype analysis of an isolated population successfully identify novel genetic associations from a GWAS on a separate population. This method can be used to identify promising candidate genes that fail to meet strict correction for multiple testing. 	Thorax	D016428 D052061 D013485
16338871	20051213	Effects of phototherapy on newborn rat testicles.	Phototherapy is the most widespread treatment for lowering bilirubin concentration in neonates. In the routine, phototherapy has some side effects including skin eruption, fluid loss, abdominal distention, mild hemolysis and mild thrombocytopenia. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible mutagenic and gametocidal side effects of 72 h continuous phototherapy on the rat testicle. We observed decreases in spermatogonia numbers per tubule (S/T values), tubular fertilization index (TFI) and sperm sertoli cell index (SSCI), which are the most reliable methods in estimating future fertility potential, due to sensitivity to phototherapy. The differences between study and control groups for S/T, TFI and SSCI values were statistically significant (p = 0.008, p = 0.02 and p = 0.004, respectively). There were significant differences in seminiferous tubule diameters between the control and study groups (p &lt; 0.005), but no significant difference in DNA index values between the control (0.66 +/- 0.12) and study (0.59 +/- 0.05) groups (p &gt; 0.05). As a conclusion, phototherapy seems to have some side effects on the newborn rat testicle. Further studies with larger groups, designed for investigation of the effects of phototherapy on seminiferous tubules, may give more beneficial results. 	Arch._Androl.	D016428
25008072	20140711	Pregabalin activates ROMK1 channels via cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C.	Pregabalin (PGB) displays analgesic and anticonvulsant activities. Regulation of the resting membrane potential (RMP) by renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK1) channels may provide a mechanism for these activities. We examined the effects of PGB on ROMK1 channel activity. To investigate the regulatory effect of PGB on the activity of ROMK1 channel, we used inside-out excised membrane patches to measure the K+ current in Xenopus oocytes expressed either the wild-type (WT) or mutant ROMK1 channels. PGB concentration-dependently enhanced the activity of ROMK1 channels. PGB increases the WT channels, pHi gating residue mutant channels (K80M) and the mutant channels at phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2)-binding sites (R188Q, R217A, and K218A). Our study suggests that PGB in the regulating of ROMK1 channel function are neither by pHi- nor PIP2-dependent mechanism. We found PGB failed to prompt the activity of consensus phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C (PKC) mutated channels (S183A, T191A, T193A, S201A and T234A). Furthermore, PGB did not stimulate the activity of channels in the presence of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibitors, the mutants of the C-terminal PKA-phosphorylation sites (S219A and S313A), and the mutants constructed (S219D and S313D) which mimic the addition of negative charged associated with phosphorylation bound to a serine. These results demonstrated that PKA- and PKC-mediated phosphorylation represents a novel mechanism for PGB-activated ROMK1 channels. The enhancement of ROMK1 currents proves to an important molecular mechanism underlying the analgesic/anticonvulsant property of PGB for the restoration of RMP. 	Eur._J._Pharmacol.	D016428 D013485
20588169	20100701	A TRIM5alpha exon 2 polymorphism is associated with protection from HIV-1 infection in the Pumwani sex worker cohort.	The innate immune component TRIM5alpha has the ability to restrict retrovirus infection in a species-specific manner. TRIM5alpha of some primate species restricts infection by HIV-1, whereas human TRIM5alpha lacks this specificity. Previous studies have suggested that certain polymorphisms in human TRIM5alpha may enhance or impair the proteins affinity for HIV-1. This study investigates the role of TRIM5alpha polymorphisms in resistance/susceptibility to HIV-1 within the Pumwani sex worker cohort in Nairobi, Kenya. A group of women within this cohort remain HIV-1-seronegative and PCR-negative despite repeated exposure to HIV-1 through active sex work. A 1 kb fragment of the TRIM5alpha gene, including exon 2, from 1032 women enrolled in the Pumwani sex worker cohort was amplified and sequenced. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes were compared between HIV-1-positive and resistant women. The TRIM5alpha exon 2 genomic fragment was amplified, sequenced and genotyped. Pypop32-0.6.0 was used to determine SNP and haplotype frequencies and statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS-13.0 for Windows. A TRIM5alpha SNP (rs10838525) resulting in the amino acid change from arginine to glutamine at codon 136, was enriched in HIV-1-resistant individuals [P = 1.104E-05; odds ratio (OR) 2.991; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.806-4.953] and women with 136Q were less likely to seroconvert (P = 0.002; log-rank 12.799). Wild-type TRIM5alpha exon 2 was associated with susceptibility to HIV-1 (P = 0.006; OR 0.279; 95% CI 0.105-0.740) and rapid seroconversion (P = 0.001; log-rank 14.475). Our findings suggest that a shift from arginine to glutamine at codon 136 in the coiled-coil region of TRIM5alpha confers protection against HIV-1 in the Pumwani sex worker cohort.

27704180	20161006	A simple method for isolation and construction of markerless cyanobacterial mutants defective in acyl-acyl carrier protein synthetase.	Cyanobacterial mutants defective in acyl-acyl carrier protein synthetase (Aas) secrete free fatty acids (FFAs) into the external medium and hence have been used for the studies aimed at photosynthetic production of biofuels. While the wild-type strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is highly sensitive to exogenously added linolenic acid, mutants defective in the aas gene are known to be resistant to the externally provided fatty acid. In this study, the wild-type Synechocystis cells were shown to be sensitive to lauric, oleic, and linoleic acids as well, and the resistance to these fatty acids was shown to be enhanced by inactivation of the aas gene. On the basis of these observations, we developed an efficient method to isolate aas-deficient mutants from cultures of Synechocystis cells by counter selection using linoleic acid or linolenic acid as the selective agent. A variety of aas mutations were found in about 70 % of the FFA-resistant mutants thus selected. Various aas mutants were isolated also from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, using lauric acid as a selective agent. Selection using FFAs was useful also for construction of markerless aas knockout mutants from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. Thus, genetic engineering of FFA-producing cyanobacterial strains would be greatly facilitated by the use of the FFAs for counter selection. 	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428
22908014	20120822	The phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway in normal and malignant B cells: activation mechanisms, regulation and impact on cellular functions.	The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is a central signal transduction axis controlling normal B cell homeostasis and activation in humoral immunity. The p110? PI3K catalytic subunit has emerged as a critical mediator of multiple B cell functions. The activity of this pathway is regulated at multiple levels, with inositol phosphatases PTEN and SHIP both playing critical roles. When deregulated, the PI3K pathway can contribute to B cell malignancies and autoantibody production. This review summarizes current knowledge on key mechanisms that activate and regulate the PI3K pathway and influence normal B cell functional responses including the development of B cell subsets, antigen presentation, immunoglobulin isotype switch, germinal center responses, and maintenance of B cell anergy. We also discuss PI3K pathway alterations reported in select B cell malignancies and highlight studies indicating the functional significance of this pathway in malignant B cell survival and growth within tissue microenvironments. Finally, we comment on early clinical trial results, which support PI3K inhibition as a promising treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. 	Front_Immunol	D016428
7811989	19950115	The first mutation identified in the thrombomodulin gene in a 45-year-old man presenting with thromboembolic disease.	Thrombomodulin (TM) is the anticoagulant endothelial cell membrane-bound protein cofactor in the thrombin-mediated activation of protein C (PC). It has been clearly demonstrated that the anticoagulant and profibrinolytic functions of the PC system are important for the prevention of a thromboembolic disease. Patients with PC, protein S, or PC &quot;'cofactor&quot;' deficiency and/or dysfunction develop thromboembolic diseases. However, the molecular abnormality in at least 20% to 30% of thrombophilic patients cannot be identified by hitherto recognized defects. A putative pathologic lesion in the TM gene could be one of several candidates for these prothrombotic mutations. A directed search strategy for deletions, insertions, or point mutations in the TM gene has not been performed. Therefore, in the present study, we have analyzed the entire TM gene, including the promoter region, by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) in normal healthy volunteers and in patients presenting with a thromboembolic disease. We have identified a patient with a thromboembolic disease and a TM point mutation. In a 45-year-old Hispanic man with a documented pulmonary embolism, PCR-SSCP showed an aberrant band pattern and subsequent DNA sequence analysis showed a heterozygous substitution for G1456 to T. This substitution predicts an Asp468 to a Tyr change in the amino acid sequence that is located between the transmembrane domain and the sixth epidermal growth factor-like domain. The Asp468 to Tyr change would probably lead to significant structural changes not allowing the expression of the TM protein or to a conformational change that is not functional.

18493316	20080522	Positive selection in East Asians for an EDAR allele that enhances NF-kappaB activation.	Genome-wide scans for positive selection in humans provide a promising approach to establish links between genetic variants and adaptive phenotypes. From this approach, lists of hundreds of candidate genomic regions for positive selection have been assembled. These candidate regions are expected to contain variants that contribute to adaptive phenotypes, but few of these regions have been associated with phenotypic effects. Here we present evidence that a derived nonsynonymous substitution (370A) in EDAR, a gene involved in ectodermal development, was driven to high frequency in East Asia by positive selection prior to 10,000 years ago. With an in vitro transfection assay, we demonstrate that 370A enhances NF-kappaB activity. Our results suggest that 370A is a positively selected functional genetic variant that underlies an adaptive human phenotype. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
26893850	20160220	Clinical characteristics and pathology of thyroid-like follicular carcinoma of the kidney: Report of 3 cases and a literature review.	Thyroid-like follicular carcinoma (TLFC) of the kidney is an extremely rare type of renal tumor, which has not been classified under a known subtype of renal cell carcinoma. It is histologically similar to the primary thyroid follicular carcinoma; however, the characteristics lack thyroid immunohistochemical markers. The aim of the present study was to illustrate the clinical characteristics of 3 new cases along with a review of the literature. The patients were compared with regards to gender, age, location and size of the tumor, imageology, morphology, immunohistochemistry and prognosis. According to the limited data, TLFC occurs mainly in young women and its clinical manifestations have no difference with other renal tumors. Its imageological features resemble a large spectrum of benign and malignant renal and extra-renal conditions, which should be eliminated in the diagnostic process. Confirmed diagnosis depends on the examination of pathology and immunohistochemistry. Surgical ablation is the preferred therapeutic method. Currently, TLFC has a relatively good prognosis; however, this conclusion requires further cases and long-term follow-ups. Improving the understanding of TLFC can help avoid misdiagnosis and prevent inappropriate treatment. 	Mol_Clin_Oncol	D016428
15201285	20040618	Autocatalytic processing of HtrA2/Omi is essential for induction of caspase-dependent cell death through antagonizing XIAP.	A mature form of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial serine protease HtrA2/Omi is pivotal in regulating apoptotic cell death; however, the underlying mechanism of the processing event of HtrA2/Omi and its relevant biological function remain to be clarified. Here, we describe that HtrA2/Omi is autocatalytically processed to the 36-kDa protein fragment, which is required for the cytochrome c-dependent caspase activation along with neutralizing XIAP-mediated inhibition of caspases through interaction with XIAP, eventually promoting apoptotic cell death. We have shown that the autocatalytic processing of HtrA2/Omi occurs via an intermolecular event, demonstrated by incubating an in vitro translated HtrA2/Omi (S306A) mutant with the enzymatically active glutathione S-transferase-HtrA2/Omi protein. Using N-terminal amino acid sequencing and mutational analysis, we identified that the autocatalytic cleavage site is the carboxyl side of alanine 133 of HtrA2/Omi, resulting in exposure of an inhibitor of apoptosis protein binding motif in its N terminus. Our study provides evidence that the autocatalytic processing of HtrA2/Omi is crucial for regulating HtrA2/Omi-mediated apoptotic cell death. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
19557185	20090627	Uptake of the necrotic serpin in Drosophila melanogaster via the lipophorin receptor-1.	The humoral response to fungal and Gram-positive infections is regulated by the serpin-family inhibitor, Necrotic. Following immune-challenge, a proteolytic cascade is activated which signals through the Toll receptor. Toll activation results in a range of antibiotic peptides being synthesised in the fat-body and exported to the haemolymph. As with mammalian serpins, Necrotic turnover in Drosophila is rapid. This serpin is synthesised in the fat-body, but its site of degradation has been unclear. By &quot;freezing&quot; endocytosis with a temperature sensitive Dynamin mutation, we demonstrate that Necrotic is removed from the haemolymph in two groups of giant cells: the garland and pericardial athrocytes. Necrotic uptake responds rapidly to infection, being visibly increased after 30 mins and peaking at 6-8 hours. Co-localisation of anti-Nec with anti-AP50, Rab5, and Rab7 antibodies establishes that the serpin is processed through multi-vesicular bodies and delivered to the lysosome, where it co-localises with the ubiquitin-binding protein, HRS. Nec does not co-localise with Rab11, indicating that the serpin is not re-exported from athrocytes. Instead, mutations which block late endosome/lysosome fusion (dor, hk, and car) cause accumulation of Necrotic-positive endosomes, even in the absence of infection. Knockdown of the 6 Drosophila orthologues of the mammalian LDL receptor family with dsRNA identifies LpR1 as an enhancer of the immune response. Uptake of Necrotic from the haemolymph is blocked by a chromosomal deletion of LpR1. In conclusion, we identify the cells and the receptor molecule responsible for the uptake and degradation of the Necrotic serpin in Drosophila melanogaster. The scavenging of serpin/proteinase complexes may be a critical step in the regulation of proteolytic cascades. 	PLoS_Genet.	D016428 D013485
23259756	20121225	Cluster analysis application identifies muscle characteristics of importance for beef tenderness.	An important controversy in the relationship between beef tenderness and muscle characteristics including biochemical traits exists among meat researchers. The aim of this study is to explain variability in meat tenderness using muscle characteristics and biochemical traits available in the Integrated and Functional Biology of Beef (BIF-Beef) database. The BIF-Beef data warehouse contains characteristic measurements from animal, muscle, carcass, and meat quality derived from numerous experiments. We created three classes for tenderness (high, medium, and low) based on trained taste panel tenderness scores of all meat samples consumed (4,366 observations from 40 different experiments). For each tenderness class, the corresponding means for the mechanical characteristics, muscle fibre type, collagen content, and biochemical traits which may influence tenderness of the muscles were calculated. Our results indicated that lower shear force values were associated with more tender meat. In addition, muscles in the highest tenderness cluster had the lowest total and insoluble collagen contents, the highest mitochondrial enzyme activity (isocitrate dehydrogenase), the highest proportion of slow oxidative muscle fibres, the lowest proportion of fast-glycolytic muscle fibres, and the lowest average muscle fibre cross-sectional area. Results were confirmed by correlation analyses, and differences between muscle types in terms of biochemical characteristics and tenderness score were evidenced by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). When the cluster analysis was repeated using only muscle samples from m. Longissimus thoracis (LT), the results were similar; only contrasting previous results by maintaining a relatively constant fibre-type composition between all three tenderness classes. Our results show that increased meat tenderness is related to lower shear forces, lower insoluble collagen and total collagen content, lower cross-sectional area of fibres, and an overall fibre type composition displaying more oxidative fibres than glycolytic fibres.

20852263	20100921	A highly conserved SOX6 double binding site mediates SOX6 gene downregulation in erythroid cells.	The Sox6 transcription factor plays critical roles in various cell types, including erythroid cells. Sox6-deficient mice are anemic due to impaired red cell maturation and show inappropriate globin gene expression in definitive erythrocytes. To identify new Sox6 target genes in erythroid cells, we used the known repressive double Sox6 consensus within the ?y-globin promoter to perform a bioinformatic genome-wide search for similar, evolutionarily conserved motifs located within genes whose expression changes during erythropoiesis. We found a highly conserved Sox6 consensus within the Sox6 human gene promoter itself. This sequence is bound by Sox6 in vitro and in vivo, and mediates transcriptional repression in transient transfections in human erythroleukemic K562 cells and in primary erythroblasts. The binding of a lentiviral transduced Sox6FLAG protein to the endogenous Sox6 promoter is accompanied, in erythroid cells, by strong downregulation of the endogenous Sox6 transcript and by decreased in vivo chromatin accessibility of this region to the PstI restriction enzyme. These observations suggest that the negative Sox6 autoregulation, mediated by the double Sox6 binding site within its own promoter, may be relevant to control the Sox6 transcriptional downregulation that we observe in human erythroid cultures and in mouse bone marrow cells in late erythroid maturation.

25720378	20150228	Association between TLR4 A299G polymorphism and pneumonia risk: a meta-analysis.	Several genetic studies have evaluated the association between Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) A299G polymorphism and the risk of pneumonia. However, the results were not consistent. We thus did this meta-analysis. Relevant studies were systematically searched by using the NCBI, Medline, Web of Science, and Embase databases. Data were extracted independently by 2 investigators. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. Eight case-control studies with 658 patients and 1862 controls were included in this meta-analysis. TLR4 A299G polymorphism was significantly associated with pneumonia risk (OR=1.74; 95% CI 1.19-2.53; P=0.004). The result was significant in adults. In addition, TLR4 A299G polymorphism was also associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) risk. Results from cumulative meta-analysis and sensitivity analysis suggested that the results are reliable and robust. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that susceptibility to pneumonia was associated with TLR4 A299G polymorphism. 	Med._Sci._Monit.	D016428 D017418 D013485
26005205	20150526	Molecular characterization and expression analysis of five chitinases associated with molting in the Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis.	Chitinases are crucial enzymes required for chitin degradation in crustaceans. Five chitinase genes, namely, EsCht1, EsCht2, EsCht3, EsCht4, and EsCht6, were identified in the Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis. The open reading frames (ORF) of EsCht1, EsCht2, EsCht3, EsCht4 and EsCht6 ranged from 1182 bp to 1926 bp with encoding proteins between 393 and 641 amino acid residues. Domain analysis of the chitinase proteins showed that most EsChts contained the catalytic domain and the chitin-binding domain (CBD) connected with the serine/threonine (S/T)-rich linker region. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that EsChts with orthologs in crustaceans were divided into six groups. The tissue-dependent, developmental stage-related and molting stage-related differential expression patterns of chitinase genes were determined using end-point polymerase chain reaction and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. During the molting cycle, EsCht2 mRNA expression in the cuticle and EsCht4 and EsCht6 mRNA expression in the hepatopancreas were 108-fold (P&lt;0.05), 19-fold (P&lt;0.05) and 12-fold (P&lt;0.05) higher in the premolt (D(0-1)) than in the intermolt stage, respectively. The results indicated that EsCht1 from group 1 might play a role in the digestion of chitin-containing food; EsCht2 from group 2 likely played a role in the degradation of chitinous cuticle during molting for growth and during the post-embryonic development; EsCh3 from group 3 potentially had a dual role in the digestion of chitin-containing food and defense against chitin-bearing pathogens. EsCht3, EsCht4, and EsCht6 were highly expressed in the reproductive system, indicating their potential roles in reproductive molting. Differential expression patterns of the chitinase genes suggested that they might have distinct biological functions in developmental stage- and physiological growth-related and reproductive molting processes, which are essential for metamorphosis, growth, and reproduction. The findings of this study might form a basis for further studies on the functions of chitinases in E. sinensis and other crustaceans. 	Comp._Biochem._Physiol._B,_Biochem._Mol._Biol.	D016428 D013485
27294501	20160614	Genetic variation and exercise-induced muscle damage: implications for athletic performance, injury and ageing.	Prolonged unaccustomed exercise involving muscle lengthening (eccentric) actions can result in ultrastructural muscle disruption, impaired excitation-contraction coupling, inflammation and muscle protein degradation. This process is associated with delayed onset muscle soreness and is referred to as exercise-induced muscle damage. Although a certain amount of muscle damage may be necessary for adaptation to occur, excessive damage or inadequate recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage can increase injury risk, particularly in older individuals, who experience more damage and require longer to recover from muscle damaging exercise than younger adults. Furthermore, it is apparent that inter-individual variation exists in the response to exercise-induced muscle damage, and there is evidence that genetic variability may play a key role. Although this area of research is in its infancy, certain gene variations, or polymorphisms have been associated with exercise-induced muscle damage (i.e. individuals with certain genotypes experience greater muscle damage, and require longer recovery, following strenuous exercise). These polymorphisms include ACTN3 (R577X, rs1815739), TNF (-308 G&gt;A, rs1800629), IL6 (-174 G&gt;C, rs1800795), and IGF2 (ApaI, 17200 G&gt;A, rs680). Knowing how someone is likely to respond to a particular type of exercise could help coaches/practitioners individualise the exercise training of their athletes/patients, thus maximising recovery and adaptation, while reducing overload-associated injury risk. The purpose of this review is to provide a critical analysis of the literature concerning gene polymorphisms associated with exercise-induced muscle damage, both in young and older individuals, and to highlight the potential mechanisms underpinning these associations, thus providing a better understanding of exercise-induced muscle damage.

20646459	20100722	[Molecular characterization of drug-resistant and extensive-drug resistant isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Shenzhen of China].	To study the molecular characterization of drug-resistant and extensive-drug resistant isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in Shenzhen of China during 2007 - 2008. According to the standards of WHO and International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD), 136 strains of MTB were collected by performing drug sensitivity test (DST) to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, ofloxacin and kanamycin on Lowenstein-Jensen in 1% proportion method. Genetic mutations in the corresponding resistance genes (rpoB, katG, rpsL, rrs((1)), gyrA/B, rrs((2))) in these MTB isolates were identified by PCR, followed by DNA sequencing of the purified PCR products. A total of 123 isolates were collected. Seventy-three isolates were drug resistant, and 50 isolates were drug susceptible. Among the isolates that were resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, ofloxacin and kanamycin, the proportion of isolates that harboured mutations in the respective genes was 44/52, 44/47, 28/41, 11/11, and 11/18, respectively. For katG gene, the mutation detected was S315T or S315N. For rpoB, the most frequently found changes were S531L (30/44) and H526D (9/44) or H526R (1/44). For the reported mutations related with streptomycin-resistant strains, K43R and K88Q were found in the rpsL locus, and 491C--&gt;T and 513A--&gt;C were found in the rrs gene. For gyrA, all gyrA mutations were clustered in codons 90, 91, and 94 apart from the S95T that was natural polymorphism, accounting for 9/11 of the ofloxacin-resistant isolates, and condon 91 was the most frequently mutated. No mutations were found in gyrB. The most frequent substitutions were 1400A--&gt;G (9/11) and 1483G--&gt;T (2/11) in a specific region of the rrs gene related with kanamycin-resistant strains. No mutations except S95T of gyrA was detected in the drug- susceptible isolates. The mutation characterization of drug-resistant and drug- susceptible isolates of MTB was shown to vary according to geographic regions, and these findings can help understanding the molecular characterization and establishing a novel method for the detection of drug-resistant MTB.

26798617	20160123	The Prediction of Clinical Outcome Using HbA1c in Acute Ischemic Stroke of the Deep Branch of Middle Cerebral Artery.	To elucidate the association between glycemic control status and clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke limited to the deep branch of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). We evaluated 65 subjects with first-ever ischemic stroke of the deep branches of the MCA, which was confirmed by magnetic resonance angiography. All subjects had blood hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measured at admission. They were classified into two groups according to the level of HbA1c (low &lt;7.0% or high ?7.0%). Neurological impairment and functional status were evaluated using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Korean version of Modified Barthel Index (K-MBI), Korean version of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE-K), and the Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment (LOTCA) at admission and discharge. Body mass index, serum glucose, homocysteine and cholesterol levels were also measured at admission. The two groups did not show any difference in the NIHSS, FIM, K-MBI, MMSE-K, and LOTCA scores at any time point. Body mass index and levels of blood homocysteine and cholesterol were not different between the two groups. The serum blood glucose level at admission was negatively correlated with all outcome measures. We found that HbA1c cannot be used for predication of clinical outcome in patients with ischemic stroke of the deep branch of the middle cerebral artery. 	Ann_Rehabil_Med	D016428
25864349	20150414	[Catalase gene rs1001179 polymorphism and oxidative stress in patients with chronic hepatitis C and ulcerative colitis].	To study the rs1001179 polymorphism of the catalase (CAT) gene and to estimate the serum levels of the enzymes catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GP) in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and in those with ulcerative colitis (UC) in the Perm Territory. Ninety patients with reactivation-phase CHC and 50 patients with exacerbation-phase UC were examined. The serum levels of catalase and GP were determined and the polymorphic variants of the marker of CAT gene rs1001179 in the DNA isolated from whole blood were found in all the patients. In the CHC and UC groups, the levels of catalase and GP were found to be lower than that in apparently healthy individuals. Furthermore, both groups showed a direct correlation between the activities of the enzymes. In the patients with CHC and in those with UC, the spread of genotypes and alleles generally failed to virtually differ from that in the control group. The G/G genotype was prevalent in all the groups. In the patients with CHC, the minor A allele demonstrated a significant inverse correlation with the enzyme catalase (r = -0.16; p = 0.02) and GP (r = -0.13; p = 0.047). The lower serum levels of catalase and GP are indicative of oxidative stress in the patients with CHC or UC. In the patients with CHC, the significant correlation of the pathological rs1701179 A allele marker with the processes of synthesis of antioxidant enzymes may suggest that CAT gene polymorphism in the A/A homozygotes might affect the regulation mechanism involved in the antioxidant system in the liver.

20579337	20100629	Characterization of SQUAMOSA-like genes in Gerbera hybrida, including one involved in reproductive transition.	The flowering process in plants proceeds through the induction of an inflorescence meristem triggered by several pathways. Many of the genes associated with both the flowering process and floral architecture encode transcription factors of the MADS domain family. Gerbera, a member of the sunflower family, Asteraceae, bears compressed inflorescence heads (capitula) with three different flower types characterized by differences in both sexuality and floral symmetry. To understand how such a complex inflorescence structure is achieved at the molecular level, we have characterized the array of Gerbera MADS box genes. The high number of SQUAMOSA-like genes in Gerbera compared to other model species raised the question as to whether they may relate to Gerbera's complex inflorescence structure and whether or not a homeotic A function is present. In this paper we describe six Gerbera genes related to the SQUAMOSA/APETALA1/FRUITFULL genes of snapdragon and Arabidopsis. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the entire gene lineage, our data indicates that GSQUA1 and GSQUA3 are members of the SQUA/AP1 clade, while GSQUA2, GSQUA4, GSQUA5 and GSQUA6 are co-orthologs of the Arabidopsis FUL gene. GSQUA1/GSQUA3 and GSQUA4/GSQUA5/GSQUA6, respectively, represent several gene duplication events unknown in the model systems that may be specific to either Gerbera or Asteraceae. GSQUA genes showed specific expression profiles. GSQUA1, GSQUA2, and GSQUA5 were inflorescence abundant, while GSQUA3, GSQUA4, and GSQUA6 expression was also detected in vegetative organs. Overexpression of GSQUA2 in Gerbera led to accelerated flowering, dwarfism and vegetative abnormalities, all new and specific phenomena observed in transgenic Gerbera plants with modified MADS box gene expression. Based on expression patterns, none of the Gerbera SQUA-like genes are likely to control flower organ identity in the sense of the floral A function. However, our data shows that the FUL-like gene GSQUA2 plays a vital role in meristem transition. The roles of other GSQUA-genes in Gerbera floral development are intriguing, but require still further study. 	BMC_Plant_Biol.	D016428 D013485

21249199	20110121	Profiling early lung immune responses in the mouse model of tuberculosis.	Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the intracellular bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and kills more than 1.5 million people every year worldwide. Immunity to TB is associated with the accumulation of IFN?-producing T helper cell type 1 (Th1) in the lungs, activation of M.tuberculosis-infected macrophages and control of bacterial growth. However, very little is known regarding the early immune responses that mediate accumulation of activated Th1 cells in the M.tuberculosis-infected lungs. To define the induction of early immune mediators in the M.tuberculosis-infected lung, we performed mRNA profiling studies and characterized immune cells in M.tuberculosis-infected lungs at early stages of infection in the mouse model. Our data show that induction of mRNAs involved in the recognition of pathogens, expression of inflammatory cytokines, activation of APCs and generation of Th1 responses occurs between day 15 and day 21 post infection. The induction of these mRNAs coincides with cellular accumulation of Th1 cells and activation of myeloid cells in M.tuberculosis-infected lungs. Strikingly, we show the induction of mRNAs associated with Gr1+ cells, namely neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes, takes place on day 12 and coincides with cellular accumulation of Gr1+ cells in M.tuberculosis-infected lungs. Interestingly, in vivo depletion of Gr1+ neutrophils between days 10-15 results in decreased accumulation of Th1 cells on day 21 in M.tuberculosis-infected lungs without impacting overall protective outcomes. These data suggest that the recruitment of Gr1+ neutrophils is an early event that leads to production of chemokines that regulate the accumulation of Th1 cells in the M.tuberculosis-infected lungs.

19593814	20090714	The L49F mutation in alpha erythroid spectrin induces local disorder in the tetramer association region: Fluorescence and molecular dynamics studies of free and bound alpha spectrin.	The bundling of the N-terminal, partial domain helix (Helix C') of human erythroid alpha-spectrin (alphaI) with the C-terminal, partial domain helices (Helices A' and B') of erythroid beta-spectrin (betaI) to give a spectrin pseudo structural domain (triple helical bundle A'B'C') has long been recognized as a crucial step in forming functional spectrin tetramers in erythrocytes. We have used apparent polarity and Stern-Volmer quenching constants of Helix C' of alphaI bound to Helices A' and B' of betaI, along with previous NMR and EPR results, to propose a model for the triple helical bundle. This model was used as the input structure for molecular dynamics simulations for both wild type (WT) and alphaI mutant L49F. The simulation output structures show a stable helical bundle for WT, but not for L49F. In WT, four critical interactions were identified: two hydrophobic clusters and two salt bridges. However, in L49F, the region downstream of Helix C' was unable to assume a helical conformation and one critical hydrophobic cluster was disrupted. Other molecular interactions critical to the WT helical bundle were also weakened in L49F, possibly leading to the lower tetramer levels observed in patients with this mutation-induced blood disorder.

24599997	20140307	Nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning of cucumber mosaic virus protein 2b determines the balance between its roles as a virulence determinant and an RNA-silencing suppressor.	The Cucumber Mosaic Virus (CMV) 2b protein is an RNA-silencing suppressor that plays roles in CMV accumulation and virulence. The 2b proteins of subgroup IA CMV strains partition between the nucleus and cytoplasm, but the biological significance of this is uncertain. We fused an additional nuclear localization signal (NLS) to the 2b protein of subgroup IA strain Fny-CMV to create 2b-NLS and tested its effects on subcellular distribution, silencing, and virulence. The additional NLS enhanced 2b protein nuclear and nucleolar accumulation, but nuclear and nucleolar enrichment correlated with markedly diminished silencing suppressor activity in patch assays and abolished 2b protein-mediated disruption of microRNA activity in transgenic Arabidopsis. Nucleus/nucleolus-localized 2b protein possesses at least some ability to inhibit antiviral silencing, but this was not sufficient to prevent recovery from disease in younger, developing leaves in Arabidopsis. However, enhanced nuclear and nucleolar accumulation of 2b increased virulence and accelerated symptom appearance in older leaves. Experiments with Arabidopsis lines carrying mutant Dicer-like alleles demonstrated that compromised suppressor activity explained the diminished ability of 2b-NLS to enhance virus accumulation. Remarkably, the increased virulence that 2b-NLS engendered was unrelated to effects on microRNA- or short interfering RNA-regulated host functions. Thus, although nucleus- and nucleolus-localized 2b protein is less efficient at silencing suppression than cytoplasm-localized 2b, it enhances CMV virulence. We propose that partitioning of the 2b protein between the cytoplasmic and nuclear/nucleolar compartments allows CMV to regulate the balance between virus accumulation and damage to the host, presumably to maximize the benefit for the virus. In this work, the main finding is that nucleus/nucleolus-localized 2b protein is strongly associated with CMV virulence, which is independent of its effect on small RNA pathways. Moreover, this work supports the contention that the silencing suppressor activity of CMV 2b protein is predominantly exerted by that portion of the 2b protein residing in the cytoplasm. Thus, we propose that partitioning of the 2b protein between the cytoplasmic and nuclear/nucleolar compartments allows CMV to regulate the balance between virus accumulation and damage to the host, presumably to maximize the benefit for the virus.

22401170	20120310	?-Thalassemia mutations in two provinces of Southern Iran: Fars &amp; Kohkeloye and Bouyer Ahmad.	The major defect in ?-thalassemia (?-thal) is a single or double gene deletion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ?-thal mutations in two provinces of Southern Iran, Fars &amp; Kohkeloye and Bouyer Ahmad. A total of 2000 subjects with microcytic hypochromic anemia was selected as a study group; finally, 1177 subjects were found to be ?-thal mutation carriers by gap-polymerase chain reaction (gap-PCR) protocols and were confirmed by multiplex PCR and reverse hybridization test strips. A total of 1195 mutated ?-globin alleles was identified in these patients that includes at least 10 different gene mutations. The most common mutation found was -?(3.7) (rightward deletion) (71.7%) and ?(-5 nt) (IVS-I, -TGAGG) and the polyadenylation signal site (poly A1; AATAAA&gt;AATAAG) were the second and third most common mutations (7.0 and 4.2%, respectively). In countries like Iran, with a high prevalence of thalassemia, identifying different mutations is helpful in carrier screening, genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis of at-risk couples for the prevention of the birth of babies affected by severe thalassemic anomalies.

27142248	20160505	TRC8-dependent degradation of hepatitis C virus immature core protein regulates viral propagation and pathogenesis.	Signal-peptide peptidase (SPP) is an intramembrane protease that participates in the production of the mature core protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Here we show that SPP inhibition reduces the production of infectious HCV particles and pathogenesis. The immature core protein produced in SPP-knockout cells or by treatment with an SPP inhibitor is quickly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Oral administration of the SPP inhibitor to transgenic mice expressing HCV core protein (CoreTg) reduces the expression of core protein and ameliorates insulin resistance and liver steatosis. Moreover, the haploinsufficiency of SPP in CoreTg has similar effects. TRC8, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is required for the degradation of the immature core protein. The expression of the HCV core protein alters endoplasmic reticulum (ER) distribution and induces ER stress in SPP/TRC8 double-knockout cells. These data suggest that HCV utilizes SPP cleavage to circumvent the induction of ER stress in host cells. 	Nat_Commun	D016428 D013485
24616599	20140312	Different clinical phenotypes in familial severe congenital neutropenia cases with same mutation of the ELANE gene.	Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a heterogeneous group of disorders with a defect in granulopoiesis causing marked neutropenia and severe bacterial infections. A 17-month-old girl (patient 1) was admitted due to cervical lymphadenitis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, with neutropenia. She had Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis and peritonitis with perforated appendicitis at 8-month of age. Her sister, a 37-month-old girl (patient 2), had recurrent stomatitis with profound neutropenia, and her mother, a 32-yr-old woman (patient 3), had had recurrent stomatitis until her early 20s with neutropenia. We found an ELANE gene mutation (c.597+1G &gt; A) from them in direct DNA sequencing analysis. Patients 1 and 2 did not respond to granulocyte colony stimulating factor and patient 1 was treated with prolonged antibiotics and excision. We demonstrated inherited SCN cases showing different severity even with the same mutation of the ELANE gene in a family. 	J._Korean_Med._Sci.	D002363 D016428
21057535	20101109	Vimentin regulates EMT induction by Slug and oncogenic H-Ras and migration by governing Axl expression in breast cancer.	Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical event in the progression toward cancer metastasis. The intermediate filament protein vimentin is an important marker of EMT and a requisite regulator of mesenchymal cell migration. However, it is not known how vimentin functionally contributes to cancer cell invasion. Here, we report that ectopic expression of oncogenic H-Ras-V12G and Slug induces vimentin expression and migration in pre-malignant breast epithelial cells. Conversely, vimentin expression is necessary for Slug- or H-Ras-V12G-induced EMT-associated migration. Furthermore, silencing of vimentin in breast epithelial cells results in specific changes in invasiveness-related gene expression including upregulation of RAB25 (small GTPase Rab25) and downregulation of AXL (receptor tyrosine kinase Axl), PLAU (plasminogen activator, urokinase) and ITGB4 (integrin ?4-subunit). Importantly, gene expression profiling analyses reveal that vimentin expression correlates positively/negatively with these genes also in multiple breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer patient samples. Focusing on the tyrosine kinase Axl, we show that induction of vimentin by EMT is associated with upregulation of Axl expression and that Axl enhances the migratory activity of pre-malignant breast epithelial cells. Using null and knock-down cells and overexpression models, we also show that regulation of breast cancer cell migration in two- and three-dimensional matrices by vimentin is Axl- dependent and that Axl functionally contributes to lung extravasation of breast cancer cells in mice. In conclusion, our data show that vimentin functionally contributes to EMT and is required for induction of Axl expression. Moreover, these results provide a molecular explanation for vimentin-dependent cancer cell migration during EMT by identifying Axl as a key proximal component in this process.

10964	19761116	Potentiometric determination of ionizations at the active site of papain.	The ionization behavior of groups at the active site of papain was determined from the pH dependence of the difference of proton content of papain and the methylthio derivative of the thiol group at the active site of papain (papain-S-SCH3). This difference in proton content was determined directly by two independent methods. One method involved potentiometric measurements of the protons released and demethylthiolation of papain-S-SCH3 with dithiothreitol, as a function of pH. The other method involved analogous measurements of the protons released on methylthiolation of papain with methyl methanethiosulfonate. The methylthio pH-difference titrations generated by these measurements indicate that ionization of the thiol group at the active site of papain is linked to the ionization of His-159. The pK of the thiol group changes from 3.3 to 7.6 on deprotonation of His-159 at 29 degrees C/20.05. Similarly, the pK of His-159 shifts from 4.3 to 8.5 when the active site thiol group is deprotonated. The microscopic ionization constants determined in this work for Cys-25 and His-159 indicate that equilibrium constant for transfer of the proton from Cys-25 to His-159 is 8--12, and that in the physiological pH range the active site thiol group exists mainly as a thiol anion.

17582071	20070622	The HBV drug entecavir - effects on HIV-1 replication and resistance.	Entecavir, a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, is not believed to inhibit replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) at clinically relevant doses. We observed that entecavir led to a consistent 1-log(10) decrease in HIV-1 RNA in three persons with HIV-1 and HBV coinfection, and we obtained supportive in vitro evidence that entecavir is a potent partial inhibitor of HIV-1 replication. Detailed analysis showed that in one of these patients, entecavir monotherapy led to an accumulation of HIV-1 variants with the lamivudine-resistant mutation, M184V. In vitro experiments showed that M184V confers resistance to entecavir. Until more is known about HIV-1-resistance patterns and their selection by entecavir, caution is needed with the use of entecavir in persons with HIV-1 and HBV coinfection who are not receiving fully suppressive antiretroviral regimens.

11232004	20010307	Early-onset type 2 diabetes: metabolic and genetic characterization in the mexican population.	The objective of this study was to investigate possible defects in the insulin sensitivity and/or the acute insulin response in a group of Mexican patients displaying early-onset type 2 diabetes and to evaluate the contribution of mutations in three of the genes linked to maturity-onset diabetes of the young. We studied 40 Mexican patients with an age of diagnosis between 20 and 40 yr in which the insulin sensitivity as well as the insulin secretory response were measured using the minimal model approach. A partial screening for possible mutations in 3 of the 5 genes linked to maturity-onset diabetes of the young was carried out by PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. A low insulin secretory capacity (AIRg = 68.5 +/- 5 muU/mL.min) and a near-normal insulin sensitivity (3.43 +/- 0.2 min/muU.mL x 10(4)) were found in these patients. Among this group we found two individuals carrying missense mutations in exon 4 of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-4alpha) gene (Asp(126)--&gt;His/Tyr and Arg(154)--&gt;Gln, respectively) and one carrying a nonsense mutation in exon 7 of the HNF-1alpha gene (Gln(486)--&gt;stop codon); 7.5% had positive titers for glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies. Thirty-five percent of cases had insulin resistance; these subjects had the lipid abnormalities seen in the metabolic syndrome. A defect in insulin secretion is the hallmark in Mexican diabetic patients diagnosed between 20 and 40 yr of age. Mutations in either the HNF-1alpha or the HNF-4alpha genes are present among the individuals who develop early-onset diabetes in our population. These particular sequence changes have not been previously reported and therefore represent putative new mutations. Even in the absence of endogenous hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance is associated with an adverse lipid profile. 	J._Clin._Endocrinol._Metab.	D016428 D013485
16838077	20060714	Seven cases of Pompe disease from Greece.	We present seven cases of Pompe disease (McKusick 232300; glycogen storage disease type II; acid maltase deficiency) from Greece. The onset of symptoms varied from early childhood to late adulthood, and the patients had quite variable duration of disease. All but one of them had muscle weakness and all had mildly to highly elevated serum creatine kinase. The diagnosis in all cases was confirmed by the finding of acid alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.3/20) deficiency in cultured skin fibroblasts. Thirteen mutant alleles were identified and nine different pathogenic mutations were encountered. Four were new: c.2071_2072insAGCCG leads to frameshift and total loss of function; c.1856G &gt; A (p.Ser619Asn) leads to 90-95% loss of function; and the splice-site mutations c.1552-3C &gt; G and c.2331+4A &gt; G reduce the number of correct splicing events by more than 90%. The splice-site mutation c.-32-13T &gt; G (IVS1-13T &gt; G) was encountered four times and seems equally common among Greek and other caucasians. The other mutations: c.925G &gt; A (p.Gly309Arg), c.[307T &gt; G; 271G &gt; A] (p.Cys103Gly; Asp91Asn), c.271del and c.1655T &gt; C (p.Leu552Pro) have been reported earlier.

20603624	20100707	Altered activity-rest patterns in mice with a human autosomal-dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy mutation in the ?2 nicotinic receptor.	High-affinity nicotinic receptors containing ?2 subunits (?2*) are widely expressed in the brain, modulating many neuronal processes and contributing to neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. Mutations in both the ?4 and ?2 subunits are associated with a rare partial epilepsy, autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE). In this study, we introduced one such human missense mutation into the mouse genome to generate a knock-in strain carrying a valine-to-leucine mutation ?2V287L. ?2(V287L) mice were viable and born at an expected Mendelian ratio. Surprisingly, mice did not show an overt seizure phenotype; however, homozygous mice did show significant alterations in their activity-rest patterns. This was manifest as an increase in activity during the light cycle suggestive of disturbances in the normal sleep patterns of mice; a parallel phenotype to that found in human ADNFLE patients. Consistent with the role of nicotinic receptors in reward pathways, we found that ?2(V287L) mice did not develop a normal proclivity to voluntary wheel running, a model for natural reward. Anxiety-related behaviors were also affected by the V287L mutation. Mutant mice spent more time in the open arms on the elevated plus maze suggesting that they had reduced levels of anxiety. Together, these findings emphasize several important roles of ?2* nicotinic receptors in complex biological processes including the activity-rest cycle, natural reward and anxiety.

21956465	20110930	Association of polymorphic G1934A variant (allele *4) of CYP2D6 gene with increased risk of breast cancer development in Ukrainian women.	Breast cancer (BC) is among the most common oncologic pathology in economically developed countries where it afflicts nearly 10% of women. Polymorphism of CYP 2D6 gene is shown to be associated with increased risk of development of a number of pathologies, in particular cancer. The work was directed on evaluation of the role of polymorphism G1934A (allele *4) of CYP 2D6 gene in elevated risk of BC development in Ukrainian women. In the study there were enrolled 85 patients (group ?) with histologically verified BC diagnosis of stages I and ??. Clinical-genealogic study has been performed by the method of patient survey and following analysis of genealogy. Earlier obtained data on the frequency of genotypes and alleles of CYP 2D6 gene in 637 Ukrainian people have been used as a control. For determination of allele variant *4 (G1934A) of CYP 2D6 gene the method of PCR-RFLP has been used. An increased risk of BC development in hereditary tainted patients with genotype *4*4 of CYP 2D6 gene compared to the control group has been revealed. The frequency of *1*4 (IM) genotype has been found to be increased in the group of women with a family history of cancer (41.79%). Significant difference between the frequency of *1*1 (??) and *1*4 (??) genotypes in females with PR-positive and PR-negative tumors in the group of hereditary tainted patients has been registered. In conclusion, our study has revealed an increased risk of BC development in hereditary tainted patients compared to control group with genotype *4*4 (??). 	Exp._Oncol.	D016428
8073037	19940501	The use of alanine scanning mutagenesis to determine the role of the N-terminus of the regulatory chain in the heterotropic mechanism of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase.	The location of the first seven residues of the regulatory chain of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase has been identified by X-ray crystallography to be near the binding site of the regulatory nucleotides. In order to determine the function of the N-terminus of the regulatory chain of aspartate transcarbamoylase in heterotropic regulation, alanine scanning mutagenesis was used. Specifically, Thr2r, His3r, Asp4r, Asn5r, Lys6r and Leu7r were each replaced with alanine. Analyses of these mutant enzymes indicate that none of these substitutions significantly alter the catalytic properties of the enzyme. However, three of the mutant enzymes, Asp4r--&gt;Ala, Lys6r--&gt;Ala and Leu7r--&gt;Ala, exhibited notable changes in their response to the regulatory nucleotides, while mutations at Thr2r, His3r and Asn5r exhibited only minor changes in their heterotropic responses. For the Asp4r--&gt;Ala enzyme, the responses to ATP and CTP were reduced approximately 30 and 40% respectively, compared with the wild-type enzyme. For the Lys6r--&gt;Ala enzyme, the response to ATP was reduced approximately 70%, while the CTP response was reduced approximately 50%. In the case of the Leu7r--&gt;Ala enzyme, a 30 and 20% reduction in response to ATP and CTP respectively, was observed. The synergistic inhibition by UTP in the presence of CTP for the Lys6r--&gt;Ala enzyme was reduced approximately 40% compared with that of the wild type enzyme. For the Leu7r--&gt;Ala enzyme, the synergistic inhibition was abolished. In addition, UTP decreased the CTP binding affinity of the Leu7r--&gt;Ala enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) 	Protein_Eng.	D016428 D013487
19772445	20090924	Efficacy and safety of AIR inhaled insulin compared to insulin lispro in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus in a 6-month, randomized, noninferiority trial.	Patients with type 1 diabetes may prefer features of AIR inhaled insulin (developed by Alkermes, Inc. [Cambridge, MA] and Eli Lilly and Company [Indianapolis, IN]; AIR is a registered trademark of Alkermes, Inc.) over insulin injection, but the two methods need to be compared for efficacy and safety. This multicenter, 6-month, parallel-group, noninferiority trial had 500 patients with type 1 diabetes randomized to morning doses of basal insulin glargine plus either preprandial injectable insulin lispro or preprandial AIR insulin. We hypothesized that AIR insulin is noninferior (upper bound of the 95% confidence interval &lt; or = 0.4%) to insulin lispro for change-from-baseline hemoglobin A1C (A1C). Baseline A1C was 7.95 +/- 0.08% for both groups. At end point, A1C was lower with insulin lispro than with AIR insulin by 0.27% (95% confidence interval 0.11, 0.43; P&lt; 0.001). Noninferiority of AIR insulin to insulin lispro was not demonstrated, but similar percentages of patients in each group achieved A1C &lt;7.0% (P = 0.448). Overall daily blood glucose was similar between groups at baseline (P = 0.879) and end point (P = 0.161). Two-hour postprandial blood glucose change from baseline was significantly (P &lt; 0.001) higher with AIR insulin (20.77 +/- 4.33 mg/dL at 3 months and 15.85 +/- 3.08 mg/dL at end point) than with insulin lispro (3.29 +/- 4.14 mg/dL at 3 months and 1.67 +/- 2.91 mg/dL at end point). Overall hypoglycemia was similar between treatment groups (P = 0.355). The AIR insulin group had greater decrease in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide at end point (P = 0.020) and greater incidence of cough (P = 0.024) and dyspnea (P = 0.030). Body weight decreased in the AIR insulin group and increased in the insulin lispro group. Insulin lispro provided lower A1C than AIR insulin, but the difference may not be clinically relevant.

22216894	20120106	Combination therapy with insulin glargine and exenatide: real-world outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.	To investigate the real-world use of combination insulin glargine/exenatide therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and associated treatment persistence and glycemic control. In this retrospective study, data were extracted from a national US insurance claims database for patients with T2DM for whom insulin glargine and exenatide were co-prescribed in differing order: insulin glargine added after exenatide (EXE+); exenatide added after insulin glargine (GLA+); glargine and exenatide initiated together (GLA?+?EXE). Patients had continuous health plan coverage for 6 months pre- (baseline) and 1-year post-index (follow-up). A total of 453 patients were eligible for analysis: 141 patients were included in the EXE+?cohort, 281 in the GLA+?cohort, and 31 in the GLA?+?EXE cohort. There were significant differences between the groups at baseline, including a significantly lower A1C in the GLA+?versus the EXE+?cohort (p?=?0.0023). Around one third of patients stayed on both drugs up until the end of the follow-up period (GLA+: 30.2%; EXE+: 29.0%; GLA?+?EXE: 29.0%). However, more patients stayed on insulin glargine than on exenatide in each cohort. Significant A1C reductions were observed in each of the cohorts at follow-up: GLA+: -0.4%; EXE+: -0.9%; GLA?+?EXE: -1.2%; p?&lt;?0.01, and were significantly higher in the GLA?+?EXE and EXE+?cohorts than in the GLA+?cohort (p?=?0.03 and p?=?0.002, respectively). The mean number of hypoglycemic events increased slightly from baseline but remained low in each of the cohorts (GLA+: 0.12 to 1.42; EXE+: 0.09 to 1.04; GLA?+?EXE: 0.23 to 1.87 per patient, all p?&gt;?0.1). Combined therapy with insulin glargine and exenatide resulted in A1C reductions in T2DM patients with poor glycemic control without a significantly increased risk of hypoglycemia irrespective of treatment order. Limitations of this study are the between-cohort differences at baseline, lack of a comparator group, and small n number, particularly in the GLA?+?EXE cohort. 	Curr_Med_Res_Opin	D016430 D016428
27173636	20160514	Identification of P-Rex1 as an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrogenic target for pulmonary fibrosis.	Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) leads to progressive and often irreversible loss of lung functions, posing a health threat with no effective cure. We examined P-Rex1, a PI3K- and G protein ??-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) of the Rac small GTPase, for its potential involvement in PF. In a bleomycin-induced PF model, mice deficient in p-rex1 had well-preserved alveolar structure and survived significantly better than their wild type (WT) littermates. The p-rex1(-/-) mice expressed significantly less proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and had reduced leukocyte infiltration in the lung tissue than their WT littermates. P-Rex1 was detected in lung fibroblasts of WT mice, and its genetic deletion attenuated TGF?-1-stimulated lung fibroblast migration, Rac1 activation and p38 MAPK phosphorylation. The p-rex1(-/-) mice showed significantly reduced pathological changes including the expression of ?-smooth muscle actin, fibronectin and TGF?-1 compared with their WT controls. Expression of a GEF-deficient P-Rex1 mutant effectively blocked Smads-dependent transcriptional activation, suggesting that P-Rex1 is a downstream mediator of TGF?-1 signaling. These findings identify P-Rex1 as a novel player of PF, suggesting that targeting P-Rex1 may simultaneously block the inflammatory and fibrogenic processes of PF. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
26852331	20160208	Protein import complexes in the mitochondrial outer membrane of Amoebozoa representatives.	An ancestral trait of eukaryotic cells is the presence of mitochondria as an essential element for function and survival. Proper functioning of mitochondria depends on the import of nearly all proteins that is performed by complexes located in both mitochondrial membranes. The complexes have been proposed to contain subunits formed by proteins common to all eukaryotes and additional subunits regarded as lineage specific. Since Amoebozoa is poorly sampled for the complexes we investigated the outer membrane complexes, namely TOM, TOB/SAM and ERMES complexes, using available genome and transcriptome sequences, including transcriptomes assembled by us. The results indicate differences in the organization of the Amoebozoa TOM, TOB/SAM and ERMES complexes, with the TOM complex appearing to be the most diverse. This is reflected by differences in the number of involved subunits and in similarities to the cognate proteins of representatives from different supergroups of eukaryotes. The obtained results clearly demonstrate structural variability/diversity of these complexes in the Amoebozoa lineage and the reduction of their complexity as compared with the same complexes of model organisms.

7925677	19940401	Autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa caused by the threonine-17-methionine rhodopsin mutation: retinal histopathology and immunocytochemistry.	The retinas from a 68-year-old man with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa caused by the threonine-17-methionine rhodopsin mutation were studied. Patients with this mutation have a characteristic clinical phenotype that shows intra- and interfamilial consistency. The retinas were examined by light and electron microscopy, including immunocytochemistry with markers for rods, cones, the retinal pigment epithelium, the interphotoreceptor matrix and M?ller cells, and the results were correlated with those from visual function tests performed fourteen months before death. Grossly, both retinas had heavy deposits of bone spicule-like pigmentation inferiorly, but the superior retinas showed much less pigmentation. The maculas contained no rods and an incomplete monolayer of cone somata, consistent with the patient's severely reduced central vision. The inferior retinas contained no rods and rare cone somata, correlating with an absolute scotoma in the superior field. The superior retinas had near-normal-appearing rods and cones in the far periphery and a gradient from the midperipheral to central retina of progressively shortened outer segments and loss of photoreceptors, consistent with the patient's reduced rod and cone electroretinograms and retained rod and cone sensitivities in the inferior peripheral field by perimetry. Immunocytochemistry with rod-specific markers was qualitatively normal in the superior mid to far peripheral retina. Electron microscopic immunogold labeling with anti-rhodopsin revealed similar densities of gold particles over rod outer segments of the RP and a normal donor retina. Degenerate photoreceptors in the superior equatorial region of the RP retina had short outer segments, and some rods had surface labeling with anti-rhodopsin of the inner segments, somata and synapses. The results indicate regional retinal differences of disease severity in this genotype and that rods in the superior peripheral retina have normal morphology despite the presence of the mutant allele. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first detailed study of rod photoreceptors in the retina of an RP patient with a rhodopsin mutation. 	Exp._Eye_Res.	D016428 D013485 D013487
23440732	20130227	GSK-3? polymorphism discriminates bipolar disorder and schizophrenia: a systematic meta-analysis.	Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is a well-known conserved and ubiquitous protein kinase and playing a pivotal role in neurodevelopment, neurogenesis, learning/memory, and neuronal cell death. Dysfunction of GSK-3 had been seen in multiple neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two common psychiatric diseases first occur in adolescence or young adulthood. They share similar risk genes as well as clinical symptoms, which make it is difficult to be discriminated from each other. Here, by using meta-analysis we reported that glycogen synthase kinase 3? promoter inactive mutant rs334558 may contribute to the development of schizophrenia not bipolar disorder. This might be used to distinguish these two diseases. 	Mol._Neurobiol.	D016428 D017418 D013485
25519399	20141219	A penalized linear mixed model for genomic prediction using pedigree structures.	Genetic Analysis Workshop 18 provided a platform for evaluating genomic prediction power based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms from single-nucleotide polymorphism array data and sequencing data. Also, Genetic Analysis Workshop 18 provided a diverse pedigree structure to be explored in prediction. In this study, we attempted to combine pedigree information with single-nucleotide polymorphism data to predict systolic blood pressure. Our results suggested that the prediction power based on pedigree information only could be unsatisfactory. Using additional information such as single-nucleotide polymorphism genotypes would improve prediction accuracy. In particular, the improvement can be significant when there exist a few single-nucleotide polymorphisms with relatively larger effect sizes. We also compared the prediction performance based on genome-wide association study data (ie, common variants) and sequencing data (ie, common variants plus low-frequency variants). The experimental result showed that inclusion of low frequency variants could not lead to improvement of prediction accuracy. 	BMC_Proc	D016428

23861206	20130718	Triple A syndrome in Japan.	Triple A syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease, characterized by esophageal achalasia, alacrima, and adrenal insufficiency, as well as involvement of the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems. This disease mimics amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in some patients. The causative gene encodes ALADIN, a nuclear pore complex (NPC) component. Only 5 patients have been reported in Japan. We conducted the first nationwide survey of triple A syndrome. Identified mutants were expressed as GFP-fusion proteins in cultured cells. Two new patients were identified, and 1 had a novel mutation (p.Ser182fsX19). All mutant proteins tested were mislocalized from NPC to cytoplasm. The most consistent neurological manifestation of triple A syndrome in Japanese patients was progressive bulbospinal muscular atrophy with both upper and lower motor neuron involvement, which mimicked motor neuron disease, similar to that seen in patients in Western countries. The identification of the new patients suggests that more cases are undiagnosed in Japan. 	Muscle_Nerve	D016428 D013485
20136632	20100209	Insertion of an NPVY sequence into the cytosolic domain of the erythropoietin receptor selectively affects erythropoietin-mediated signalling and function.	EPO (erythropoietin), the major hormone regulating erythropoiesis, functions via activation of its cell-surface receptor (EPO-R) present on erythroid progenitor cells. One of the most striking properties of EPO-R is its low expression on the cell surface, as opposed to its high intracellular levels. The low cell-surface expression of EPO-R may thus limit the efficacy of EPO that is routinely used to treat primary and secondary anaemia. In a recent study [Nahari, Barzilay, Hirschberg and Neumann (2008) Biochem. J. 410, 409-416] we have shown that insertion of an NPVY sequence into the intracellular domain of EPO-R increases its cell-surface expression. In the present study we demonstrate that this NPVY EPO-R insert has a selective effect on EPO-mediated downstream signalling in Ba/F3 cells expressing this receptor (NPVY-EPO-R). This is monitored by increased phosphorylation of the NPVY-EPO-R (on Tyr479), Akt, JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) and ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2), but not STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5), as compared with cells expressing wild-type EPO-R. This enhanced signalling is reflected in augmented proliferation at low EPO levels (0.05 units/ml) and protection against etoposide-induced apoptosis. Increased cell-surface levels of NPVY-EPO-R are most probably not sufficient to mediate these effects as the A234E-EPO-R mutant that is expressed at high cell-surface levels does not confer an augmented response to EPO. Taken together, we demonstrate that insertion of an NPVY sequence into the cytosolic domain of the EPO-R confers not only improved maturation, but also selectively affects EPO-mediated signalling resulting in an improved responsiveness to EPO reflected in cell proliferation and protection against apoptosis.

16678104	20060509	Interaction between c-Abl and Arg tyrosine kinases and proteasome subunit PSMA7 regulates proteasome degradation.	Proteasome-mediated proteolysis is a primary protein degradation pathway in cells. The present study demonstrates that c-Abl and Arg (abl-related gene) tyrosine kinases associate with and phosphorylate the proteasome PSMA7 (alpha4) subunit at Tyr-153. Consequently, proteasome-dependent proteolysis is compromised. Notably, cells expressing a phosphorylation mutant of PSMA7(Y153F) display impaired G1/S transition and S/G2 progression, highlighting the biological significance of tyrosine phosphorylation of a proteasome subunit as an important cellular regulatory control.

22915837	20120824	Meta-analysis of general bacterial subclades in whole-genome phylogenies using tree topology profiling.	In the last two decades, a large number of whole-genome phylogenies have been inferred to reconstruct the Tree of Life (ToL). Underlying data models range from gene or functionality content in species to phylogenetic gene family trees and multiple sequence alignments of concatenated protein sequences. Diversity in data models together with the use of different tree reconstruction techniques, disruptive biological effects and the steadily increasing number of genomes have led to a huge diversity in published phylogenies. Comparison of those and, moreover, identification of the impact of inference properties (underlying data model, inference technique) on particular reconstructions is almost impossible. In this work, we introduce tree topology profiling as a method to compare already published whole-genome phylogenies. This method requires visual determination of the particular topology in a drawn whole-genome phylogeny for a set of particular bacterial clans. For each clan, neighborhoods to other bacteria are collected into a catalogue of generalized alternative topologies. Particular topology alternatives found for an ordered list of bacterial clans reveal a topology profile that represents the analyzed phylogeny. To simulate the inhomogeneity of published gene content phylogenies we generate a set of seven phylogenies using different inference techniques and the SYSTERS-PhyloMatrix data model. After tree topology profiling on in total 54 selected published and newly inferred phylogenies, we separate artefactual from biologically meaningful phylogenies and associate particular inference results (phylogenies) with inference background (inference techniques as well as data models). Topological relationships of particular bacterial species groups are presented. With this work we introduce tree topology profiling into the scientific field of comparative phylogenomics.

1138922	19750530	Haemoglobin Camperdown beta104(G6) arginine leads to serine.	Routine investigation of ante natal patients revealed a subtle change in the electrophoretic pattern on cellulose acetate of the proposita. Further investigations by isoelectric focussing in polyacrylamide gel suggested the presence of two major haemoglobin components. Using a modified cellulose acetate technique globin chain separation revealed an abnormal beta-chain. Chain separation on a carboxymethyl-cellulose column provided a pure sample of the abnormal beta-chain. After amino-ethylation, tryptic digestion and peptide mapping, amino acid analysis of relevant peptides showed the abnormality in the beta-chain to be a substitution of arginine by serine at the 104 position. The presence of a positively charged residue at this position would appear to be necessary for the stabilization of the haemoglobin central cavity. The replacement by serine in this haemoglobin leads to slightly decreased stability but does not appear to affect the oxygen affinity. 	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428
23874141	20130723	Surge of dengue virus infection and chikungunya Fever in bali in 2010: the burden of mosquito-borne infectious diseases in a tourist destination.	Labor flow and travelers are important factors contributing to the spread of Dengue virus infection and chikungunya fever. Bali Province of Indonesia, a popular resort and tourist destination, has these factors and suffers from mosquito-borne infectious diseases. Using area study approach, a series of fieldwork was conducted in Bali to obtain up-to-date primary disease data, to learn more about public health measures, and to interview health officers, hotel personnel, and other resource persons. The national data including information on two other provinces were obtained for comparison. The health ministry reported 5,810 and 11,697 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever in Bali in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Moreover, two densely populated tourist areas and one district have shown a particularly high incidence and sharp increases in 2010. Cases of chikungunya fever reported in Bali more than doubled in 2010 from the previous year. Our findings suggest that Bali can benefit from a significant reduction in vector populations and dissemination of disease preventive knowledge among both local residents and foreign visitors. This will require a concerted and trans-border approach, which may prove difficult in the province. 	Trop_Med_Health	D016428
24687979	20140402	Requirement for A-type cyclin-dependent kinase and cyclins for the terminal division in the stomatal lineage of Arabidopsis.	The Arabidopsis stoma is a specialized epidermal valve made up of a pair of guard cells around a pore whose aperture controls gas exchange between the shoot and atmosphere. Guard cells (GCs) are produced by a symmetric division of guard mother cells (GMCs). The R2R3-MYB transcription factor FOUR LIPS (FLP) and its paralogue MYB88 restrict the division of a GMC to one. Previously, the upstream regions of several core cell cycle genes were identified as the direct targets of FLP/MYB88, including the B-type cyclin-dependent kinase CDKB1;1 and A2-type cyclin CYCA2;3. Here we show that CDKA;1 is also an immediate direct target of FLP/MYB88 through the binding to cis-regulatory elements in the CDKA;1 promoter region. CDKA;1 activity is required not only for normal GMC divisions but also for the excessive cell overproliferation in flp myb88 mutant GMCs. The impaired defects of GMC division in cdkb1;1 1;2 mutants could be partially rescued by a stage-specific expression of CDKA;1. Although targeted overexpression of CDKA;1 does not affect stomatal development, ectopic expression of the D3-type cyclin CYCD3;2 induces GC subdivision, resulting in a stoma with 3-4 GCs instead of the normal two. Co-overexpression of CDKA;1 with CYCD3;2, but not with CYCA2;3, confers a synergistic effect with respect to GC subdivision. Thus, in addition to a role in stomatal formative asymmetric divisions at early developmental stages, CDKA;1 is needed in triggering GMC symmetric divisions at the late stage of stomatal development. However, timely down-regulation of CDKA;1-CYCD3 activity is required for restriction of GC proliferation. 	J._Exp._Bot.	D016428 D013485
9819491	19981120	Helicobacter pylori colonization in infants and young children is not necessarily associated with diarrhoea.	A cohort of 151 infants and young children aged 1-23 months from a poor peri-urban community of Bangladesh was studied to determine the relationship between Helicobacter pylori colonization and morbidity due to diarrhoea. A 13C urea breath test was performed to detect the presence of H. pylori. Children were followed up at home every alternate day for 6 months and diarrhoeal morbidity data were collected. Diarrhoeal morbidity was compared between H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative children. Sixty-eight (45 per cent) children were H. pylori positive and 83 (55 per cent) were H. pylori negative. During the first 1-month period following the breath test, three (4.4 per cent) H. pylori-positive and four (4.8 per cent) H. pylori-negative children had diarrhoea. Thirty-two (47 per cent) of the children in the positive group and 43 (52 per cent) in the negative group had one or more episodes of diarrhoea during the 6-month follow-up period. Median number of diarrhoeal episodes was 1.0 (range 1.0-4.0) in the H. pylori-positive children and 2.0 (range 1.0-5.0) in the H. pylori-negative children (p = 0.19). No significant difference was observed in the cumulative days with diarrhoea. The results of this study suggest that H. pylori colonization is not associated with diarrhoeal morbidity in infants and young children. 	J._Trop._Pediatr.	D016428 D013485
21779355	20110723	Orally active multi-functional antioxidants are neuroprotective in a rat model of light-induced retinal damage.	Progression of age-related macular degeneration has been linked to iron dysregulation and oxidative stress that induce apoptosis of neural retinal cells. Since both antioxidants and chelating agents have been reported to reduce the progression of retinal lesions associated with AMD in experimental animals, the present study evaluates the ability of multi-functional antioxidants containing functional groups that can independently chelate redox metals and quench free radicals to protect the retina against light-induced retinal degeneration, a rat model of dry atrophic AMD. Proof of concept studies were conducted to evaluate the ability of 4-(5-hydroxypyrimidin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethyl-3,5-dioxopiperazine-1-sulfonamide (compound 4) and 4-(5-hydroxy-4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethyl-3,5-dioxopiperazine-1-sulfonamide (compound 8) to reduce retinal damage in 2-week dark adapted Wistar rats exposed to 1000 lx of light for 3 hours. Assessment of the oxidative stress markers 4- hydroxynonenal and nitrotyrosine modified proteins and Thioredoxin by ELISA and Western blots indicated that these compounds reduced the oxidative insult caused by light exposure. The beneficial antioxidant effects of these compounds in providing significant functional and structural protection were confirmed by electroretinography and quantitative histology of the retina. The present study suggests that multi-functional compounds may be effective candidates for preventive therapy of AMD. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061 D013485
9787165	19981027	Detection of a complex that associates with the Bbeta fibrinogen G-455-A polymorphism.	The promoter region of the Bbeta fibrinogen gene containing the polymorphic site (G-455-A) shows an increase in fibrinogen levels for individuals containing an adenine rather than a guanine. Two methods were used to explore the possible functional role of this region. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed using specific DNA probes containing base sequences pertinent to the allelic site. Specific DNA binding proteins were detected and their binding characteristics were determined. Secondly, we placed DNA fragments containing different -455 nucleotide substitutions of the Bbeta promoter upstream of a luciferase reporter gene and transfected them into HepG2 cells to determine their effect on transactivation. An adenine at position -455 resulted in greater luciferase activity than when a guanine was present. UV cross-linking bound protein to the DNA demonstrated a 47-kD protein binding preferentially to the site when a guanine rather than an adenine was present at -455. We hypothesize that a transactivation protein complex associates with the site, but its association is stronger when guanine is present, thereby slowing downstream Bbeta gene transcription. These data provide the first molecular evidence that accounts for the increase in fibrinogen in individuals carrying this allele. 	Blood	D016428 D013485
22885303	20120814	Crystal structures of the Cid1 poly (U) polymerase reveal the mechanism for UTP selectivity.	Polyuridylation is emerging as a ubiquitous post-translational modification with important roles in multiple aspects of RNA metabolism. These poly (U) tails are added by poly (U) polymerases with homology to poly (A) polymerases; nevertheless, the selection for UTP over ATP remains enigmatic. We report the structures of poly (U) polymerase Cid1 from Schizoscaccharomyces pombe alone and in complex with UTP, CTP, GTP and 3'-dATP. These structures reveal that each of the 4?nt can be accommodated at the active site; however, differences exist that suggest how the polymerase selects UTP over the other nucleotides. Furthermore, we find that Cid1 shares a number of common UTP recognition features with the kinetoplastid terminal uridyltransferases. Kinetic analysis of Cid1's activity for its preferred substrates, UTP and ATP, reveal a clear preference for UTP over ATP. Ultimately, we show that a single histidine in the active site plays a pivotal role for poly (U) activity. Notably, this residue is typically replaced by an asparagine residue in Cid1-family poly (A) polymerases. By mutating this histidine to an asparagine residue in Cid1, we diminished Cid1's activity for UTP addition and improved ATP incorporation, supporting that this residue is important for UTP selectivity.

16189114	20050929	High-level chromosomally mediated tetracycline resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae results from a point mutation in the rpsJ gene encoding ribosomal protein S10 in combination with the mtrR and penB resistance determinants.	Neisseria gonorrhoeae becomes resistant to tetracycline by two major mechanisms: expression of a plasmid-encoded TetM protein and mutations in endogenous genes (chromosomally mediated resistance). Early studies by Sparling and colleagues (P. F. Sparling F. A. J. Sarubbi, and E. Blackman, J. Bacteriol. 124:740-749, 1975) demonstrated that three genes were involved in high-level chromosomally mediated tetracycline resistance (MIC of tetracycline &gt; or = 2 microg/ml): ery-2 (now referred to as mtrR), penB, and tet-2. While the identities of the first two genes are known, the tet-2 gene has not been identified. We cloned the tet-2 gene, which confers tetracycline resistance, from tetracycline-resistant clinical isolate N. gonorrhoeae FA6140 and show that resistance is due to a single point mutation (Val-57 to Met) in the rpsJ gene (rpsJ1) encoding ribosomal protein S10. Moreover, the identical mutation was found in six distinct tetracycline-resistant clinical isolates in which the MIC of tetracycline was &gt; or =2 microg/ml. Site-saturation mutagenesis of the codon for Val-57 identified two other amino acids (Leu and Gln) that conferred identical levels of resistance as the Met-57 mutation. The mutation maps to the vertex of a loop in S10 that is near the aminoacyl-tRNA site in the structure of the 30S ribosomal subunit from Thermus thermophilus, and the residue equivalent to Val-57 in T. thermophilus S10, Lys-55, is within 8 to 9 A of bound tetracycline. These data suggest that large noncharged amino acids alter the rRNA structure near the tetracycline-binding site, leading to a lower affinity of the antibiotic. 	Antimicrob._Agents_Chemother.

24983477	20140702	Characterization of the zebrafish homolog of zipper interacting protein kinase.	Zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK) is a conserved vertebrate-specific regulator of actomyosin contractility in smooth muscle and non-muscle cells. Murine ZIPK has undergone an unusual divergence in sequence and regulation compared to other ZIPK orthologs. In humans, subcellular localization is controlled by phosphorylation of threonines 299 and 300. In contrast, ZIPK subcellular localization in mouse and rat is controlled by interaction with PAR-4. We carried out a comparative biochemical characterization of the regulation of the zebrafish ortholog of ZIPK. Like the human orthologs zebrafish ZIPK undergoes nucleocytoplasmic-shuttling and is abundant in the cytoplasm, unlike the primarily nuclear rat ZIPK. Rat ZIPK, but not human or zebrafish ZIPK, interacts with zebrafish PAR-4. Mutation of the conserved residues required for activation of the mammalian orthologs abrogated activity of the zebrafish ZIPK. In contrast to the human ortholog, mutation of threonine 299 and 300 in the zebrafish ZIPK has no effect on the activity or subcellular localization. Thus, we found that zebrafish ZIPK functions in a manner most similar to the human ZIPK and quite distinct from murine orthologs, yet the regulation of subcellular localization is not conserved.

Toehold-mediated strand displacement is often used in solution to drive synthetic nanomachines made from DNA, but the effects of surface-immobilization on the mechanism and kinetics of this reaction have not yet been fully elucidated. Here we show that the kinetics of strand displacement in surface-immobilized nanomachines are significantly different to those of the solution phase reaction, and we attribute this to the effects of intermolecular interactions within the DNA layer. We demonstrate that the dynamics of strand displacement can be manipulated by changing strand length, concentration and G/C content. By inserting mismatched bases it is also possible to tune the rates of the constituent displacement processes (toehold-binding and branch migration) independently, and information can be encoded in the time-dependence of the overall reaction. Our findings will facilitate the rational design of surface-immobilized dynamic DNA nanomachines, including computing devices and track-based motors. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
26157398	20150710	New perspectives for motivating better decisions in older adults.	Decision-making competence in later adulthood is affected by declines in cognitive skills, and age-related changes in affect and experience can sometimes compensate. However, recent findings suggest that age-related changes in motivation also affect the extent to which adults draw from experience, affect, and deliberative skills when making decisions. To date, relatively little attention has been given to strategies for addressing age-related changes in motivation to promote better decisions in older adults. To address this limitation, we draw from diverse literatures to suggest promising intervention strategies for motivating older recipients' motivation to make better decisions. We start by reviewing the life-span developmental literature, which suggests that older adults' motivation to put effort into decisions depends on the perceived personal relevance of decisions as well as their self-efficacy (i.e., confidence in applying their ability and knowledge). Next, we discuss two approaches from the health intervention design literature, the mental models approach and the patient activation approach, which aim to improve motivation for decision making by improving personal relevance or by building self-efficacy or confidence to use new information and skills. Using examples from these literatures, we discuss how to construct interventions to motivate good decisions in later adulthood. 	Front_Psychol	D016428 D016454
18004208	20071116	Predictive role of coagulation-balance gene polymorphisms in the efficacy of photodynamic therapy with verteporfin for classic choroidal neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration.	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) represents the leading cause of blindness in Western populations. The majority of severe vision loss occurs in the exudative form of AMD, characterized by the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) beneath the fovea. Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (PDT-V) represents one of the most largely employed modality that maybe achieves the subfoveal CNV inactivation in AMD patients. Although several ocular factors have been hitherto investigated as predictors, these researches have weakly contributed to PDT-V optimization. As PDT-V benefit is determined by CNV photothrombosis, we have retrospectively studied several coagulation-balance gene polymorphisms as predictors of PDT-V efficacy. Ninety Caucasian patients with neovascular AMD were subdivided in responder and nonresponder, on the basis of CNV responsiveness to PDT-V application. Six gene polymorphisms, that is factor V G1691A, prothrombin G20210A, factor XIII-A G185T, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T, methionine synthase A2756G, and methionine synthase reductase A66G, were genotyped in the entire cohort. Logistic regression models showed that PDT-V responders were more prevalent within patients with prothrombin G20210A mutation [odds ratio (OR)=5.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.2, 27.2), P=0.03], and within methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677T carriers [OR=6.9, 95% CI (2.7, 18.1), P&lt;0.001]. Conversely, PDT-V nonresponders were overrepresented in carriers for factor XIII-A 185T [OR=0.13, 95% CI (0.05, 0.36), P&lt;0.001]. These results provide evidences for the presence of pharmacogenetic relationship between peculiar coagulation-balance gene polymorphisms and different levels of PDT-V effectiveness in patients with AMD-related CNV.

18393252	20080409	[Mutation screening of MLH1 and MSH2 genes in two Chinese families with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer].	To identify the MLH1 and MSH2 gene mutation in two hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) families. Polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing were used to screen for MLH1 and MSH2 gene mutation, and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing were performed to confirm the mutation. By DNA sequencing, a novel mutation of c.243_244insA located at the exon 3 of MLH1 gene was detected in family A, while c.1215_1218dupCCGA mutation located at the exon 7 of MSH2 gene was detected in family B. These two mutations can cause the formation of premature proteins. The novel mutations c.243_244insA in MLH1 gene and c.1215_1218dupCCGA in MSH2 gene were the disease-causing mutations in the two HNPCC families. 	Zhonghua_Yi_Xue_Yi_Chuan_Xue_Za_Zhi	D016428
21187979	20101229	Olfactory stem cells, a new cellular model for studying molecular mechanisms underlying familial dysautonomia.	Familial dysautonomia (FD) is a hereditary neuropathy caused by mutations in the IKBKAP gene, the most common of which results in variable tissue-specific mRNA splicing with skipping of exon 20. Defective splicing is especially severe in nervous tissue, leading to incomplete development and progressive degeneration of sensory and autonomic neurons. The specificity of neuron loss in FD is poorly understood due to the lack of an appropriate model system. To better understand and modelize the molecular mechanisms of IKBKAP mRNA splicing, we collected human olfactory ecto-mesenchymal stem cells (hOE-MSC) from FD patients. hOE-MSCs have a pluripotent ability to differentiate into various cell lineages, including neurons and glial cells. We confirmed IKBKAP mRNA alternative splicing in FD hOE-MSCs and identified 2 novel spliced isoforms also present in control cells. We observed a significant lower expression of both IKBKAP transcript and IKAP/hELP1 protein in FD cells resulting from the degradation of the transcript isoform skipping exon 20. We localized IKAP/hELP1 in different cell compartments, including the nucleus, which supports multiple roles for that protein. We also investigated cellular pathways altered in FD, at the genome-wide level, and confirmed that cell migration and cytoskeleton reorganization were among the processes altered in FD. Indeed, FD hOE-MSCs exhibit impaired migration compared to control cells. Moreover, we showed that kinetin improved exon 20 inclusion and restores a normal level of IKAP/hELP1 in FD hOE-MSCs. Furthermore, we were able to modify the IKBKAP splicing ratio in FD hOE-MSCs, increasing or reducing the WT (exon 20 inclusion):MU (exon 20 skipping) ratio respectively, either by producing free-floating spheres, or by inducing cells into neural differentiation. hOE-MSCs isolated from FD patients represent a new approach for modeling FD to better understand genetic expression and possible therapeutic approaches. This model could also be applied to other neurological genetic diseases. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
20880125	20101001	Origin and spread of a common deletion causing mucolipidosis type II: insights from patterns of haplotypic diversity.	Mucolipidosis II (ML II alpha/beta), or I-cell disease, is a rare genetic disease in which activity of the uridine diphosphate (UDP)-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-phosphotransferase) is absent. GlcNAc-phosphotransferase is a multimeric enzyme encoded by two genes, GNPTAB and GNPTG. A spectrum of mutations in GNPTAB has been recently reported to cause ML II alpha/beta. Most of these mutations were found to be private or rare. However, the mutation c.3503_3504delTC has been detected among Israeli and Palestinian Arab-Muslim, Turkish, Canadian, Italian, Portuguese, Irish traveller and US patients. We analysed 44 patients who were either homozygous or compound heterozygous for this deletion (22 Italians, 8 Arab-Muslims, 1 Turk, 3 Argentineans, 3 Brazilians, 2 Irish travellers and 5 Portuguese) and 16 carriers (15 Canadians and 1 Italian) for three intragenic polymorphisms: c.-41_-39delGGC, c.18G&gt;A and c.1932A&gt;G as well as two microsatellite markers flanking the GNPTAB gene (D12S1607 and D12S1727). We identified a common haplotype in all chromosomes bearing the c.3503_3504delTC mutation. In summary, we showed that patients carrying the c.3503_3504delTC deletion presented with a common haplotype, which implies a common origin of this mutation. Additionally, the level of diversity observed at the most distant locus indicates that the mutation is relatively ancient (around 2063 years old), and the geographical distribution further suggests that it probably arose in a peri-Mediterranean region.

23095170	20121026	High yield derivation of enriched glutamatergic neurons from suspension-cultured mouse ESCs for neurotoxicology research.	Recently, there has been a strong emphasis on identifying an in vitro model for neurotoxicity research that combines the biological relevance of primary neurons with the scalability, reproducibility and genetic tractability of continuous cell lines. Derived neurons should be homotypic, exhibit neuron-specific gene expression and morphology, form functioning synapses and consistently respond to neurotoxins in a fashion indistinguishable from primary neurons. However, efficient methods to produce neuronal populations that are suitable alternatives to primary neurons have not been available. With the objective of developing a more facile, robust and efficient method to generate enriched glutamatergic neuronal cultures, we evaluated the neurogenic capacity of three mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines (R1, C57BL/6 and D3) adapted to feeder-independent suspension culture. Neurogenesis and neuronal maturation were characterized as a function of time in culture using immunological, genomic, morphological and functional metrics. The functional responses of ESNs to neurotropic toxins with distinctly different targets and mechanisms of toxicity, such as glutamate, ?-latrotoxin (LTX), and botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), were also evaluated. Suspension-adapted ESCs expressed markers of pluripotency through at least 30 passages, and differentiation produced 97?106 neural progenitor cells (NPCs) per 10-cm dish. Greater than 99% of embryonic stem cell-derived neurons (ESNs) expressed neuron-specific markers by 96 h after plating and rapidly developed complex axodendritic arbors and appropriate compartmentalization of neurotypic proteins. Expression profiling demonstrated the presence of transcripts necessary for neuronal function and confirmed that ESN populations were predominantly glutamatergic. Furthermore, ESNs were functionally receptive to all toxins with sensitivities and responses consistent with primary neurons. These findings demonstrate a cost-effective, scalable and flexible method to produce a highly enriched glutamatergic neuron population. The functional characterization of pathophysiological responses to neurotropic toxins and the compatibility with multi-well plating formats were used to demonstrate the suitability of ESNs as a discovery platform for molecular mechanisms of action, moderate-throughput analytical approaches and diagnostic screening. Furthermore, for the first time we demonstrate a cell-based model that is sensitive to all seven BoNT serotypes with EC50 values comparable to those reported in primary neuron populations. These data providing compelling evidence that ESNs offer a neuromimetic platform suitable for the evaluation of molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity. 	BMC_Neurosci	D016428 D013485
23519598	20130323	Quantifying the effect of covariates on concentrations and effects of steady-state phenprocoumon using a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model.	The oral anticoagulant phenprocoumon, similar to other vitamin K antagonists, is characterized by pronounced interindividual variability in the doses needed to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. Previous studies assessed the effect of genetic and demographic covariates on empirical dose requirements of phenprocoumon to enable individualized dose prediction. The aim of the present study was to quantify major sources of interindividual variability separately on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of phenprocoumon using a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. A single steady-state blood sample was collected from 278 patients and assayed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for phenprocoumon and its metabolites. Genotyping was performed for variants of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 (CYP2C9) and vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1 (VKORC1) genes. Effects were quantified by international normalized ratio (INR). Data were analyzed simultaneously using NONMEM VII. The model confirmed CYP2C9 and VKORC1 variants as the major predictors of variability in phenprocoumon concentrations and effects, together with body weight, age, comedication with CYP3A modifiers (i.e. inhibitors or inducers) and presence of atrial fibrillation. These covariates explained 50.0 % of the observed variability in the model parameters. Phenprocoumon clearance fractions mediated per CYP2C9 allele were 13.4, 9.5 and 5.7 mL/h for the 1, 2 and 3 variants, respectively. An additional clearance fraction of 5.3 mL/h was independent of CYP2C9 activity. Homozygous VKORC1 wild-type carriers were estimated to have a 2.13-fold higher phenprocoumon exposure requirement than homozygous 1173 C&gt;T carriers to achieve the same effect on INR. The model provides a deeper insight in the separate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parts of phenprocoumon action. Thus, it provides important information for individualized dose prediction, with the option to include further covariates not studied here with known effects on individual pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic processes.

24133613	20131018	Impact of Korean pine nut oil on weight gain and immune responses in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.	Korean pine nut oil (PNO) has been reported to have favorable effects on lipid metabolism and appetite control. We investigated whether PNO consumption could influence weight gain, and whether the PNO-induced effect would result in an improvement of immune function in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. C57BL/6 mice were fed control diets with 10% energy fat from either PNO or soybean oil (SBO), or HFDs with 45% energy fat from 10% PNO or SBO and 35% lard, 20% PNO or SBO and 25% lard, or 30% PNO or SBO and 15% lard for 12 weeks. The proliferative responses of splenocytes upon stimulation with concanavalin A (Con A) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Con A-stimulated production of interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon (IFN)-?, and LPS-stimulated production of IL-6, IL-1?, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by splenocytes were determined. Consumption of HFDs containing PNO resulted in significantly less weight gain (17% less, P &lt; 0.001), and lower weight gain was mainly due to less white adipose tissue (18% less, P = 0.001). The reduction in weight gain did not result in the overall enhancement in splenocyte proliferation. Overall, PNO consumption resulted in a higher production of IL-1? (P = 0.04). Replacement of SBO with PNO had no effect on the production of IL-2, IFN-?, IL-6, or PGE2 in mice fed with either the control diets or HFDs. In conclusion, consumption of PNO reduced weight gain in mice fed with HFD, but this effect did not result in the overall improvement in immune responses. 	Nutr_Res_Pract	D016428
26242695	20150806	Site-directed Mutagenesis of Key Residues Unveiled a Novel Allosteric Site on Human Adenosine Kinase for Pyrrolobenzoxa(thia)zepinone Non-Nucleoside Inhibitors.	Most nucleoside kinases, besides the catalytic domain, feature an allosteric domain which modulates their activity. Generally, non-substrate analogs, interacting with allosteric sites, represent a major opportunity for developing more selective and safer therapeutics. We recently developed a series of non-nucleoside non-competitive inhibitors of human adenosine kinase (hAK), based on a pyrrolobenzoxa(thia)zepinone scaffold. Based on computational analysis, we hypothesized the existence of a novel allosteric site on hAK, topographically distinct from the catalytic site. In this study, we have adopted a multidisciplinary approach including molecular modeling, biochemical studies, and site-directed mutagenesis to validate our hypothesis. Based on a three-dimensional model of interaction between hAK and our molecules, we designed, cloned, and expressed specific, single and double point mutants of hAK (Q74A, Q78A, H107A, K341A, F338A, and Q74A-F338A). Kinetic characterization of recombinant enzymes indicated that these mutations did not affect enzyme functioning; conversely, mutated enzymes are endowed of reduced susceptibility to our non-nucleoside inhibitors, while maintaining comparable affinity for nucleoside inhibitors to the wild-type enzyme. This study represents the first characterization and validation of a novel allosteric site in hAK and may pave the way to the development of novel selective and potent non-nucleoside inhibitors of hAK endowed with therapeutic potential.

16007594	20050712	Mutation analysis of SBDS in pediatric acute myeloblastic leukemia.	Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is associated with a high risk of myelodysplasia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chromosome 7 abnormalities. Ninety percent of SDS patients have mutations in SBDS on 7q11. Herein, we studied the role of genetic alterations in SBDS in AML. DNA was extracted from marrows of SDS patients with AML, as well as from children with de novo AML. Direct sequencing of PCR amplified genomic DNA was performed using specific primers flanking each exon. To study whether SBDS heterozygosity confers a risk for MDS/AML, data on family members of SDS patients on the Canadian Inherited Marrow Failure Registry (CIMFR) was analyzed. Of two SDS patients with SDS/AML one was homozygous 258 + 2T &gt; C, and one was compound heterozygous 183-184TA &gt; CT/258 + 2T &gt; C. To determine whether a subset of patients with SDS can present with AML, we analyzed 48 AML samples at remission, but no mutations were identified. To address whether acquired mutated SBDS gene is associated with leukemic transformation in de novo AML, we analyzed 77 AML samples at diagnosis or relapse (4 with -7 and 7q-) for SBDS mutations; no alterations were detected. Also, among the relatives of an SDS patient cohort on the registry no cases of MDS/AML were reported. Common mutations occurred in our SDS patients who develop AML, and thus, AML is not confined to a rare genetic subgroup of SDS. Newly diagnosed patients with AML are unlikely to have an underlying undiagnosed SDS. Acquired SBDS gene mutations also would appear unlikely to play a mechanistic role in de novo AML, and might not be involved in the pathogenesis of chromosome 7 abnormalities as well.

16507567	20060302	Integrin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of protein-tyrosine phosphatase-alpha is required for cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration.	Protein-tyrosine phosphatase-alpha (PTPalpha) activates Src family kinases (SFKs) to promote the integrin-stimulated early autophosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We report here that integrin stimulation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PTPalpha. PTPalpha was dephosphorylated upon fibroblast detachment from the substratum and rephosphorylated when cells were plated on the integrin ligand fibronectin. alpha PTP phosphorylation occurred at Tyr789 and required SFKs (Src or Fyn/Yes), FAK, and an intact cytoskeleton. It also required active PTPalpha or constitutively active Src. These observations indicate that PTPalpha activates SFKs and that the subsequently activated SFK.FAK tyrosine kinase complex in turn phosphorylates PTPalpha. Reintroduction of wild-type PTPalpha or unphosphorylatable PTPalpha(Y789F) (but not inactive PTPalpha) into PTPalpha-null fibroblasts restored defective integrin-induced SFK activation, FAK phosphorylation, and paxillin phosphorylation. PTPalpha(Y789F) and inactive PTPalpha could not rescue delayed actin stress fiber assembly and focal adhesion formation or defective cell migration. This study distinguishes two roles of PTPalpha in integrin signaling: an early role as an activator of SFKs and FAK with no requirement for PTPalpha phosphorylation and a later downstream role in cytoskeleton-associated events for which PTPalpha phosphorylation at Tyr789 is essential.

25500362	20141216	Single-center study under a French Temporary Authorization for Use (TAU) protocol for ipilimumab in metastatic melanoma: negative impact of baseline corticosteroids.	Ipilimumab is an anti-CTLA-4 antibody which has recently been approved in Europe as a monotherapy in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. We report a single-center study among patients treated within a Temporary Authorization for Use (TAU) protocol. We also performed a review of the literature involving expanded access program studies with a focus on factors associated with overall survival (OS). This retrospective, observational study included patients between June 2010 and July 2011 with a diagnosis of non-resectable stage III or IV melanoma with at least one previous line of chemotherapy. Treatment consisted of four courses of ipilimumab at a dose of 3mg/kg every three weeks. 45 patients were included, among whom 23 (51%) had brain metastases. 33 (71%) of the patients completed the induction phase. The best overall response rate (BORR) was 13% and median overall survival (OS) was 8 months (95%CI: 7 to 12). OS was not different between patients with brain metastases at baseline and those without (p = 0.10), regardless of BRAF V600E status (p = 0.61). OS was poorer in patients who were being treated with corticoids at baseline (p&lt;0.001) or with LDH at baseline &gt; 500 UI/ml (p = 0.008). A subset of patients most likely to benefit from ipilimumab should be defined. In our series we found a negative association of baseline corticosteroids with OS. Unlike high LDH levels, BRAF V600 E status and brain metastases should not be barriers to the initiation of treatment. 	Eur_J_Dermatol	D016428 D064888

23399569	20130213	High plasma efavirenz concentration and CYP2B6 polymorphisms in Thai HIV-1 infections.	??Efavirenz is mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6). This study aimed to examine the frequencies of CYP2B6 and the association between CYP2B6 polymorphisms and plasma efavirenz concentrations in an HIV-1 infected Thai population. Mid-dose plasma efavirenz concentration was determined at 12 weeks following the initiation of an antiretroviral therapy (tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz) in 100 Thai adults with HIV-1 infection using high-performance liquid chromatography. Candidate CYP2B6 polymorphisms (c.64C&gt;T, c.499C&gt;G, c.516G&gt;T, c.785A&gt;G, c.1375A&gt;G, c.1459C&gt;T) were conducted by real-time PCR-based allelic discrimination. The most frequent polymorphisms among this cohort were the CYP2B6 c.785A&gt;G and c.516G&gt;T, which had a frequency of 0.36 and 0.32, respectively. From the cases observed, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (c.516G&gt;T and c.785A&gt;G) were significantly associated with high efavirenz plasma levels (p &lt; 0.05). The most frequent haplotypic combinations were *1/*6, *1/*1, *1/*2 and *6/*6 at a frequency of 42.0%, 32.0%, 8.0% and 7.0%, respectively. Increased plasma concentrations of efavirenz were present in individuals with CYP2B6 *6/*6 [7.210 mg/L; interquartile range (IQR), 5.020-9.260] when compared to those with CYP2B6*1/*1 (1.570 mg/L; IQR, 1.295-2.670), p &lt; 0.001. In our study, the impact of SNPs which are correlated with a high level of efavirenz plasma concentrations was found. The genetic configuration of SNPs which are associated with high plasma efavirenz levels may be useful in optimizing the efavirenz dose that is used in HIV-1 infected patients.

19444286	20090516	Clinical and genetic characterization of 16q-linked autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia in South Kyushu, Japan.	16q-ADCA (OMIM no. 117210) is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (AD-SCA) characterized by late-onset pure cerebellar ataxia and -16C&gt;T substitution of the puratrophin-1 gene. Recently, a series of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (haplotype block) were found to be specific to 16q-ADCA. We screened patients with ataxia and found 62 patients, including four homozygotes who carry the C-T substitution of the puratrophin-1 gene. By further analysis of the patients with the haplotype block, we observed a single-founder effect for 16q-ADCA, even in patients who are supposed to be sporadic late cortical cerebellar atrophy (LCCA). We also observed slippage mutations of microsatellite markers, GATA01 and 17 msm, in the pedigrees. We compared the clinical course of 16q-ADCA in heterozygotes and homozygotes with the haplotype block and observed no apparent gene dosage effect. 16q-ADCA accounts for 27% of AD-SCAs and is the most frequent AD-SCA in South Kyushu, Japan.

12181609	20020816	Genistein modifies the activation kinetics and magnitude of phosphorylated wild-type and G551D-CFTR chloride currents.	We have studied the mechanism by which genistein activates cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in CHO cells expressing wild type or G551D-CFTR. In wild-type CHO cells, after exposure to 2.5 microM forskolin, 25 microM genistein induced a further 2-fold and rapid increase of the forskolin-activated CFTR current. In both types of cells, when forskolin was added after genistein preincubation, whole-cell current density was greatly reduced compared to that measured when genistein was added after phosphorylation of CFTR, and all activation kinetic parameters were significantly altered. Genistein had no effect on the adenylate cyclase activity. Our results suggest that the occupancy of a putative genistein binding site is critical for the gating mechanism of CFTR chloride channels, which, depending on the phosphorylation status of the R-domain, drives CFTR either into a refractory state or alternatively to a highly activated state.

27242543	20160601	Regulation of Differentiation by Calcium-Sensing Receptor in Normal and Tumoral Developing Nervous System.	During normal development of the nervous system (NS), neural progenitor cells (NPCs) produce specialized populations of neurons and glial cells upon cell fate restriction and terminal differentiation. These sequential processes require the dynamic regulation of thousands of genes. The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is temporally and spatially regulated in both neurons and glial cells during development of the NS. In particular, CaSR expression and function have been shown to play a significant role during differentiation of NPCs toward the oligodendrocyte lineage and also in maturation of cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs). Moreover, CaSR regulates axonal and dendritic growth in both central and peripheral nervous systems (PNSs), a process necessary for proper construction of mature neuronal networks. On the other hand, several lines of evidence support a role for CaSR in promotion of cell differentiation and inhibition of proliferation in neuroblastoma, a tumor arising from precursor cells of developing PNS. Thus, among the variety of NS functions in which the CaSR participates, this mini-review focuses on its role in differentiation of normal and tumoral cells. Current knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for CaSR regulation and function in these contexts is also discussed, together with the therapeutic opportunities provided by CaSR allosteric modulators.

23758789	20130614	Diffuse myocardial fibrosis by T1-mapping in children with subclinical anthracycline cardiotoxicity: relationship to exercise capacity, cumulative dose and remodeling.	The late cardiotoxic effects of anthracycline chemotherapy influence morbidity and mortality in the growing population of childhood cancer survivors. Even with lower anthracycline doses, evidence of adverse cardiac remodeling and reduced exercise capacity exist. We aim to examine the relationship between cardiac structure, function and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) tissue characteristics with chemotherapy dose and exercise capacity in childhood cancer survivors. Thirty patients (15???3 years), at least 2 years following anthracycline treatment, underwent CMR, echocardiography, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (peak VO(2)). CMR measured ventricular function, mass, T(1) and T(2) values, and myocardial extracellular volume fraction, ECV, a measure of diffuse fibrosis based on changes in myocardial T1 values pre- and post-gadolinium. Cardiac function was also assessed with conventional and speckle tracking echocardiography. Patients had normal LVEF (59???7%) but peak VO(2) was 17% lower than age-predicted normal values and were correlated with anthracycline dose (r?=?-0.49). Increased ECV correlated with decreased mass/volume ratio (r?=?-0.64), decreased LV wall thickness/height ratio (r?=?-0.72), lower peak VO(2)(r?=?-0.52), and higher cumulative dose (r?=?0.40). Echocardiographic measures of systolic and diastolic function were reduced compared to normal values (p?&lt;?0.01), but had no relation to ECV, peak VO(2) or cumulative dose. Myocardial T1 and ECV were found to be early tissue markers of ventricular remodeling that may represent diffuse fibrosis in children with normal ejection fraction post anthracycline therapy, and are related to cumulative dose, exercise capacity and myocardial wall thinning.

The molecular mechanism of microtubule bundling by KCBP remains unknown. KCBP binding to microtubules is regulated by Ca(2+)-binding proteins that recognize its C-terminal regulatory domain. In this work, we have discovered a new function of the regulatory domain. We present a crystal structure of an Arabidopsis KCBP fragment showing that the C-terminal regulatory domain forms a dimerization interface for KCBP. This dimerization site is distinct from the dimerization interface within the N-terminal domain. Side chains of hydrophobic residues of the calmodulin binding helix of the regulatory domain form the C-terminal dimerization interface. Biochemical experiments show that another segment of the regulatory domain located beyond the dimerization interface, its negatively charged coil, is unexpectedly and absolutely required to stabilize the dimers. The strong microtubule bundling properties of KCBP are unaffected by deletion of the C-terminal regulatory domain. The slow minus-end directed motility of KCBP is also unchanged in vitro. Although the C-terminal domain is not essential for microtubule bundling, we suggest that KCBP may use its two independent dimerization interfaces to support different types of bundled microtubule structures in cells. Two distinct dimerization sites may provide a mechanism for microtubule rearrangement in response to Ca(2+) signaling since Ca(2+)- binding proteins can disengage KCBP dimers dependent on its C-terminal dimerization interface.

11004248	20000927	Temperature-sensitive mutation of PEX6 in peroxisome biogenesis disorders in complementation group C (CG-C): comparative study of PEX6 and PEX1.	Peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBD), including Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, and infantile Refsum disease, are a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal-recessive diseases caused by mutations in PEX genes that encode peroxins, proteins required for peroxisome biogenesis. Zellweger syndrome patients present the most severe phenotype, whereas neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy patients are intermediate and infantile Refsum disease patients have the mildest features. PEX6 is a causative gene for PBD of complementation group C (CG-C) and encodes the peroxin Pex6p, one of the ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities and a member of the same family of proteins as Pex1p, a causative protein for PBD of CG-E (CG1). Here, we identified the temperature sensitivity of peroxisomes in the fibroblasts of a patient with neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy in CG-C. Peroxisomes were morphologically and biochemically formed at 30 degrees C but not at 37 degrees C. This patient was homozygous for a missense mutation, T--&gt;C at nucleotide 170 resulting in a change from leucine to proline at amino acid 57 (L57P) in Pex6p. CG-C cell mutants (ZP92) in the Chinese hamster ovary transfected with L57P in HsPEX6 revealed the same temperature-sensitive phenotype. However, PEX1-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants (ZP101) transfected with L111P in PEX1, the counterpart to L57P in PEX6, showed no temperature sensitivity. In addition, ZP92 transfected with G708D in PEX6, the counterpart to the temperature-sensitive mutation G843D in PEX1, revealed no temperature-sensitive phenotype. These results indicate that L57P in Pex6p is a temperature-sensitive mutation causing the milder phenotype in a patient with PBD in CG-C. They also indicate that the amino acid residues responsible for temperature sensitivity do not seem to be conserved between Pex6p and Pex1p. 	Pediatr._Res.	D002363 D003160 D016428 D013485
23889540	20130730	Clinicopathologic features of autosomal recessive amyotrophic lateral sclerosis associated with optineurin mutation.	We performed clinicopathological analyses of two amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with homozygous Q398X optineurin (OPTN) mutation. Clinically, both patients presented signs of upper and lower motor neuron degeneration, but only Patient 1 showed gradual frontal dysfunction and extrapyramidal signs, and temporal lobe and motor cortex atrophy. Neuropathological examination of Patient 1 revealed extensive cortical and spinal motor neuron degeneration and widespread degeneration of the basal ganglia. Bilateral corticospinal tracts exhibited degeneration. Loss of spinal anterior horn cells (AHCs) and gliosis were observed, whereas posterior columns, Clarke's columns, intermediate lateral columns, and the Onuf's nucleus were spared. In the brainstem, moderate neuronal loss and gliosis were noted in the hypoglossal and facial motor nuclei. No Bunina bodies were found in the surviving spinal and brainstem motor neurons. Transactivation response (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)-positive neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions were observed throughout the central nervous system. The Golgi apparatus in motor neurons of the brainstem and spinal cord was often fragmented. Immunoreactivity for OPTN was not observed in the brain and spinal cord, consistent with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay of OPTN. The TDP-43 pathology of Q398X was similar to that of an autosomal dominant E478G mutation. This result suggests that the loss-of-function, but not the proteinopathy itself, of OPTN results in TDP-43 deposits in neuronal and glial cytoplasm and Golgi apparatus fragmentation, leading to multisystem neurodegeneration.

27313381	20160618	The influence of seat height, trunk inclination and hip posture on the activity of the superior trapezius and longissimus.	[Purpose] This study was aimed at investigating the influence of seat height and body posture on the activity of the superior trapezius and longissimus muscles. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty two healthy subjects were instructed to perform a total of eight different body postures, varying according three main factors: seat height (low and high seat); trunk inclination (upright and leaning forward at 45?); and the hips in abduction and adduction. Electromyography of the superior trapezius and longissimus was collected bilaterally, and the average values were obtained and compared across all the postures. [Results] The activity of the superior trapezius and longissimus significantly changes according to the seat height and trunk inclination. For both seat heights, sitting with trunk leaning forward resulted in a significant increase in the activity of both muscles. When sitting in a high seat and the trunk leaning forward, the superior trapezius activity was significantly reduced when compared to the same posture in a low seat. [Conclusion] This study contributes to the knowledge on the influence of the body posture and seat configuration on the activity of postural muscles. Reducing the biomechanical loads on the postural muscles must be targeted in order to improve users' comfort and safety. 	J_Phys_Ther_Sci	D016428
27375657	20160705	Extensive Natural Variation in Arabidopsis Seed Mucilage Structure.	Hydrated Arabidopsis thaliana seeds are coated by a gelatinous layer called mucilage, which is mainly composed of cell wall polysaccharides. Since mucilage is rich in pectin, its architecture can be visualized with the ruthenium red (RR) dye. We screened the seeds of around 280 Arabidopsis natural accessions for variation in mucilage structure, and identified a large number of novel variants that differed from the Col-0 wild-type. Most of the accessions released smaller RR-stained capsules compared to the Col-0 reference. By biochemically characterizing the phenotypes of 25 of these accessions in greater detail, we discovered that distinct changes in polysaccharide structure resulted in gelatinous coatings with a deceptively similar appearance. Monosaccharide composition analysis of total mucilage extracts revealed a remarkable variation (from 50 to 200% of Col-0 levels) in the content of galactose and mannose, which are important subunits of heteromannan. In addition, most of the natural variants had altered Pontamine Fast Scarlet 4B staining of cellulose and significantly reduced birefringence of crystalline structures. This indicates that the production or organization of cellulose may be affected by the presence of different amounts of hemicellulose. Although, the accessions described in this study were primarily collected from Western Europe, they form five different phenotypic classes based on the combined results of our experiments. This suggests that polymorphisms at multiple loci are likely responsible for the observed mucilage structure. The transcription of MUCILAGE-RELATED10 (MUCI10), which encodes a key enzyme for galactoglucomannan synthesis, was severely reduced in multiple variants that phenocopied the muci10-1 insertion mutant. Although, we could not pinpoint any causal polymorphisms in this gene, constitutive expression of fluorescently-tagged MUCI10 proteins complemented the mucilage defects of a muci10-like accession. This leads us to hypothesize that some accessions might disrupt a transcriptional regulator of MUCI10. Therefore, this collection of publicly-available variants should provide insight into plant cell wall organization and facilitate the discovery of genes that regulate polysaccharide biosynthesis.

26202907	20150724	Fe(2+) substrate transport through ferritin protein cage ion channels influences enzyme activity and biomineralization.	Ferritins, complex protein nanocages, form internal iron-oxy minerals (Fe2O3?H2O), by moving cytoplasmic Fe(2+) through intracage ion channels to cage-embedded enzyme (2Fe(2+)/O2 oxidoreductase) sites where ferritin biomineralization is initiated. The products of ferritin enzyme activity are diferric oxy complexes that are mineral precursors. Conserved, carboxylate amino acid side chains of D127 from each of three cage subunits project into ferritin ion channels near the interior ion channel exits and, thus, could direct Fe(2+) movement to the internal enzyme sites. Ferritin D127E was designed and analyzed to probe properties of ion channel size and carboxylate crowding near the internal ion channel opening. Glu side chains are chemically equivalent to, but longer by one -CH2 than Asp, side chains. Ferritin D127E assembled into normal protein cages, but diferric peroxo formation (enzyme activity) was not observed, when measured at 650?nm (DFP ? max). The caged biomineral formation, measured at 350?nm in the middle of the broad, nonspecific Fe(3+)-O absorption band, was slower. Structural differences (protein X-ray crystallography), between ion channels in wild type and ferritin D127E, which correlate with the inhibition of ferritin D127E enzyme activity include: (1) narrower interior ion channel openings/pores; (2) increased numbers of ion channel protein-metal binding sites, and (3) a change in ion channel electrostatics due to carboxylate crowding. The contributions of ion channel size and structure to ferritin activity reflect metal ion transport in ion channels are precisely regulated both in ferritin protein nanocages and membranes of living cells.

21152284	20101215	A single amino acid substitution changes antigenicity of ORF2-encoded proteins of hepatitis E virus.	Extensive genomic diversity has been observed among hepatitis E virus (HEV) strains. However, the implication of the genetic heterogeneity on HEV antigenic properties is uncertain. In this study, monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) against truncated ORF2-encoded proteins (aa452-617, designated p166 proteins) derived from HEV strains of Burma (genotype 1a, p166Bur), Pakistan (1b, p166Pak) and Morocco (1c, p166Mor) were raised and used for identification of HEV antigenic diversity. Six Mabs reacted to these 3 p166 proteins as well as p166 proteins constructed from strains derived from Mexico (genotype 2), US (genotype 3) and China (genotype 4), indicating the existence of pan-genotypic epitopes. Two Mabs, 1B5 and 6C7, reacted with p166Bur and p166Mor, but not p166Pak or p166s derived from genotypes 2, 3, and 4, indicating that these 2 Mabs recognized strain-specific HEV epitopes. Both the common and specific epitopes could not be mapped by 23 synthetic peptides spanning the p166Bur sequence, suggesting that they are confirmation-dependent. Comparative sequence analysis showed that p166Bur and p166Mor shared an identical aa sequence along their entire lengths, whereas for p166Pak the aas occupying positions 606 and 614 are different from aas at corresponding positions of p166Bur and p166Mor. Reactivity between 1B5 and p166Bur was abrogated with mutation of p166Bur/A606V, whereas p166Pak acquired the reactivity to 1B5 with mutation of p166Pak/V606A. However, mutations of p166Bur/L614M and P166Pak/M614L did not affect the immunoreactivity. Therefore, the aa occupying position 606 plays a critical role in maintaining the antigenicity of the HEV p166 proteins. 	Int_J_Mol_Sci	D016428 D013485 D013486

12553950	20030130	Folate status and a new repletion cut-off value in a group of healthy Majorcan women.	Folate status is complex, complicated to assess and we lack consensus for laboratory determination. Total plasma homocysteine (Hcy) is a sensitive marker of folate status. The aim of this study was choosing a plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) measurement method and folate repletion level; assess the mutation C677T frequency for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in healthy Majorcan women. The measurement methods were compared using 219 women. Folate status assessment was determined by plasma tHcy, serum and erythrocyte folate and C677T for MTHFR in 342 healthy women. The mutation frequency is established with 146 of them. The measurement method comparison is summarized by Y = 1.013 (IC 95% 0.959, 1.069) X +0.829 (IC 95% 0.485, 1.170). The folate repletion level was set at Hcy &lt; or = 8.6 micromol/l. Women (67.1%) are heterozygotic and do not carry the mutation. Homozygotic frequency is 18.5%, significantly higher in women under 40 years (P = 0.033). Hyperhomocysteinemia prevalence is 19.3%, and 51.7% in the younger group. Hcy determination by polarized fluorescence immunoassay reflects folate status. Levels &lt; or = 8.6 micromol/l suggest folate repletion, which is less frequent in homozygotes. Population frequency for homozygotic-TT alleles for C677T-MTHFR reductase and hyperhomocysteinemia is significantly higher in women under 40 years. 	Clin_Nutr	D016428 D013485
24611473	20140312	Polymorphisms of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (C677T and A1298C) in nulliparous women complicated with preeclampsia.	To determine the prevalence of C677T and A1298C Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the MTHFR gene in nulliparous women complicated with preeclampsia (PE). One hundred fifty gestations complicated with PE and their corresponding controls without the disease were recruited for the genotyping of C677T and A1298C polymorphisms of the MTHFR gene using restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction. Secondarily, homocysteine (HCy) plasma levels were measured in preeclamptic women displaying the CC genotype of the A1298C polymorphism (homozygous) and compared to HCy levels determined among controls with the normal AA genotype for the A1298C variant. Only the mutant CC genotype of the A1298C polymorphism was associated to higher risk of presenting PE, as frequency of this genotype was significantly higher among cases than controls (15.3% versus 0.7%, p?&lt;?0.05). All PE women with a neck circumference ?32?cm presented the mutant CC A1298C polymorphism as compared to none among preeclamptics with a lower neck circumference (p?=?0.0001). Women with the mutant CC A1298C SNP displayed higher plasma HCy levels as compared to controls with normal AA A1298C genotype (8.4???2.6 versus 7.5???2.7?mmoL/L p?=?0.04). Prevalence of the CC mutant genotype of the A1298C polymorphism was higher among PE women. This mutation among PE women was related to increased neck circumference and higher HCy levels. Future research should aim at linking these gestational findings with obesity and cardiovascular risk. 	Gynecol._Endocrinol.	D016428 D013485
9589689	19980520	Congenital central hypothyroidism due to a homozygous mutation in the thyrotropin beta-subunit gene follows an autosomal recessive inheritance.	A 5-month-old infant of nonconsanguineous parents had severe hypothyroidism. Undetectable serum levels of T3 and T4 in combination with an undetectable baseline TSH level led to the diagnosis of central hypothyroidism. Administration of TRH failed to increase serum TSH, but not PRL, confirming isolated TSH deficiency. Measurement of the TSH in serum with three different immunoassays that recognize different epitopes of the TSH molecule failed to detect TSH, suggesting an aberrant or absent TSH. Direct sequencing of the entire coding region of the human TSH beta-subunit gene revealed a homozygous single base pair deletion in codon 105, resulting in a frame shift with a premature stop at codon 114. The truncated TSH beta peptide lacks the terminal five amino acids. Furthermore, the cysteine in codon 105 that is believed to be important for the interaction of the TSH beta-subunit with the alpha-subunit, is replaced with a valine (C105V), supporting the theory of a conformational change in the TSH molecule. Genotyping confirmed that the proposita was homozygous for this mutation, whereas her unaffected parents, the paternal grand-mother, and the maternal grandfather were heterozygous. Thus, isolated TSH deficiency follows an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance in this kindred. 	J._Clin._Endocrinol._Metab.	D002363 D016428 D013485
26744121	20160109	Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing Analysis of a Pendred Syndrome-Associated Thyroid Carcinoma.	Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hearing loss and goiter and is caused by bi-allelic mutations (homozygous or compound heterozygous) of the PDS (SLC26A4) gene. The incidence of Pendred syndrome is 7.5-10/100,000 in the general population, and it carries a 1?% risk of developing thyroid carcinoma. Herein, we report a case of a patient with Pendred syndrome who developed a follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC)-that is approximately at an odd of 1/1,000,000. Targeted next-generation sequencing with ThyroSeq v2 was performed on the tumor, and only a TP53 mutation (TP53 p.R175H) was identified. The mutation was limited to the tumor nodule of FVPTC as shown by immunohistochemistry. This report represents the first extensive molecular study of a Pendred syndrome-associated thyroid carcinoma. The evidences support that thyroid carcinomas arising from dyshormonogenetic goiter require additional genetic alteration in addition to the purported thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) overstimulation. It is intrigue to note that the mutant p53 is involved in the development of a low-grade malignant thyroid tumor as FVPTC in this patient. 	Endocr._Pathol.	D002363 D016428
25310450	20141014	Micro-plasticity of genomes as illustrated by the evolution of glutathione transferases in 12 Drosophila species.	Glutathione transferases (GST) are an ancient superfamily comprising a large number of paralogous proteins in a single organism. This multiplicity of GSTs has allowed the copies to diverge for neofunctionalization with proposed roles ranging from detoxication and oxidative stress response to involvement in signal transduction cascades. We performed a comparative genomic analysis using FlyBase annotations and Drosophila melanogaster GST sequences as templates to further annotate the GST orthologs in the 12 Drosophila sequenced genomes. We found that GST genes in the Drosophila subgenera have undergone repeated local duplications followed by transposition, inversion, and micro-rearrangements of these copies. The colinearity and orientations of the orthologous GST genes appear to be unique in many of the species which suggests that genomic rearrangement events have occurred multiple times during speciation. The high micro-plasticity of the genomes appears to have a functional contribution utilized for evolution of this gene family. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
9100010	19970408	Structures and characteristics of novel siderophores from plant deleterious Pseudomonas fluorescens A225 and Pseudomonas putida ATCC 39167.	When Pseudomonas putida ATCC 39167 and plant-deleterious Pseudomonas fluorescens A225 were grown in an iron-deficient culture medium, they each produced two different novel yellow-green fluorescent pseudobactins: P39167-I, II and PA225-I, II. Pseudobactin P39167-I has a molecular formula of C46H65O23N13 and is monoanionic at neutral pH. P39167-II has the molecular formula of C46H63O22N13 and no charge at neutral pH. Pseudobactin PA225-I has a molecular formula of C46H65O24N13 and is monoanionic at neutral pH whereas pseudobactin PA225-II has the molecular formula of C46H63O23N13 and no charge at neutral pH. All four of the pseudobactins contain a dihydroxyquinoline-based chromophore. The amino acid sequence for the octapeptide in case of pseudobactins from P. putida ATCC 39167 is Chr-Ser(1)-Ala(1)-AcOHOrn-Gly-Ala(2)-OHAsp-Ser(2)-Thr. In case of pseudobactins from P. fluorescens A225, the octapeptide has the sequence Chr-Ser(1)-Ala-AcOHOrn-Gly-Ser(2)-OHAsp-Ser(3)-Thr. For all four pseudobactins (P39167-I, II and PA225-I, II), the serine(1) residue of the octapeptide is attached to the carboxylic acid group on the C-11 of the fluorescent quinoline via an amide bond. Additionally, for pseudobactin P39167-II and PA225-II, the hydroxyl group of the serine(1) residue is also attached to the carboxyl group of threonine residue at the carboxy terminus of the peptide via an ester bond, resulting in a cyclic depsipeptide in contrast to the linear peptide chain of P39167-I and PA225-I. For all four pseudobactins, a malamide group is attached to the C-3 of the quinoline derived chromophore. The three bidentate iron(III) chelating groups in all four pseudobactins consist of a 1,2-dihydroxy aromatic group of the fluorescent chromophore, a hydroxy acid group of beta-hydroxy aspartic acid, and a hydroxamate group from the acylated Ndelta-hydroxyornithine. The amino acid constituents of the pseudobactins P39167 I, II are the same as those in pseudobactin A214, whereas those in A225 I, II are the same as in 7SR1, but in both cases the sequences are different. The uptake results indicate a single outer membrane receptor protein for ferric-pseudobactins in both organisms. The receptor proteins in the two species are similar but not identical.

24800237	20140507	Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes as research and therapeutic tools.	Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), namely, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), with their ability of indefinite self-renewal and capability to differentiate into cell types derivatives of all three germ layers, represent a powerful research tool in developmental biology, for drug screening, disease modelling, and potentially cell replacement therapy. Efficient differentiation protocols that would result in the cell type of our interest are needed for maximal exploitation of these cells. In the present work, we aim at focusing on the protocols for differentiation of hPSCs into functional cardiomyocytes in vitro as well as achievements in the heart disease modelling and drug testing on the patient-specific iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs).

10759281	20000412	Prothrombin 20210 G--&gt;A, MTHFR C677T mutations in women with venous thromboembolism associated with pregnancy.	Over 50 unselected women with maternal venous thromboembolism were screened for the prothrombin 20210 G--&gt;A and MTHFR C677T mutations, in addition to screening for other thrombophilias. The prevalence of thrombophilia in these women was compared with its prevalence in the general population in our area. The prothrombin (OR 4.4; 95% CI 1.2-16) and factor V Leiden (OR 4.5; 95% CI 2.1-14.5) mutations were more common in our patients, compared with the general population, whereas women homozygous for the C677T mutation in the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase gene (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.13-1.58) were not. It is recommended that women with a personal or strong family history of venous thromboembolism should be screened for the prothrombin mutation either before or early in pregnancy, in addition to screening for other thrombophilias. Screening for the MTHFR mutation does not appear to identify women at increased risk of maternal venous thrombosis. 	BJOG	D016428

21044324	20101104	Human ASPM participates in spindle organisation, spindle orientation and cytokinesis.	Mutations in the Abnormal Spindle Microcephaly related gene (ASPM) are the commonest cause of autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) a disorder characterised by a small brain and associated mental retardation. ASPM encodes a mitotic spindle pole associated protein. It is suggested that the MCPH phenotype arises from proliferation defects in neural progenitor cells (NPC). We show that ASPM is a microtubule minus end-associated protein that is recruited in a microtubule-dependent manner to the pericentriolar matrix (PCM) at the spindle poles during mitosis. ASPM siRNA reduces ASPM protein at the spindle poles in cultured U2OS cells and severely perturbs a number of aspects of mitosis, including the orientation of the mitotic spindle, the main determinant of developmental asymmetrical cell division. The majority of ASPM depleted mitotic cells fail to complete cytokinesis. In MCPH patient fibroblasts we show that a pathogenic ASPM splice site mutation results in the expression of a novel variant protein lacking a tripeptide motif, a minimal alteration that correlates with a dramatic decrease in ASPM spindle pole localisation. Moreover, expression of dominant-negative ASPM C-terminal fragments cause severe spindle assembly defects and cytokinesis failure in cultured cells. These observations indicate that ASPM participates in spindle organisation, spindle positioning and cytokinesis in all dividing cells and that the extreme C-terminus of the protein is required for ASPM localisation and function. Our data supports the hypothesis that the MCPH phenotype caused by ASPM mutation is a consequence of mitotic aberrations during neurogenesis. We propose the effects of ASPM mutation are tolerated in somatic cells but have profound consequences for the symmetrical division of NPCs, due to the unusual morphology of these cells. This antagonises the early expansion of the progenitor pool that underpins cortical neurogenesis, causing the MCPH phenotype. 	BMC_Cell_Biol.	D016428 D013485
17489563	20070511	Iron-sulfur cluster N7 of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is essential for stability but not involved in electron transfer.	The NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) from Escherichia coli is composed of 13 subunits called NuoA through NuoN. It catalyzes the electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone by a chain of redox groups consisting of one FMN and seven iron-sulfur clusters. The function of the additional, nonconserved cluster N7 located on NuoG is not known. It has been speculated that it is not involved in electron transfer, due to its distance of more than 20 A from the electron transfer chain. Dithionite-reduced minus NADH-reduced EPR difference spectra of complex I and of a soluble fragment containing NuoG revealed for the first time the EPR spectrum of N7 in the complex. Individual mutation of the cysteines ligating this cluster to alanine led to a decreased amount of complex I in the membrane without affecting the electron transfer activity. Sucrose gradient centrifugation revealed that the complex from the C230A and C233A mutants decayed in detergent solution while the C237A and C265A mutant complex was stable. Cluster N7 was detectable in the latter mutants but with shifted g-values, indicating a different ligation of N7. Thus, N7 is essential for the stability of the complex but is not involved in electron transfer. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485
17331978	20070303	The archetypal R90C CADASIL-NOTCH3 mutation retains NOTCH3 function in vivo.	Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most prominent known cause of inherited stroke and vascular dementia in human adult. The disease gene, NOTCH3, encodes a transmembrane receptor primarily expressed in arterial smooth muscle cells (SMC). Pathogenic mutations lead to an odd number of cysteine residues within the NOTCH3 extracellular domain (NOTCH3(ECD)), and are associated with progressive accumulation of NOTCH3(ECD) at the SMC plasma membrane. The murine homolog, Notch3, is dispensable for viability but required post-natally for the elaboration and maintenance of arteries. How CADASIL-associated mutations impact NOTCH3 function remains a fundamental, yet unresolved issue. Particularly, whether NOTCH3(ECD) accumulation may titrate the ligand and inhibit the normal pathway is unknown. Herein, using genetic analyses in the mouse, we assessed the functional significance of an archetypal CADASIL-associated mutation (R90C), in vivo, in brain arteries. We show that transgenic mouse lines expressing either the wild-type human NOTCH3 or the mutant R90C human NOTCH3, at comparable and physiological levels, can rescue the arterial defects of Notch3-/- mice to similar degrees. In vivo assessment of NOTCH3/RBP-Jk activity provides evidence that the mutant NOTCH3 protein exhibits normal level of activity in brain arteries. Remarkably, the mutant NOTCH3 protein remains functional and does not exhibit dominant negative interfering activity, even when NOTCH3(ECD) accumulates. Collectively, these data suggest a model that invokes novel pathogenic roles for the mutant NOTCH3 protein rather than compromised NOTCH3 function as the primary determinant of the CADASIL arteriopathy.

24644047	20140320	Detection of the I1781L mutation in fenoxaprop-p-ethyl-resistant American sloughgrass (Beckmannia syzigachne Steud.), based on the loop-mediated isothermal amplification method.	The increasing use of fenoxaprop-p-ethyl has resulted in evolved resistance in American sloughgrass (Beckmannia syzigachne Steud.). Target-site-based resistance to acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitors in B. syzigachne occurs owing to an isoleucine-to-leucine substitution at residue 1781 (I1781L) of the ACCase enzyme. A rapid detection method is needed to identify the resistance-conferring substitution. Four populations of B. syzigachne that were resistant to fenoxaprop-p-ethyl and contained the I1781L substitution were identified. Conventional PCR and derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (dCAPS) methods were used to detect the mutation. Additionally, a rapid nucleic acid detection method, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), was successfully developed and used to detect the genetic mutation underlying the I1781L substitution in the B. syzigachne ACCase enzyme. This report is the first to describe the application of a LAMP assay for mutation detection in herbicide-resistant weeds. The assay does not require specialised equipment: only a standard laboratory bath is needed. This technique could be employed for detecting the I1781L substitution in B. syzigachne plants and seeds.

23936060	20130813	R31C GNRH1 mutation and congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.	Normosmic congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nCHH) is a rare reproductive disease leading to lack of puberty and infertility. Loss-of-function mutations of GNRH1 gene are a very rare cause of autosomal recessive nCHH. R31C GNRH1 is the only missense mutation that affects the conserved GnRH decapeptide sequence. This mutation was identified in a CpG islet in nine nCHH subjects from four unrelated families, giving evidence for a putative &quot;hot spot&quot;. Interestingly, all the nCHH patients carry this mutation in heterozygosis that strikingly contrasts with the recessive inheritance associated with frame shift and non-sense mutations. Therefore, after exclusion of a second genetic event, a comprehensive functional characterization of the mutant R31C GnRH was undertaken. Using different cellular models, we clearly demonstrate a dramatic reduction of the mutant decapeptide capacity to bind GnRH-receptor, to activate MAPK pathway and to trigger inositol phosphate accumulation and intracellular calcium mobilization. In addition it is less able than wild type to induce lh-beta transcription and LH secretion in gonadotrope cells. Finally, the absence of a negative dominance in vitro offers a unique opportunity to discuss the complex in vivo patho-physiology of this form of nCHH. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
21067572	20101112	Association analysis of nine candidate gene polymorphisms in Indian patients with type 2 diabetic retinopathy.	Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is classically defined as a microvasculopathy that primarily affects the small blood vessels of the inner retina as a complication of diabetes mellitus (DM).It is a multifactorial disease with a strong genetic component. The aim of this study is to investigate the association of a set of nine candidate genes with the development of diabetic retinopathy in a South Indian cohort who have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Seven candidate genes (RAGE, PEDF, AKR1B1, EPO, HTRA1, ICAM and HFE) were chosen based on reported association with DR in the literature. Two more, CFH and ARMS2, were chosen based on their roles in biological pathways previously implicated in DR. Fourteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one dinucleotide repeat polymorphism, previously reported to show association with DR or other related diseases, were genotyped in 345 DR and 356 diabetic patients without retinopathy (DNR). The genes which showed positive association in this screening set were tested further in additional sets of 100 DR and 90 DNR additional patients from the Aravind Eye Hospital. Those which showed association in the secondary screen were subjected to a combined analysis with the 100 DR and 100 DNR subjects previously recruited and genotyped through the Sankara Nethralaya Hospital, India. Genotypes were evaluated using a combination of direct sequencing, TaqMan SNP genotyping, RFLP analysis, and SNaPshot PCR assays. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to analyze the genotype and allele frequencies. Among the nine loci (15 polymorphisms) screened, SNP rs2070600 (G82S) in the RAGE gene, showed significant association with DR (allelic P = 0.016, dominant model P = 0.012), compared to DNR. SNP rs2070600 further showed significant association with DR in the confirmation cohort (P = 0.035, dominant model P = 0.032). Combining the two cohorts gave an allelic P &lt; 0.003 and dominant P = 0.0013). Combined analysis with the Sankara Nethralaya cohort gave an allelic P = 0.0003 and dominant P = 0.00011 with an OR = 0.49 (0.34 - 0.70) for the minor allele. In HTRA1, rs11200638 (G&gt;A), showed marginal significance with DR (P = 0.055) while rs10490924 in LOC387715 gave a P = 0.07. No statistical significance was observed for SNPs in the other 7 genes studied. This study confirms significant association of one polymorphism only (rs2070600 in RAGE) with DR in an Indian population which had T2DM. 	BMC_Med._Genet.	D016428 D052061
27320382	20160621	Rabbit-specific computational modelling of ventricular cell electrophysiology: Using populations of models to explore variability in the response to ischemia.	Computational modelling, combined with experimental investigations, is a powerful method for investigating complex cardiac electrophysiological behaviour. The use of rabbit-specific models, due to the similarities of cardiac electrophysiology in this species with human, is especially prevalent. In this paper, we first briefly review rabbit-specific computational modelling of ventricular cell electrophysiology, multi-cellular simulations including cellular heterogeneity, and acute ischemia. This mini-review is followed by an original computational investigation of variability in the electrophysiological response of two experimentally-calibrated populations of rabbit-specific ventricular myocyte action potential models to acute ischemia. We performed a systematic exploration of the response of the model populations to varying degrees of ischemia and individual ischemic parameters, to investigate their individual and combined effects on action potential duration and refractoriness. This revealed complex interactions between model population variability and ischemic factors, which combined to enhance variability during ischemia. This represents an important step towards an improved understanding of the role that physiological variability may play in electrophysiological alterations during acute ischemia.

25303901	20141012	Heligmosomoides neopolygyrus Asakawa &amp; Ohbayashi, 1986, a cryptic Asian nematode infecting the striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius in Central Europe.	Heligmosomoides polygyrus is a widespread gastro-intestinal nematode infecting wild Apodemus (wood mice) throughout Europe. Using molecular and morphological evidence, we review the status of Heligmosomoides from Apodemus agrarius in Poland previously considered to be an outlying clade of H. polygyrus, to further resolve the status of the laboratory model species, H. bakeri. Morphological analysis of the male bursa and the synlophe, and molecular analyses of concatenated nuclear (28S rDNA, ITS1 and ITS2) and mitochondrial (CO1 and cytb) genes, of Heligmosomoides collected from Apodemus agrarius from two sites in Poland and comparison with related heligmosomids from voles and mice in Eurasia. Heligmosomoides neopolygyrus, a heligmosomid nematode from Apodemus species from China and Japan, is recognised for the first time in western Europe infecting Apodemus agrarius in Poland. It can be distinguished from H. polygyrus by the filiform externo-dorsal rays of the male copulatory bursa and the small, equally distributed longitudinal cr?tes on the body. Specimens from A. agrarius are 20% different at ribosomal (ITS1 and ITS2) nuclear loci, and 10% different at the mitochondrial cytb locus from H. polygyrus, and in phylogenetic analyses group with the vole-infecting genus Heligmosomum. Despite morphological similarity, H. neopolygyrus is only distantly related to H. polygyrus from western European Apodemus, and may be more closely related to vole-infecting taxa. It was brought into Europe by the recent rapid migration of the host mice. Inclusion of H. neopolygyrus in phylogenies makes it clear that Heligmosomoides is paraphyletic, with the pika-infecting Ohbayashinema and the vole-infecting Heligmosomum nesting within it. Clarification of the European status of H. neopolygyrus also allows H. bakeri, the laboratory model species, to be seen as a terminal sister clade to H. polygyrus, rather than as an internal clade of the latter taxon.

25143528	20140822	Potential for genomic instability associated with retrotranspositionally-incompetent L1 loci.	Expression of the L1 retrotransposon can damage the genome through insertional mutagenesis and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The majority of L1 loci in the human genome are 5'-truncated and therefore incapable of retrotransposition. While thousands of full-length L1 loci remain, most are retrotranspositionally-incompetent due to inactivating mutations. However, mutations leading to premature stop codons within the L1 ORF2 sequence may yield truncated proteins that retain a functional endonuclease domain. We demonstrate that some truncated ORF2 proteins cause varying levels of toxicity and DNA damage when chronically overexpressed in mammalian cells. Furthermore, transfection of some ORF2 constructs containing premature stop codons supported low levels of Alu retrotransposition, demonstrating the potential for select retrotranspositionally-incompetent L1 loci to generate genomic instability. This result suggests yet another plausible explanation for the relative success of Alu elements in populating the human genome. Our data suggest that a subset of retrotranspositionally-incompetent L1s, previously considered to be harmless to genomic integrity, may have the potential to cause chronic DNA damage by introducing DSBs and mobilizing Alu. These results imply that the number of known L1 loci in the human genome that potentially threaten its stability may not be limited to the retrotranspositionally active loci. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.

25356771	20141031	Effect of breadmaking process on in vitro gut microbiota parameters in irritable bowel syndrome.	A variety of foods have been implicated in symptoms of patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) but wheat products are most frequently cited by patients as a trigger. Our aim was to investigate the effects of breads, which were fermented for different lengths of time, on the colonic microbiota using in vitro batch culture experiments. A set of in vitro anaerobic culture systems were run over a period of 24 h using faeces from 3 different IBS donors (Rome Criteria-mainly constipated) and 3 healthy donors. Changes in gut microbiota during a time course were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), whilst the small-molecular weight metabolomic profile was determined by NMR analysis. Gas production was separately investigated in non pH-controlled, 36 h batch culture experiments. Numbers of bifidobacteria were higher in healthy subjects compared to IBS donors. In addition, the healthy donors showed a significant increase in bifidobacteria (P&lt;0.005) after 8 h of fermentation of a bread produced using a sourdough process (type C) compared to breads produced with commercial yeasted dough (type B) and no time fermentation (Chorleywood Breadmaking process) (type A). A significant decrease of ?-Proteobacteria and most Gemmatimonadetes species was observed after 24 h fermentation of type C bread in both IBS and healthy donors. In general, IBS donors showed higher rates of gas production compared to healthy donors. Rates of gas production for type A and conventional long fermentation (type B) breads were almost identical in IBS and healthy donors. Sourdough bread produced significantly lower cumulative gas after 15 h fermentation as compared to type A and B breads in IBS donors but not in the healthy controls. In conclusion, breads fermented by the traditional long fermentation and sourdough are less likely to lead to IBS symptoms compared to bread made using the Chorleywood Breadmaking Process.

27478330	20160802	Immunohistochemical Analysis of ATRX, IDH1 and p53 in Glioblastoma and Their Correlations with Patient Survival.	Glioblastoma (GBM) can be classified into molecular subgroups, on the basis of biomarker expression. Here, we classified our cohort of 163 adult GBMs into molecular subgroups according to the expression of proteins encoded by genes of alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and TP53. We focused on the survival rate of molecular subgroups, depending on each and various combination of these biomarkers. ATRX, IDH1 and p53 protein expression were evaluated immunohistochemically and Kaplan-Meier analysis were carried out in each group. A total of 15.3% of enrolled GBMs demonstrated loss of ATRX expression (ATRX-), 10.4% expressed an aberrant IDH1 R132H protein (IDH1+), and 48.4% exhibited p53 overexpression (p53+). Survival differences were statistically significant when single protein expression or different combinations of expression of these proteins were analyzed. In conclusion, in the case of single protein expression, the patients with each IDH1+, or ATRX-, or p53- GBMs showed better survival than patients with counterparts protein expressed GBMs. In the case of double protein pairs, the patients with ATRX-/p53-, ATRX-/IDH1+, and IDH1+/p53- GBMs revealed better survival than the patients with GBMs with the remained pairs. In the case of triple protein combinations, the patients with ATRX-/p53-/IDH+ showed statistically significant survival gain than the patients with remained combination of proteins-expression status. Therefore, these three biomarkers, individually and as a combination, can stratify GBMs into prognostically relevant subgroups and have strong prognostic values in adult GBMs. 	J._Korean_Med._Sci.

27382334	20160707	Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy: current perspectives.	There has been an increasing trend in the use of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) in the United States among women diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer, particularly young women. Approximately one-third of women &lt;40 years old are undergoing CPM in the US. Most studies have shown that the CPM trend is mainly patient-driven, which reflects a changing environment for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. The most common reason that women choose CPM is based on misperceptions about CPM's effect on survival and overestimation of their contralateral breast cancer (CBC) risk. No prospective studies have shown survival benefit to CPM, and the CBC rate for most women is low at 10 years. Fear of recurrence is also a big driver of CPM decisions. Nonetheless, studies have shown that women are mostly satisfied with undergoing CPM, but complications and subsequent surgeries with reconstruction have been associated with dissatisfaction with CPM. Studies on surgeon's perspectives on CPM are sparse but show that the most common reasons surgeons discuss CPM with patients is because of a suspicious family history or for a patient who is a confirmed BRCA mutation carrier. Studies on the cost-effectiveness of CPM have been conflicting and are highly dependent on patient's quality of life after CPM. Most recent guidelines for CPM are contradictory. Future areas of research include the development of interventions to better inform patients about CPM, modification of the guidelines to form a more consistent statement, longer term studies on CBC risk and CPM's effect on survival, and prospective studies that track the psychosocial effects of CPM on body image and sexuality.

22610140	20120522	Notch-RBP-J signaling regulates the transcription factor IRF8 to promote inflammatory macrophage polarization.	Emerging concepts suggest that the functional phenotype of macrophages is regulated by transcription factors that define alternative activation states. We found that RBP-J, the main nuclear transducer of signaling via Notch receptors, augmented Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-induced expression of key mediators of classically activated M1 macrophages and thus of innate immune responses to Listeria monocytogenes. Notch-RBP-J signaling controlled expression of the transcription factor IRF8 that induced downstream M1 macrophage-associated genes. RBP-J promoted the synthesis of IRF8 protein by selectively augmenting kinase IRAK2-dependent signaling via TLR4 to the kinase MNK1 and downstream translation-initiation control through eIF4E. Our results define a signaling network in which signaling via Notch-RBP-J and TLRs is integrated at the level of synthesis of IRF8 protein and identify a mechanism by which heterologous signaling pathways can regulate the TLR-induced inflammatory polarization of macrophages.

21422378	20110323	Human genetic polymorphisms in T1R1 and T1R3 taste receptor subunits affect their function.	Umami is the typical taste induced by monosodium glutamate (MSG), which is thought to be detected by the heterodimeric G protein-coupled receptor, T1R1 and T1R3. Previously, we showed that MSG detection thresholds differ substantially between individuals and we further showed that nontaster and hypotaster subjects are associated with nonsynonymous single polymorphisms occurring in the T1R1 and T1R3 genes. Here, we show using functional expression that both amino acid substitutions (A110V and R507Q) in the N-terminal ligand-binding domain of T1R1 and the 2 other ones (F749S and R757C), located in the transmembrane domain of T1R3, severely impair in vitro T1R1/T1R3 response to MSG. A molecular model of the ligand-binding region of T1R1/T1R3 provides a mechanistic explanation supporting functional expression data. The data presented here support causal relations between the genotype and previous in vivo psychophysical studies in human evaluating sensitivity to MSG. 	Chem._Senses	D016428 D013485
22194995	20111224	Expression of B-RAF V600E in type II pneumocytes causes abnormalities in alveolar formation, airspace enlargement and tumor formation in mice.	Growth factor induced signaling cascades are key regulatory elements in tissue development, maintenance and regeneration. Perturbations of these cascades have severe consequences, leading to developmental disorders and neoplastic diseases. As a major function in signal transduction, activating mutations in RAF family kinases are the cause of human tumorigenesis, where B-RAF V600E has been identified as the prevalent mutant. In order to address the oncogenic function of B-RAF V600E, we have generated transgenic mice expressing the activated oncogene specifically in lung alveolar epithelial type II cells. Constitutive expression of B-RAF V600E caused abnormalities in alveolar epithelium formation that led to airspace enlargements. These lung lesions showed signs of tissue remodeling and were often associated with chronic inflammation and low incidence of lung tumors. The inflammatory cell infiltration did not precede the formation of the lung lesions but was rather accompanied with late tumor development. These data support a model where the continuous regenerative process initiated by oncogenic B-RAF-driven alveolar disruption provides a tumor-promoting environment associated with chronic inflammation.

27374075	20160705	Genetic variants of nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 associated with the complications in Han descents with type 2 diabetes mellitus of Northeast China.	The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (NFE2L2) is essential for preventing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)-induced complications in animal models. This case and control study assessed genetic variants of NFE2L2 for associations with T2DM and its complications in Han Chinese volunteers. T2DM patients with (n?=?214) or without (n?=?236) complications, or healthy controls (n?=?359), were genotyped for six NFE2L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs: rs2364723, rs13001694, rs10497511, rs1806649, rs1962142 and rs6726395) with TaqMan Pre-Designed SNP Genotyping and Sequence System. Serum levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) were determined through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Informative data were obtained for 341 cases and 266 controls. Between T2DM patients and controls, the genotypic and allelic frequencies and haplotypes of the SNPs were similar. However, there was a significant difference in genotypic and allelic frequencies of rs2364723, rs10497511, rs1962142 and rs6726395 between T2DM patients with and without complications, including peripheral neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, foot ulcers and microangiopathy. Furthermore, HMOX1 levels were significantly higher in T2DM patients with complications than in controls. Multiple logistic regression analysis, however, showed that only rs2364723 significantly reduced levels of serum HMOX1 in T2DM patients for the GG genotype carriers compared with participants with CG+CC genotype. The data suggest that although NFE2L2 rs2364723, rs10497511, rs1962142 and rs6726395 were not associated with T2DM risk, they were significantly associated with complications of T2DM. In addition, only for rs2364723 higher serum HMOX1 levels were found in the T2DM patients with CG+CC than those with GG genotype. 	J._Cell._Mol._Med.	D016428 D013485
7904829	19940125	Kinetic and mutagenic studies of the role of the active site residues Asp-50 and Glu-327 of Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase.	The role of Asp-50 and Glu-327 of Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase in catalysis and substrate binding has been interrogated by construction of site-directed mutants at these positions. Steady-state and rapid-quench kinetic methods were used to elucidate contributions of Asp-50 and Glu-327 to the Km values of all three substrates, ATP, glutamate, and NH4+, as well as to the enzymatic kcat value. Kinetic constants were obtained for the D50A enzyme using both Mg2+ and Mn2+ as activating metal ions; the data reveal that Asp-50 has a significant role in both substrate binding and catalysis as reflected by the increases in the Km values for NH4+ and the destabilization of both the ground state and the transition state for phosphoryl transfer. The D50E mutant was found to have activity with Mn2+ but very low activity with Mg2+, the physiologically important metal ion. The kcat/Km values for all three substrates were substantially altered by changing Asp to Glu. The steady-state results for the E327A mutant indicate a decreased kcat/Km value for NH4+ compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. The E327A-Mg2+ enzyme destabilizes the ground state of the ternary complex (E-ATP-Glu-NH4+) and the transition state for phosphoryl transfer while the E327A-Mn2(+)-enzyme provides greater stabilization for the ATP and glutamate complexes but destabilizes phosphoryl transfer steps in the ternary complex. Overall, these results suggest that Asp-50 is likely involved in binding NH4+ and may also play a role in catalyzing deprotonation of NH4+ to form NH3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) 	Biochemistry	D003160 D016428 D013487
20477790	20100519	Genetic association between bovine NOD2 polymorphisms and infection by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis in Holstein-Friesian cattle.	Nucleotide-Binding Oligomerization Domain 2 (NOD2) has been reported to be a candidate gene for Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) infection in a Bos taurus ? Bos indicus mixed breed based on a genetic association with the c.2197T&gt;C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Nevertheless, this SNP has also been reported to be monomorphic in the B. taurus species. In the present work, 18 SNPs spanning the bovine NOD2 gene have been analysed in a genetic association study of two independent populations of Holstein-Friesian cattle. We found that the C allele of SNP c.*1908C&gt;T, located in the 3?-UTR region of the gene, is significantly more frequent in infected animals than in healthy ones, which supports the idea that the bovine NOD2 gene plays a role in susceptibility to MAP infection. However, in silico analyses of the NOD2 nucleotide sequence did not yield definitive data about a possible direct effect of SNP c.*1908C&gt;T on susceptibility to infection and led us to consider its linkage disequilibrium with the causative variant. A more exhaustive genetic association study including all putative, functional SNPs from this gene and subsequent functional analyses needs to be conducted to achieve a more complete understanding of how different variants of NOD2 may affect susceptibility to MAP infection in cattle.

23433201	20130226	Mutation Reporter Tool: an online tool to interrogate loci of interest, with its utility demonstrated using hepatitis B virus.	An online tool, which extracts and summarises nucleotide or amino acid sequence data at specified loci of interest, was developed and tested using the basic core promoter/precore (BCP/PC) region of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The tool is aimed at researchers without specialist computer skills. The tool consists of a web-based front-end, with a CGI script, which runs Python code to generate an output web-page. The Python code searches the input sequence data for a specified anchor motif, after which it generates summary tables and graphs of residue and motif distributions. After the user provides an input file in FASTA format containing aligned sequence data (nucleotides or amino acids) and specifies an anchor motif at a known coordinate, the tool summarizes the nucleotides or amino acids at the specified loci, their frequency and analyzes motif patterns of the loci.The tool can output a graph that displays the frequency of mutations relative to a reference sequence. The tool was used to analyze the BCP/PC region of HBV belonging to subgenotypes A1, A2 and subgenotype D and to serotype HBV. The &quot;Discovery Mode&quot; ignores conserved loci and assists in identifying potential loci of interest. Although HBV was used to demonstrate the utility of the Mutation Reporter Tool, the tool has wide application as it is genome-agnostic: nucleotide or amino acid sequence data from any organism can be processed. Rapid characterisation of many sequences can be achieved easily when the loci of interest are known. The tool is available online, without charge, at http://hvdr.bioinf.wits.ac.za/tools. 	Virol._J.

26433229	20151004	SerRS-tRNASec complex structures reveal mechanism of the first step in selenocysteine biosynthesis.	Selenocysteine (Sec) is found in the catalytic centers of many selenoproteins and plays important roles in living organisms. Malfunctions of selenoproteins lead to various human disorders including cancer. Known as the 21st amino acid, the biosynthesis of Sec involves unusual pathways consisting of several stages. While the later stages of the pathways are well elucidated, the molecular basis of the first stage-the serylation of Sec-specific tRNA (tRNA(Sec)) catalyzed by seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS)-is unclear. Here we present two cocrystal structures of human SerRS bound with tRNA(Sec) in different stoichiometry and confirm the formation of both complexes in solution by various characterization techniques. We discovered that the enzyme mainly recognizes the backbone of the long variable arm of tRNA(Sec) with few base-specific contacts. The N-terminal coiled-coil region works like a long-range lever to precisely direct tRNA 3' end to the other protein subunit for aminoacylation in a conformation-dependent manner. Restraints of the flexibility of the coiled-coil greatly reduce serylation efficiencies. Lastly, modeling studies suggest that the local differences present in the D- and T-regions as well as the characteristic U20:G19:C56 base triple in tRNA(Sec) may allow SerRS to distinguish tRNA(Sec) from closely related tRNA(Ser) substrate.

22713570	20120621	Switch II mutants reveal coupling between the nucleotide- and actin-binding regions in myosin V.	Conserved active-site elements in myosins and other P-loop NTPases play critical roles in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis; however, the mechanisms of allosteric communication among these mechanoenzymes remain unresolved. In this work we introduced the E442A mutation, which abrogates a salt-bridge between switch I and switch II, and the G440A mutation, which abolishes a main-chain hydrogen bond associated with the interaction of switch II with the ? phosphate of ATP, into myosin V. We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer between mant-labeled nucleotides or IAEDANS-labeled actin and FlAsH-labeled myosin V to examine the conformation of the nucleotide- and actin-binding regions, respectively. We demonstrate that in the absence of actin, both the G440A and E442A mutants bind ATP with similar affinity and result in only minor alterations in the conformation of the nucleotide-binding pocket (NBP). In the presence of ADP and actin, both switch II mutants disrupt the formation of a closed NBP actomyosin.ADP state. The G440A mutant also prevents ATP-induced opening of the actin-binding cleft. Our results indicate that the switch II region is critical for stabilizing the closed NBP conformation in the presence of actin, and is essential for communication between the active site and actin-binding region.

Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) can be classified into distinct subtypes on the basis of sequence polymorphisms in several open reading frames (ORFs). We analyzed the subtypes of HHV-8 in 59 human immunodeficiency virus-infected Japanese patients by using polymorphisms in ORF26 and found that over two-thirds of the HHV-8 isolates fell into major subtype A. We also found that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at nucleotide positions 1032 (C-to-A substitution) and 1055 (G-to-T substitution) in HHV-8 ORF26 were correlated with increased susceptibility to Kaposi's sarcoma, compared to the results obtained with HHV-8 with wild-type nucleotides at these positions (P = 0.0106). This observation suggests that molecular heterogeneity of the HHV-8 genome affects the biological properties of HHV-8, resulting in different clinical phenotypes of HHV-8 infection. Since sensitive PCR of ORF26 allowed us to analyze the SNPs by using peripheral blood from HHV-8-infected patients, the ORF26 SNPs will be a potent tool for investigating the pathogenesis of HHV-8 infection.

20144192	20100211	Chromosome 7p linkage and association study for diabetes related traits and type 2 diabetes in an African-American population enriched for nephropathy.	Previously we performed a linkage scan of 638 African American affected sibling pairs (ASP) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) enriched for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Ordered subset linkage analysis (OSA) revealed a linkage peak on chromosome 7p in the subset of families with earlier age of T2D diagnosis. We fine mapped this region by genotyping 11 additional polymorphic markers in the same ASP and investigated a total of 68 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in functional candidate genes (GCK1, IL6, IGFBP1 and IGFBP3) for association with age of T2D diagnosis, age of ESRD diagnosis, duration of T2D to onset of ESRD, body mass index (BMI) in African American cases and T2D-ESRD in an African American case-control cohort. OSA of fine mapping markers supported linkage at 28 cM on 7p (near D7S3051) in early-onset T2D families (max. LOD = 3.61, P = 0.002). SNPs in candidate genes and 70 ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) were evaluated in 577 African American T2D-ESRD cases and 596 African American controls. The most significant association was observed between ESRD age of diagnosis and SNP rs730497, located in intron 1 of the GCK1 gene (recessive T2D age-adjusted P = 0.0006). Nominal associations were observed with GCK1 SNPs and T2D age of diagnosis (BMI-adjusted P = 0.014 to 0.032). Also, one IGFBP1 and four IGFBP3 SNPs showed nominal genotypic association with T2D-ESRD (P = 0.002-0.049). After correcting for multiple tests, only rs730497 remanined significant. Variant rs730947 in the GCK1 gene appears to play a role in early ESRD onset in African Americans. 	BMC_Med._Genet.	D003160 D016428 D052061 D013485

27071553	20160414	Annexins family: insights into their functions and potential role in pathogenesis of sarcoidosis.	Annexins are Ca(2+)-regulated phospholipid-binding proteins that play an important role in the cell life cycle, exocytosis, and apoptosis. Annexin A11 is one of the oldest vertebrate annexins that has a crucial role in sarcoidosis pathogenesis. The mechanism of effect in sarcoidosis granuloma cells may be due to alterations in apoptosis. Immune cells with a specific mutation at protein location 230 are resistant to apoptosis and consequently have continued effects on inflammation and progression of sarcoidosis. The mechanism of action of annexin A11 may be based upon alterations in delivering calcium to two different apoptosis pathways (caspase and P53). 	J_Transl_Med	D016428 D016454
26204449	20150724	Application of wMelPop Wolbachia Strain to Crash Local Populations of Aedes aegypti.	The endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia pipientis (wMel strain) has been successfully established in several populations of Aedes aegypti, the primary dengue vector. The virulent Wolbachia strain wMelPop is known to cause several pathological impacts (increased egg mortality, life shortening, etc.) reducing overall fitness in the mosquito Ae. aegypti. Increased egg mortality could substantially reduce egg banks in areas with a lengthy monsoonal dry season, and be employed to eliminate local populations. We tested this application under semi-field cage conditions. First, we determined that wMelPop infection significantly reduced the survival of desiccation-resistant eggs of the dengue vector Ae. aegypti, with shade and temperature having a significant impact; nearly all wMelPop-infected eggs failed to hatch after 6 and 10 weeks in summer and winter conditions, respectively. In laboratory selection experiments we found that egg desiccation resistance can be increased by selection, and that this effect of wMelPop infection is due to the nuclear background of the host rather than Wolbachia. We then conducted an invasion of wMelPop within a semi-field cage using sustained weekly releases of wMelPop infected mosquitoes, with fixation achieved after 9 weeks. The egg populations wMelPop infected and an uninfected control were then subjected to a simulated prolonged monsoonal dry season (2.5 months) before flooding to induce hatching. The wMelPop infected eggs suffered significantly greater mortality than the controls, with only 0.67% and 4.35% of respective infected and uninfected eggs held in 99% shade hatching after 80 days. These studies suggest that wMelPop could be used to locally eliminate populations of Ae. aegypti that are exposed to prolonged dry conditions, particularly if combined with vector control.

27784267	20161028	Expression of ribosomopathy genes during Xenopus tropicalis embryogenesis.	Because ribosomes are ubiquitously required for protein production, it was long assumed that any inherited defect in ribosome manufacture would be embryonically lethal. However, several human congenital diseases have been found to be associated with mutations in ribosome biogenesis factors. Surprisingly, despite the global requirement for ribosomes, these &quot;ribosomopathies&quot; are characterized by distinct and tissue specific phenotypes. The reasons for such tissue proclivity in ribosomopathies remain mysterious but may include differential expression of ribosome biogenesis factors in distinct tissues. Here we use in situ hybridization of labeled antisense mRNA probes and ultra high temporal resolution RNA-Seq data to examine and compare expression of 13 disease associated ribosome biogenesis factors at six key stages in Xenopus tropicalis development. Rather than being ubiquitously expressed during development, mRNAs of all examined ribosome biogenesis factors were highly enriched in specific tissues, including the cranial neural crest and ventral blood islands. Interestingly, expression of ribosome biogenesis factors demonstrates clear differences in timing, transcript number and tissue localization. Ribosome biogenesis factor expression is more spatiotemporally regulated during embryonic development than previously expected and correlates closely with many of the common ribosomopathy phenotypes. Our findings provide information on the dynamic use of ribosome production machinery components during development and advance our understanding of their roles in disease. 	BMC_Dev._Biol.

9860858	19981223	S100A1 utilizes different mechanisms for interacting with calcium-dependent and calcium-independent target proteins.	While previous studies have identified target proteins that interact with S100A1 in a calcium-dependent manner as well as target proteins that interact in a calcium-independent manner, the molecular mechanisms of S100A1-target protein interaction have not been elucidated. In this study, point and deletion mutants of S100A1 were used to investigate the contribution of carboxyl terminal amino acids to S100A1 interaction with calcium-dependent and calcium-independent target proteins. First, a recombinant rat S100A1 protein (recS100A1) expressed in bacteria exhibited physical and chemical properties indistinguishable from native S100A1. Next, proteins lacking the carboxyl-terminal nine residues of recS100A1 (Delta85-93), or containing alanine substitutions at Phe 88 (F88A), Phe 89 (F89A), or Trp 90 (W90A), both Phe 88 and Phe 89 (F88/89A), or all three aromatic residues (F88/89A-W90A) were recombinantly expressed. Like recS100A1, F88A, F89A, and W90A proteins interacted with phenyl-Sepharose in a calcium-dependent manner. However, the Delta85-93 protein did not interact with phenyl-Sepharose, indicating that a phenyl-Sepharose-binding region (PSBR) of recS100A1 had been disrupted. The F88/89A and F88/89A-W90A proteins exhibited reduced calcium-dependent interaction with phenyl-Sepharose when compared with recS100A1, demonstrating that the carboxyl-terminal aromatic residues Phe 88, Phe 89, and Trp 90 comprise the PSBR of S100A1. Fluorescence studies showed that the Delta85-93 protein exhibited reduced calcium-dependent interaction with the dodecyl CapZ peptide, TRTK, while W90A bound TRTK with a Kd of 5.55 microM. These results demonstrate that the calcium-dependent target protein-binding site and the PSBR are indistinguishable. In contrast to the calcium-dependent target TRTK, activation of the calcium-independent target protein aldolase A by the point and deletion mutant S100A1s was indistinguishable from native S100A1. These results demonstrate that carboxyl-terminal residues are not required for S100A1 modulation of calcium-independent target protein aldolase A. Alltogether, these results indicate that S100A1 utilizes distinct mechanisms for interaction with calcium-independent and calcium-dependent target proteins. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485 D013487
17082571	20061104	Cutting edge: the phosphoinositide 3-kinase p110 delta is critical for the function of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells.	CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) contribute to the maintenance of peripheral tolerance by inhibiting the expansion and function of conventional T cells. Treg development and homeostasis are regulated by the Ag receptor, costimulatory receptors such as CD28 and CTLA-4, and cytokines such as IL-2, IL-10, and TGF-beta. Here we show that the proportions of Tregs in the spleen and lymph nodes of mice with inactive p110delta PI3K (p110deltaD910A/D910A) are reduced despite enhanced Treg selection in the thymus. p110deltaD910A/D910A CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs showed attenuated suppressor function in vitro and failed to secrete IL-10. In adoptive transfer experiments, p110deltaD910A/D910A T cells failed to protect against experimental colitis. The identification of p110delta as an intracellular signaling protein that regulates the activity of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs may facilitate the further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms responsible for Treg-mediated suppression.

20101210	20100127	Knock in of the AKT1 E17K mutation in human breast epithelial cells does not recapitulate oncogenic PIK3CA mutations.	An oncogenic mutation (G49A:E17K) in the AKT1 gene has been described recently in human breast, colon, and ovarian cancers. The low frequency of this mutation and perhaps other selective pressures have prevented the isolation of human cancer cell lines that harbor this mutation thereby limiting functional analysis. Here, we create a physiologic in vitro model to study the effects of this mutation by using somatic cell gene targeting using the nontumorigenic human breast epithelial cell line, MCF10A. Surprisingly, knock in of E17K into the AKT1 gene had minimal phenotypic consequences and importantly, did not recapitulate the biochemical and growth characteristics seen with somatic cell knock in of PIK3CA hotspot mutations. These results suggest that mutations in critical genes within the PI3-kinase (PI3K) pathway are not functionally equivalent, and that other cooperative genetic events may be necessary to achieve oncogenic PI3K pathway activation in cancers that contain the AKT1 E17K mutation.

24747200	20140422	SIBLING family genes and bone mineral density: association and allele-specific expression in humans.	Osteoporosis is a common complex disorder with reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and increased susceptibility to fracture. Peak BMD is one of the primary determinants of osteoporotic fracture risk, and is under substantial genetic control. Extracellular matrix, a major component of the bone, influences BMD by regulating mineral deposition and maintaining cellular activity. It contains several SIBLING family proteins, null mutations of which cause mineralization defects in humans. In this study, we tested 59 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the 5 SIBLING family genes (DSPP, DMP1, IBSP, MEPE and SPP1) for association with normal variation in peak BMD in healthy men and women. We measured femoral neck (FN) and lumbar spine (LS) areal BMD by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in 1692 premenopausal European-American women, 512 premenopausal African-American women and 715 European-American men. SNPs were tested for association with FN and LS-BMD in the 3 subsamples. In the European-American women, we observed association (p?0.005) with LS-BMD for SNPs in DSPP, IBSP and MEPE, and for FN-BMD with SNPs in DMP1 and IBSP. Allele-specific regulation of gene expression (ASE) is an important mechanism in which an allele giving rise to modest influence in transcript abundance might result in a predisposition to disease. To identify whether there was ASE of SIBLING family genes at these SNPs, we examined 52 human bone samples obtained from the femoral neck during surgical hip replacement (27 female, 25 male; 44 European-American and 8 African-American). We observed unidirectional ASE for the IBSP gene, with lower expression of the G allele compared to the A allele for SNP rs17013181. Our data suggest that SNPs within the SIBLING genes may contribute to normal variation of peak BMD. Further studies are necessary to identify the functional variants and to determine the mechanisms underlying the differences in ASE and how these differences relate to the pathophysiology of osteoporosis.

26918704	20160227	A Novel Analog Reasoning Paradigm: New Insights in Intellectually Disabled Patients.	Intellectual Disability (ID) is characterized by deficits in intellectual functions such as reasoning, problem-solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, and learning. As new avenues are emerging for treatment of genetically determined ID (such as Down's syndrome or Fragile X syndrome), it is necessary to identify objective reliable and sensitive outcome measures for use in clinical trials. We developed a novel visual analogical reasoning paradigm, inspired by the Progressive Raven's Matrices, but appropriate for Intellectually Disabled patients. This new paradigm assesses reasoning and inhibition abilities in ID patients. We performed behavioural analyses for this task (with a reaction time and error rate analysis, Study 1) in 96 healthy controls (adults and typically developed children older than 4) and 41 genetically determined ID patients (Fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome and ARX mutated patients). In order to establish and quantify the cognitive strategies used to solve the task, we also performed an eye-tracking analysis (Study 2). Down syndrome, ARX and Fragile X patients were significantly slower and made significantly more errors than chronological age-matched healthy controls. The effect of inhibition on error rate was greater than the matrix complexity effect in ID patients, opposite to findings in adult healthy controls. Interestingly, ID patients were more impaired by inhibition than mental age-matched healthy controls, but not by the matrix complexity. Eye-tracking analysis made it possible to identify the strategy used by the participants to solve the task. Adult healthy controls used a matrix-based strategy, whereas ID patients used a response-based strategy. Furthermore, etiologic-specific reasoning differences were evidenced between ID patients groups. We suggest that this paradigm, appropriate for ID patients and developmental populations as well as adult healthy controls, provides an objective and quantitative assessment of visual analogical reasoning and cognitive inhibition, enabling testing for the effect of pharmacological or behavioural intervention in these specific populations.

23317015	20130116	ACTN3 genotype in Spanish elite swimmers: no &quot;heterozygous advantage&quot;.	The aim of the present case-control study was to examine the association of the ACTN3 R577X genotype with elite swimming status. We compared a group of Spanish (Caucasian) elite swimmers (n?=?88) with other cohorts of the same ethnic origin, i.e., nonathletic controls (n?=?343) and other types of athletes who are in both end-points of the sports performance continuum, i.e., world-class power (n?=?119) and endurance male athletes (n?=?154). Swimmers had a lower odds ratio (OR) of having the RX genotype [1.815, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.899-3.664] compared with nonathletic controls, yet the association did not reach statistical significance (P?=?0.096). Endurance athletes had greater OR of having the XX genotype (OR: 2.88, 95% CI: 1.162-7.135, P?=?0.022), or the RX+XX genotype (OR: 1.903, 95% CI: 1.015-3.567, P?=?0.045) compared with swimmers. No other association was found. In summary, we did not observe an association between the ACTN3 R577X polymorphism and elite swimmer's status, suggesting that any influence of this polymorphism is not of sufficient magnitude as to significantly influence elite swimming performance, at least in Spanish athletes.

To construct a recombinant prokaryoticexpression plasmid pET/ c-A?(15)-c, and evaluate the immunogenicity of its encoded fusion protein as expressed in E.coli. The gene fragment HBc88-144 was amplified by PCR and subcloned to pUC19. The synthetic, double-strand A?(1-15) gene was inserted downstream of HBc1-71 in pGEMEX/c1-71. After restriction enzyme digestion, c1-71- A?(15) was spliced to HBc88-144, yielding the recombinant gene c-A?(15)-c; that gene was subcloned into pET-28a(+). The fusion protein (CA15C) expressed in the transformed E.coli BL21 was induced with isopropyl ?-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The virus-like particle (VLP) formed by fusion protein CA15C was observed with transmission electric microscope (TEM). Four Kunming (KM) mice were given intraperitoneal injections of CA15C, and the anti-A? antibody elicited was detected by indirect ELISA. The sequence of the recombinant gene was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. After IPTG induction, the fusion protein was expressed, mainly in the sediment from the bacterial lysate. The expression level was 40% of total protein in the sediment. The CA15C could form VLP. After 5 rounds of immunization, the titer of anti-A? antibody in the sera of KM mice reached 1:10000, while the anti-HBc antibody was undetectable. Recombinant c-A?(15)-c gene can be expressed in E.coli. The expressed protein can form VLPs and has a strong immunogenicity. 	Zhong_Nan_Da_Xue_Xue_Bao_Yi_Xue_Ban	D004740 D016428 D013485
23446638	20130301	Germline and somatic KLLN alterations in breast cancer dysregulate G2 arrest.	PTEN is a well-described predisposition gene for Cowden syndrome (CS), a familial cancer syndrome characterized by a high risk of breast and other cancers. KLLN, which shares a bidirectional promoter with PTEN, causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We previously identified germline hypermethylation of the KLLN promoter in 37% of PTEN mutation-negative CS/CS-like (CSL) patients. Patients with germline KLLN hypermethylation have an increased prevalence of breast and renal cancers when compared with PTEN mutation carriers. We have consequently sought to identify and characterize germline KLLN variants/mutations in CS/CSL and in apparently sporadic breast cancer patients. KLLN variants in CS/CSL patients are rare (1 of 136, 0.007%). Interestingly, among 438 breast cancer patients, 13 (3%) have germline KLLN variants when compared with none in 128 controls (P = 0.049). Patients with KLLN variants have a family history of breast cancer when compared with those without (P = 0.02). We demonstrate that germline KLLN variants dysregulate the cell cycle at G2. Of 24 breast carcinomas analyzed, 3 (13%) have somatic KLLN hemizygous deletions, with somatic loss of the wild-type allele in a patient with germline KLLN p.Leu119Leu. Of 452 breast carcinomas in The Cancer Genome Atlas project, 93 (21%) have KLLN hemizygous or homozygous deletions. This is the first study to associate germline KLLN variants with sporadic breast cancer and to recognize somatic KLLN deletions in breast carcinomas. Our observations suggest that KLLN may be a low penetrance susceptibility factor for apparently sporadic breast cancer. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D013485
23124202	20121106	The human W42R ?D-crystallin mutant structure provides a link between congenital and age-related cataracts.	Some mutants of human ?D-crystallin are closely linked to congenital cataracts, although the detailed molecular mechanisms of mutant-associated cataract formation are generally not known. Here we report on a recently discovered ?D-crystallin mutant (W42R) that has been linked to autosomal dominant, congenital cataracts in a Chinese family. The mutant protein is much less soluble and stable than wild-type ?D-crystallin. We solved the crystal structure of W42R at 1.7 ? resolution, which revealed only minor differences from the wild-type structure. Interestingly, the W42R variant is highly susceptible to protease digestion, suggesting the presence of a small population of partially unfolded protein. This partially unfolded species was confirmed and quantified by NMR spectroscopy. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments revealed chemical exchange between the folded and unfolded species. Exposure of wild-type ?D-crystallin to UV caused damage to the N-terminal domain of the protein, resulting in very similar proteolytic susceptibility as observed for the W42R mutant. Altogether, our combined data allowed us to propose a model for W42R pathogenesis, with the W42R mutant serving as a mimic for photodamaged ?D-crystallin involved in age-related cataract.

26602024	20151126	Polymorphisms near the IFNL3 Gene Associated with HCV RNA Spontaneous Clearance and Hepatocellular Carcinoma Risk.	The aims of this study were to investigate associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the genes IFNL2, IFNL3, and IFNL4 and spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and to evaluate variants for their risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among subjects in whom spontaneous HCV RNA clearance did not occur. In the first study, 889 untreated anti-HCV-seropositive patients without HCC symptoms were followed from 1991 to 2005. The spontaneous HCV clearance rate was found to be 33.1%. The TT variant of rs8099917 near IFNL3 was associated with increased spontaneous HCV RNA clearance, with an adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of 2.78 (1.43-5.39), as was the newly-identified TT/TT dinucleotide variant rs368234815 near IFNL4 (adjusted odds ratio 2.68, 95% CI: 1.42-5.05). In the second study, associations between SNPs and HCC risk were examined in 483 HCC cases with detectable HCV RNA and 516 controls. In participants with HCV genotype 1, unfavorable genotypes for HCV clearance near IFNL3 were associated with increased HCC risk, the adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) for rs12979860 and rs8099917 being 1.73 (1.00-2.99) and 1.84 (1.02-3.33), respectively. Host characteristics should be considered to identify high-risk patients to prioritize the use of new antiviral agents and intensive screening. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D013485
2890635	19871115	Structure of a human serum amyloid A gene and modulation of its expression in transfected L cells.	The structure of a human serum amyloid A (SAA) genomic clone (SAAg9) has been analyzed and the nucleotide sequence of the coding regions is compared with that of the cDNA for apoSAA1. The leader and coding sequences of exons 2 and 3 are identical to SAA1. However, there are 10 nucleotide and 7 derived amino acid substitutions in exon 4. These changes are identical to the amino acid sequence of the amyloid protein associated with familial Mediterranean fever. In particular, the amino acid substitution (Thr to Phe) at residue 69 of SAA1 may have an important role in this type of hereditary amyloidosis. The genomic clone SAAg9 has been transfected into mouse L cells, and constitutive expression of human specific mRNA and protein were observed in stable transfected clones. The expression of both SAA mRNA and protein were increased by incubation of the transfected cells with purified human interleukin-1 (IL-1), both human and mouse recombinant IL-1, and recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha. The induction of SAA is pretranslational and is likely to be mediated by protein factor(s) since incubation with cycloheximide diminished IL-1-dependent increase in SAA mRNA. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428
24226769	20131115	The heterotaxy gene GALNT11 glycosylates Notch to orchestrate cilia type and laterality.	Heterotaxy is a disorder of left-right body patterning, or laterality, that is associated with major congenital heart disease. The aetiology and mechanisms underlying most cases of human heterotaxy are poorly understood. In vertebrates, laterality is initiated at the embryonic left-right organizer, where motile cilia generate leftward flow that is detected by immotile sensory cilia, which transduce flow into downstream asymmetric signals. The mechanism that specifies these two cilia types remains unknown. Here we show that the N-acetylgalactosamine-type O-glycosylation enzyme GALNT11 is crucial to such determination. We previously identified GALNT11 as a candidate disease gene in a patient with heterotaxy, and now demonstrate, in Xenopus tropicalis, that galnt11 activates Notch signalling. GALNT11 O-glycosylates human NOTCH1 peptides in vitro, thereby supporting a mechanism of Notch activation either by increasing ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding of the Notch receptor or by modification of specific EGF repeats. We further developed a quantitative live imaging technique for Xenopus left-right organizer cilia and show that Galnt11-mediated Notch1 signalling modulates the spatial distribution and ratio of motile and immotile cilia at the left-right organizer. galnt11 or notch1 depletion increases the ratio of motile cilia at the expense of immotile cilia and produces a laterality defect reminiscent of loss of the ciliary sensor Pkd2. By contrast, Notch overexpression decreases this ratio, mimicking the ciliopathy primary ciliary dyskinesia. Together our data demonstrate that Galnt11 modifies Notch, establishing an essential balance between motile and immotile cilia at the left-right organizer to determine laterality, and reveal a novel mechanism for human heterotaxy.

4924630	19701201	Capsid size and deoxyribonucleic acid length: the petite variant of bacteriophage T4.	A mutant which produces a small-headed (&quot;petite&quot;) variant of bacteriophage T4 is described. The mutation (E920g) maps in a new gene (66) between genes 23 and 24. Petite phage particles composed up to 70% of the phage yield. The petite phage was nonviable upon single infection but produced progeny when two or more infected a cell. Its genome was shortened by a random deletion of about 30%, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extracted from the particles was 0.68 the length of normal T4 DNA. The reduction in DNA length was accompanied by a proportional reduction in head volume. Double mutants between E920g and head-defective mutants in gene 21 produced unusually high frequencies of spherical capsidlike structures (tau-particles). 	J._Virol.	D016428
7491778	19951110	Limited viral spread and rapid immune response in lymph nodes of macaques inoculated with attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus.	A comparative study was undertaken to characterize the very early events that distinguish attenuated and pathogenic simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections. Three rhesus macaques were inoculated with the attenuated SIVmac 251 delta nef virus, and three others with a virus of intermediate phenotype, SIVmac 239 nef stop. They were compared to four macaques inoculated with the pathogenic SIVmac 251 isolate. Lymph nodes (LN) taken between 7 days and 2 months postinoculation were analyzed for SIV expression by in situ hybridization. During acute infection, SIV 21 delta nef infected 1 to 1.5 log10 fewer cells in LN tissue than the pathogenic SIV 251 isolate. The reduction was more marked in the blood, as SIV 251 delta nef infected 2 to 3 log10 fewer PBMC than the isolate and did not yield detectable antigenemia. Morphometric measurements showed that the development of germinal centers (GC) was more rapid in the delta nef infection, which led to a more efficient trapping of viral particles, and could account for antigenemia clearance. The SIV 239 nef stop clone reverted to a nef+ genotype at Week 2, but induced a lower viral burden than a directly pathogenic virus. The kinetics of GC development was rapid, indicating that SIV 239 nef stop induced an immune response similar to that seen in attenuated infection. This study provides evidence that attenuated SIV elicits a more rapid immune response than pathogenic SIV and suggests that an early immunosuppressive episode may facilitate the dissemination of pathogenic SIV.

24049060	20130920	Combined analysis of pharmacokinetic and efficacy data of preclinical studies with statins markedly improves translation of drug efficacy to human trials.	Correct prediction of human pharmacokinetics (PK) and the safety and efficacy of novel compounds based on preclinical data, is essential but often fails. In the current study, we aimed to improve the predictive value of ApoE*3Leiden (E3L) transgenic mice regarding the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of various statins in humans by combining pharmacokinetic with efficacy data. The efficacy of five currently marketed statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin) in hypercholesterolemic patients (low-density lipoprotein ? 160 mg/dl) was ranked based on meta-analysis of published human trials. Additionally, a preclinical combined PK efficacy data set for these five statins was established in E3L mice that were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 4 weeks, followed by 6 weeks of drug intervention in which statins were supplemented to the diet. Plasma and tissue levels of the statins were determined on administration of (radiolabeled) drugs (10 mg/kg p.o.). As expected, all statins reduced plasma cholesterol in the preclinical model, but a direct correlation between cholesterol lowering efficacy of the different statins in mice and in humans did not reach statistical significance (R(2) = 0.11, P &lt; 0.57). It is noteworthy that, when murine data were corrected for effective liver uptake of the different statins, the correlation markedly increased (R(2) = 0.89, P &lt; 0.05). Here we show for the first time that hepatic uptake of statins is related to their cholesterol-lowering efficacy and provide evidence that combined PK and efficacy studies can substantially improve the translational value of the E3L mouse model in the case of statin treatment. This strategy may also be applicable for other classes of drugs and other preclinical models. 	J._Pharmacol._Exp._Ther.	D016428 D013485
26354350	20150911	Duffy blood group genotyping in Thai blood donors.	Duffy (FY) blood group genotyping is important in transfusion medicine because Duffy alloantibodies are associated with delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. In this study, FY allele frequencies in Thai blood donors were determined by in-house PCR with sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP), and the probability of obtaining compatible blood for alloimmunized patients was assessed. Five hundred blood samples from Thai blood donors of the National Blood Centre, Thai Red Cross Society, were included. Only 200 samples were tested with anti-Fy(a) and anti-Fy(b) using the gel technique. All 500 samples and four samples from a Guinea family with the Fy(a-b-) phenotype were genotyped by using PCR-SSP. Additionally, the probability of obtaining antigen-negative red blood cells (RBCs) for alloimmunized patients was calculated according to the estimated FY allele frequencies. The FY phenotyping and genotyping results were in 100% concordance. The allele frequencies of FY*A and FY*B in 500 central Thais were 0.962 (962/1,000) and 0.038 (38/1,000), respectively. Although the Fy(a-b-) phenotype was not observed in this study, FY*B(ES)/FY*B(ES) was identified by PCR-SSP in the Guinea family and was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Our results confirm the high frequency of the FY*A allele in the Thai population, similar to that of Asian populations. At least 500 Thai blood donors are needed to obtain two units of antigen-negative RBCs for the Fy(a-b+) phenotype. 	Ann_Lab_Med	D016428 D013485
25460726	20141203	Protein engineering to develop a redox insensitive endothelial nitric oxide synthase.	The zinc tetrathiolate (ZnS4) cluster is an important structural feature of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). The cluster is located on the dimeric interface and four cysteine residues (C94 and C99 from two adjacent subunits) form a cluster with a Zn ion in the center of a tetrahedral configuration. Due to its high sensitivity to oxidants this cluster is responsible for eNOS dimer destabilization during periods of redox stress. In this work we utilized site directed mutagenesis to replace the redox sensitive cysteine residues in the ZnS4 cluster with redox stable tetra-arginines. Our data indicate that this C94R/C99R eNOS mutant is active. In addition, this mutant protein is insensitive to dimer disruption and inhibition when challenged with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Further, the overexpression of the C94R/C99R mutant preserved the angiogenic response in endothelial cells challenged with H2O2. The over-expression of the C94R/C99R mutant preserved the ability of endothelial cells to migrate towards vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and preserved the endothelial monolayer in a scratch wound assay. We propose that this dimer stable eNOS mutant could be utilized in the treatment of diseases in which there is eNOS dysfunction due to high levels of oxidative stress.

24386165	20140104	Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) expression in ovarian carcinomas and its clinicopathological associations.	Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is known as a carrier protein. It is classically thought to be mainly synthesized in the liver and then secreted into the circulating system, where it binds to sex steroids with a high affinity and modulates the bio-availability of the hormones. Other organs known to produce SHBG include brain, uterus, testis, prostate, breast and ovary, and the local expressed SHBG may play an important role in tumor development. However, SHBG expression status and its clinicopathological significance in ovarian cancer cells are not reported yet. In our present study, we examined and found the variable SHBG expression in four ovarian cancer cell lines (OV-90, OVCAR-3, SKOV-3 and ES-2) by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. We then extended our study to 248 ovarian carcinoma samples, which were collected at The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital with complete clinical information, and discovered that SHBG was variably expressed in these ovarian carcinomas. Higher level of SHBG expression was significantly associated with more aggressive histological subtype (p = 0.022), higher FIGO stage (p = 0.018) and higher histological grade (grade of differentiation, p = 0.020), although association between SHBG expression and OS/PFS was not observed. Our results demonstrate that ovarian cancer cells produce SHBG and higher SHBG expression in ovarian carcinoma is associated with unfavorable clinicopathological features. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
27428329	20160719	Multiple Rad52-Mediated Homology-Directed Repair Mechanisms Are Required to Prevent Telomere Attrition-Induced Senescence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	Most human somatic cells express insufficient levels of telomerase, which can result in telomere shortening and eventually senescence, both of which are hallmarks of ageing. Homology-directed repair (HDR) is important for maintaining proper telomere function in yeast and mammals. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rad52 is required for almost all HDR mechanisms, and telomerase-null cells senesce faster in the absence of Rad52. However, its role in preventing accelerated senescence has been unclear. In this study, we make use of rad52 separation-of-function mutants to find that multiple Rad52-mediated HDR mechanisms are required to delay senescence, including break-induced replication and sister chromatid recombination. In addition, we show that misregulation of histone 3 lysine 56 acetylation, which is known to be defective in sister chromatid recombination, also causes accelerated senescence. We propose a model where Rad52 is needed to repair telomere attrition-induced replication stress. 	PLoS_Genet.	D016428 D013485

575138	19791201	Low resolution crystal structure of lipase from Geotrichum candidum (ATCC34614).	Lipase from Geotrichum candidum (ATCC34614) is a glycerol ester hydrolase which has a molecular weight of 55,000 with about 7% carbohydrate, displaying a high affinity for triolein. The enzyme was crystallized from more than 2% protein solution without using any salt or organic solvent. The crystals were cross-linked by soaking in 0.37% glutaraldehyde solution (0.1 M acetate buffer solution, pH 5.6). The structure was determined by X-ray diffraction using the isomorphous replacement technique. Two heavy-atom derivatives [K2PtCl4 and UO2(CH3COO)2] were obtained by the soaking method. The electron density map calculated at 5 A resolution clearly showed the molecular boundary. A balsa wood model was made on the basis of the 6 A electron density map. The molecular has an ellipsoidal shape with dimensions of 70 A X 50 A X 50 A. Several columns of density corresponding to alpha-helix and a few clefts were found in the molecule. The active site is presumably located in the vicinity of one of the Pt sites in the Pt-derivative crystal, judging from the inactivation of the enzyme by K2PtCl4. 	J._Biochem.	D016428
27912868	20161204	Correlation between Total Solar Irradiance and Glycated Hemoglobin 2 to 3 Months Later in Patients with Diabetes: A Big-Data Analysis.	Much attention has been paid recently to a relationship between glucose metabolism and weather. This study investigated the temporal correlation between total solar irradiance (TSI) and glycated hemoglobin (A1C) values in patients with diabetes. In 1531 patients with diabetes who received follow-up care between 2009 and 2013 (type 1 diabetes, 123 patients; type 2 diabetes, 1408 patients; male 53.6%; mean age, 61.2 years), A1C levels were measured a total of 58,830 times. The correlation between mean monthly TSI and mean A1C values from 1 to 4 months later was then examined. The mean values for TSI and A1C throughout the entire study period were 13.7?MJ/m2and 7.7%, respectively. The correlation coefficient between TSI and mean monthly A1C values at 1 to 4 months was -0.516, -0.734, -0.726 and -0.475, respectively (all p&lt;0.001). There was a highly negative correlation between TSI and mean A1C values 2 to 3 months later in this population; thus, this fact may need to be considered when using A1C levels as a glycemic control index in patients with diabetes. Further studies are warranted. 	Can_J_Diabetes	D016428
20410266	20100423	Neuraminidase receptor binding variants of human influenza A(H3N2) viruses resulting from substitution of aspartic acid 151 in the catalytic site: a role in virus attachment?	Changes in the receptor binding characteristics of human H3N2 viruses have been evident from changes in the agglutination of different red blood cells (RBCs) and the reduced growth capacity of recently isolated viruses, particularly in embryonated eggs. An additional peculiarity of viruses circulating in 2005 to 2009 has been the poor inhibition of hemagglutination by postinfection ferret antisera for many viruses isolated in MDCK cells, including homologous reference viruses. This was shown not to be due to an antigenic change in hemagglutinin (HA) but was shown to be the result of a mutation in aspartic acid 151 of neuraminidase (NA) to glycine, asparagine, or alanine, which caused an oseltamivir-sensitive agglutination of RBCs. The D151G substitution was shown to cause a change in the specificity of NA such that it acquired the capacity to bind receptors, which were refractory to enzymatic cleavage, without altering its ability to remove receptors for HA. Thus, the inhibition of NA-dependent agglutination by the inclusion of oseltamivir carboxylate in the assay was effective in restoring the anti-HA specificity of the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay for monitoring antigenic changes in HA. Since the NA-dependent binding activity did not affect virus neutralization, and virus populations in clinical specimens possessed, at most, low levels of the &quot;151 mutant,&quot; the biological significance of this feature of NA in, for example, immune evasion is unclear. It is apparent, however, that an important role of aspartic acid 151 in the activity of NA may be to restrict the specificity of the NA interaction and its receptor-destroying activity to complement that of HA receptor binding.

12773538	20030530	Evidence for distinct sodium-, dopamine-, and cocaine-dependent conformational changes in transmembrane segments 7 and 8 of the dopamine transporter.	Previously we obtained evidence based on engineering of Zn2+ binding sites that the extracellular parts of transmembrane segment 7 (TM7) and TM8 in the human dopamine transporter are important for transporter function. To further evaluate the role of this domain, we have employed the substituted cysteine accessibility method and performed 10 single cysteine substitutions at the extracellular ends of TM7 and TM8. The mutants were made in background mutants of the human dopamine transporter with either two (E2C) or five endogenous cysteines substituted (X5C) that render the transporter largely insensitive to cysteine modification. In two mutants (M371C and A399C), treatment with the sulfhydryl-reactive reagent [2-(trimethylammonium)-ethyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) led to a substantial inhibition of [3H]dopamine uptake. In M371C this inactivation was enhanced by Na+ and blocked by dopamine. Inhibitors such as cocaine did not alter the effect of MTSET in M371C. The protection of M371C inactivation by dopamine required Na+. Because dopamine binding is believed to be Na+-independent, this suggests that dopamine induces a transport-associated conformational change that decreases the reactivity of M371C with MTSET. In contrast to M371C, cocaine decreased the reaction rate of A399C with MTSET, whereas dopamine had no effect. The protection by cocaine can either reflect that Ala-399 lines the cocaine binding crevice or that cocaine induces a conformational change that decreases the reactivity of A399C. The present findings add new functionality to the TM7/8 region by providing evidence for the occurrence of distinct Na+-, substrate-, and perhaps inhibitor-induced conformational changes critical for the proper function of the transporter.

27066076	20160412	Gas Chromatography/Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization-Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry of Pyrolysis Oil from German Brown Coal.	Pyrolysis oil from the slow pyrolysis of German brown coal from Sch?ningen, obtained at a temperature of 500?C, was separated and analyzed using hyphenation of gas chromatography with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source operated in negative ion mode and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (GC-APCI-FT-ICR-MS). Development of this ultrahigh-resolving analysis method is described, that is, optimization of specific GC and APCI parameters and performed data processing. The advantages of GC-APCI-FT-ICR-MS hyphenation, for example, soft ionization, ultrahigh-resolving detection, and most important isomer separation, were demonstrated for the sample liquid. For instance, it was possible to separate and identify nine different propylphenol, ethylmethylphenol, and trimethylphenol isomers. Furthermore, homologous series of different acids, for example, alkyl and alkylene carboxylic acids, were verified, as well as homologous series of alkyl phenols, alkyl dihydroxy benzenes, and alkoxy alkyl phenols.

25250022	20140925	The lethal cargo of Myxococcus xanthus outer membrane vesicles.	Myxococcus xanthus is a bacterial micro-predator known for hunting other microbes in a wolf pack-like manner. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are produced in large quantities by M. xanthus and have a highly organized structure in the extracellular milieu, sometimes occurring in chains that link neighboring cells within a biofilm. OMVs may be a vehicle for mediating wolf pack activity by delivering hydrolytic enzymes and antibiotics aimed at killing prey microbes. Here, both the protein and small molecule cargo of the OMV and membrane fractions of M. xanthus were characterized and compared. Our analysis indicates a number of proteins that are OMV-specific or OMV-enriched, including several with putative hydrolytic function. Secondary metabolite profiling of OMVs identifies 16 molecules, many associated with antibiotic activities. Several hydrolytic enzyme homologs were identified, including the protein encoded by MXAN_3564 (mepA), an M36 protease homolog. Genetic disruption of mepA leads to a significant reduction in extracellular protease activity suggesting MepA is part of the long-predicted (yet to date undetermined) extracellular protease suite of M. xanthus.

27168688	20160512	Evaluation of Mosquito Repellent Activity of Isolated Oleic Acid, Eicosyl Ester from Thalictrum javanicum.	To evaluate the traditional use, the mosquito repellent property of Thalictrum javanicum and to confirm the predicted larvicidal activity of the isolated compound, oleic acid, eicosyl ester from its aerial parts by PASS software, the present study was carried out using 4th instar stage larvae of the mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti (dengue vector) and Culex quinquefasciatus (filarial vector). Insecticidal susceptibility tests were conducted and the mortality rate was observed after 24 h exposure. The chitinase activity of isolated compound was assessed by using purified ?-N-acetyl glucosaminidase (chitinase). Ecdysone 20-monooxygenase assay (radioimmuno assay) was made using the same larval stage of A. aegyptiand C. quinquefasciatus. The results were compared with the crude methanol extract of the whole plant. The isolated compound, oleic acid, eicosyl ester was found to be the most effective larvicide against A. aegypti (LC50/24 h -8.51 ppm) and C. quinquefasciatus (LC50/24 h - 12.5 ppm) than the crude methanol extract (LC50/24 h - 257.03 ppm and LC50/24 h - 281.83 ppm, respectively). The impact of oleic acid, eicosyl ester on reducing the activity of chitinase and ecdysone 20-monooxygenase was most prominent in both the target species, A. aegyptiand C. quinquefasciatus than the control. The results therefore suggest that the compound, oleic acid, eicosyl ester from Thalictrum javanicum may be considered as a potent source of mosquito larvicidal property. 	Indian_J_Pharm_Sci	D016428
22927926	20120829	Amyloid-? peptide binds to cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1.	Extracellular and intraneuronal accumulation of amyloid-beta aggregates has been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the precise mechanism of amyloid-beta neurotoxicity is not completely understood. Previous studies suggest that binding of amyloid-beta to a number of macromolecules has deleterious effects on cellular functions. Mitochondria were found to be the target for amyloid-beta, and mitochondrial dysfunction is well documented in AD. In the present study we have shown for the first time that A? 1-42 bound to a peptide comprising the amino-terminal region of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1. Phage clone, selected after screening of a human brain cDNA library expressed on M13 phage and bearing a 61 amino acid fragment of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, bound to A? 1-42 in ELISA as well as to A? aggregates present in AD brain. A? 1-42 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 co-immunoprecipitated from mitochondrial fraction of differentiated human neuroblastoma cells. Likewise, molecular dynamics simulation of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 and the A? 1-42 peptide complex resulted in a reliable helix-helix interaction, supporting the experimental results. The interaction between A? 1-42 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 may explain, in part, the diminished enzymatic activity of respiratory chain complex IV and subsequent neuronal metabolic dysfunction observed in AD.

26632718	20151204	Genetic Variations in Key MicroRNAs are Associated With the Survival of Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, noncoding RNA molecules involved in carcinogenesis. It has been identified that genetic variations in miRNAs contribute to cancer risk, prognosis, and survival. In the present study, we investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of several key miRNAs (miR-184, miR-218, and miR-124) were associated with the prognosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a clinical cohort study including 1001 cases. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We found that 5 SNPs were associated with NSCLC survival (rs919968, rs3775815, rs4867902, and rs6122390 in an additive model: adjusted HR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.02-1.29; adjusted HR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.67-0.91, adjusted HR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.09-1.41; adjusted HR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.07-1.36, respectively; rs298206 in a dominant model: HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.05-1.49). Even after the Bonferroni correction, 3 SNPs remained significant (adjusted P = 0.010, 0.010, and 0.032 for rs3775815, rs4867902, and rs6122390, respectively). Additionally, the combined analysis of these 5 SNPs showed a significant locus-dosage effect between number of unfavorable alleles (rs919968-A, rs3775815-C, rs4867902-G, rs6122390-A, and rs298206-T) and death risk of NSCLC (P for trend &lt; 0.001). A statistically significant multiplicative interaction was found between the genotypes of rs4867902 and surgical operation status (Pint = 0.013). These findings indicated that genetic variations in miRNAs (miR-184, miR-218, and miR-124) might be prognostic markers for NSCLC patients. 	Medicine_(Baltimore)	D016428 D013485
24114630	20131012	An interleukin-6 gene promoter polymorphism is associated with polycystic ovary syndrome in South Indian women.	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a most common endocrine disorder of reproductive age women. Interleukin-6 is involved in the pathophysiological characteristics associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The-174 G/C IL-6 gene promoter region single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may influence or modulate gene function and/or transcriptional efficiency. The current study was aimed to evaluate the association between IL-6 gene -174 G/C promoter polymorphism and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome in South Indian women. In the present study, we examined the genotypic and allele distribution among the PCOS patients (n?=?104) and controls (n?=?156). The genotypes of IL-6 -174 G/C SNP were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analysis. The allele frequency and genotype distributions of cases and controls were analyzed using Fisher's exact test. The genotype frequencies observed among the 104 cases and 156 controls were G/G 66.3?% and 49.4?%, G/C 29.8?% and 46.8?%, and C/C 3.8?% and 3.8?% (OR: 1.6226, CI: 1.0574-2.4899). The G and C allele frequencies were 81.25?% and 72.8?%, and 18.75?% and 27.2?%, respectively. The genotype and allele distribution revealed significant differences between PCOS patients and controls (all P values &lt; 0.05). Our findings showed a significant statistical association between IL-6 -174 G/C SNP and PCOS risk in South Indian women. The 'G' allele frequency influences significantly higher in PCOS patients than controls. However, the exact mechanism by which 'G' allele frequency influence PCOS patients is yet to be determined.

24083244	20131002	Comparative analyses of the ?-tubulin gene and molecular modeling reveal molecular insight into the colchicine resistance in kinetoplastids organisms.	Differential susceptibility to microtubule agents has been demonstrated between mammalian cells and kinetoplastid organisms such as Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma spp. The aims of this study were to identify and characterize the architecture of the putative colchicine binding site of Leishmania spp. and investigate the molecular basis of colchicine resistance. We cloned and sequenced the ?-tubulin gene of Leishmania (Viannia) guyanensis and established the theoretical 3D model of the protein, using the crystallographic structure of the bovine protein as template. We identified mutations on the Leishmania ?-tubulin gene sequences on regions related to the putative colchicine-binding pocket, which generate amino acid substitutions and changes in the topology of this region, blocking the access of colchicine. The same mutations were found in the ?-tubulin sequence of kinetoplastid organisms such as Trypanosoma cruzi, T. brucei, and T. evansi. Using molecular modelling approaches, we demonstrated that conformational changes include an elongation and torsion of an ?-helix structure and displacement to the inside of the pocket of one ?-sheet that hinders access of colchicine. We propose that kinetoplastid organisms show resistance to colchicine due to amino acids substitutions that generate structural changes in the putative colchicine-binding domain, which prevent colchicine access.

22357470	20120224	[Relationship between TIM-4 polymorphism and childhood asthma].	To elucidate whether the polymorphism of asthma immune regulator gene TIM-4 is associated with the risk of childhood allergic asthma in the southwest region of China. TIM-4 gene promoter region RS6882076 and intron RS4704727 were studied. PCR-RFLP was used to test the genotypes of two polymorphism loci among 579 cases (average 7.2 years old) of asthma and 524 controls (average 7.6 years old) in a case-control study. There were significant differences in the frequency of gene types at RS4704727 site between the asthma and the control groups (P&lt;0.01). The results of PCR-RFLP showed that the polyporphisms of RS6882076 and RS4704727 in TIM-4 gene were present in this study population. The frequency of T allele at the RS4704727 site in the asthma group was significantly lower than that in the control group (OR=1.603; 95%CI 1.304-1.971; P&lt;0.01). There were no significant differences in the frequencies of gene types and allele at RS6882076 site between the two groups (P&gt;0.05). RS4704727 polymorphism of TIM-4 gene may be associated with childhood asthma, providing a better understanding of the pathogenesis of childhood asthma in the Southwest region of China.

15878957	20050510	Constitutively active Gq impairs gonadotropin-releasing hormone-induced intracellular signaling and luteinizing hormone secretion in LbetaT2 cells.	Chronic GnRH treatment causes homologous desensitization by reducing GnRH receptor and Gq/11 expression and by down-regulating protein kinase C (PKC), cAMP, and calcium-dependent signaling. It also causes heterologous desensitization of other Gq-coupled receptors, but the mechanisms involved remain elusive. In this study, we investigated the effect of constitutive activation of Gq signaling on GnRH-induced signaling and LH secretion. We show that adenoviral expression of a constitutively active mutant Gq(Q209L) results in a state of GnRH resistance but does not alter GnRH receptor expression. We observed that Gq(Q209L) reduced expression of phospholipase C (PLC)beta1, a target of Gq in these cells, but not PLCbeta3 or PLCgamma1. Downstream of PLCbeta1, expression of novel PKC isoforms (delta and epsilon) was reduced. Adenoviral expression of a kinase-inactive, dominant-negative version of PKCdelta impaired GnRH activation of ERK, but not induction of c-Fos and LHbeta proteins, indicating that the novel PKCs signal to the ERK cascade. Despite reductions in PLCbeta1, calcium responses to GnRH were elevated in Gq(Q209L)-infected cells due to increased calcium influx through L-type calcium channels. Paradoxically, downstream calcium-dependent signaling and LH secretion were impaired. Taken together, these data demonstrate that prolonged activation of the Gq pathway desensitizes GnRH-induced signaling by selectively down-regulating the PLC-PKC-Ca2+ pathway, leading to reduced LHbeta synthesis and LH secretion.

25811190	20150327	Interaction of ATP with a small heat shock protein from Mycobacterium leprae: effect on its structure and function.	Adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) is an important phosphate metabolite abundantly found in Mycobacterium leprae bacilli. This pathogen does not derive ATP from its host but has its own mechanism for the generation of ATP. Interestingly, this molecule as well as several antigenic proteins act as bio-markers for the detection of leprosy. One such bio-marker is the 18 kDa antigen. This 18 kDa antigen is a small heat shock protein (HSP18) whose molecular chaperone function is believed to help in the growth and survival of the pathogen. But, no evidences of interaction of ATP with HSP18 and its effect on the structure and chaperone function of HSP18 are available in the literature. Here, we report for the first time evidences of &quot;HSP18-ATP&quot; interaction and its consequences on the structure and chaperone function of HSP18. TNP-ATP binding experiment and surface plasmon resonance measurement showed that HSP18 interacts with ATP with a sub-micromolar binding affinity. Comparative sequence alignment between M. leprae HSP18 and ?B-crystallin identified the sequence 49KADSLDIDIE58 of HSP18 as the Walker-B ATP binding motif. Molecular docking studies revealed that ?4-?8 groove/strands as an ATP interactive region in M. leprae HSP18. ATP perturbs the tertiary structure of HSP18 mildly and makes it less susceptible towards tryptic cleavage. ATP triggers exposure of additional hydrophobic patches at the surface of HSP18 and induces more stability against chemical and thermal denaturation. In vitro aggregation and thermal inactivation assays clearly revealed that ATP enhances the chaperone function of HSP18. Our studies also revealed that the alteration in the chaperone function of HSP18 is reversible and is independent of ATP hydrolysis. As the availability and binding of ATP to HSP18 regulates its chaperone function, this functional inflection may play an important role in the survival of M. leprae in hosts.

20927635	20101008	The mutation spectrum of the SLC25A13 gene in Chinese infants with intrahepatic cholestasis and aminoacidemia.	SLC25A13 gene mutations cause citrin deficiency, which leads to neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD). Information on the mutation spectrum of SLC25A13 in the Chinese population is limited. The aim of this study was to explore the mutation spectrum of the SLC25A13 gene in Chinese infants with intrahepatic cholestasis and various forms of aminoacidemia. Sequence analyses were performed on 39 infants with intrahepatic cholestasis and various forms of aminoacidemia. Novel mutations were subjected to homology and structural analyses. Western blots were performed when liver specimens available. Genetic testing revealed the presence of SLC25A13 gene mutations (9 heterozygotes, 6 homozygotes and 13 compound heterozygotes) in 28 infants. Subsequent Western blot analysis revealed 22 cases of citrin deficiency, accounting for 56.4% of the 39 patients. Twelve types of mutations, including nine known mutations and three novel mutations, were found. Of the 49 mutated alleles, known ones include 851del4 (26 alleles, 53.1%), 1638ins23 (6 alleles, 12.2%), IVSl6ins3kb (3 alleles, 6.1%), IVS6+5G&gt;A (2 alleles, 4.1%), E601K (2 alleles, 4.1%) and IVS11+1G&gt;A, R184X, R360X and R585H (1 allele each, 2.0%). The three novel mutations were a splice site change (IVS6+1G&gt;A), a deletion mutation (1092_1095delT) and a missense mutation (L85P), each in one allele. The mutation spectrum of the SLC25A13 gene in a Chinese population of infants with intrahepatic cholestasis with various forms of aminoacidemia was found to be different from that of other population groups in East Asia. The SLC25A13 gene mutation is the most important cause of infantile intrahepatic cholestasis with various forms of aminoacidemia. 	J._Gastroenterol.	D016428 D013485
11598031	20011013	Characterization of FasG segments required for 987P fimbria-mediated binding to piglet glycoprotein receptors.	The 987P fimbriae of enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli bind to both glycoprotein and glycolipid receptors on the brush borders of piglet enterocytes. A mutation in lysine residue 117 of the adhesive subunit FasG [fasG(K117A)] previously shown to abrogate 987P binding to the lipid receptor sulfatide did not affect the interaction with the glycoprotein receptors. Both the fimbriae and the FasG subunits of the wild type and the fasG(K117A) mutant bound to the glycoprotein receptors, confirming that lysine 117 was not required for binding to the glycoprotein receptors. Truncated FasG molecules were used to identify domains required for glycoprotein receptor recognition. At least two segments which did not include lysine117, namely, residues 211 (glutamine) to 220 (serine) and 20 (aspartic acid) to 41 (serine), were shown to be involved in the FasG-glycoprotein receptor interactions by ligand-blotting assays. Changing isoleucine 217 or leucine 215 of FasG to alanine abolished the property of a truncated FasG fusion protein to inhibit 987P recognition of its glycoprotein receptors. Thus, the K117 residue of FasG is required only for binding to the glycolipid receptor, whereas the newly identified hydrophobic residues of the FasG subunit are required specifically for the recognition of the glycoprotein receptor. Taken together, our data indicate that different residues of the FasG adhesin are important in 987P fimbrial binding to sulfatide and glycoprotein receptors, suggesting different mechanisms of interaction.

23555764	20130405	Bapineuzumab alters a? composition: implications for the amyloid cascade hypothesis and anti-amyloid immunotherapy.	The characteristic neuropathological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other lines of evidence support the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Viewing amyloid deposits as the prime instigator of dementia has now led to clinical trials of multiple strategies to remove or prevent their formation. We performed neuropathological and biochemical assessments of 3 subjects treated with bapineuzumab infusions. Histological analyses were conducted to quantify amyloid plaque densities, Braak stages and the extent of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Amyloid-? (A?) species in frontal and temporal lobe samples were quantified by ELISA. Western blots of amyloid-? precursor protein (A?PP) and its C-terminal (CT) fragments as well as tau species were performed. Bapineuzumab-treated (Bapi-AD) subjects were compared to non-immunized age-matched subjects with AD (NI-AD) and non-demented control (NDC) cases. Our study revealed that Bapi-AD subjects exhibited overall amyloid plaque densities similar to those of NI-AD cases. In addition, CAA was moderate to severe in NI-AD and Bapi-AD patients. Although histologically-demonstrable leptomeningeal, cerebrovascular and neuroparenchymal-amyloid densities all appeared unaffected by treatment, A? peptide profiles were significantly altered in Bapi-AD subjects. There was a trend for reduction in total A?42 levels as well as an increase in A?40 which led to a corresponding significant decrease in A?42:A?40 ratio in comparison to NI-AD subjects. There were no differences in the levels of A?PP, CT99 and CT83 or tau species between Bapi-AD and NI-AD subjects. The remarkable alteration in A? profiles reveals a dynamic amyloid production in which removal and depositional processes were apparently perturbed by bapineuzumab therapy. Despite the alteration in biochemical composition, all 3 immunized subjects exhibited continued cognitive decline. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061 D013485
23791841	20130625	An ENU mutagenesis-derived mouse model with a dominant Jak1 mutation resembling phenotypes of systemic autoimmune disease.	Within the Munich, Germany, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mouse mutagenesis program, we isolated a dominant Jak1 mouse model resembling phenotypic characteristics related to autoimmune disease. Chromosomal sequencing revealed a new Jak1 (p.Ser645Pro) point mutation at the conserved serine of the pseudokinase domain, corresponding to a somatic human mutation (p.Ser646Phe) inducing a constitutive activation of the Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT pathway. Morphologically, all Jak1(S645P+/-) mice showed a progressive structural deterioration of ears starting at the age of 4 months, with mononuclear cell infiltration into the dermis. Female mutant mice, in particular, developed severe skin lesions in the neck from 7 months of age. The IHC analysis of these lesions showed an activation of Stat3 downstream to Jak1(S645P) and elevated tissue levels of IL-6. Histopathological analysis of liver revealed a nodular regenerative hyperplasia. In the spleen, the number of Russell bodies was doubled, correlating with significant increased levels of all immunoglobulin isotypes and anti-DNA antibodies in serum. Older mutant mice developed thrombocytopenia and altered microcytic red blood cell counts. Jak1(S645P+/-) mice showed phenotypes related to impaired bone metabolism as increased carboxy-terminal collagen cross-link-1 levels and alkaline phosphatase activities in plasma, hypophosphatemia, and strongly decreased bone morphometric values. Taken together, Jak1(S645P+/-) mice showed an increased activation of the IL-6-JAK-STAT pathway leading to a systemic lupus erythematosus-like phenotype and offering a new valuable tool to study the role of the JAK/STAT pathway in disease development.

17280870	20070207	Evolutionary paradigm of chloroquine-resistant malaria in India.	Drug pressure in the field is believed to be responsible for the emergence of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes malaria. Variants of the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene have been shown to be responsible for conferring resistance to the commonly used drug chloroquine. In particular, an amino acid mutation, K76T, was shown to have a strong positive correlation with the chloroquine-resistant varieties of malaria parasites. Global studies have reported highly reduced genetic diversity surrounding K76T in the pfcrt gene, which indicates that the mutation has been a target of positive Darwinian natural selection. However, two recent studies of P. falciparum in India found high genetic diversity in the pfcrt gene, which, at first sight, do not support the role of natural selection in the evolution of chloroquine resistance in India.

22699782	20120616	VEGF polymorphisms may be associated with susceptibility to colorectal cancer: a case-control study.	The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has a pivotal role in angiogenesis. VEGF levels appear to be influenced by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the VEGF gene. The aim of this study was to assess the importance of four VEGF SNPs in modulating susceptibility to colorectal cancer. We have genotyped 223 patients with colorectal cancer and 264 healthy individuals for the -2578C&gt;A, -1498C&gt;T, -634G&gt;C and +936C&gt;T VEGF SNPs using Taqman probes in polymerase chain reactions. The -2578 A, -1498 C and -634 G alleles were more frequently detected in CRC patients compared to healthy controls. Moreover, the haplotype -2578C/-1498T was less frequent in CRC patients while the -2578A/-1498C haplotype was significantly more frequent in patients compared to healthy controls. VEGF -2578C&gt;A and -1498C&gt;T SNPs and -2578/-1498 haplotypes appear to be associated with susceptibility to CRC. 	Cancer_Biomark	D016428 D013485
25009288	20140711	R9AP targeting to rod outer segments is independent of rhodopsin and is guided by the SNARE homology domain.	In vertebrate photoreceptor cells, rapid recovery from light excitation is dependent on the RGS9?G?5 GTPase-activating complex located in the light-sensitive outer segment organelle. RGS9?G?5 is tethered to the outer segment membranes by its membrane anchor, R9AP. Recent studies indicated that RGS9?G?5 possesses targeting information that excludes it from the outer segment and that this information is overridden by association with R9AP, which allows outer segment targeting of the entire complex. It was also proposed that R9AP itself does not contain specific targeting information and instead is delivered to the outer segment in the same post-Golgi vesicles as rhodopsin, because they are the most abundant transport vesicles in photoreceptor cells. In this study, we revisited this concept by analyzing R9AP targeting in rods of wild-type and rhodopsin-knockout mice. We found that the R9AP targeting mechanism does not require the presence of rhodopsin and further demonstrated that R9AP is actively targeted in rods by its SNARE homology domain.

2829709	19871001	Nucleotide sequence changes in thymidine kinase gene of herpes simplex virus type 2 clones from an isolate of a patient treated with acyclovir.	To identify the nucleotide changes that occur in drug-induced thymidine kinase (TK) mutants of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), we compared the nucleotide sequences of the tk genes of two mutant HSV-2 clones isolated from a patient who had been treated with acyclovir [9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine; ACV] with the nucleotide sequence of the parental TK+ HSV-2(8703) strain isolated from the same patient. One of the mutants, TK-altered (TKA) HSV-2(9637), was ACV resistant but induced the incorporation of [14C]thymidine into the DNA of infected rabbit skin cells. The nucleotide sequence of the tk gene of mutant TKA HSV-2(9637) had a single change (G to A) at nucleotide 668, which would cause an arginine-to-histidine substitution at amino acid residue 223 of the TK polypeptide. The second ACV-resistant mutant, TK- HSV-2(8710), did not induce detectable incorporation of [14C]thymidine into the DNA of infected rabbit skin cells. This mutant exhibited a deletion of a single base at nucleotide 217 of its nucleotide sequence. This deletion would cause a frameshift mutation at amino acid residue 73 and chain termination at amino acid residue 86 of the TK polypeptide. The nucleotide sequence of TK+ HSV-2(8703) was the same as that of the laboratory strain, TK+ HSV-2(333). The nucleotide sequence of a bromodeoxyuridine-resistant TK- HSV-2(333) mutant of TK+ HSV-2(333) also exhibited a single-base deletion, but at nucleotide 439. This deletion would cause a frameshift mutation at amino acid residue 147 and chain termination at amino acid residue 182. The frameshift mutations of TK- HSV(8710) and TK- HSV-2(333), respectively, occurred in sequences in which C was repeated three times and G was repeated seven times. The results raise the possibility that TK- frameshift mutations of HSV-2 may be common. 	Antimicrob._Agents_Chemother.	D016428 D013487
21957465	20110930	Sensory experience differentially modulates the mRNA expression of the polysialyltransferases ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV in postnatal mouse visual cortex.	Polysialic acid (PSA) is a unique carbohydrate composed of a linear homopolymer of ?-2,8 linked sialic acid, and is mainly attached to the fifth immunoglobulin-like domain of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in vertebrate neural system. In the brain, PSA is exclusively synthesized by the two polysialyltransferases ST8SiaII (also known as STX) and ST8SiaIV (also known as PST). By modulating adhesive property of NCAM, PSA plays a critical role in several neural development processes such as cell migration, neurite outgrowth, axon pathfinding, synaptogenesis and activity-dependent plasticity. The expression of PSA is temporally and spatially regulated during neural development and a tight regulation of PSA expression is essential to its biological function. In mouse visual cortex, PSA is downregulated following eye opening and its decrease allows the maturation of GABAergic synapses and the opening of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity. Relatively little is known about how PSA levels are regulated by sensory experience and neuronal activity. Here, we demonstrate that while both ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV mRNA levels decrease around the time of eye opening in mouse visual cortex, only ST8SiaII mRNA level reduction is regulated by sensory experience. Using an organotypic culture system from mouse visual cortex, we further show that ST8SiaII gene expression is regulated by spiking activity and NMDA-mediated excitation. Further, we show that both ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV mRNA levels are positively regulated by PKC-mediated signaling. Therefore, sensory experience-dependent ST8SiaII gene expression regulates PSA levels in postnatal visual cortex, thus acting as molecular link between visual activity and PSA expression.

11923365	20020330	In vitro activity of nystatin compared with those of liposomal nystatin, amphotericin B, and fluconazole against clinical Candida isolates.	We investigated the in vitro activity of nystatin and liposomal nystatin against 103 Candida isolates to determine the effect of both time and medium on MICs. We also compared the nystatin MICs with those of amphotericin B and fluconazole. Testing was performed in accordance with the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards M27-A microdilution methodology with RPMI 1640, RPMI 1640 supplemented with glucose to 2% (RPMI-2), and antibiotic medium 3 supplemented with glucose to 2% (AM3). While nystatin MICs were similar to or slightly lower than liposomal nystatin MICs in RPMI 1640 and RPMI-2, they were markedly higher than liposomal nystatin MICs in AM3. Use of AM3 and determination of the MIC after 24 h of incubation provided a slightly wider range of liposomal nystatin MICs (0.06 to &gt;16 microg/ml). Under these conditions, the MICs at which 90% of isolates were inhibited of nystatin and liposomal nystatin were 2 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. Nystatin and liposomal nystatin in general showed good activity against all Candida spp. tested. Although the MICs of nystatin and liposomal nystatin tended to rise in parallel with the amphotericin B MICs, nystatin and liposomal nystatin MICs of 1 to 2 and 0.5 to 1 microg/ml, respectively, were obtained for seven and six, respectively, of nine isolates for which amphotericin B MICs were &gt;or=0.25 microg/ml. No correlation between fluconazole and nystatin or liposomal nystatin MICs was observed. As amphotericin B MICs of &gt;or=0.25 microg/ml correlate with in vitro resistance, these results suggest that liposomal nystatin might have activity against some amphotericin B-resistant isolates. In vivo testing in animal models is required for clarification of this issue. 	J._Clin._Microbiol.	D003160 D023362 D016428 D013485
22652272	20120602	Correlation of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms with homocysteine metabolism in healthy Lebanese adults.	Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with several vascular and teratogenic conditions. Determinants of total homocysteine concentrations include genetic and nutritional factors. This study assesses the relation between homocysteine concentrations and MTHFR gene polymorphisms at two common alleles (C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131)) as well as other predictors of homocysteine (folate, vitamin B(12), body mass index (BMI), age, and gender) in a group of healthy Lebanese: 109 males and 124 females aged 17-55years. We used serum for the determination of homocysteine, folate and vitamin B(12) levels and blood drawn in EDTA tubes for molecular analysis of MTHFR polymorphisms. Hyperhomocysteinemia was present in 59/233 (25.3%) of the subjects, with male/female ratio of 1.95. Multivariable regression analysis showed that homocysteine levels were negatively related to folate and vitamin B(12) and positively related to male gender and C677T homozygosity; but not A1298C polymorphism, BMI or age. The prevalence of wild, heterozygous, and homozygous C677T genotypes was 45.0%, 43.3% and 11.6%, respectively; with a carrier frequency of 54.9% and allelic frequency of 33.3%. The A1298C genotypic prevalence was 39.5%, 30.9%, and 29.6% respectively; with a carrier frequency of 60.5% and allelic frequency of 45.1%. C677T/A1289C compound heterozygosity was present in 47/233 (20.2%) of volunteers. In this first pilot study, gender, folate, vitamin B(12) and C677T mutational status could explain around 32% of homocysteine variations. Future larger studies are recommended to investigate other predictors of homocysteine variation and combine them with markers explored in this and other studies, in order to evaluate their impact on vascular and/or congenital diseases.

25206310	20140911	Simeprevir for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection.	Simeprevir (TMC435, Olysio?), a second-generation hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor, has been recently approved for the treatment of genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. This molecule has very different characteristics from first-generation protease inhibitors. Results from trials show that simeprevir is highly effective and safe, with few adverse events. We discuss the specific features of this new treatment option for HCV infection, in terms of in vitro data, pharmacological data, and clinical trials. We also discuss the impact of Q80K polymorphism at baseline. Studies evaluating interferon-free regimens with simeprevir are ongoing. Future combinations of two or more direct-acting antiviral agents, targeting different viral enzymes and with synergistic antiviral effects, will be approved, allowing treatment of pan-genotypic HCV with optimized sustained virologic responses. Simeprevir will undoubtedly be part of future treatment strategies. 	Pharmgenomics_Pers_Med	D016428 D016454
19718781	20090901	Antisense oligonucleotide treatment for a pseudoexon-generating mutation in the NPC1 gene causing Niemann-Pick type C disease.	Niemann-Pick type C disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in either the NPC1 or NPC2 gene. While most of the mutations are missense, a few splicing mutations have also been described. We identified and characterized a novel point mutation c.1554-1009G&gt;A located in intron 9 of the NPC1 gene in a Spanish patient. Sequencing of the cDNA from the patient showed that this intronic mutation creates a cryptic donor splice site resulting in the incorporation of 194 bp of intron 9 as a new exon (pseudoexon) in the mRNA. This new transcript bears a premature termination codon and is degraded by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay mechanism. Experimental confirmation that the point mutation generates the inclusion of a pseudoexon in the mRNA was obtained using a minigene. A specific antisense morpholino oligonucleotide targeted to the cryptic splice site was designed and transfected into fibroblasts from the patient. Using this approach, normal splicing was restored. These results demonstrate the importance of screening deep intronic regions and support the efficacy of antisense therapeutics for the treatment of diseases caused by pseudoexon-generating mutations.

18400985	20080411	Bestrophin Cl- channels are highly permeable to HCO3-.	Bestrophin-1 (Best1) is a Cl(-) channel that is linked to various retinopathies in both humans and dogs. Dysfunction of the Best1 Cl(-) channel has been proposed to cause retinopathy because of altered Cl(-) transport across the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In addition to Cl(-), many Cl(-) channels also transport HCO3(-). Because HCO3(-) is physiologically important in pH regulation and in fluid and ion transport across the RPE, we measured the permeability and conductance of bestrophins to HCO3(-) relative to Cl(-). Four human bestrophin homologs (hBest1, hBest2, hBest3, and hBest4) and mouse Best2 (mBest2) were expressed in HEK cells, and the relative HCO3(-) permeability (P HCO3/PCl) and conductance (G HCO3/GCl) were determined. P HCO3/PCl was calculated from the change in reversal potential (Erev) produced by replacing extracellular Cl(-) with HCO3(-). hBest1 was highly permeable to HCO3(-) (P HCO3)/PCl = approximately 0.44). hBest2, hBest4, and mBest2 had an even higher relative HCO3(-) permeability (P HCO3/PCl = 0.6-0.7). All four bestrophins had HCO3(-) conductances that were nearly the same as Cl(-) (G HCO3/GCl = 0.9-1.1). Extracellular Na+ did not affect the permeation of hBest1 to HCO3(-). At physiological HCO3(-) concentration, HCO3(-) was also highly conductive. The hBest1 disease-causing mutations Y85H, R92C, and W93C abolished both Cl(-) and HCO3(-) currents equally. The V78C mutation changed P HCO3/PCl and G HCO3/GCl of mBest2 channels. These results raise the possibility that disease-causing mutations in hBest1 produce disease by altering HCO3(-) homeostasis as well as Cl(-) transport in the retina. 	Am._J._Physiol.,_Cell_Physiol.

23276717	20130102	SWI/SNF gene variants and glioma risk and outcome.	The human SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex plays essential roles in a variety of cellular processes and has been implicated in human cancer. However, the role of germline genetic variants in this complex in relation to cancer risk is not well studied. We assessed the association of 16 variants in the catalytic subunits (SMARCA2 and SMARCA4) of the SWI/SNF complex with the risk of glioma subtypes (lower grade astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma and glioblastoma [GBM]) and with mortality from high-grade tumors (GBM) in a multicenter US case-control study that included 561 cases and 574 controls. Associations were estimated with odds ratios (OR, for risk) or hazards ratios (HR, for mortality) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). False discovery rate (FDR-q) was used to control for multiple testing in risk associations. None of the investigated SNPs was associated with overall glioma risk. However, analyses according to histological subtypes revealed a statistically significant increased risk of oligodendroglioma in association with SMARCA2 rs2296212 (OR = 4.05, 95% CI = 1.11-14.80, P = 0.030, q = 0.08) and rs4741651 (OR = 4.68, 95% CI = 1.43-15.30, P = 0.011, q = 0.08) and SMARCA4 rs11672232 (OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.01-3.58, P = 0.048, q = 0.08) and rs12232780 (OR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.06-4.33, P = 0.035, q = 0.08). No significant risk associations were observed for GBM or lower grade astrocytoma. Suggestive associations with GBM mortality were not validated in the Cancer Genome Atlas. Our findings suggest that genetic variants in SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 influence the risk of oligodendroglioma. Further research is warranted on the SWI/SNF complex genes and epigenetic mechanisms more generally in the development of glioma in adults. 	Cancer_Epidemiol	D003160 D016428 D052061 D013485
25722982	20150228	The influence of tea tree oil (Melaleuca alternifolia) on fluconazole activity against fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans strains.	The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity of fluconazole against 32 clinical strains of fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans, and C. albicans ATCC 10231 reference strain, after their exposure to sublethal concentrations of tea tree oil (TTO) or its main bioactive component terpinen-4-ol. For all tested fluconazole-resistant C. albicans strains TTO and terpinen-4-ol minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were low, ranging from 0.06% to 0.5%. The 24-hour exposure of fluconazole-resistant C. albicans strains to fluconazole with sublethal dose of TTO enhanced fluconazole activity against these strains. Overall, 62.5% of isolates were classified as susceptible, 25.0% exhibited intermediate susceptibility, and 12.5% were resistant. For all of the tested clinical strains the fluconazole MIC decreased from an average of 244.0 ?g/mL to an average of 38.46 ?g/mL, and the fluconazole minimal fungicidal concentrations (MFC) decreased from an average of 254.67 ?g/mL to an average of 66.62 ?g/mL. Terpinen-4-ol was found to be more active than TTO, and strongly enhanced fluconazole activity against fluconazole-resistant C. albicans strains. The results of this study demonstrate that combining natural substances such as TTO and conventional drug such as fluconazole, may help treat difficult yeast infections. 	Biomed_Res_Int	D016428
21496239	20110419	Physiological and behavioral reactions elicited by simulated and real-life visual and acoustic helicopter stimuli in dairy goats.	Anecdotal reports and a few scientific publications suggest that flyovers of helicopters at low altitude may elicit fear- or anxiety-related behavioral reactions in grazing feral and farm animals. We investigated the behavioral and physiological stress reactions of five individually housed dairy goats to different acoustic and visual stimuli from helicopters and to combinations of these stimuli under controlled environmental (indoor) conditions. The visual stimuli were helicopter animations projected on a large screen in front of the enclosures of the goats. Acoustic and visual stimuli of a tractor were also presented. On the final day of the study the goats were exposed to two flyovers (altitude 50 m and 75 m) of a Chinook helicopter while grazing in a pasture. Salivary cortisol, behavior, and heart rate of the goats were registered before, during and after stimulus presentations. The goats reacted alert to the visual and/or acoustic stimuli that were presented in their room. They raised their heads and turned their ears forward in the direction of the stimuli. There was no statistically reliable rise of the average velocity of moving of the goats in their enclosure and no increase of the duration of moving during presentation of the stimuli. Also there was no increase in heart rate or salivary cortisol concentration during the indoor test sessions. Surprisingly, no physiological and behavioral stress responses were observed during the flyover of a Chinook at 50 m, which produced a peak noise of 110 dB. We conclude that the behavior and physiology of goats are unaffected by brief episodes of intense, adverse visual and acoustic stimulation such as the sight and noise of overflying helicopters. The absence of a physiological stress response and of elevated emotional reactivity of goats subjected to helicopter stimuli is discussed in relation to the design and testing schedule of this study.

22048266	20111104	Exploratory investigation on functional significance of ETS2 and SIM2 genes in Down syndrome.	Trisomy of the 21{st} chromosome leads to an over dosage of several regulatory genes in Down syndrome (DS). Though allelic and genotypic combinations formed between genes are interesting, till date, this particular area has never been explored in DS. In the present investigation four SNPs in two transcription factors, Single minded 2 (SIM2) and V-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog2 (ETS&lt;formula&gt;2&lt;/formula&gt;), located in the 21{st} chromosome were genotyped to understand their role in DS. Genomic DNA of eastern Indian probands with DS (N=132), their parents (N=209) and ethnically matched controls (N=149) was subjected to PCR-based analyses of functionally important SNPs followed by statistical analyses. ETS2 rs461155 showed high heterozygosity in DS. Significantly lower frequency of SIM2 C-G haplotype (rs2073601-rs2073416) was noticed in individuals with DS (P value =0.01669) and their fathers (P value=0.01185). Significantly lower frequency of the A-C-C-G with higher frequency of A-C-A-G haplotypes was also noticed in subjects with DS (P value =0.02089 and 0.00588 respectively). Data obtained indicate that the rs2073601 'A' allele, responsible for nonsynonymous substitution of leucine to methionine, may have some role in DS in this population. 	Dis._Markers	D016428 D013485
15911879	20050525	Cdk5 phosphorylation of huntingtin reduces its cleavage by caspases: implications for mutant huntingtin toxicity.	Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the huntingtin (htt) protein. Mutant htt toxicity is exposed after htt cleavage by caspases and other proteases release NH(2)-terminal fragments containing the polyQ expansion. Here, we show htt interacts and colocalizes with cdk5 in cellular membrane fractions. Cdk5 phosphorylates htt at Ser434, and this phosphorylation reduces caspase-mediated htt cleavage at residue 513. Reduced mutant htt cleavage resulting from cdk5 phosphorylation attenuated aggregate formation and toxicity in cells expressing the NH(2)-terminal 588 amino acids (htt588) of mutant htt. Cdk5 activity is reduced in the brains of HD transgenic mice compared with controls. This result can be accounted for by the polyQ-expanded htt fragments reducing the interaction between cdk5 and its activator p35. These data predict that the ability of cdk5 phosphorylation to protect against htt cleavage, aggregation, and toxicity is compromised in cells expressing toxic fragments of htt. 	J._Cell_Biol.

17242337	20070124	Muscle coenzyme Q10 deficiencies in ataxia with oculomotor apraxia 1.	APTX gene mutations responsible for ataxia-oculomotor apraxia 1 (AOA1) were identified in a family previously reported with ataxia and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) deficiency. We measured muscle CoQ10 levels in six patients with AOA1 and found decreased levels in five. Patients homozygous for the W279X mutation had lower values (p = 0.003). A therapeutic trial of CoQ10 may be warranted in patients with AOA1. 	Neurology	D016428
27034675	20160402	High Performance Liquid Chromatographic Assay for the Simultaneous Determination of Posaconazole and Vincristine in Rat Plasma.	Purpose. Developing a validated HPLC-DAD method for simultaneous determination of posaconazole (PSZ) and vincristine (VCR) in rat plasma. Methods. PSZ, VCR, and itraconazole (ITZ) were extracted from 200??L plasma using diethyl ether in the presence of 0.1?M sodium hydroxide solution. The organic layer was evaporated in vacuo and dried residue was reconstituted and injected through HC-C18 (4.6 ? 250?mm, 5??m) column. In the mobile phase, acetonitrile and 0.015?M potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate (30?:?70 to 80?:?20, linear gradient over 7 minutes) pumped at 1.5?mL/min. VCR and PSZ were measured at 220 and 262?nm, respectively. Two Sprague Dawley rats were orally dosed PSZ followed by iv dosing of VCR and serial blood sampling was performed. Results. VCR, PSZ, and ITZ were successfully separated within 11?min. Calibration curves were linear over the range of 50-5000?ng/mL for both drugs. The CV% and % error of the mean were ?18% and limit of quantitation was 50?ng/mL for both drugs. Rat plasma concentrations of PSZ and VCR were simultaneously measured up to 72?h and their calculated pharmacokinetics parameters were comparable to the literature. Conclusion. The assay was validated as per ICH guidelines and is appropriate for pharmacokinetics drug-drug interaction studies. 	Int_J_Anal_Chem	D016428
15199365	20040617	Association between the PPARalpha L162V polymorphism, plasma lipoprotein levels, and atherosclerotic disease in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 and in nondiabetic controls.	Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) regulates genes involved in lipoprotein metabolism, hemostasis, and inflammation. It thus represents a candidate gene for the risk of dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and coronary heart disease (CHD). Nonesterified fatty acids are PPARalpha ligands and their levels are increased in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM-2). The effects of the polymorphism of PPARalpha on plasma lipids and atherosclerosis development have been until now contradictory. The present study was performed to evaluate the association between the PPARalpha polymorphism L162V and the presence of dyslipidemia and/or atherosclerotic disease in patients with DM-2 in comparison with nondiabetic controls. We determined this polymorphism in 404 subjects with DM-2 and in 438 age and sex-matched nondiabetic controls. The V allele was present in 9.4% of patients with DM-2 and in 11.4% of the control group (P =.34). There was no significant association between the presence of the polymorphism and body mass index. There was no association between the polymorphism and lipoprotein concentrations in either group, independent of lipid-lowering therapy. In patients with DM-2, there was a trend towards a lower prevalence of atherosclerosis in carriers versus noncarriers of the V allele (P =.0837). In the control group, the presence of the V allele was not associated with an altered prevalence of atherosclerotic disease (P =.45). Likewise, there was a trend towards lower CHD prevalence in carriers versus noncarriers of the V allele (P =.0622). The presence of the polymorphism was not associated with CHD in the control group (P =.80). The data suggest that the PPARalpha polymorphism L162V might protect against the development of atherosclerosis or CHD in patients with DM-2. The absence of an association between the polymorphism and plasma lipoprotein concentrations may suggest that these protective effects are exerted directly on the arterial wall. 	Am._Heart_J.

26649000	20151210	Association between codon 399 polymorphism in the X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 gene and risk of prostate cancer in Asians: A study of 4,479 cases and 4,281 controls.	The polymorphism in codon 399 of the X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) gene may subtly alter structure of DNA repair enzymes and modulate the repair capacity. Impaired DNA repair can lead to the development of cancers such as prostate cancer (PCA). Although the association between the XRCC1 codon 399 polymorphism and PCA risk has been extensively reported, the results have been ambiguous. We conducted an updated analysis of 18 case-control studies to determine the association between the XRCC1 codon 399 polymorphism and PCA risk. We performed a literature search of the PubMed database to identify all eligible articles that reported this association. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were evaluated to assess the association. Significant associations between PCA risk and XRCC1 codon 399 polymorphism were found (such as A-allele vs. G-allele: OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.01-1.23). Moreover, subgroup analysis based on ethnicity revealed similar significant associations in Asians (such as AA vs. GG: OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.19-1.97). Egger's test did not reveal the presence of a publication bias. Our updated analysis provides evidence for significant association between XRCC1 codon 399 polymorphism and PCA risk. Further carefully designed studies should be performed. 	Pak_J_Med_Sci	D016428
24442994	20140121	Association of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) gene polymorphisms with the susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis: a case-control study.	To investigate the association between receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) gene polymorphisms and the susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in a Chinese Han population. Three hundred and fifty-two AS patients and 299 age- and gender-matched controls were recruited in this study. Peripheral blood samples were collected from all the subjects and the genomic DNA was then extracted. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the RANKL gene (rs2277438, rs7984870 and rs9533156) were genotyped using the TaqMan assay. The frequencies of alleles and genotypes were compared between AS patients and normal controls. The distributions of genotype frequencies in rs2277438 were significantly different between AS patients and normal controls (P &lt; 0.05). The frequency of G allele of SNP rs2277438 in AS patients was significantly higher than that in normal controls (P &lt; 0.05). The frequencies of genotypes with G allele (GG and AG) were significantly higher in AS patients when compared with normal controls (OR = 1.573, 95 % CI 1.151-2.150, P &lt; 0.05). Neither the genotype frequencies nor the allele frequencies of rs7984870 and rs9533156 were found to be significantly different between AS patients and normal controls (P &gt; 0.05). The current study demonstrated that SNP rs2277438 of the RANKL gene was associated with the susceptibility of AS in a Chinese Han population. Genotypes with G allele (GG and AG) were identified as the risk factors for the occurrence of AS. 	J_Orthop_Sci	D016428 D013485
18754871	20080830	Expression and mutation analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.	The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-RAS-RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade is an important pathway in cancer development and recent reports show that EGFR and its downstream signaling molecules are mutated in a number of cancers. We have analyzed 91 Japanese head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and 12 HNSCC cell lines for mutations in EGFR, ErbB2, and K-ras. Exons encoding the hot-spot regions in the tyrosine kinase domain of both EGFR (exons 18, 19, and 21) and ErbB2 (exons 18-23), as well as exons 1 and 2 of K-ras were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced directly. EGFR expression was also analyzed in 65 HNSCC patients using immunohistochemistry. Only one silent mutation, C836T, was found in exon 21 of EGFR in the UT-SCC-16A cell line and its corresponding metastasic cell line UT-SCC-16B. No other mutation was found in EGFR, ErbB2, or K-ras. All tumors showed EGFR expression. In 21 (32%) tumors, EGFR was expressed weakly (+1). In 27 (42%) tumors it was expressed (+2) moderately, and in 17 (26%) tumors high expression (+3) was detected. Overexpression (+2, +3) was found in 44 tumors (68%). A worse tumor differentiation and a positive nodal stage were significantly associated with EGFR overexpression (P = 0.02, P = 0.032, respectively). Similar to patients from western ethnicity, mutations are absent or rare in Japanese HNSCC. Protein overexpression rather than mutation might be responsible for activation of the EGFR pathway in HNSCC. 	Cancer_Sci.	D016428 D013485
20534768	20100611	OPG and RANK polymorphisms are both associated with cortical bone mineral density: findings from a metaanalysis of the Avon longitudinal study of parents and children and gothenburg osteoporosis and obesity determinants cohorts.	Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reliably associated with areal bone mineral density (aBMD) in genome-wide association studies of mostly older subjects. We aimed to test those SNPs for an association with peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) bone measures in two young cohorts. We genotyped nine SNPs from the most promising aBMD candidates in a cohort of 15-yr-olds [in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)] and carried out association analysis with several tibial pQCT measures to determine whether these candidates were important during adolescent growth and which particular skeletal parameters each of the candidates were acting upon. We also carried out a metaanalysis of the SNPs for association with cortical bone mineral density (BMDC) in ALSPAC and a similar male-only study (Gothenburg Osteoporosis and Obesity Determinants). In the ALSPAC cohort, we found a significant association between RANK SNP (rs3018362) and BMDC but not any of the other pQCT bone measures. In the metaanalysis, we found the OPG SNP (rs4355801) and the RANK SNP (rs3018362) to be significantly associated with BMDC. We also found suggestive evidence of an association between the MARK3 SNP (rs2010281) and BMDC but with a direction of effect opposite to that previously reported. The association of genes from the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway and BMDC provides new insight into how this system might affect the skeleton, confirming it to be associated with volumetric cortical bone density but observing no relationship with bone size.

21298086	20110208	Bub1-mediated adaptation of the spindle checkpoint.	During cell division, the spindle checkpoint ensures accurate chromosome segregation by monitoring the kinetochore-microtubule interaction and delaying the onset of anaphase until each pair of sister chromosomes is properly attached to microtubules. The spindle checkpoint is deactivated as chromosomes start moving toward the spindles in anaphase, but the mechanisms by which this deactivation and adaptation to prolonged mitotic arrest occur remain obscure. Our results strongly suggest that Cdc28-mediated phosphorylation of Bub1 at T566 plays an important role for the degradation of Bub1 in anaphase, and the phosphorylation is required for adaptation of the spindle checkpoint to prolonged mitotic arrest.

15677321	20050129	Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor/GAPDH complex augments Ca2+ release via locally derived NADH.	NADH regulates the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum by modulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R), accounting for the augmented calcium release of hypoxic cells. We report selective binding of IP3R to GAPDH, whose activity leads to the local generation of NADH to regulate intracellular calcium signaling. This interaction requires cysteines 992 and 995 of IP3R and C150 of GAPDH. Addition of native GAPDH and NAD+ to WT IP3R stimulates calcium release, whereas no stimulation occurs with C992S/995S IP3R that cannot bind GAPDH. Thus, the IP3R/GAPDH interaction likely enables cellular energy dynamics to impact calcium signaling. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 D013487
17117362	20061123	DGAT1 K232A polymorphism in Brazilian cattle breeds.	Recent reports identified DGAT1 (EC 2.3.1.20) harboring a lysine to alanine substitution (K232A) as a candidate gene with a strong effect on milk production traits. Our objective was to estimate the frequency of the DGAT1 K232A polymorphism in the main Zebu and Taurine breeds in Brazil as well as in Zebu x Taurine crossbreds as a potential QTL for marker-assisted selection. Samples of 331 animals from the main Brazilian breeds, Nellore, Guzerat, Red Sindhi, Gyr, Holstein, and Gyr x Holstein F1 were genotyped for DGAT1 K232A polymorphism (A and K alleles) using the PCR-RFLP technique. The highest frequency of the A allele was found in the Holstein sample (73%) followed by Gyr x Holstein F1 (39%). Gyr and Red Sindhi showed low frequencies of A alleles (4 and 2.5%, respectively). The A allele was not found in the Nellore and Guzerat samples. Our results could be used to guide association studies between this locus and milk traits in these breeds. 	Genet._Mol._Res.

7493970	19951208	Structure-function relationships of the mitochondrial bc1 complex in temperature-sensitive mutants of the cytochrome b gene, impaired in the catalytic center N.	Seven new structures of cytochrome b have been recently identified by isolating and sequencing revertants from cytochrome b respiratory deficient mutants (Copp?e, J. Y., Brasseur, G., Brivet-Chevillotte, P., and Colson, A. M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 4221-4226). These mutations are located in the center N domain (QN). All the revertants exhibited a modified heme b562 maximum, confirming that part of the NH2-terminal region is in the vicinity of the extramembranous loop between helices IV-V and heme b562. Based on measurements performed on the maximal activities occurring in each segment of the respiratory chain, the decrease observed in the NADH oxidase activities of several revertants was correlated with some bc1 complex activity impairments; this may also explain why a moderate decrease in bc1 complex activity does not limit the succinate oxidase activity. The decrease in the rate of reduction of cytochrome b via the center N pathway is responsible for the impairment of the bc1 complex activity of these revertants. The three double-mutated revertants (S206L/N208K or -Y; S206L/W30C) are temperature-sensitive in vivo, and their mitochondria like that of the original mutant S206L are thermosensitive in vitro. Isolating the W30C mutation does not yield a thermosensitive phenotype: the replacement of serine 206 by leucine is therefore responsible for the thermoinstability of these strains; this temperature sensitivity is reinforced by additional mutations N208K or N208Y, and not by W30C. These data suggest that serine 206 and asparagine 208 are involved in the thermostability of the protein. When bc1 complex activity is lost after incubating mitochondria at a nonpermissive temperature (37 degrees C), heme b is still present, but can no longer be reduced by physiological substrate. The progressive loss of bc1 complex activity seems to be initially linked to a change in the tertiary structure of cytochrome b, which occurs drastically at center N and much more slowly at center P, as shown by kinetic study on the two cytochrome b redox pathways.

21792324	20110728	Insulin initiation and intensification in patients with T2DM for the primary care physician.	Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by both insulin resistance and inadequate insulin secretion. All patients with the disease require treatment to achieve and maintain the target glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) level of 6.5%-7%. Pharmacological management of T2DM typically begins with the introduction of oral medications, and the majority of patients require exogenous insulin therapy at some point in time. Primary care physicians play an essential role in the management of T2DM since they often initiate insulin therapy and intensify regimens over time as needed. Although insulin therapy is prescribed on an individualized basis, treatment usually begins with basal insulin added to a background therapy of oral agents. Prandial insulin injections may be added if glycemic targets are not achieved. Treatments may be intensified over time using patient-friendly titration algorithms. The goal of insulin intensification within the primary care setting is to minimize patients' exposure to chronic hyperglycemia and weight gain, and reduce patients' risk of hypoglycemia, while achieving individualized fasting, postprandial, and A1C targets. Simplified treatment protocols and insulin delivery devices allow physicians to become efficient prescribers of insulin intensification within the primary care arena.

26148664	20150708	Structural insights into the unique inhibitory mechanism of the silkworm protease inhibitor serpin18.	Serpins generally serve as inhibitors that utilize a mobile reactive center loop (RCL) as bait to trap protease targets. Here, we present the crystal structure of serpin18 from Bombyx mori at 1.65 ? resolution, which has a very short and stable RCL. Activity analysis showed that the inhibitory target of serpin18 is a cysteine protease rather than a serine protease. Notably, this inhibitiory reaction results from the formation of an intermediate complex, which then follows for the digestion of protease and inhibitor into small fragments. This activity differs from previously reported modes of inhibition for serpins. Our findings have thus provided novel structural insights into the unique inhibitory mechanism of serpin18. Furthermore, one physiological target of serpin18, fibroinase, was identified, which enables us to better define the potential role for serpin18 in regulating fibroinase activity during B. mori development.

Assess the effects of belimumab treatment plus standard systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) therapy on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with active, autoantibody-positive SLE. Patients received standard therapy plus placebo or belimumab 1 or 10 mg/kg in two multicentre, randomised controlled trials of 52 (BLISS-52; N=865) and 76 (BLISS-76; N=819) weeks' duration. Responders were evaluated by SLE Responder Index at week 52. Patient-reported outcome assessments included SF-36, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue, and EQ-5D. Mean SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) scores at week 24 was a major secondary endpoint. Baseline SF-36 scores were 1.5 SDs below age-/sex-matched US norms with similar improvement at week 24 across treatment groups. Mean changes from baseline in PCS scores were significantly (p&lt;0.05) greater with belimumab 1 mg/kg (4.20) and 10 mg/kg (4.18) versus placebo (2.96) in BLISS-52, week 52. In BLISS-76, significantly (p&lt;0.05) greater improvements were seen with belimumab 1 mg/kg in PCS (belimumab 1 mg/kg=4.37, 10 mg/kg=3.41 vs placebo=2.85) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores (belimumab 1 mg/kg=3.14, 10 mg/kg=2.70 vs placebo=1.40) at week 52, and in MCS score at week 76 (belimumab 1 mg/kg=3.05, 10 mg/kg=2.28 vs placebo=1.36). In pooled analysis, significantly greater improvements in PCS, SF-36 vitality domain, and FACIT-Fatigue scores at week 52 were evident with both belimumab doses. The clinically meaningful improvements in HRQOL in autoantibody-positive patients with active SLE treated with belimumab and standard therapy are consistent with the reductions in disease activity observed in these trials.

25913043	20150428	Replication of genome wide association studies on hepatocellular carcinoma susceptibility loci of STAT4 and HLA-DQ in a Korean population.	A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) identified two loci (rs7574865 in STAT4 and rs9275319 in HLA-DQ) in a Chinese population. We attempted to replicate the associations between the two SNP loci and the risk of HCC in a Korean population. The rs7574865 in STAT4 and rs9275319 in HLA-DQ were genotyped in a total of 3838 Korean subjects composed of 287 HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma patients, 671 chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB) patients, and 2880 population controls using TaqMan genotyping assay. Gene expression was measured by microarray. A logistic regression analysis revealed that rs7574865 in STAT4 and rs9275319 in HLA-DQ were associated with the risk of CHB (OR = 1.25, P = 0.0002 and OR = 1.57, P= 1.44 ? 10(-10), respectively). However, these loci were no association with the risk of HBV-related HCC among CHB patients. In the gene expression analyses, although no significant differences in mRNA expression of nearby genes according to genotypes were detected, a significantly decreased mRNA expression in HCC subjects was observed in STAT4, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1. Although the genetic effects of two HCC susceptibility loci were not replicated, the two loci were found to exert susceptibility effects on the risk of CHB in a Korean population. In addition, the decreased mRNA expression of STAT4, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1 in HCC tissue might provide a clue to understanding their role in the progression to HCC. 	Infect._Genet._Evol.	D016428
22492586	20120412	Dose-ranging effects of canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, as add-on to metformin in subjects with type 2 diabetes.	To evaluate the effects of canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, in type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, dose-ranging study in 451 subjects randomized to canagliflozin 50, 100, 200, or 300 mg once daily (QD) or 300 mg twice daily (BID), sitagliptin 100 mg QD, or placebo. Primary end point was change in A1C from baseline through week 12. Secondary end points included change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight, and overnight urinary glucose-to-creatinine ratio. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. Canagliflozin was associated with significant reductions in A1C from baseline (7.6-8.0%) to week 12: -0.79, -0.76, -0.70, -0.92, and -0.95% for canagliflozin 50, 100, 200, 300 mg QD and 300 mg BID, respectively, versus -0.22% for placebo (all P &lt; 0.001) and -0.74% for sitagliptin. FPG was reduced by -16 to -27 mg/dL, and body weight was reduced by -2.3 to -3.4%, with significant increases in urinary glucose-to-creatinine ratio. Adverse events were transient, mild to moderate, and balanced across arms except for a non-dose-dependent increase in symptomatic genital infections with canagliflozin (3-8%) versus placebo and sitagliptin (2%). Urinary tract infections were reported without dose dependency in 3-9% of canagliflozin, 6% of placebo, and 2% of sitagliptin arms. Overall incidence of hypoglycemia was low. Canagliflozin added onto metformin significantly improved glycemic control in type 2 diabetes and was associated with low incidence of hypoglycemia and significant weight loss. The safety/tolerability profile of canagliflozin was favorable except for increased frequency of genital infections in females. 	Diabetes_Care	D016428 D016448 D016449 D013485
22904623	20120821	Lysine-functionalized nanodiamonds: synthesis, physiochemical characterization, and nucleic acid binding studies.	Detonation nanodiamonds (NDs) are carbon-based nanomaterials that, because of their size (4-5 nm), stable inert core, alterable surface chemistry, fluorescence, and biocompatibility, are emerging as bioimaging agents and promising tools for the delivery of biochemical molecules into cellular systems. However, diamond particles possess a strong propensity to aggregate in liquid formulation media, restricting their applicability in biomedical sciences. Here, the authors describe the covalent functionalization of NDs with lysine in an attempt to develop nanoparticles able to act as suitable nonviral vectors for transferring genetic materials across cellular membranes. NDs were oxidized and functionalized by binding lysine moieties attached to a three-carbon-length linker (1,3-diaminopropane) to their surfaces through amide bonds. Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, zeta potential measurement, dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopic imaging, and thermogravimetric analysis were used to characterize the lysine-functionalized NDs. Finally, the ability of the functionalized diamonds to bind plasmid DNA and small interfering RNA was investigated by gel electrophoresis assay and through size and zeta potential measurements. NDs were successfully functionalized with the lysine linker, producing surface loading of 1.7 mmol g(-1) of ND. These modified NDs formed highly stable aqueous dispersions with a zeta potential of 49 mV and particle size of approximately 20 nm. The functionalized NDs were found to be able to bind plasmid DNA and small interfering RNA by forming nanosized &quot;diamoplexes&quot;. The lysine-substituted ND particles generated in this study exhibit stable aqueous formulations and show potential for use as carriers for genetic materials. 	Int_J_Nanomedicine	D016428 D013485
21345510	20110225	Association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene for XRCC1 and radiation-induced late toxicity in prostate cancer patients.	Polymorphisms in genes responsible for DNA damage signaling and repair might modulate DNA repair capacity and, therefore, affect cell and tissue response to radiation and influence individual radiosensitivity. The purpose of the present prospective investigation was to evaluate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in XRCC1 with radiation-induced late side effects in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. To analyze the role of XRCC1 polymorphisms for late toxicity 603 participants from the Austrian PROCAGENE study treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy were included in the present investigation. Three non-synonymous candidate polymorphisms in the X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) gene (Arg194Trp; Arg280His; Arg399Gln) were selected and determined by 5?-nuclease (TaqMan) assays. Within a median follow-up time of 35 months, 91 patients (15.7%) developed high-grade late toxicities (defined as late bladder and/or rectal toxicity RTOG?2). In a Kaplan-Meier analysis, carriers of the XRCC1 Arg280His polymorphism were at decreased risk of high-grade late toxicity (p=0.022), in multivariate analysis including clinical and dosimetric parameters as potential confounders the XRCC1 Arg280His polymorphism remained a significant predictor for high-grade late toxicity (HR=0.221, 95% CI 0.051-0.956; p=0.043). No significant associations were found for the remaining polymorphisms. We conclude that the XRCC1 Arg280His polymorphism may be protective against the development of high-grade late toxicity after radiotherapy in prostate cancer patients.

17949312	20071024	High-power potassium-titanyl-phosphate or lithium triboride laser photoselective vaporization prostatectomy for benign prostatic hyperplasia: a systematic approach.	We describe a safe and reproducible technique for potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) and lithium triboride (LBO) laser photoselective vaporization prostatectomy (PVP). With the patient under anesthesia in the dorsal lithotomy position, cystoscopy is performed. Using a high-power KTP/LBO laser system, a groove is created along the lateral-median lobe junction from the bladder neck to the verumontanum to delineate the margins of vaporization. The remainder of the ipsilateral lobe is vaporized using a series of overlapping passes along the length of the groove. The contralateral lobe is vaporized in a similar manner. Finally, the median lobe is vaporized from lateral to medial. A 20F urethral catheter is placed at the conclusion of the procedure. This technique has been successful in 240 consecutive patients over an 18-month period. This systematic approach has been safe, effective, and reproducible for KTP/LBO laser PVP. It has become our standard technique for this procedure. 	J._Endourol.	D016428
23850728	20130716	A novel TNNI2 mutation causes Freeman-Sheldon syndrome in a Chinese family with an affected adult with only facial contractures.	Distal arthrogryposes (DAs), a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by congenital contractures with predominant involvement of the hands and feet, can be classified into at least 12 different forms. These autosomal dominant disorders are of variable expressivity and reduced penetrance. Mutations in sarcomeric protein genes, including troponin I2 (TNNI2), troponin T3 (TNNT3), tropomyosin 2 (TPM2), embryonic myosin heavy chain 3 (MYH3), and myosin binding protein C1 (MYBPC1), have been identified in distal arthrogryposis type 1 (DA1, MIM 108120), type 2B (DA2B, MIM 601680) and type 2A (DA2A)/Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (FSS, MIM 193700). However, mutations causing FSS have only been reported in MYH3. Herein we describe a Chinese DA family whose members meet classical strict criteria for FSS, as well as one member of the family who has isolated facial features consistent with FSS. No disease-causing mutation was found in MYH3. Segregation of microsatellite markers flanking the TNNI2 and TNNT3 genes at 11p15.5 was compatible with linkage. Subsequent sequencing of TNNI2 revealed a novel mutation, c.A493T (p.I165F), located in the C-terminal region, which is critical for proper protein function. This mutation was found to cosegregate with the FSS phenotype in this family, and assessment using SIFT and PolyPhen-2 predicted a damaging effect. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first TNNI2 mutation in classical FSS and describe an atypical adult FSS case with only facial contractures resulting from somatic mosaicism. We infer that DA1, DA2B and FSS represent a phenotypic continuum of the same disorder and provide further genetic evidence for this hypothesis. 	Gene	D002363 D016428 D013485
22287632	20120131	Association of the interferon-? gene with pericentromeric heterochromatin is dynamically regulated during virus infection through a YY1-dependent mechanism.	Nuclear architecture as well as gene nuclear positioning can modulate gene expression. In this work, we have analyzed the nuclear position of the interferon-? (IFN-?) locus, responsible for the establishment of the innate antiviral response, with respect to pericentromeric heterochromatin (PCH) in correlation with virus-induced IFN-? gene expression. Experiments were carried out in two different cell types either non-infected (NI) or during the time course of three different viral infections. In NI cells, we showed a monoallelic IFN-? promoter association with PCH that strongly decreased after viral infection. Dissociation of the IFN-? locus away from these repressive regions preceded strong promoter transcriptional activation and was reversible within 12? h after infection. No dissociation was observed after infection with a virus that abnormally maintained the IFN-? gene in a repressed state. Dissociation induced after virus infection specifically targeted the IFN-? locus without affecting the general structure and nuclear distribution of PCH clusters. Using cell lines stably transfected with wild-type or mutated IFN-? promoters, we identified the proximal region of the IFN-? promoter containing YY1 DNA-binding sites as the region regulating IFN-? promoter association with PCH before as well as during virus infection.

9048576	19970218	Role of Glu51 for cofactor binding and catalytic activity in pyruvate decarboxylase from yeast studied by site-directed mutagenesis.	We investigated the importance of the interaction between the Nl'-atom of the cofactor thiamine diphosphate and glutamic acid residue 51 in pyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4.1. 1.1). The yeast wild type gene PDCl and the respective mutant genes (E51Q and E51A) were expressed in Escherichia coli. The three enzymes were purified to homogeneity. They comigrated as a single band during silver-stained SDS/PAGE with a molecular mass of 60 000 Da. A molecular mass of 61 200 +/- 200 Da was determined by mass spectrometry for the subunit. The native enzyme is a homotetramer as demonstrated by gel filtration experiments. Near- and far-UV CD spectra showed no significant differences for the apoenzyme of the wild type and the mutants. Slight differences in the rate of thiamine diphosphate binding to the apoprotein component were observed between the wild type and the E51Q PDC by CD spectroscopy. Compared to the wild type enzyme, thiamine diphosphate binding at the E51A mutant apoprotein is very slow. Only 0.04% of the catalytic activity of the wild type enzyme was observed for the E51Q mutant; the E51A mutant has no detectable catalytic activity. The S0.5 value for the substrate pyruvate is increased 33-fold for the E51Q mutant. Substrate activation was observed for both the wild type and the E51Q mutant. The interaction between the N1'-atom of the coenzyme and glutamic acid 51 strongly influences the catalytic activity but only moderately the binding of the cofactor to the apoenzyme and the substrate activation rate.

10666310	20000210	Evidence for requirement of NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase in the microsomal NADPH-sterol Delta7-reductase system.	Rabbit antibodies raised against the hydrophilic part of microsomal NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (denoted fpT) demonstrated a marked ability to inhibit NADPH-sterol Delta7-reductase activity. In addition, trypsin and proteinase K treatment of microsomes removed almost all microsomal electron transfer constituents from the microsomes, but the Delta7-reductase activity could be reconstituted by adding detergent-solubilized NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (denoted OR). Furthermore, after solubilization from microsomes, the Delta7-reductase activity could be reconstituted with OR in a DEAE-cellulose column chromatography eluate fraction, which contained little OR activity. In the microsomal system, carbon monoxide, ketoconazole, and miconazole, specific inhibitors of cytochrome P450, had no effect on Delta7-reductase activity. These results provide the first evidence of an essential requirement of OR, which is distinct from cytochrome P450, in the NADPH-sterol Delta7-reductase system. EDTA, o-phenanthroline and KCN markedly lowered Delta7-reductase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Among metal ions tested, only ferric ion restored the reductase activity in the EDTA-treated microsomes. These results sugguest that NADPH-sterol Delta7-reductase is membrane-bound iron-dependent protein embedded in the microsomal lipid bilayer. 	Arch._Biochem._Biophys.	D016428 D013485
24897020	20140605	Genetic variants in human leukocyte antigen-DP influence both hepatitis C virus persistence and hepatitis C virus F protein generation in the Chinese Han population.	Chronic hepatitis C is a serious liver disease that often results in cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this study was to assess the association of human leukocyte antigen-DP (HLA-DP) variants with risk of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) or anti-F antibody generation. We selected two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a region including HLA-DPA1 (rs3077) and HLA-DPB1 (rs9277534) and genotyped SNPs in 702 cases and 342 healthy controls from the Chinese population using TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. Moreover, the exon 2 of the HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 genes were amplified and determined by sequencing-based typing (SBT). The results showed that rs3077 significantly increased the risk of chronic HCV infection in additive models and dominant models (odds ratio (OR) = 1.32 and 1.53). The rs3077 also contributed to decrease the risk of anti-F antibody generation in additive models and dominant models (OR = 0.46 and 0.56). Subsequent analyses revealed the risk haplotypes (DPA1*0103-DPB1*0501 and DPA1*0103-DPB1*0201) and protective haplotypes (DPA1*0202-DPB1*0501 and DPA1*0202-DPB1*0202) to chronic HCV infection. Moreover, we also found that the haplotype of DPA1*0103-DPB1*0201 and DPA1*0202-DPB1*0202 were associated with the anti-F antibody generation. Our findings show that genetic variants in HLA-DP gene are associated with chronic HCV infection and anti-F antibody generation. 	Int_J_Mol_Sci	D016428 D013485
26005817	20150526	[Molecular analysis of sporadic colon cancer].	In Chile, colorectal cancer (CRC) is often diagnosed in late stages. Thus, surgical treatment must be complemented with chemotherapy. KRAS mutations and microsatellite instability have been detected in these tumors. However, the response to treatment in patients without KRAS mutations varies and requires a better understanding. To determine the frequency and distribution of somatic point mutations in KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA genes and microsatellite instability status (MSI) in patients with colon cancer (CC). A prospective observational study of patients undergoing surgery for colon cancer. Tumor-derived DNA was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the most frequent mutations of KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA. PCR was also used to analyze MSI. Fifty-eight patients with sporadic CC were analyzed, 16 showed KRAS mutations (G12R, G12D, G12V, G13D) and out of the 42 patients that did not show any mutation, 10 had mutations in BRAF (V600E) and PIK3CA (E542K, E545D, E545K, Q546E, H1047R). BRAF mutations alone or in combination with PIK3CA mutations were observed in 27% of high MSI tumors and in 2% of tumors without instability (p &lt; 0.049). A higher percentage of high MSI tumors were located in the right colon (p &lt; 0.001), and showed BRAF mutation (p &lt; 0.020). The highest percentage of high MSI and BRAF mutations was observed in the right colon. Therefore, this study suggests the presence of different molecular features between right and left colon tumors that should be considered when defining the therapeutic management.

24495190	20140206	Analysis of polymorphic sites in the promoter of the nitric oxide synthase 2 gene in Brazilian patients with leprosy.	Leprosy is one of the most neglected infectious tropical diseases of the skin and the nerves caused by the intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium leprae. The inducible NOS isoform encoded by NOS2A plays a vital role in host defence against bacterial infections. The functional promoter polymorphisms in NOS2A are associated with various autoimmune and infectious diseases. We investigated the association of NOS2A variants with progression of leprosy in a Brazilian cohort including 221 clinically classified patients and 103 unrelated healthy controls. We observed a novel variant ss528838018A/G in the promoter region at position -6558. The other functional variants were observed with low frequency of minor allele (&lt;0.005). NOS2A promoter variant (-954G/C) was not observed in Brazilian populations, and the new observed promoter variant (ss528838018A/G) as well as other promoter variants were not associated with any clinical forms of leprosy in the Brazilian populations.

9687432	19980804	Expression and secretion of defined cutinase variants by Aspergillus awamori.	Several cutinase variants derived by molecular modelling and site-directed mutagenesis of a cutinase gene from Fusarium solani pisi are poorly secreted by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The majority of these variants are successfully produced by the filamentous fungus Aspergillus awamori. However, the L51S and T179Y mutations caused reductions in the levels of extracellular production of two cutinase variants by A. awamori. Metabolic labelling studies were performed to analyze the bottleneck in enzyme production by the fungus in detail. These studies showed that because of the single L51S substitution, rapid extracellular degradation of cutinase occurred. The T179Y substitution did not result in enhanced sensitivity towards extracellular proteases. Presumably, the delay in the extracellular accumulation of this cutinase variant is caused by the enhanced hydrophobicity of the molecule. Overexpression of the A. awamori gene encoding the chaperone BiP in the cutinase-producing A. awamori strains had no significant effect on the secretion efficiency of the cutinases. A cutinase variant with the amino acid changes G28A, A85F, V184I, A185L, and L189F that was known to aggregate in the endoplasmic reticulum of S. cerevisiae, resulting in low extracellular protein levels, was successfully produced by A. awamori. An initial bottleneck in secretion occurred before or during translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum but was rapidly overcome by the fungus. 	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485
10820030	20000523	Stereochemical outcome and kinetic effects of Rp- and Sp-phosphorothioate substitutions at the cleavage site of vaccinia type I DNA topoisomerase.	To probe the mechanism of the reversible DNA phosphodiester bond cleavage and religation mechanism of the type I topoisomerase from vaccinia virus, we have synthesized DNA substrates carrying a single nonbridging Rp- or Sp-phosphorothioate (Ps) modification at the scissile phosphodiester (Pd) bond. Analysis of the stereochemical outcome of the net cleavage and rejoining reaction established that the reaction proceeds with retention of configuration, as expected for a double-displacement mechanism. Single-turnover kinetic studies on irreversible strand cleavage using 18/24 mer suicide substrates showed thio effects (k(Pd)/k(Ps)) of 340- and 30-fold for the Rp-Ps and Sp-Ps stereoisomers, respectively, but approximately 10-fold smaller thio effects for the reverse single-turnover religation reaction (Rp-Ps = 30 and Sp-Ps = 3). As compared to the smaller suicide cleavage substrates, approach-to-equilibrium cleavage studies using 32/32 mer substrates showed 7-9-fold smaller thio effects on cleavage, similar effects on religation, and the same ratio of the Rp to Sp thio effect as the suicide cleavage reaction ( approximately 10). In general, thio effects of 2.4-7.2-fold on the cleavage equilibrium are observed for the wild-type and H265A enzymes, suggesting differences in the interactions of the enzyme with the nonbridging sulfur in the noncovalent and covalent complexes. Studies of the cleavage, religation, and approach-to-equilibrium reactions catalyzed by the H265A active site mutant revealed a stereoselective, 11-fold decrease in the Rp-thio effect on cleavage and religation as compared to the wild-type enzyme. This result suggests that His-265 interacts with the nonbridging pro-Rp oxygen in the transition state for cleavage and religation, consistent with the arrangement of this conserved residue in the crystal structure of the human topoisomerase-DNA complex. In general, the greatest effect of thio substitution and the H265A mutation is to destabilize the transition state, with smaller effects on substrate binding. The interaction of His-265 with the pro-Rp nonbridging oxygen is inconsistent with the proposal that this conserved residue acts as a general acid in the strand cleavage reaction.

25169713	20140830	FBXO7-R498X mutation: phenotypic variability from chorea to early onset parkinsonism within a family.	FBXO7 mutations (PARK 15), first reported in 2008, are among the monogenic causes of early-onset parkinsonism. Classically, PARK 15 was suggested to correspond to previously described pallido-pyramidal syndrome. Here, we report clinical and genetic findings in a unique family of Kurdish origin with an FBXO7 mutation and presenting with diverse clinical phenotypes. The family consisted of 14 members (12 offspring) of whom three were affected. Two of these three siblings were examined in our clinic. DNA samples from the index case and his elder sister were subjected to homozygosity mapping and exomic sequencing. The index case had progressive speech problems, severe apathy, chorea, and tics at presentation and developed very mild parkinsonism and postural instability after 3 years. His sister had young-onset asymmetric tremor-dominant parkinsonism with some atypical features, such as early development of postural instability, tics, and tachyphemic speech. She died of an akinetic-rigid condition and had not developed chorea. A homozygous R498X mutation was found in both patients (NM_012179; chr22:31,224,440). This result was further confirmed by Sanger sequencing in both patients, their consanguineous parents, and their maternal grandfather; the latter three were found to be heterozygous for the mutation (c.C1492T; p.R498X). The family presented here broadens the clinical spectrum of parkinsonism to include tics and chorea, in addition to the parkinsonian-pyramidal phenotype, in connection with FBXO7 mutations and points to an intrafamilial phenotypic variation.

9972102	19990211	Geographic heterogeneity of 4 common worldwide cystic fibrosis non-DF508 mutations in Brazil.	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by at least 750 different mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The frequency of the most common mutation (DF508) in Brazilian patients of European origin is 47%. To determine the frequency of 4 other common CF mutations (G542X, G551D, R553X, and N1303K) in Brazilian patients of European origin, we used direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of DNA obtained from dried blood spots on Guthrie cards. The DNA came from 247 non-DF508 chromosomes from 172 Brazilian CF patients ascertained from 5 different states of Brazil. The results show that the 4 mutations account for 17% of the non-DF508 alleles and only 9% of the total number of Brazilian CF alleles. Overall, the frequency of each mutation is different from northern European and North American populations but similar to southern European populations, mainly the Italian and Spanish populations. When Brazilian patients of European origin are grouped according to state of birth, the frequencies of the mutations are significantly different between southern and southeastern states of Brazil. Therefore there are serious implication for risk assessment of DNA-based tests in heterogeneous populations such as Brazilians. Further studies are needed to identify the remaining 44% of CF mutations for the different populations and regions of Brazil. 	Hum._Biol.	D003160 D016428 D013485 D013487
26229483	20150801	IL-2 -330T/G polymorphism and cancer risk: a meta-analysis.	Some studies have investigated the association of IL-2 -330T/G (rs2069762) polymorphism with cancer risk, but the previous results were conflicting and had relatively low statistical power. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis to derive a more precise estimation of the association between IL-2 -330T/G polymorphism and cancer risk. A literature search was performed systematically using electronic databases. The odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to estimate the pooled effect. A total of ten studies including 3,060 cases and 3,435 controls were involved in this meta-analysis. The results indicated that IL-2 -330T/G polymorphism was significantly associated with cancer risk ([OR =2.03, 95% CI =1.40-2.95] for GG vs TT; [OR =1.37, 95% CI =1.11-1.69] for GT vs TT; [OR =1.46, 95% CI =1.18-1.81] for [GG + GT] vs TT; [OR =1.66, 95% CI =1.24-2.23] for GG vs [GT + TT]; and [OR =1.35, 95% CI =1.16-1.57] for G vs T). In the subgroup analysis according to cancer type, significant association was found in lymphoma ([OR =1.46, 95% CI =1.11-1.91] for GT vs TT; [OR =1.58, 95% CI =1.22-2.05] for [GG + GT] vs TT; [OR =1.84, 95% CI =1.22-2.77] for GG vs [GT + TT]) and other cancers, but not in gastric cancer. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, the significant risk was found among Asians, but not among Europeans. This meta-analysis suggests that IL-2 -330T/G polymorphism has an increased risk of cancer in Asians. However, further detailed studies are still required to confirm our findings.

25422215	20141126	Association between the interleukin-17A -197G&gt;A (rs2275913) polymorphism and risk of digestive cancer.	Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is a multifunctional cytokine which plays a crucial role in the initiation and progression of cancer. To date, several studies have investigated associations between IL-17A -197G&gt;A (rs2275913) polymorphism and digestive cancer risk, but the results remain conflicting. We here aimed to confirm the role of this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in susceptibility to digestive cancer through a systemic review and meta-analysis. Ten eligible case-control studies were identified by searching electronic databases, involving 3,087 cases and 3,815 controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to estimate the strength of the association. The results of overall analyses indicated that the variant A allele was associated with an increased risk of digestive cancer (AA vs GG: OR=1.51, 95%CI=1.18-1.93; AA vs GG+GA: OR=1.45, 95%CI=1.12-1.87; A vs G: OR=1.21, 95%CI=1.05-1.39). In subgroup analysis stratified by specific cancer type, elevated risk among studies of gastric cancer was found (AA vs GG: OR=1.68, 95%CI=1.24-2.28; AA vs GG+GA: OR=1.62, 95%CI=1.16-2.26; A vs G: OR=1.23, 95%CI=1.04-1.46). According to ethnicity, there was evidence in the Asian populations for an association between this polymorphism and cancer risk (GA vs GG: OR=1.19, 95%CI=1.05-1.36; AA vs GG: OR=1.56, 95%CI=1.15-2.12; AA+GA vs GG: OR=1.28, 95%CI=1.13- 1.44; AA vs GG+GA: OR=1.42, 95%CI=1.01-2.00; A vs G: OR=1.24, 95%CI=1.08-1.44), while in the Caucasian populations an association was found in the recessive model (AA vs GG+GA: OR=1.62, 95%CI=1.17-2.24). In conclusion, the results of this meta-analysis suggest that the IL-17A -197G&gt;A polymorphism contributes to an increased risk of human digestive cancer, both in the Asian and Caucasian populations and especially for gastric cancer.

24040148	20130917	Depletion of the p43 mitochondrial T3 receptor increases Sertoli cell proliferation in mice.	Among T3 receptors, TR?1 is ubiquitous and its deletion or a specific expression of a dominant-negative TR?1 isoform in Sertoli cell leads to an increase in testis weight and sperm production. The identification of a 43-kDa truncated form of the nuclear receptor TR?1 (p43) in the mitochondrial matrix led us to test the hypothesis that this mitochondrial transcription factor could regulate Sertoli cell proliferation. Here we report that p43 depletion in mice increases testis weight and sperm reserve. In addition, we found that p43 deletion increases Sertoli cell proliferation in postnatal testis at 3 days of development. Electron microscopy studies evidence an alteration of mitochondrial morphology observed specifically in Sertoli cells of p43-/- mice. Moreover, gene expression studies indicate that the lack of p43 in testis induced an alteration of the mitochondrial-nuclear cross-talk. In particular, the up-regulation of Cdk4 and c-myc pathway in p43-/- probably explain the extended proliferation recorded in Sertoli cells of these mice. Our finding suggests that T3 limits post-natal Sertoli cell proliferation mainly through its mitochondrial T3 receptor p43. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
21859860	20110824	The histone methyltransferase Set7/9 promotes myoblast differentiation and myofibril assembly.	The molecular events that modulate chromatin structure during skeletal muscle differentiation are still poorly understood. We report in this paper that expression of the H3-K4 histone methyltransferase Set7 is increased when myoblasts differentiate into myotubes and is required for skeletal muscle development, expression of muscle contractile proteins, and myofibril assembly. Knockdown of Set7 or expression of a dominant-negative Set7 mutant impairs skeletal muscle differentiation, accompanied by a decrease in levels of histone monomethylation (H3-K4me1). Set7 directly interacts with MyoD to enhance expression of muscle differentiation genes. Expression of myocyte enhancer factor 2 and genes encoding contractile proteins is decreased in Set7 knockdown myocytes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Set7 also activates muscle gene expression by precluding Suv39h1-mediated H3-K9 methylation on the promoters of myogenic differentiation genes. Together, our experiments define a biological function for Set7 in muscle differentiation and provide a molecular mechanism by which Set7 modulates myogenic transcription factors during muscle differentiation.

21854111	20110823	Leptin deficiency and leptin gene mutations in obese children from Pakistan.	Congenital leptin deficiency is a rare human genetic condition clinically characterized by hyperphagia and acute weight gain usually during the first postnatal year. The worldwide data on this disorder includes only 14 cases and four pathogenic mutations have been reported in the leptin gene. The objectives of this study were to measure serum leptin levels in obese children and to detect leptin gene mutations in those found to be leptin deficient. A total of 25 obese children were recruited for the study. Leptin deficiency was detected in nine of them. Leptin gene sequencing identified mutations in homozygous state in all the leptin deficient children. Two cases carried novel mutations (c.481_482delCT and c.104_106delTCA) and each of the remaining seven the previously reported frameshift mutation (c.398delG). The results suggest that leptin deficiency caused by mutations in the leptin gene may frequently be seen in obese Pakistani children from Central Punjab. 	Int_J_Pediatr_Obes	D016428
24350798	20131220	Identification of functionally important conserved trans-membrane residues of bacterial PIB -type ATPases.	Powered by ATP hydrolysis, P(IB) -ATPases drive the energetically uphill transport of transition metals. These high affinity pumps are essential for heavy metal detoxification and delivery of metal cofactors to specific cellular compartments. Amino acid sequence alignment of the trans-membrane (TM) helices of P(IB)-ATPases reveals a high degree of conservation, with ? 60-70 fully conserved positions. Of these conserved positions, 6-7 were previously identified to be important for transport. However, the functional importance of the majority of the conserved TM residues remains unclear. To investigate the role of conserved TM residues of P(IB)-ATPases we conducted an extensive mutagenesis study of a Zn(2+)/Cd(2+) P(IB)-ATPase from Rhizobium radiobacter (rrZntA) and seven other P(IB)-ATPases. Of the 38 conserved positions tested, 24 had small effects on metal tolerance. Fourteen mutations compromised in vivo metal tolerance and in vitro metal-stimulated ATPase activity. Based on structural modelling, the functionally important residues line a constricted 'channel', tightly surrounded by the residues that were found to be inconsequential for function. We tentatively propose that the distribution of the mutable and immutable residues marks a possible trans-membrane metal translocation pathway. In addition, by substituting six trans-membrane amino acids of rrZntA we changed the in vivo metal specificity of this pump from Zn(2+)/Cd(2+) to Ag(+). 	Mol._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485
17688234	20070811	Variants of chemokine receptor 2 and interleukin 4 receptor, but not interleukin 10 or Fas ligand, increase risk of cervical cancer.	Cervical cancer is caused by persistent infection of oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV). Most infected women clear the virus without developing cervical lesions and it is likely that immunological host factors affect susceptibility to cervical cancer. The impact of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus on the risk of cervical cancer is established and several other genes involved in immunological pathways have been suggested as biologically plausible candidates. The aim of this study was to examine the potential role of polymorphisms in 4 candidate genes by analysis of 1,306 familial cervical cancer cases and 288 controls. The following genes and polymorphisms were studied: Chemokine receptor 2 (CCR-2) V64I; Interleukin 4 receptor alpha (IL-4R) I75V, S503P and Q576R; Interleukin 10 (IL-10) -592; and Fas ligand (FasL) -844. The CCR-2 64I variant was associated with decreased risk of cervical cancer; homozygote carriers of the 64I variant had an odds ratio of 0.31 (0.12-0.77). This association was detected in both carriers and noncarriers of the HLA DQB1*0602 cervical cancer risk allele. The IL-4R 75V variant was associated with increased risk of cervical tumors, cases homozygote for 75V had an odds ratio of 1.91 (1.27-2.86) with a tendency that the association was stronger in noncarriers of the DQB1*0602 allele. We did not find any association for IL-10 -592, or FasL -844, previously reported to be associated with cervical cancer in the Dutch and Chinese populations, respectively.

23164062	20121121	Implications of bio-efficacy and persistence of insecticides when indoor residual spraying and long-lasting insecticide nets are combined for malaria prevention.	Bio-efficacy and residual activity of insecticides used for indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticide nets (LLINs) were assessed against laboratory-reared and wild populations of the malaria vector, Anopheles arabiensis in south eastern Tanzania. Implications of the findings are examined in the context of potential synergies and redundancies where IRS and LLINs are combined. Bioassays were conducted monthly for six months on three LLIN types (Olyset? PermaNet 2.0?,and Icon Life?) and three IRS treatments (2 g/m2 pirimiphos-methyl, 2 g/m2 DDT and 0.03 g/m2 lambda-cyhalothrin, sprayed on mud walls and palm ceilings of experimental huts). Tests used susceptible laboratory-reared An. arabiensis exposed in cones (nets and IRS) or wire balls (nets only). Susceptibility of wild populations was assessed using WHO diagnostic concentrations and PCR for knock-down resistance (kdr) genes. IRS treatments killed ? 85% of mosquitoes exposed on palm ceilings and ? 90% of those exposed on mud walls, but up to 50% of this toxicity decayed within 1-3 months, except for DDT. By 6th month, only 7.5%, 42.5% and 30.0% of mosquitoes died when exposed to ceilings sprayed with pirimiphos-methyl, DDT or lambda-cyhalothrin respectively, while 12.5%, 36.0% and 27.5% died after exposure to mud walls sprayed with the same insecticides. In wire-ball assays, mortality decreased from 98.1% in 1st month to 92.6% in 6th month in tests on PermaNet 2.0?, from 100% to 61.1% on Icon Life? and from 93.2% to 33.3% on Olyset? nets. In cone bioassays, mortality reduced from 92.8% in 1st month to 83.3% in 6th month on PermaNet 2.0?, from 96.9% to 43.80% on Icon Life? and from 85.6% to 14.6% on Olyset?. Wild An. arabiensis were 100% susceptible to DDT, 95.8% to deltamethrin, 90.2% to lambda cyhalothrin and 95.2% susceptible to permethrin. No kdr gene mutations were detected. In bioassays where sufficient contact with treated surfaces is assured, LLINs and IRS kill high proportions of susceptible An. arabiensis mosquitoes, though these efficacies decay gradually for LLINs and rapidly for IRS. It is, therefore, important to always add intact nets in sprayed houses, guaranteeing protection even after the IRS decays, and to ensure accurate timing, quality control and regular re-spraying in IRS programmes. By contrast, adding IRS in houses with intact LLINs is unlikely to improve protection relative to LLINs alone, since there is no guarantee that unfed vectors would rest long enough on the sprayed surfaces, and because of the rapid IRS decay. However, there is need to clarify these effects using data from observations of free flying mosquitoes in huts. Physiological susceptibility of An. arabiensis in the area remains 100% against DDT, but is slightly reduced against pyrethroids, necessitating caution over possible spread of resistance. The loss of LLIN toxicity, particularly Olyset? nets suggests that protection offered by these nets against An. arabiensis may be primarily due to physical bite prevention rather than insecticidal efficacy.

21684747	20110621	Distinct distal myopathy phenotype caused by VCP gene mutation in a Finnish family.	Inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is caused by mutations in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene. We report a new distal phenotype caused by VCP gene mutation in a Finnish family with nine affected members in three generations. Patients had onset of distal leg muscle weakness and atrophy in the anterior compartment muscles after age 35, which caused a foot drop at age 50. None of the siblings had scapular winging, proximal myopathy, cardiomyopathy or respiratory problems during long-term follow-up. Three distal myopathy patients developed rapidly progressive dementia, became bedridden and died of cachexia and pneumonia and VCP gene mutation P137L (c.410C&gt;T) was then identified in the family. Late onset autosomal dominant distal myopathy with rimmed vacuolar muscle pathology was not sufficient for exact diagnosis in this family until late-occurring dementia provided the clue for molecular diagnosis. VCP needs to be considered in the differential diagnostic work-up in patients with distal myopathy phenotype. 	Neuromuscul._Disord.	D016428
16963262	20060912	Identification of germline MLH1 alterations in familial prostate cancer.	Several linkage and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses suggest that the region 3p21-p26, which is a chromosomal location of MLH1, could harbour a susceptibility gene for prostate cancer (PRCA). Furthermore, in a recent candidate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis the I219V variation of the MLH1 gene was associated with PRCA. Microsatellite instability (MSI) and germ-line MLH1 mutations were originally demonstrated in hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) but MSI and loss of MLH1 function have also been detected in PRCA. To assess the contribution of MLH1 germline mutations to the development of PRCA in Finland different approaches were used. First, the samples from 11 PRCA-colon cancer patients were screened for MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC revealed one patient with a putative MLH1 aberration and sequencing of this sample revealed five sequence variants including two missense variants P434L and I219V. Second, the samples from Finnish hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) families were used for the screening of MLH1 mutations which produced twelve MLH1 sequence variants including two missense mutations, I219V, as in the PRCA-colon cancer patient, and V647M. P434L and V647 were both novel, rare variants. Carrier frequencies of the I219V mutation were compared between hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) patients, unselected PRCA cases, patients with benign prostate hyperplasia and controls, but no differences between the sample groups were found. P434L was not present in this study population and V647M was a very rare variant found only in one HPC family. According to the present results, MLH1 does not have a major role in PRCA causation in Finland. 	Eur._J._Cancer	D016428 D013485
2304452	19900201	Binding of warfarin, salicylate, and diazepam to genetic variants of human serum albumin with known mutations.	Possible effects of single point mutations on the ligand-binding capabilities of human serum albumin (Alb) were investigated by studying the interactions between the strongly bound drugs warfarin, salicylate, and diazepam and five structurally characterized genetic variants of the protein. Equilibrium dialysis data, obtained with the variants and normal serum Alb, revealed pronounced reductions in high affinity binding of all three ligands to Alb Canterbury (313 Lys----Asn) and to Alb Parklands (365 Asp----His). By contrast, unchanged binding of the drugs was found in the case of Alb Verona (570 Glu----Lys). Different effects on binding were observed for the other two variants. Salicylate was the only drug bound with a lower affinity to Alb Niigata (269 Asp----Gly), whereas binding of both salicylate and diazepam to Alb Roma (321 Glu----Lys) were moderately reduced. In about half of the cases of diminished binding, the primary association constant was reduced by 1 order of magnitude, giving rise to an increase in the unbound fraction of the drugs of 500% or more at therapeutically relevant molar ratios of drug and protein. Changes in protein charge seem to be of only minor importance for reduced binding. More likely, conformational changes in the 313-365 region of the proteins are the main cause for diminished binding of these diverse ligands, which probably have different high affinity binding sites. The specific reduction in salicylate binding after modification of residue 269 may be due to conformational changes at or close to the salicylate binding site. 	Mol._Pharmacol.	D016428 D013485
10562281	19991124	The COOH-terminal domain of Myo2p, a yeast myosin V, has a direct role in secretory vesicle targeting.	MYO2 encodes a type V myosin heavy chain needed for the targeting of vacuoles and secretory vesicles to the growing bud of yeast. Here we describe new myo2 alleles containing conditional lethal mutations in the COOH-terminal tail domain. Within 5 min of shifting to the restrictive temperature, the polarized distribution of secretory vesicles is abolished without affecting the distribution of actin or the mutant Myo2p, showing that the tail has a direct role in vesicle targeting. We also show that the actin cable-dependent translocation of Myo2p to growth sites does not require secretory vesicle cargo. Although a fusion protein containing the Myo2p tail also concentrates at growth sites, this accumulation depends on the polarized delivery of secretory vesicles, implying that the Myo2p tail binds to secretory vesicles. Most of the new mutations alter a region of the Myo2p tail conserved with vertebrate myosin Vs but divergent from Myo4p, the myosin V involved in mRNA transport, and genetic data suggest that the tail interacts with Smy1p, a kinesin homologue, and Sec4p, a vesicle-associated Rab protein. The data support a model in which the Myo2p tail tethers secretory vesicles, and the motor transports them down polarized actin cables to the site of exocytosis. 	J._Cell_Biol.

19072333	20081217	Identification of essential residues of human alpha-L-fucosidase and tests of its mechanism.	Fucosylated glycoconjugates have critical roles in biological processes, but a limited availability of alpha-l-fucosidase has hampered research on this human enzyme (h-Fuc) at a molecular level. After overexpressing h-Fuc in Escherichia coli as an active form, we investigated the catalytic function of this recombinant enzyme. Based on sequence alignment and structural analysis of close homologues of h-Fuc, nine residues of glutamate and aspartate in h-Fuc were selected for mutagenic tests to determine the essential residues. Among the mutants, D225N, E289Q, and E289G lost catalytic activity significantly; their k(cat) values are 1/5700, 1/430, and 1/340, respectively, of that of the wild-type enzyme. The Br?nsted plot for k(cat)/K(m) for the E289G mutant is linear with beta(lg) = -0.93, but that for k(cat) is biphasic, with beta(lg) for poor substrates being -0.88 and for activated substrates being -0.11. The small magnitude of beta(lg) for the activated substrates may indicate that the rate-limiting step of the reaction is defucosylation, whereas the large magnitude of the latter beta(lg) value for the poor substrates indicates that the rate-limiting step of the reaction becomes fucosylation. The kinetic outcomes support an argument that Asp(225) functions as a nucleophile and Glu(289) as a general acid/base catalyst. As further evidence, azide significantly reactivated D225G and E289G, and (1)H NMR spectral analysis confirmed the formation of beta-fucosyl azide and alpha-fucosyl azide in the azide rescues of D225G and E289G catalyses, respectively. As direct evidence to prove the function of Glu(289), an accumulation of fucosyl-enzyme intermediate was detected directly through ESI/MS analysis. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485
26956050	20160310	Antitumor effect of the novel sphingosine kinase 2 inhibitor ABC294640 is enhanced by inhibition of autophagy and by sorafenib in human cholangiocarcinoma cells.	Sphingosine kinase 2 (Sphk2) has an oncogenic role in cancer. A recently developed first-in-class Sphk2 specific inhibitor ABC294640 displays antitumor activity in many cancer models. However, the role of Sphk2 and the antitumor activity of its inhibitor ABC294640 are not known in cholangiocarcinoma. We investigated the potential of targeting Sphk2 for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma. We found that Sphk2 is overexpressed in five established human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines (WITT, HuCCT1, EGI-1, OZ and HuH28) and a new patient-derived cholangiocarcinoma cell line (LIV27) compared to H69 normal cholangiocytes. Inhibition of Sphk2 by ABC294640 inhibited proliferation and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that ABC294640 inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation, one of the key signaling pathways regulating cholangiocarcinoma cell proliferation and survival. ABC294640 also induced autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy by bafilomycin A1 or chloroquine potentiated ABC294640-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis. In addition, ABC294640 in combination with sorafenib synergistically inhibited cell proliferation of cholangiocarcinoma cells. Strong decreases in STAT3 phosphorylation were observed in WITT and HuCCT1 cells exposed to the ABC294640 and sorafenib combination. These findings provide novel evidence that Sphk2 may be a rational therapeutic target in cholangiocarcinoma. Combinations of ABC294640 with sorafenib and/or autophagy inhibitors may provide novel strategies for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma. 	Oncotarget	D016428
24301936	20131205	A novel splicing site mutation of the GPR143 gene in a Chinese X-linked ocular albinism pedigree.	Ocular albinism is an X-linked inherited disease characterized by hypopigmentation of the iris and nystagmus. To identify a new disease-causing mutation of ocular albinism, we collected a Han Chinese pedigree with 7 male congenital nystagmus patients over 3 generations. Slit-lamp photography and optical coherence tomography were performed for the proband. Genomic DNA was extracted from a whole blood sample from the proband using the high-salt method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing was carried out for GPR143 and FRMD7 genes. The three-dimensional structures of the wild-type and mutant GPR143 proteins were determined using SWISS-MODEL. The transmission of the disease in the pedigree clearly followed an X-linked pattern. The proband had significant iris and fundus hypopigmentation. Optical coherence tomography showed severe foveal hypoplasias in both eyes of the proband. A novel splicing site (G/C) mutation was found on the boundary of the 6th intron and the 7th exon of the GPR143 gene, resulting in a 9-amino-acid deletion (codons 257-265) in the 6th transmembrane domain of the GPR143 protein. In conclusion, a novel splicing site mutation of the GPR143 gene was found in a Han Chinese congenital ocular albinism pedigree. 	Genet._Mol._Res.	D002363 D016428 D013485
26950205	20160308	Molecular Epidemiological Survey of Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency and Thalassemia in Uygur and Kazak Ethnic Groups in Xinjiang, Northwest China.	Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and thalassemia occur frequently in tropical and subtropical regions, while the prevalence of relationship between the two diseases in Xinjiang has not been reported. We aimed to determine the prevalence of these diseases and clarify the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes of the two diseases in the Uygur and Kazak ethnic groups in Xinjiang. We measured G6PD activity by G6PD:6PGD (glucose acid-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) ratio, identified the gene variants of G6PD and ?- and ?-globin genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-DNA sequencing and gap-PCR and compared these variants in different ethnic groups in Xinjiang with those adjacent to it. Of the 149 subjects with molecular analysis of G6PD deficiency conducted, a higher prevalence of the combined mutations c.1311C?&gt;?T/IVSXI?+?93T?&gt;?C and IVSXI?+?93T?&gt;?C, both with normal enzymatic activities, were observed in the Uygur and Kazak subjects. A case of rare mutation HBB: c.135delC [codon 44 (-C) in the heterozygous state], a heterozygous case of HBB: c.68A?&gt;?G [Hb G-Taipei or ?22(B4)Glu?Gly] and several common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found on the ?-globin gene. In conclusion, G6PD deficiency with pathogenic mutations and three common ?-thalassemia (?-thal) [-?-(SEA), -?(3.7) (rightward), -?(4.2) (leftward)] deletions and point mutations of the ?-globin gene were not detected in the present study. The average incidence of ?-thalassemia (?-thal) in Uygurs was 1.45% (2/138) in Xinjiang. The polymorphisms of G6PD and ?-globin genes might be useful genetic markers to trace the origin and migration of the Uygur and Kazak in Xinjiang. 	Hemoglobin	D016428
20581664	20100629	Thrombophilia and the risk of thromboembolic events in women on oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy.	Thrombophilia contributes to the risk of thrombosis in women using female hormones. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of thrombophilia in women with thromboembolic events (TEEs) using oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and assess the contribution of a family history and the duration of hormone use in predicting thrombosis. A retrospective analysis was performed of the case records of women who developed a TEE while on oral contraceptives or HRT and were referred for thrombophilia evaluation over a 4-year period. Among 85 women who developed a TEE while on oral contraceptives or HRT, 65 had at least one additional thrombophilia risk factor. Of the 85 cases, 23 tested positive for more than two thrombophilias, 16 had factor V Leiden, five had the prothrombin gene G20210A polymorphism, 26 had antiphospholipid antibodies, 10 had elevated homocysteine, four had protein C deficiency, and seven had protein S deficiency. There were 64 TEE: 16 pulmonary emboli, 17 cerebrovascular events, 11 intra-abdominal thromboses, 13 deep venous thromboses, five cases of superficial thrombophlebitis, and two retinal vein thromboses. Of the 65 women, 37% had a positive family history of thrombosis. Approximately half of the women had been taking oral contraceptives or HRT for more than 1 year. There is a high prevalence of thrombophilia in women who developed a TEE while using oral contraceptives or HRT for more than 1 year. Family and personal history of thrombosis should be carefully evaluated in all women before initiating or continuing oral contraceptives or HRT, and a positive history may warrant a thrombophilia screening.

27298254	20160615	The Shu complex promotes error-free tolerance of alkylation-induced base excision repair products.	Here, we investigate the role of the budding yeast Shu complex in promoting homologous recombination (HR) upon replication fork damage. We recently found that the Shu complex stimulates Rad51 filament formation during HR through its physical interactions with Rad55-Rad57. Unlike other HR factors, Shu complex mutants are primarily sensitive to replicative stress caused by MMS and not to more direct DNA breaks. Here, we uncover a novel role for the Shu complex in the repair of specific MMS-induced DNA lesions and elucidate the interplay between HR and translesion DNA synthesis. We find that the Shu complex promotes high-fidelity bypass of MMS-induced alkylation damage, such as N3-methyladenine, as well as bypassing the abasic sites generated after Mag1 removes N3-methyladenine lesions. Furthermore, we find that the Shu complex responds to ssDNA breaks generated in cells lacking the abasic site endonucleases. At each lesion, the Shu complex promotes Rad51-dependent HR as the primary repair/tolerance mechanism over error-prone translesion DNA polymerases. Together, our work demonstrates that the Shu complex's promotion of Rad51 pre-synaptic filaments is critical for high-fidelity bypass of multiple replication-blocking lesion. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.

23895962	20130731	The macrophage migration inhibitory factor -173G/C polymorphism is not significantly associated with necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants.	Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among premature infants. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been implicated in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases. The MIF promoter contains a functionally relevant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) G?C at position -173, with the MIF -173*C allele being associated with higher MIF expression in vitro and with higher MIF levels in vivo. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the G/C polymorphism at -173 of the MIF promoter is associated with the development of NEC. In this retrospective cohort study, 107 preterm infants (GA ? 32 weeks), of whom 41 had NEC (NEC Stage I n = 20, Stage II n = 3, Stage III n = 18) and 66 were not affected, were genotyped for the MIF -173 SNP. MIF genotyping was carried out by PCR and DHPLC. We did not find significant differences in the prevalence of the -173G/C polymorphism and in the distribution of the -173 MIF genotype in infants with NEC compared to controls. Moreover, we did not observe an association between the polymorphism and mortality. The polymorphism -173G/C of the MIF promoter does not appear to be of major importance in the pathophysiology of NEC in preterm infants. 	J._Pediatr._Surg.	D016428 D013485
27689327	20161001	Low carbohydrate diet prevents Mcl-1-mediated resistance to BH3-mimetics.	Overexpression of Mcl-1 is implicated in resistance of several cancers to chemotherapeutic treatment, therefore identifying a safe way to decrease its expression in tumor cells represents a central goal. We investigated if a modulation of the diet could impact on Mcl-1 expression using a Myc-driven lymphoma model. We established that a partial reduction of caloric intake by 25% represents an efficient way to decrease Mcl-1 expression in tumor cells. Furthermore, using isocaloric custom diets, we observed that carbohydrates (CHO) are the main regulators of Mcl-1 expression within the food. Indeed, feeding lymphoma-bearing mice with a diet having 25% less carbohydrates was sufficient to decrease Mcl-1 expression by 50% in lymphoma cells. We showed that a low CHO diet resulted in AMPK activation and mTOR inhibition leading to eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) inhibition, blocking protein translation elongation. Strikingly, a low CHO diet was sufficient to sensitize Myc-driven lymphoma-bearing mice to ABT-737-induced cell death in vivo. Thus reducing carbohydrate intake may represent a safe way to decrease Mcl-1 expression and to sensitize tumor cells to anti-cancer therapeutics. 	Oncotarget	D016428
22418777	20120316	Estrogen-related genes and their contribution to racial differences in breast cancer risk.	Racial differences in breast cancer risk, including the risks of hormone receptor subtypes of breast cancer, have been previously reported. We evaluated whether variation in genes related to estrogen metabolism (COMT, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP17A1, CYP19A1, ESR1, GSTM1, GSTP1, GSTT1, HSD17B1, SULT1A1, and UGT1A1) contributes to breast cancer risk and/or racial differences in risk within the CARE study, a multi-centered, population-based case-control study of breast cancer. Genetic variation was assessed as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), haplotypes, and SNP-hormone therapy (HT) interactions within a subset of 1,644 cases and 1,451 controls, including 949 Black women (493 cases and 456 controls), sampled from the CARE study population. No appreciable associations with breast cancer risk were detected for single SNPs or haplotypes in women overall. We detected SNP-HT interactions in women overall within CYP1B1 (rs1800440; p (het)?=?0.003) and within CYP17A1 (rs743572; p (het)?=?0.009) in which never users of HT were at a decreased risk of breast cancer, while ever users were at a non-significant increased risk. When investigated among racial groups, we detected evidence of an SNP-HT interaction with CYP1B1 in White women (p value?=?0.02) and with CYP17A1 in Black women (p value?=?0.04). This analysis suggests that HT use may modify the effect of variation in estrogen-related genes on breast cancer risk, which may affect Black and White women to a different extent.

23414134	20130219	Correlation of MLH1 and MGMT expression and promoter methylation with genomic instability in patients with thyroid carcinoma.	Gene silencing of the repair genes MLH1 and MGMT was shown to be a mechanism underlying the development of microsatellite instability (MSI), a phenotype frequently associated with various human malignancies. Recently, aberrant methylation of MLH1, MGMT and MSI were shown to be associated with mutations in genes such as BRAF, RAS and IDH1 in colon and brain tumours. Little is known about the methylation status of MLH1 and MGMT in thyroid tumours and its association with MSI and mutational status. In a series of 96 thyroid tumours whose mutational profiles of BRAF, IDH1 and NRAS mutations and RET/PTC were previously determined, we investigated MLH1 and MGMT expression and methylation status by qPCR and methylation-specific PCR after bisulphite treatment, respectively. MSI was determined by PCR using seven standard microsatellite markers. Samples with point mutations (BRAF, IDH1 and NRAS) show a decrease in MLH1 expression when compared to negative samples. Additionally, malignant lesions show a higher MSI pattern than benign lesions. The MSI phenotype was also associated with down-regulation of MLH1. The results of this study allow us to conclude that low expression of MLH1 is associated with BRAF V600E mutations, RET/PTC rearrangements and transitions (IDH1 and NRAS) in patients with thyroid carcinoma. In addition, a significant relationship between MSI status and histological subtypes was found. 	BMC_Cancer	D016428
12877648	20030725	Glyburide/metformin tablets: a new therapeutic option for the management of Type 2 diabetes.	Oral antidiabetic combination therapy is a proven means of establishing glycaemic control in the hyperglycaemic, Type 2 diabetic patient, but co-administering two oral antidiabetic agents separately may hinder compliance with therapy. A new single-tablet of glyburide/metformin combination therapy (Glucovance), Bristol-Myers Squibb, Inc.) has recently been developed, which addresses the primary defects of Type 2 diabetes: beta-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. The glyburide/metformin tablet, taken with meals, is designed to optimise the absorption of glyburide and to address the postprandial glucose rise. Glyburide/metformin tablets are more effective in controlling fasting and postprandial glycaemia than its component monotherapies, at lower doses of metformin and glyburide compared with monotherapy because of the synergy between its glyburide and metformin components. Moreover, a double-blind study showed that glyburide/metformin tablets are more effective than a free combination of glyburide co-administered with metformin in controlling postprandial glucose. Retrospective analyses suggested that glyburide/metformin tablets control glycated haemoglobin (A1C) more effectively than a free combination of glyburide co-administered with metformin, at lower mean doses of glyburide and metformin. The incidence of side effects is lower than separate component therapy for any given A1C. Glyburide/metformin tablets are an effective option for optimising the control of blood glucose in Type 2 diabetic patients and appear to enhance adherence to therapy.

12748174	20030516	Membrane-anchoring and charge effects in the interaction of myelin basic protein with lipid bilayers studied by site-directed spin labeling.	Myelin basic protein (MBP) maintains the compaction of the myelin sheath in the central nervous system by anchoring the cytoplasmic face of the two apposing bilayers and may also play a role in signal transduction. Site-directed spin labeling was done at eight matching sites in each of two recombinant murine MBPs, qC1 (charge +19) and qC8 charge (+13), which, respectively, emulate the native form of the protein (C1) and a post-translationally modified form (C8) that is increased in multiple sclerosis. When interacting with large unilamellar vesicles, most spin-labeled sites in qC8 were more mobile than those in qC1. Depth measurement via continuous wave power saturation indicated that the N-terminal and C-terminal sites in qC1 were located below the plane of the phospholipid headgroups. In qC8, the C-terminal domain dissociated from the membrane, suggesting a means by which the exposure of natural C8 to cytosolic enzymes and ligands might increase in vivo in multiple sclerosis. The importance of two Phe-Phe pairs in MBP to its interactions with lipids was investigated by separately mutating each pair to Ala-Ala. The mobility at F42A/F43A and especially F86A/F87A increased significantly. Depth measurements and helical wheel analysis indicated that the Phe-86/Phe-87 region could form a surface-seeking amphipathic alpha-helix. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
19959478	20091205	Potassium channel silencing by constitutive endocytosis and intracellular sequestration.	Tandem of P domains in a weak inwardly rectifying K(+) channel 1 (TWIK1) is a K(+) channel that produces unusually low levels of current. Replacement of lysine 274 by a glutamic acid (K274E) is associated with stronger currents. This mutation would prevent conjugation of a small ubiquitin modifier peptide to Lys-274, a mechanism proposed to be responsible for channel silencing. However, we found no biochemical evidence of TWIK1 sumoylation, and we showed that the conservative change K274R did not increase current, suggesting that K274E modifies TWIK1 gating through a charge effect. Now we rule out an eventual effect of K274E on TWIK1 trafficking, and we provide convincing evidence that TWIK1 silencing results from its rapid retrieval from the cell surface. TWIK1 is internalized via a dynamin-dependent mechanism and addressed to the recycling endosomal compartment. Mutation of a diisoleucine repeat located in its cytoplasmic C terminus (I293A,I294A) stabilizes TWIK1 at the plasma membrane, resulting in robust currents. The effects of I293A,I294A on channel trafficking and of K274E on channel activity are cumulative, promoting even more currents. Activation of serotoninergic receptor 5-HT(1)R or adrenoreceptor alpha2A-AR stimulates TWIK1 but has no effect on TWIK1I293A,I294A, suggesting that G(i) protein activation is a physiological signal for increasing the number of active channels at the plasma membrane.

2550440	19891005	Identification of the ral and rac1 gene products, low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins from human platelets.	Identification of the GTP-binding proteins from human platelet particulate fractions was attained by their purification via successive column chromatography steps followed by amino acid sequencing. To enhance the likelihood of identifying the GTP-binding proteins, two assays were employed to monitor GTP-binding activities: (i) guanosine 5'-(3-O-[35S]thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S)-binding followed by rapid filtration and ii) [alpha-32P]GTP-binding following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. The latter assay permitted the isolation of a 28-kDa GTP-binding protein that bound [alpha-32P]GTP prominently but was only poorly detected with the GTP gamma S-binding assay. The amino acid sequences of three peptide fragments derived from the 28-kDa protein were identical to regions of the amino acid sequence deduced from a simian ral cDNA with the exception of one conservative substitution (Asp147----Glu). A full length human ral cDNA was isolated from a placental cDNA library, and its deduced amino acid sequence, compared with simian ral, also contained the Asp----Glu substitution along with two other substitutions and an additional three NH2-terminal amino acids. In addition to the 28-kDa protein, two distinct 25-kDa GTP-binding proteins were purified from platelets. One of these proteins has been previously characterized as G25K, an abundant low molecular mass GTP-binding protein. Partial amino acid sequence obtained from the second unidentified 25-kDa protein indicates that it is the product of the rac1 gene; a member of a newly identified gene family which encode for low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins (Didsbury, J., Weber, R.F., Bokoch, G. M., Evans, T., and Snyderman, R. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 16378-16382). These results identify two new GTP-binding proteins in human platelets, ral, the major protein that binds [alpha-32P]GTP on nitrocellulose transfers, and rac1, a substrate for botulinum C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase.

21639866	20110607	Neonatal lactic acidosis with methylmalonic aciduria due to novel mutations in the SUCLG1 gene.	Succinyl-coenzyme A ligase (SUCL) is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyses the reversible conversion of succinyl-coenzyme A to succinate. SUCL consists of an ? subunit, encoded by SUCLG1, and a ? subunit, encoded by either SUCLA2 or SUCLG2. Recently, mutations in SUCLG1 or SUCLA2 have been identified in patients with infantile lactic acidosis showing elevated urinary excretion of methylmalonate, mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) deficiency, and mitochondrial DNA depletion. Case description of a Japanese female patient who manifested a neonatal-onset lactic acidosis with urinary excretion of methylmalonic acid. Enzymatic analyses (MRC enzyme assay and Western blotting) and direct sequencing analysis of SUCLA2 and SUCLG1 were performed. MRC enzyme assay and Western blotting showed that MRC complex I was deficient. SUCLG1 mutation analysis showed that the patient was a compound heterozygote for disease-causing mutations (p.M14T and p.S200F). For patients showing neonatal lactic acidosis and prolonged mild methylmalonic aciduria, MRC activities and mutations of SUCLG1 or SUCLA2 should be screened for. 	Pediatr_Int	D002363 D016428 D013485
19021634	20081122	Estrogen receptor status in CHEK2-positive breast cancers: implications for chemoprevention.	To investigate the relationship between CHEK2 mutation status and estrogen receptor (ER) status in unselected cases of early-onset breast cancer from Poland, we screened 4441 women diagnosed with breast cancer younger than 51 years and 7217 controls for three inherited mutations in CHEK2 (1100delC, IVS2+1G&gt;A, del5395). ER status was compared between CHEK2-positive and CHEK2-negative breast cancer cases. A truncating mutation in CHEK2 was seen in 140 of 4441 cases and in 70 of 7217 controls [odds ratio (OR) = 3.3; 95% CI = 2.5-4.4; p &lt; 0.0001]. ER status was available for 92 of 140 mutation carriers and for 3001 of 4301 non-carriers with breast cancer. The OR was higher for ER-positive cancers (OR = 3.9; 95% CI = 2.7-5.4; p &lt; 0.0001) than for ER-negative cancers (OR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.3-3.3; p = 0.002). Sixty-six of the 92 breast cancers in carriers of CHEK2 truncating mutations were ER positive compared with 1742 of the 3001 breast cancers in non-carriers (72% vs 58%; p = 0.01). Women with a CHEK2 mutation face a fourfold increase in the risk of ER-positive breast cancer and might be candidates for tamoxifen chemoprevention. 	Clin._Genet.	D016428 D013485
21491613	20110415	Glyoxalase I polymorphism rs2736654 causing the Ala111Glu substitution modulates enzyme activity--implications for autism.	Autism is a pervasive, heterogeneous, neurodevelopmental disability characterized by impairments in verbal communications, reciprocal social interactions, and restricted repetitive stereotyped behaviors. Evidence suggests the involvement of multiple genetic factors in the etiology of autism, and extensive genome-wide association studies have revealed several candidate genes that bear single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in non-coding and coding regions. We have shown that a non-conservative, non-synonymous SNP in the glyoxalase I gene, GLOI, may be an autism susceptibility factor. The GLOI rs2736654 SNP is a C?A change that causes an Ala111Glu change in the Glo1 enzyme. To identify the significance of the SNP, we have conducted functional assays for Glo1. We now present evidence that the presence of the A-allele at rs2736654 results in reduced enzyme activity. Glo1 activity is decreased in lymphoblastoid cells that are homozygous for the A allele. The Glu-isoform of Glo1 in these cells is hyperphosphorylated. Direct HPLC measurements of the glyoxalase I substrate, methylglyoxal (MG), show an increase in MG in these cells. Western blot analysis revealed elevated levels of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGEs). We also show that MG is toxic to the developing neuronal cells. We suggest that accumulation of MG results in the formation of AGEs, which induce expression of the RAGE that during crucial neuronal development may be a factor in the pathology of autism.

23532979	20130328	Inhibition of viral pathogenesis and promotion of the septic shock response to bacterial infection by IRF-3 are regulated by the acetylation and phosphorylation of its coactivators.	Interferon (IFN) is required for protecting mice from viral pathogenesis; reciprocally, it mediates the deleterious septic shock response to bacterial infection. The critical transcription factor for IFN induction, in both cases, is IRF-3, which is activated by TLR3 or RIG-I signaling in response to virus infection and TLR4 signaling in response to bacterial infection. Here, we report that IRF-3's transcriptional activity required its coactivators, ?-catenin and CBP, to be modified by HDAC6-mediated deacetylation and protein kinase C isozyme ? (PKC-?)-mediated phosphorylation, respectively, so that activated nuclear IRF-3 could form a stable transcription initiation complex at the target gene promoters. ?-Catenin bridges IRF-3 and CBP, and the modifications were required specifically for the interaction between ?-catenin and CBP but not ?-catenin and IRF-3. Consequently, like IRF-3(-/-) mice, HDAC6(-/-) mice were resistant to bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock. Conversely, they were highly susceptible to pathogenesis caused by Sendai virus infection. Thus, HDAC6 is an essential component of the innate immune response to microbial infection.

10974403	20000907	Human tumor necrosis factor-alpha mutant RGD-V29 (F4614) shows potent antitumor activity and reduced toxicity against human tumor xenografted nude mice.	The antitumor effects of human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) mutant RGD-V29 (code no. F4614), that includes the cell adhesive sequence (4)Arg-(5)Gly-(6)Asp and (29)Arg--&gt;Val substitution, were evaluated. The therapeutic index, a measure of the extent of the therapeutically-effective range, using three constitutive administrations of RGD-V29 in Meth A-bearing mice was 4.8, whereas that of recombinant human TNF (rhTNF) ((1)SSS(4)RTPSDK...(29)RR...(155)L) was 2.8, clearly indicating that the effective RGD-V29 dose-range was extended. Furthermore, RGD-V29 showed potent antitumor activity against human lung cancer Mqnu-1 xenografted nude mice without severe gastrointestinal and other organ toxicities, even when administered at the maximal tolerated dose (MTD). In contrast, rhTNF induced severe toxicity at the MTD. Direct cytotoxicity of RGD-V29 against Mqnu-1 cells was similar to that of rhTNF. In addition, a cytotoxicity assay using a tumor-derived endothelial-like cell (tEC)/normal endothelial cell (nEC) system used to study TNF antitumor effects on tumor-associated endothelial cells, suggested that RGD-V29 showed preferential cytotoxicity toward tumor-associated endothelial cells compared with rhTNF. Thus, RGD-V29 appears to be a low-toxicity mutant of rhTNF that shows preferential activity towards tumors, and therefore merits further investigation in pre-clinical and clinical studies.

12242656	20020921	Role of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and mTOR/P70S6-kinase pathways in the proliferation and apoptosis in multiple myeloma.	Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy preliminary localized in the bone marrow and characterized by its capacity to disseminate. IL-6 and IGF-1 have been shown to mediate proliferative and anti-apoptotic signals in plasmocytes. However, in primary plasma-cell leukemia (PCL) and in end-stage aggressive extramedullar disease, the cytokine requirement for both effects may be not mandatory. This suggests that constitutive activation of signaling pathways occurs. One of the signaling pathways whose deregulation may play an oncogenic role in MM is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) pathway. In human growth factor-independent MM cell lines OPM2 and RPMI8226, we show that the PI 3-K inhibitors LY294002 and Wortmannin strongly inhibited cell proliferation, whereas inhibition of the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR)/P70-S6-kinase (P70(S6K)) pathway with rapamycin or of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway with PD98059 had minimal effect on proliferation. In both cell lines, constitutive activation of the PI 3-K/Akt/FKHRL-1, mTOR/P70(S6K) and MAPK pathways was detected. LY294002 inhibited phosphorylation of Akt, FKHRL-1 and P70(S6K) but had no effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating that the PI 3-K and MAPK pathways are independent. IGF-1 but not IL-6 increased phosphorylation of Akt, FKHRL-1 and P70(S6K). Purified plasmocytes from four patients with MM and two patients with primary PCL were studied. In three of them including the two patients with PCL, constitutive phosphorylation of Akt, FKHRL-1 and P70(S6K) was present, inhibited by LY294002 and enhanced by IGF-1. In these patients with constitutive Akt activation, normal PTEN expression was detected. PI 3-K inhibition induced caspase-dependent apoptosis as confirmed by inhibition with the large spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK and cleavage of pro-caspase-3. Both cell lines spontaneously expressed Skp2 and cyclin D1 proteins at high levels but no p27(Kip1) protein. In the presence of LY294002, cell-cycle arrest in G0/G1 was observed, p27(Kip1) protein expression was up-regulated whereas the expression of both Skp2 and cyclin D1 dramatically diminished. PI 3-K-dependent GSK-3alpha/beta constitutive phosphorylation was also detected in OPM2 cells that may contribute to high cyclin D1 expression. Overall, our results suggest that PI 3-K has a major role in the control of proliferation and apoptosis of growth factor-independent MM cell lines. Most of the biological effects of PI 3-K activation in these cell lines may be mediated by the opposite modulation of p27(Kip1) and Skp2 protein expression. Moreover, constitutive activation of this pathway is a frequent event in the biology of MM in vivo and may be more frequently observed in PCL. 	Oncogene	D016428 D013485
25549359	20141231	Trichloroethylene-induced gene expression and DNA methylation changes in B6C3F1 mouse liver.	Trichloroethylene (TCE), widely used as an organic solvent in the industry, is a common contaminant in air, soil, and water. Chronic TCE exposure induced hepatocellular carcinoma in mice, and occupational exposure in humans was suggested to be associated with liver cancer. To understand the role of non-genotoxic mechanism(s) for TCE action, we examined the gene expression and DNA methylation changes in the liver of B6C3F1 mice orally administered with TCE (0, 100, 500 and 1000 mg/kg b.w. per day) for 5 days. After 5 days TCE treatment at a dose level of 1000 mg/kg b.w., a total of 431 differentially expressed genes were identified in mouse liver by microarray, of which 291 were up-regulated and 140 down-regulated. The expression changed genes were involved in key signal pathways including PPAR, proliferation, apoptosis and homologous recombination. Notably, the expression level of a number of vital genes involved in the regulation of DNA methylation, such as Utrf1, Tet2, DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b, were dysregulated. Although global DNA methylation change was not detected in the liver of mice exposed to TCE, the promoter regions of Cdkn1a and Ihh were found to be hypo- and hypermethylated respectively, which correlated negatively with their mRNA expression changes. Furthermore, the gene expression and DNA methylation changes induced by TCE were dose dependent. The overall data indicate that TCE exposure leads to aberrant DNA methylation changes, which might alter the expression of genes involved in the TCE-induced liver tumorgenesis.

25626298	20150129	[Classification and genetic abnormalities of multiple myeloma].	Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy of plasma cells which develops through genetic aberrations, epigenetic changes and the bone marrow microenvironment interaction. Despite recent tremendous progress in treatments for MM, a complete cure remains elusive. Further development of more effective therapeutic strategies is needed. The International Staging System (ISS) reported in 2005 has been used widely as the most simple and powerful prognostic classification in MM, but genetic abnormalities affecting prognosis were not considered in this model. In the past decade, non-random chromosomal aberrations such as t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), amp1q21 and del17p have shown to be poor prognostic value, and moreover, recent progress in genome-wide deep sequencing studies has revealed novel mutations and intra-tumor subclonal heterogeneity which may explain clinical phenotype and therapeutic resistance. Here we review the current understanding of genetic abnormalities in MM for developing better prognostic classification and molecular targeted therapies leading to the stratified or personalized medicine.

23122394	20121106	Characterization and identification of alanine to serine sequence variants in an IgG4 monoclonal antibody produced in mammalian cell lines.	Low levels of alanine to serine sequence variants were identified in an IgG4 monoclonal antibody by ultra/high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. The levels of the identified sequence variants A183S and A152S, both in the light chain, have been determined to be 7.8-9.9% and 0.5-0.6%, by extracted ion currents of the tryptic peptides L16 and L14, respectively. The A183S variant was confirmed through tryptic map spiking experiments using synthetic peptide, SDYEK, which incorporated Ser at the position of native Ala in the tryptic peptide L16. Both mutations were also observed by endoproteinase Asp-N peptide mapping. The variant level of A183S was also quantified by LC-UV with detection at 280nm and fluorescence detection of tyrosine residues on the tryptic peptides. The results from LC-MS, UV, and fluorescence detection are in close agreement with each other. The levels of the sequence variants are comparable among the antibody samples manufactured at different scales as well as locations, indicating that the variants' levels are not affected by manufacture scale or locations. DNA sequencing of the master cell bank revealed the presence of mixed bases at position 183 encoding both wild and mutated populations, whereas bases encoding the minor sequence variant at position 152 were not detected. The root cause for A152S mutation is not yet clearly understood at this moment. 	J._Chromatogr._B_Analyt._Technol._Biomed._Life_Sci.	D016428
8807664	19960601	Human catechol-O-methyltransferase pharmacogenetics: description of a functional polymorphism and its potential application to neuropsychiatric disorders.	Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inactivates catecholamines and catechol drugs such as L-DOPA. A common genetic polymorphism in humans is associated with a three-to-four-fold variation in COMT enzyme activity and is also associated with individual variation in COMT thermal instability. We now show that this is due to G--&gt;A transition at codon 158 of the COMT gene that results in a valine to methionine substitution. The two alleles can be identified with a PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using the restriction enzyme Nla III. The identification of a gentic marker associated with significant alterations in enzyme activity will facilitate the analysis of a possible role for the COMT gene in neuropsychiatric conditions in which abnormalities in catecholamine neurotransmission are believed to occur, including mood disorders, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, alcohol and substance abuse, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In addition, this polymorphism may have pharmacogenetic significance in that it will help make it possible to identify patients who display altered metabolism of catechol drugs.

8980760	19970101	A novel, double mutation in DNA gyrase A of Escherichia coli conferring resistance to quinolone antibiotics.	A spontaneous Escherichia coli mutant, named Q3, resistant to nalidixic acid was obtained from a previously described clinical isolate of E. coli, Q2, resistant to fluoroquinolones but susceptible to nalidixic acid (E. Cambau, F. Bordon, E. Collatz, and L. Gutmann, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 37:1247-1252, 1993). Q3 harbored the mutation Asp82Gly in addition to the Gly81Asp mutation of Q2. The different mutations leading to Gly81Asp, Asp82Gly, and Gly81AspAsp82Gly were introduced into the gyrA gene harbored on plasmid pJSW102, and the resulting plasmids were introduced into E. coli KNK453 (gyrAts) by transformation. The presence of Asp82Gly or Gly81Asp alone led to a low-level resistance to fluoroquinolones but not to nalidixic acid resistance. When both mutations were present, resistance to both nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones was expressed. Purified gyrases of the different mutants showed similar rates of supercoiling. Dominance of the various gyrA mutant alleles harbored on plasmids was examined. The susceptibility to quinolones associated with wild-type gyrA was always dominant. The susceptibility to nalidixic acid expressed by the Gly81Asp mutant was dominant, while that expressed by the Asp82Gly mutant was recessive. From these results, we hypothesize that some amino acids within the quinolone resistance-determining region of gyrase A are more important for the association of subunits rather than for the activity of the holoenzyme.

To screen out the anti-platelet GPIIb/IIIa autoantibody which can inhibit with aggregation function of platelet and construct a humanized anti-platelet GPIIb/IIIa single chain Fv library by phage surface display technology. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients whose plasma contains anti-platelet GPIIb/IIIa autoantibodies were screened out. The antibodies can inhibit the aggregation function of platelet by using MAIPA assay and platelet aggregation test. The heavy chain and light chain variable region genes of human immunoglobulin were amplified by RT-PCR from peripheral blood lymphocytes mRNA of the patients screened out and randomly combined through a DNA linker encoding the peptide (Gly(4)Ser)(3) to construct single chain Fv gene. ScFv gene was digested with SfiI/NotI restricted digest enzyme to ligate the pHEN2 cloning vector, then were electrically transformed to E.coli TG1. The TG1 containing ScFv-pHEN2 was rescued by helper phage M13K07 to produce ScFv phage antibody. Of 95 chronic ITP patients, 41 (43.2%) were found positive for anti-platelet GPIIb/IIIa autoantibody, 5 (5.3%) were markedly positive. 2 (2.1%) patients plasma significantly inhibited the aggregation function of platelet. The lengths of VH and VL were about 380 to 400 bp. They were successfully linked by DNA linker to form ScFv fragment of about 780 bp. After cloning ScFv to phagemid pHEN2 and transforming ScFv-pHEN2 to TG1, 2.1 x 10(7) clones formed. After M13K07 rescue, 1.62 x 10(10) cfu/ml ScFv phage antibodies were produced. Few anti-platelet GPIIb/IIIa antibodies can inhibit the aggregation function of platelet. A phage antibody library has been constructed by phage surface display technology. Humanized anti-platelet GPIIb/IIIa ScFv phage antibody can be screened from this library. 	Zhonghua_Nei_Ke_Za_Zhi	D004740 D016428 D013485
23555527	20130405	Genetics of microscopic polyangiitis in the Japanese population.	The epidemiology of ANCA-associated vasculitis is substantially different between Caucasians and Japanese, which may be related to differences in genetic backgrounds. In this review, I discussed our findings on the genetics of microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) in Japanese. Analysis of HLA genes revealed a significant increase in the HLA-DRB1*09:01-DQB1*03:03 haplotype MPA. This is one of the most frequent haplotypes in Japanese, but is nearly absent in Caucasians, and has been shown to be associated with multiple autoimmune diseases. Analysis of KIR genes revealed significant decreases in the carrier frequency of an activating receptor KIR2DS3 in MPA. When KIRs were analyzed in combination with HLA ligands, the proportion of individuals carrying KIR3DL1 and HLA-Bw4 but not KIR3DS1, the most inhibitory of all KIR3DS1/3DL1/HLA-B combinations, was significantly increased in MPA. These results suggested that decreased activation of NK and/or T cells may cause a predisposition to MPA. LILRA2 is an activating receptor involved in granulocyte and macrophage activation. LILRA2 SNP rs2241524 G &gt;A, which disrupts the intron 6 splice acceptor site, was significantly associated with MPA. The risk allele produces an LILRA2 isoform lacking three amino acids in the linker region. These findings, when confirmed by larger-scale studies, will shed light on the molecular mechanisms of MPA.

27844016	20161116	Omentin-1 rs2274907 and resistin rs1862513 polymorphisms influence genetic susceptibility to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an obesity-associated disease and dysregulation of adipokines has an important role in its development. Omentin-1 (ITLN1 protein) and resistin are two adipokine secreted from adipose tissue. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the adipokine genes may affect expression and activity of the adipokine, and thus play a contributory role in NAFLD pathogenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between omentin-1 rs2274907 (326A/T) and resistin rs1862513 (-420 C/G) polymorphisms and risk of NAFLD in Iranian patients. This case-control study was done on 282 subjects included 94 patients with NAFLD and 188 healthy peoples. The genotypes were determined using PCR-RFLP method. The frequency of omentin-1 AT genotype in patients with NAFLD was significantly different from that in the control (OR=2.3, 95% CI: 1.3-3.8, P=0.003). A significant association was observed between NAFLD and the GG genotype regarding resistin rs1862513 polymorphism (OR=2.3, 95% CI: 1.1-4.8, P=0.03). In conclusion, Omentin-1 rs2274907 and resistin rs1862513 polymorphisms might be a candidate genetic factor for susceptibility to NAFLD. 	Mol_Biol_Res_Commun	D016428
26446091	20151009	Seizures Due to a KCNQ2 Mutation: Treatment with Vitamin B6.	There is increasing evidence that vitamin B6, given either as pyridoxine or pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, can sometimes result in improved seizure control in idiopathic epilepsy. Whole-exome sequencing was used to identify a de novo mutation (c.629G&gt;A; p.Arg210His) in KCNQ2 in a 7-year-old patient whose neonatal seizures showed a response to pyridoxine and who had a high plasma to CSF pyridoxal 5'-phosphate ratio, usually indicative of an inborn error of vitamin B6 metabolism. This mutation has been described in three other patients with neonatal epileptic encephalopathy. A review of the literature was performed to assess the effectiveness of vitamin B6 treatment in patients with a KCNQ2 channelopathy. Twenty-three patients have been reported to have been trialled with B6; in three of which B6 treatment was used alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs to control seizures. The anticonvulsant effect of B6 vitamers may be propagated by multiple mechanisms including direct antagonist action on ion channels, antioxidant action on excess reactive oxygen species generated by increased neuronal firing and replenishing the pool of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate needed for the synthesis of some inhibitory neurotransmitters. Vitamin B6 may be a promising adjunctive treatment for patients with channelopathies and the wider epileptic population. This report also demonstrates that an abnormal plasma to CSF pyridoxal 5'-phosphate ratio may not be exclusive to inborn errors of vitamin B6 metabolism. 	JIMD_Rep	D016428
25180793	20140903	mTOR inhibition induces compensatory, therapeutically targetable MEK activation in renal cell carcinoma.	Rapamycin derivatives allosterically targeting mTOR are currently FDA approved to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and catalytic inhibitors of mTOR/PI3K are now in clinical trials for treating various solid tumors. We sought to investigate the relative efficacy of allosteric versus catalytic mTOR inhibition, evaluate the crosstalk between the mTOR and MEK/ERK pathways, as well as the therapeutic potential of dual mTOR and MEK inhibition in RCC. Pharmacologic (rapamycin and BEZ235) and genetic manipulation of the mTOR pathway were evaluated by in vitro assays as monotherapy as well as in combination with MEK inhibition (GSK1120212). Catalytic mTOR inhibition with BEZ235 decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis better than allosteric mTOR inhibition with rapamycin. While mTOR inhibition upregulated MEK/ERK signaling, concurrent inhibition of both pathways had enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Finally, primary RCC tumors could be classified into subgroups [(I) MEK activated, (II) Dual MEK and mTOR activated, (III) Not activated, and (IV) mTOR activated] based on their relative activation of the PI3K/mTOR and MEK pathways. Patients with mTOR only activated tumors had the worst prognosis. In summary, dual targeting of the mTOR and MEK pathways in RCC can enhance therapeutic efficacy and primary RCC can be subclassified based on their relative levels of mTOR and MEK activation with potential therapeutic implications.

23388117	20130208	The role of BRCA1 in homologous recombination repair in response to replication stress: significance in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy.	Germ line mutations in breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) predispose women to breast and ovarian cancers. Although BRCA1 is involved in many important biological processes, the function of BRCA1 in homologous recombination (HR) mediated repair is considered one of the major mechanisms contributing to its tumor suppression activity, and the cause of hypersensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors when BRCA1 is defective. Mounting evidence suggests that the mechanism of repairing DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) by HR is different than the mechanism operating when DNA replication is blocked. Although BRCA1 has been recognized as a central component in HR, the precise role of BRCA1 in HR, particularly under replication stress, has remained largely unknown. Given the fact that DNA lesions caused by replication blockages are the primary substrates for HR in mitotic cells, functional analysis of BRCA1 in HR repair in the context of replication stress should benefit our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis associated with BRCA1 deficiencies, as well as the development of therapeutic approaches for cancer patients carrying BRCA1 mutations or reduced BRCA1 expression. This review focuses on the current advances in this setting and also discusses the significance in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy. 	Cell_Biosci	D016428
2668268	19890815	Fumarate reductase mutants of Escherichia coli that lack covalently bound flavin.	Menaquinol-fumarate oxidoreductase of Escherichia coli is a four-subunit membrane-bound complex that catalyzes the final step in anaerobic respiration when fumarate is the terminal electron acceptor. The catalytic domain of fumarate reductase consists of the FrdA subunit, which contains the active site, and a FAD prosthetic group covalently attached to His44, plus the FrdB subunit which contains at least two of the three nonidentical iron-sulfur clusters of the enzyme. To examine the role of covalently bound FAD in enzyme activity and electron transfer during anaerobic cell growth, site-directed mutagenesis was used to alter His44 of the FrdA subunit to a Ser, Cys, or Tyr residue. The resulting mutant enzyme complexes that were synthesized associated normally with the cytoplasmic membrane, but had decreased ability (greater than 70%) to reduce fumarate with reduced benzyl viologen, an artificial electron donor of low redox potential (Em = -359 mV; Clark, W. M. (1972) Oxidation-Reduction Potentials of Organic Systems, Robert E. Kreiger Publishing Co., Melbourne, FL). Even lower activities were measured when the higher potential, natural electron donor menaquinol was used, which, however, correlated with the slower growth rates of the different mutant complexes. In contrast to the normal enzyme, the mutant enzyme complexes were unable to oxidize succinate. Substitution of Arg for His44 produced a totally inactive enzyme complex that permitted no cell growth on nonfermentable substrates with fumarate as electron acceptor. All four mutant complexes contained noncovalently bound FAD in stoichiometric amounts. These data indicate a unique role of the 8 alpha-[N(3)-histidyl] FAD linkage in enzyme activity, by raising the redox potential of free FAD to permit reduction by both menaquinol and succinate.

Current BRAF inhibitors block signaling from monomeric BRAF(V600E), but not from oncogenic RAS, which requires RAF dimerization. In this issue of Cancer Cell, Yao and colleagues investigate why current drugs are ineffective against RAF dimers, while Peng and colleagues describe a pan-RAF inhibitor targeting both monomeric and dimeric RAF.

17241921	20070124	Promiscuity of the AlloHLA-A2 restricted T cell repertoire hampers the generation of minor Histocompatibility antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells across HLA barriers.	Hematopoietic system-specific miHAs are ideal targets for adoptive immunotherapy after allogeneic HLA (alloHLA)-matched SCT. Adoptive immunotherapy with cytotoxic T cells targeting hematopoietic system-specific miHAs restricted by alloHLA molecules is an attractive strategy to treat relapsed hematologic malignancies after HLA-mismatched SCT. As a proof of principle, we exploited 2 new strategies to generate alloHLA-A2-restricted miHA-specific T cells from HLA-A2(neg) donors using a HLA/miHA multimer-guided approach. In one strategy, autologous DCs coated with HLA-A2/miHA complexes were used for in vitro generation of miHA-specific T cells from HLA-A2(neg) male donors. In the other strategy, miHA-specific T cells were directly isolated from the peripheral blood of HLA-A2(neg) parous females with HLA-A2(pos) offspring. Both methods introduced recombinant HLA-A2/miHA complexes as the sole allogeneic target antigen. However, neither method yielded high avidity miHA-specific T cells or prevented the emergence of peptide-dependent promiscuous T cells. The latter T cells resembled miHA-specific T cells so closely with regard to tetramer binding and cytokine production that only extensive testing at a clonal level revealed their nonspecific nature. Therefore, promiscuity of the alloHLA-A2 T cell repertoire of HLA-A2(neg) individuals hampers in vitro generation of genuine miHA-specific T cells and limits its use for adoptive immunotherapy after HLA-A2 mismatched SCT.

16921166	20060822	Functional difference of the SOX10 mutant proteins responsible for the phenotypic variability in auditory-pigmentary disorders.	Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is an inherited disorder, characterized by auditory-pigmentary abnormalities. SOX10 transcription factor and endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB) are responsible for WS type 4 (WS4), which also exhibits megacolon, while microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is responsible for WS2, which is not associated with megacolon. Here, we investigated the functions of SOX10 mutant proteins using the target promoters, EDNRB and MITF. The SOX10 mutations chosen were E189X, Q377X, and 482ins6, which are associated with WS4, and S135T that is associated with Yemenite deaf-blind hypopigmentation syndrome (YDBS), which does not manifest megacolon. These SOX10 mutant proteins showed impaired transactivation activity on the MITF promoter. In contrast, E189X and Q377X proteins, each of which lacks its C-terminal portion, activated the EDNRB promoter, whereas no activation was detected with the SOX10 proteins mutated at the DNA-binding domain, 482ins6 and S135T. However, unlike 482ins6 protein, S135T protein synergistically activated EDNRB promoter with a transcription factor Sp1, indicating that Sp1 could compensate the impaired function of a SOX10 mutant protein. We suggest that the variability in transactivation ability of SOX10 mutant proteins may account for the different phenotypes between WS4 and YDBS and that Sp1 is a potential modifier gene of WS4.

21895628	20110908	Effects of palmitoylation of Cys(415) in helix 8 of the CB(1) cannabinoid receptor on membrane localization and signalling.	The CB(1) cannabinoid receptor is regulated by its association with membrane microdomains such as lipid rafts. Here, we investigated the role of palmitoylation of the CB(1) receptor by analysing the functional consequences of site-specific mutation of Cys(415) , the likely site of palmitoylation at the end of helix 8, in terms of membrane association, raft targeting and signalling. The palmitoylation state of CB(1) receptors in rat forebrain was assessed by depalmitoylation/repalmitoylation experiments. Cys(415) was replaced with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. Green fluorescence protein chimeras of both wild-type and mutant receptors were transiently expressed and functionally characterized in SH-SY5Y cells and HEK-293 cells by means of confocal microscopy, cytofluorimetry and competitive binding assays. Confocal fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was used to assess receptor membrane dynamics, whereas signalling activity was assessed by [(35) S]GTP?S, cAMP and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Endogenous CB(1) receptors in rat brain were palmitoylated. Mutation of Cys(415) prevented the palmitoylation of the receptor in transfected cells and reduced its recruitment to plasma membrane and lipid rafts; it also increased protein diffusional mobility. The same mutation markedly reduced the functional coupling of CB(1) receptors with G-proteins and adenylyl cyclase, whereas depalmitoylation abolished receptor association with a specific subset of G-proteins. CB(1) receptors were post-translationally modified by palmitoylation. Mutation of Cys(415) provides a receptor that is functionally impaired in terms of membrane targeting and signalling.

23449784	20130302	The pH of activation of the hemagglutinin protein regulates H5N1 influenza virus replication and pathogenesis in mice.	After receptor binding and internalization during influenza virus entry, the hemagglutinin (HA) protein is triggered by low pH to undergo irreversible conformational changes that mediate membrane fusion. To investigate how mutations that alter the activation pH of the HA protein influence the fitness of an avian H5N1 influenza virus in a mammalian model, we infected C57BL/6J or DBA/2J mice and compared the replication and virulence of recombinant A/chicken/Vietnam/C58/04 (H5N1) HA-Y231H mutant, wild-type, and HA-H241Q and HA-K582I mutant viruses that have HA activation pH values of 6.3, 5.9, 5.6, and 5.4, respectively. The HA-Y231H mutant virus was highly susceptible to acid inactivation in vitro and was attenuated for growth and virulence in mice, suggesting that an H5N1 HA protein triggered at pH 6.3 is too unstable for the virus to remain fit. Wild-type and HA-H241Q viruses were similar in pathogenicity and grew to similar levels in mice, ducks, and cell cultures derived from both avian and mammalian tissues, suggesting that H5N1 HA proteins triggered at pH values in the range of 5.9 to 5.6 broadly support replication. The HA-K582I mutant virus had greater growth and virulence in DBA/2J mice than the wild type did, although the mutant virus was highly attenuated in ducks. The data suggest that adaptation of avian H5N1 influenza virus for infection in mammals is supported by a decrease in the HA activation pH to 5.4. Identification of the HA activation pH as a host-specific infectivity factor is expected to aid in the surveillance and risk assessment of currently circulating H5N1 influenza viruses. 	J._Virol.

25459751	20141203	Alteration of Scn3a expression is mediated via CpG methylation and MBD2 in mouse hippocampus during postnatal development and seizure condition.	Increased expression of sodium channel SCN3A, an embryonic-expressed gene, has been identified in epileptic tissues, which is believed to contribute to the development of epilepsy. However, the regulatory mechanism of SCN3A expression under epileptic condition is still unknown. Here we showed a high level of Scn3a mRNA expression in mouse embryonic hippocampus with gradually decreasing to a low level during the postnatal development and a methylation of a specific CpG site (-39C) in the Scn3a promoter was increased in hippocampus during postnatal development, corresponding to the downregulation of Scn3a expression. Furthermore, in vitro methylation and -39C&gt;T mutation of the Scn3a promoter decreased the reporter gene expression, suggesting an important role of the -39C site in regulating gene expression. We then demonstrated that the sequence containing -39C was a MBD2-binding motif and the CpG methylation of the promoter region increased the capability of MBD2's binding to the motif. Knockdown of MBD2 in mouse N1E-115 cells led to the -39C methylation and the downregulation of Scn3a transcription by decreasing the Scn3a promoter activity. In the hippocampus of seizure mice, the expressions of Scn3a and Mbd2 were upregulated after 10-day KA treatment. At the same time point, the -39C site was demethylated and the capability of MBD2's binding to the Scn3a promoter motif was decreased. Taken together, these findings suggest that CpG methylation and MBD2 are involved in altering Scn3a expression during postnatal development and seizure condition.

14622271	20031119	Mutations in the C-terminal domain of ALSV (Avian Leukemia and Sarcoma Viruses) integrase alter the concerted DNA integration process in vitro.	Integrase (IN) is the retroviral enzyme responsible for the integration of the DNA copy of the retroviral genome into the host cell DNA. The C-terminal domain of IN is involved in DNA binding and enzyme multimerization. We previously performed single amino acid substitutions in the C-terminal domain of the avian leukemia and sarcoma viruses (ALSV) IN. Here, we modelled these IN mutants and analysed their ability to mediate concerted DNA integration (in an in vitro assay) as well as to form dimers (by size exclusion chromatography and protein-protein cross-linking). Mutations of residues located at the dimer interface (V239, L240, Y246, V257 and K266) have the greatest effects on the activity of the IN. Among them: (a) the L240A mutation resulted in a decrease of integration efficiency that was concomitant with a decrease of IN dimerization; (b) the V239A, V249A and K266A mutants preferentially mediated non-concerted DNA integration rather than concerted DNA integration although they were found as dimers. Other mutations (V260E and Y246W/DeltaC25) highlight the role of the C-terminal domain in the general folding of the enzyme and, hence, on its activity. This study points to the important role of residues at the IN C-terminal domain in the folding and dimerization of the enzyme as well as in the concerted DNA integration of viral DNA ends.

11274426	20010329	Muscle-specific mutations accumulate with aging in critical human mtDNA control sites for replication.	The recently discovered aging-dependent large accumulation of point mutations in the human fibroblast mtDNA control region raised the question of their occurrence in postmitotic tissues. In the present work, analysis of biopsied or autopsied human skeletal muscle revealed the absence or only minimal presence of those mutations. By contrast, surprisingly, most of 26 individuals 53 to 92 years old, without a known history of neuromuscular disease, exhibited at mtDNA replication control sites in muscle an accumulation of two new point mutations, i.e., A189G and T408A, which were absent or marginally present in 19 individuals younger than 34 years. These two mutations were not found in fibroblasts from 22 subjects 64 to 101 years of age (T408A), or were present only in three subjects in very low amounts (A189G). Furthermore, in several older individuals exhibiting an accumulation in muscle of one or both of these mutations, they were nearly absent in other tissues, whereas the most frequent fibroblast-specific mutation (T414G) was present in skin, but not in muscle. Among eight additional individuals exhibiting partial denervation of their biopsied muscle, four subjects &gt;80 years old had accumulated the two muscle-specific point mutations, which were, conversely, present at only very low levels in four subjects &lt; or =40 years old. The striking tissue specificity of the muscle mtDNA mutations detected here and their mapping at critical sites for mtDNA replication strongly point to the involvement of a specific mutagenic machinery and to the functional relevance of these mutations.

20189584	20100302	Involvement of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase in morphine-induced cardioprotection.	Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) orchestrates the regulation of energy-generating and -consuming pathways, and protects the heart against ischemic injury and apoptosis. Recent progress shed light on various factors, including adiponectin, MIF, H11K, and metformin in the activation of AMPK. It is uncertain whether the activation of AMPK is contributed to cardioprotection of opioids. Here we show that morphine, an exogenous non-peptide opioid receptor agonist, can modulate the activation of the cardioprotective AMPK pathway during ischemia and exert anti-apoptotic effects through AMPK. Isolated rat hearts were perfused on a constant pressure Langendorff system and subjected to 30 min of global ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion. The hearts received vehicles, morphine, a combination of morphine and compound C, a combination of morphine and STO609, a combination of morphine and BAPTA-AM at the onset of ischemia. Hemodynamics parameters, infarct size, release of intracellular creatine kinase, expression of AMPK, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining were analyzed. Morphine significantly increased phosphorylation level of Thr172 site on AMPK, left ventricular function, and reduced infarct size as a percentage of the area at risk (IS/AAR from 63% ? 7% to 40% ? 5%), release of intracellular creatine kinase (from 319 ? 46 to 156 ? 42IU/60 min/gdw), apoptosis ratio (from 16% ? 2% to 5% ? 1.4%) during reperfusion in comparison with the control group. A inhibitor of AMPK, compound C abrogated phosphorylation of AMPK induced by morphine, the improvement in myocardial function, and the reduction of IS/AAR (58% ? 6%), release of intracellular creatine kinase (270 ? 40IU/60 min/gdw), apoptosis ratio (13% ? 1.5%). A Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase inhibitor STO609 and a chelator of intracellular Ca(2+) stores BAPTA-AM also abolished the cardioprotection of morphine. Morphine can ameliorate myocardial contractile dysfunction and limit infarct size following ischemia and reperfusion by a mechanism involving activation of AMPK, and activate AMPK by Ca(2+)-CaMKK?-dependent phosphorylation.

27466336	20160729	Distinct Functions of Syntaxin-1 in Neuronal Maintenance, Synaptic Vesicle Docking, and Fusion in Mouse Neurons.	Neurotransmitter release requires the formation of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes by SNARE proteins syntaxin-1 (Stx1), synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25), and synaptobrevin-2 (Syb2). In mammalian systems, loss of SNAP-25 or Syb2 severely impairs neurotransmitter release; however, complete loss of function studies for Stx1 have been elusive due to the functional redundancy between Stx1 isoforms Stx1A and Stx1B and the embryonic lethality of Stx1A/1B double knock-out (DKO) mice. Here, we studied the roles of Stx1 in neuronal maintenance and neurotransmitter release in mice with constitutive or conditional deletion of Stx1B on an Stx1A-null background. Both constitutive and postnatal loss of Stx1 severely compromised neuronal viability in vivo and in vitro, indicating an obligatory role of Stx1 for maintenance of developing and mature neurons. Loss of Munc18-1, a high-affinity binding partner of Stx1, also showed severely impaired neuronal viability, but with a slower time course compared with Stx1A/1B DKO neurons, and exogenous Stx1A or Stx1B expression significantly delayed Munc18-1-dependent lethality. In addition, loss of Stx1 completely abolished fusion-competent vesicles and severely impaired vesicle docking, demonstrating its essential roles in neurotransmission. Putative partial SNARE complex assembly with the SNARE motif mutant Stx1A(AV) (A240V, V244A) was not sufficient to rescue neurotransmission despite full recovery of vesicle docking and neuronal survival. Together, these data suggest that Stx1 has independent functions in neuronal maintenance and neurotransmitter release and complete SNARE complex formation is required for vesicle fusion and priming, whereas partial SNARE complex formation is sufficient for vesicle docking and neuronal maintenance. Syntaxin-1 (Stx1) is a component of the synaptic vesicle soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex and is essential for neurotransmission. We present the first detailed loss-of-function characterization of the two Stx1 isoforms in central mammalian neurons. We show that Stx1 is fundamental for maintenance of developing and mature neurons and also for vesicle docking and neurotransmission. We also demonstrate that neuronal maintenance and neurotransmitter release are regulated by Stx1 through independent functions. Furthermore, we show that SNARE complex formation is required for vesicle fusion, whereas partial SNARE complex formation is sufficient for vesicle docking and neuronal maintenance. Therefore, our work provides insights into differential functions of Stx1 in neuronal maintenance and neurotransmission, with the latter explored further into its functions in vesicle docking and fusion.

24904823	20140607	Targeting T cell immunometabolism for cancer immunotherapy; understanding the impact of the tumor microenvironment.	The immune system has a key role to play in controlling cancer initiation and progression. T cell activation, which is central to anti-tumor immune responses, coincides with changes in cellular metabolism. Na?ve T cells predominantly require an ATP generating metabolic profile, whereas proliferating effector T cells require anabolic metabolic profiles that promote rapid growth and proliferation. Furthermore, specific T cell subsets require distinct energetic and biosynthetic pathways to match their functional requirements. The often hostile tumor microenvironment can affect T cell immune responses by altering the resulting cellular metabolism. Tailoring immune responses by manipulating cellular metabolic pathways may provide an exciting new option for cancer immunotherapy. T cell responses might also be skewed via metabolic manipulation to treat the complications of obesity-associated inflammation, which is a rapidly growing global health problem and a major risk factor for many malignancies. In this review, the diverse metabolic requirements of T cells in anti-tumor immunity are discussed, as well as the profound influence of the tumor microenvironment and the possible avenues for manipulation to enhance anti-tumor immunity.

15315827	20040819	A BMAL1 mutant with arginine 91 substituted with alanine acts as a dominant negative inhibitor.	Basic-Helix-Loop-Helix-Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH-PAS) transcription factor, Brain-Muscle-Arnt-Like-protein 1 (BMAL1), forms a heterodimer with the CLOCK protein. The BMAL1/CLOCK complex binds to a specific DNA sequence and plays an essential role in the generation of the circadian rhythm. The basic region of BMAL1 contains an E-R-X-R motif that is highly conserved among basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors that bind to the E-box transcription element, and is thus thought to constitute a structure required for recognition of this DNA sequence. To understand the role of arginine 91 (E-K-R-R) within the basic region of BMAL1, we examined the effect of mutation of this residue on BMAL1 function. Co-immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) showed that a BMAL1 R91A mutant forms a heterodimer with CLOCK, but is unable to support DNA binding in vitro. Consistent with these observations, plasmids encoding the R91A and R91H mutants of BMAL1 were unable to stimulate transcription from an E-box containing reporter construct in transient co-transfection analyses in NIH 3T3 cells. More importantly, these mutants suppressed the activation of transcription from the reporter construct mediated by wild-type BMAL1, indicating that they possess dominant negative activity in this assay. These results document further the importance of the basic region of BMAL1 in binding to DNA and suggest that this new mutant might be a useful tool for further analysis of BMAL1 function.

21476902	20110412	Impact of aldosterone synthase gene C-344T polymorphism on IgA nephropathy.	In the past years, aldosterone has been identified as an important mediator of renal injury. In this study, we evaluated the influence of C-344T polymorphism of aldosterone synthase gene, associated with serum aldosterone levels and the development of arterial hypertension, on IgA nephropathy (IgAN). We studied n = 143 patients with biopsy-proven IgAN followed up for 7.1 ? 6.2 years. Patients were classified according to the slope of reciprocal serum creatinine into group A (slow progressors, n = 93) and group B (fast progressors, n = 50). One hundred healthy volunteers were analyzed as controls. The biopsies of n = 79 patients were reviewed and analyzed by the same pathologist. Aldosterone synthase gene C-344T polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification. The genotype distribution was similar in patients and control subjects [not significant (ns)]. Age, initial renal function, proteinuria, and blood pressure did not differ significantly between patients with different genotypes (ns). The percentage of sclerosed glomeruli tended to be higher among patients carrying the CC/CT genotypes (29.4 ? 26.5% vs. 21.7 ? 25.2% in TT genotype; ns). C-344T polymorphism was associated with the progression of IgAN as shown by the different genotype frequencies in group ? (slow progressors, 60.2%, TT: 39.8%) and group B (fast progressors, 78.0%, TT: 22:0%; p = 0.032). Our results indicate that aldosterone synthase gene C-344T polymorphism is a risk factor for accelerated progression in Caucasian patients with IgAN. 	Ren_Fail	D016428 D013485
25256166	20140927	Mutational profiling of kinases in glioblastoma.	Glioblastoma is a highly malignant brain tumor for which no cure is available. To identify new therapeutic targets, we performed a mutation analysis of kinase genes in glioblastoma. Database mining and a literature search identified 76 kinases that have been found to be mutated at least twice in multiple cancer types before. Among those we selected 34 kinase genes for mutation analysis. We also included IDH1, IDH2, PTEN, TP53 and NRAS, genes that are known to be mutated at considerable frequencies in glioblastoma. In total, 174 exons of 39 genes in 113 glioblastoma samples from 109 patients and 16 high-grade glioma (HGG) cell lines were sequenced. Our mutation analysis led to the identification of 148 non-synonymous somatic mutations, of which 25 have not been reported before in glioblastoma. Somatic mutations were found in TP53, PTEN, IDH1, PIK3CA, EGFR, BRAF, EPHA3, NRAS, TGFBR2, FLT3 and RPS6KC1. Mapping the mutated genes into known signaling pathways revealed that the large majority of them plays a central role in the PI3K-AKT pathway. The knowledge that at least 50% of glioblastoma tumors display mutational activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway should offer new opportunities for the rational development of therapeutic approaches for glioblastomas. However, due to the development of resistance mechanisms, kinase inhibition studies targeting the PI3K-AKT pathway for relapsing glioblastoma have mostly failed thus far. Other therapies should be investigated, targeting early events in gliomagenesis that involve both kinases and non-kinases. 	BMC_Cancer	D016428 D013485
25608993	20150123	[Association between single nucleotide polymorphism of rs2252673 of INSR gene and polycystic ovarian syndrome].	This study is designed to determine whether an association exists between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant rs2252673 of insulin receptor (INSR) gene and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in Han Chinese in order to identify INSR as a genetic susceptibility factor for PCOS. A total of 224 women with PCOS, 192 controls and 672 participants consisting of 224 trios (mother, father and offspring with PCOS) were recruited from the Hospital for Reproductive Medicine Affiliated to Shandong University, from July 2007 to April 2013. Genomic DNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol. SNP rs2252673 of INSR gene was amplified by PCR and then sequenced on an automated sequencer. Moreover, clinical and metabolic features of the patients with PCOS were compared according to the genotypes. The subjects were divided into twot groups according to body mass index (BMI), and then the results were compared between two groups. And the transmitted disequilibrium test (TDT) was applied for data analysis. (1) There were three kinds of genotype of CC, CG and GG. Genotype frequencies of rs2252673 were 8.0%, 38.8%, 53.1% and 14.6%, 42.2%, 43.2% in the PCOS group and the control group, respectively. The allele frequencies of C and G were 27.5%, 72.5% and 35.7%, 64.3% in the PCOS group and the control group, respectively. There were statistical differences in genotype frequencies and allele frequencies between two groups (all P &lt; 0.05 ). (2)No significant differences were observed in the different genotype according to clinical and metabolic characteristics of women with PCOS(P &gt; 0.05). But when merging the genotype CG and GG, carriers of the CG and GG genotypes in women with PCOS were slightly associated with total cholesterol (TC) levels (t = 2.072, P = 0.048) and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (t = 2.274, P = 0.026). Although statistical significance was not achieved, there was an increased tendency in fasting blood glucose (FBG) and fasting insulin (FINS) levels in CG and GG genotypes in PCOS cases.(3)Between the obesity and the non-obesity with PCOS, there was no statistical significance in the genotype and allele frequencies (?(2) = 0.054, P = 0.974; ?(2) = 0.022, P = 0.883 ). (4) The results of families based analysis shown that genotype distribution of the SNP rs2252673 was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P &gt; 0.05). After the TDT, the G allele in SNP rs2252673 was over transmitted in families (transmitted:non-transmitted = 120:88; ?(2) = 4.923, P = 0.027). There was a transmitted disequilibrium in rs2252673, which implies the association of INSR and PCOS were independent of population stratification. There were a association between the SNP variant rs2252673 of INSR gene and the susceptibility to PCOS in Han Chinese women, which was independently of body mass index. The carrier of G allele frequency of rs2252673 may have higher risk of PCOS. 	Zhonghua_Fu_Chan_Ke_Za_Zhi	D004740 D016428
16604422	20060411	Assessment of the effects of increased relaxation dispersion data on the extraction of 3-site exchange parameters characterizing the unfolding of an SH3 domain.	Recently a suite of six CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments has been described for quantifying millisecond time-scale exchange processes in proteins. The methodology has been applied to study the folding reaction of a G48M Fyn SH3 domain mutant that exchanges between the native state, and low populated unfolded and intermediate states. A complex non-linear global optimization protocol allows extraction of the kinetics and thermodynamics of the 3-site exchange process from the experimental data, as well as reconstruction of the amide group chemical shifts of the excited states. We show here, through a series of Monte-Carlo simulations on various synthetic data sets, that the 3-site exchange parameters extracted for this system on the basis of (15)N single-quantum (SQ) dispersion profiles exclusively, recorded at a single temperature, are significantly in error. While a temperature dependent (15)N study improves the robustness of extracted parameters, as does a combined analysis of (15)N and (1)H SQ data sets measured at a single temperature, the best agreement is observed in cases where the full complement of six dispersion profiles per residue is analyzed.

20417220	20100427	Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol is a full agonist at CB1 receptors on GABA neuron axon terminals in the hippocampus.	Marijuana impairs learning and memory through actions of its psychoactive constituent, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC), in the hippocampus, through activation of cannabinoid CB1 receptors (CB1R). CB1Rs are found on glutamate and GABA neuron axon terminals in the hippocampus where they control neurotransmitter release. Previous studies suggest that Delta(9)-THC is a partial agonist of CB1Rs on glutamate axon terminals in the hippocampus, whereas its effects on GABA terminals have not been described. Using whole-cell electrophysiology in brain slices from C57BL6/J mice, we examined Delta(9)-THC effects on synaptic GABA IPSCs and postsynaptic GABA currents elicited by laser-induced photo-uncaging (photolysis) of alpha-carboxy-2-nitrobenzyl (CNB) caged GABA. Despite robust inhibition of synaptic IPSCs in wildtype mice by the full synthetic agonist WIN55,212-2, using a Tween-80 and DMSO vehicle, Delta(9)-THC had no effects on IPSCs in this, or in a low concentration of another vehicle, randomly-methylated beta-cyclodextrin (RAMEB, 0.023%). However, IPSCs were inhibited by Delta(9)-THC in 0.1% RAMEB, but not in neurons from CB1R knockout mice. Whereas Delta(9)-THC did not affect photolysis-evoked GABA currents, these responses were prolonged by a GABA uptake inhibitor. Concentration-response curves revealed that the maximal effects of Delta(9)-THC and WIN55,212-2 were similar, indicating that Delta(9)-THC is a full agonist at CB1Rs on GABA axon terminals. These results suggest that Delta(9)-THC inhibits GABA release, but does not directly alter GABA(A) receptors or GABA uptake in the hippocampus. Furthermore, full agonist effects of Delta(9)-THC on IPSCs likely result from a much higher expression of CB1Rs on GABA versus glutamate axon terminals in the hippocampus.

16831127	20060713	The differential catalytic activity of ribosome-inactivating proteins saporin 5 and 6 is due to a single substitution at position 162.	Saporin, a type I ribosome-inactivating protein produced by the soapwort plant Saponaria officinalis belongs to a multigene family that encodes its several isoforms. The saporin seed isoform 6 has significantly higher N-glycosidase and cytotoxic activities compared with the seed isoform 5, although the two have identical active sites. In the present study, we have investigated the contribution of non-conservative amino acid changes outside the active sites of these isoforms towards their differential catalytic activity. The saporin 6 residues Lys134, Leu147, Phe149, Asn162, Thr188 and Asp196 were replaced by the corresponding saporin 5 residues, Gln134, Ser147, Ser149, Asp162, Ile188 and Asn196, to generate six variants of saporin 6, K134Q, L147S, F149S, N162D, T188I and D196N. By functional characterization, we show that the change in amino acid Asn162 in saporin 6 to aspartic acid residue of saporin 5 contributes mainly to the lower catalytic activity of saporin 5 compared with saporin 6. The non-involvement of other non-conservative amino acids in the differential catalytic activity of these isoforms was confirmed with the help of the double mutations N162D/K134Q, N162D/L147S, N162D/F149S, N162D/T188I and N162D/D196N.

19194963	20090206	Common and rare variants of DAOA in bipolar disorder.	The D-amino acid oxidase activator (DAOA, previously known as G72) gene, mapped on 13q33, has been reported to be genetically associated with bipolar disorder (BP) in several populations. The consistency of associated variants is unclear and rare variants in exons of the DAOA gene have not been investigated in psychiatric diseases. We employed a conditional linkage method-STatistical Explanation for Positional Cloning (STEPC) to evaluate whether any associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) account for the evidence of linkage in a pedigree series that previously has been linked to marker D13S779 at 13q33. We also performed an association study in a sample of 376 Caucasian BP parent-proband trios by genotyping 38 common SNPs in the gene region. Besides, we resequenced coding regions and flanking intronic sequences of DAOA in 555 Caucasian unrelated BP patients and 564 mentally healthy controls, to identify putative functional rare variants that may contribute to disease. One SNP rs1935058 could &quot;explain&quot; the linkage signal in the family sample set (P = 0.055) using STEPC analysis. No significant allelic association was detected in an association study by genotyping 38 common SNPs in 376 Caucasian BP trios. Resequencing identified 53 SNPs, of which 46 were novel SNPs. There was no significant excess of rare variants in cases relative to controls. Our results suggest that DAOA does not have a major effect on BP susceptibility. However, DAOA may contribute to bipolar susceptibility in some specific families as evidenced by the STEPC analysis. 	Am._J._Med._Genet._B_Neuropsychiatr._Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013485
21283772	20110202	The mitochondrial genome of the legume Vigna radiata and the analysis of recombination across short mitochondrial repeats.	The mitochondrial genomes of seed plants are exceptionally fluid in size, structure, and sequence content, with the accumulation and activity of repetitive sequences underlying much of this variation. We report the first fully sequenced mitochondrial genome of a legume, Vigna radiata (mung bean), and show that despite its unexceptional size (401,262 nt), the genome is unusually depauperate in repetitive DNA and &quot;promiscuous&quot; sequences from the chloroplast and nuclear genomes. Although Vigna lacks the large, recombinationally active repeats typical of most other seed plants, a PCR survey of its modest repertoire of short (38-297 nt) repeats nevertheless revealed evidence for recombination across all of them. A set of novel control assays showed, however, that these results could instead reflect, in part or entirely, artifacts of PCR-mediated recombination. Consequently, we recommend that other methods, especially high-depth genome sequencing, be used instead of PCR to infer patterns of plant mitochondrial recombination. The average-sized but repeat- and feature-poor mitochondrial genome of Vigna makes it ever more difficult to generalize about the factors shaping the size and sequence content of plant mitochondrial genomes.

7683085	19930501	Mutational specificity of oxidative DNA damage.	In this paper we describe our studies on the mutagenic consequences of oxidative DNA damage introduced by radiation-induced OH radicals (.OH) and by exposure to singlet oxygen (1O2), released by thermo-dissociation of the endoperoxide 3,3'-(1,4-naphthalidene) dipropionate (NDPO2). We have made use of M13mp10 bacteriophage and pUC18 plasmid DNA, containing a 144 base pair (bp) insert in the lacZ alpha gene. This 144 bp insert was used as a mutational target sequence. When dilute aqueous solutions of double-stranded (ds) M13mp10 (plus 144 bp insert) were gamma-irradiated in the presence of oxygen (O2; 100% .OH) or nitrous oxide (N2O; 90% .OH, 10% .H), very specific mutation spectra were found. Mainly bp substitutions were observed, of which C/G to G/C transversions are the predominant type. Moreover, the mutations are for the most part concentrated into two mutational hot spots: a minor and major one. Differences between the oxic (O2) and anoxic (N2O) mutation spectra could also be observed. Under N2O-1 bp deletions were detected, which are absent in the presence of O2, and in the anoxic spectrum more C/G to A/T transversions are present. To investigate whether these differences were due to the small amount of H radicals, which are formed under N2O, ds M13mp10 (plus 144 bp insert) was exposed to gamma-rays in phosphate buffer under nitrogen (55% .H, 45% .OH). Under these conditions a remarkable shift was observed from C/G--&gt;G/C to C/G--&gt;A/T transversions, while the mutations were far more scattered along the 144 bp sequence and no -1 bp deletions were detected. These results strongly suggest that H radicals do not cause -1 bp deletions, but may be responsible for the observed C/G to A/T transversions. The kind of bp substitution not only appeared to be dependent on the type of the water radicals, but also appeared to be strongly influenced by the replicon in which the target sequence is incorporated. When an oxygenated solution of pUC18 plasmid DNA (plus 144 bp insert) is irradiated, mainly C/G to A/T transversions were found at the same major hot spot instead of C/G to G/C transversions when the 144 bp sequence is part of M13mp10 DNA. Finally, in agreement with the observation that 1O2 reacts preferentially with guanine in DNA, a guanine is involved in most of the mutations scored after exposure of single-stranded (ss) M13mp10 DNA to NDPO2-generated 1O2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) 	Mutat._Res.

25247397	20140924	The overexpression of KIT proto-oncogene in acute leukemic cells is not necessarily caused by the gene mutation.	KIT is detected in a variety of cells, also in acute leukemia. Inhibition of wild-type KIT is not always satisfactory. The aim of this work was to evaluate the frequency of the most common KIT mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and determine the correlation between mutation and expression level. Samples were obtained from 75 patients with AL. CD117 presence was shown in 45 of 51 patients with AML and in 1 of 16 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Asp816Val mutation was found in 3.5% of cases of AML and Val560Gly mutation in 1 sample with acute biclonal leukemia. Other genetic changes were found in 15 of 57 samples with AML: polymorphisms Met541Leu in 14% of cases, Lys546Lys in 7% and 1 case of acute biclonal leukemia, Ile798Ile in 5.3% of cases, Met541Leu in 1 acute biphenotypic leukemia and in 6.3% of ALL. Polymorphism Lys546Lys was also shown in 1 case of acute biclonal leukemia. Nonsilent genetic changes were detected in a total of 23% cases with core binding factor leukemia. There was no statistical significance between KIT expression and genetic changes. There was no correlation between the incidence and types of KIT mutations and its expression on cells in AML.

25277760	20141004	Neuroprotective effects of Psoralea corylifolia Linn seed extracts on mitochondrial dysfunction induced by 3-nitropropionic acid.	Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in neuronal apoptosis associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD). Animals that are administered 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), a mitochondrial toxin that specifically inhibits complex II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, manifest HD-like symptoms. Psoralea corylifolia Linn seed extracts against 3-NP induced mitochondrial dysfunction in cultured rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, which are used for neurobiological studies. In this study showed that 3-NP-treated PC12 cells had decreased ATP levels, lower cellular oxygen consumption, and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential than those of untreated PC12 cells. Psoralea corylifolia Linn seed extracts stimulated mitochondrial respiration with uncoupling and induced an increased bioenergetic reserve capacity. Furthermore, PC12 cells pretreated with P. corylifolia Linn seed extracts significantly attenuated 3-NP-induced cell death, reduced ATP levels, and lowered the mitochondrial membrane potential. These results demonstrate that P. corylifolia Linn seed extracts have a significant protective effect against 3-NP induced cytotoxicity. Thus, our results indicate that P. corylifolia Linn seed extracts may have potential applications as therapeutic agents for treating neurodegenerative disease.

25813047	20150328	New insights into Hoogsteen base pairs in DNA duplexes from a structure-based survey.	Hoogsteen (HG) base pairs (bps) provide an alternative pairing geometry to Watson-Crick (WC) bps and can play unique functional roles in duplex DNA. Here, we use structural features unique to HG bps (syn purine base, HG hydrogen bonds and constricted C1'-C1' distance across the bp) to search for HG bps in X-ray structures of DNA duplexes in the Protein Data Bank. The survey identifies 106 A?T and 34 G?C HG bps in DNA duplexes, many of which are undocumented in the literature. It also uncovers HG-like bps with syn purines lacking HG hydrogen bonds or constricted C1'-C1' distances that are analogous to conformations that have been proposed to populate the WC-to-HG transition pathway. The survey reveals HG preferences similar to those observed for transient HG bps in solution by nuclear magnetic resonance, including stronger preferences for A?T versus G?C bps, TA versus GG steps, and also suggests enrichment at terminal ends with a preference for 5'-purine. HG bps induce small local perturbations in neighboring bps and, surprisingly, a small but significant degree of DNA bending (?14?) directed toward the major groove. The survey provides insights into the preferences and structural consequences of HG bps in duplex DNA. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D052061 D016454
27006458	20160324	Investigation of the Genetics and Biochemistry of Roseobacticide Production in the Roseobacter Clade Bacterium Phaeobacter inhibens.	Roseobacterclade bacteria are abundant in surface waters and are among the most metabolically diverse and ecologically significant species. This group includes opportunistic symbionts that associate with micro- and macroalgae. We have proposed that one representative member,Phaeobacter inhibens, engages in a dynamic symbiosis with the microalgaEmiliania huxleyi In one phase, mutualistically beneficial molecules are exchanged, including theRoseobacter-produced antibiotic tropodithietic acid (TDA), which is thought to protect the symbiotic interaction. In an alternative parasitic phase, triggered by algal senescence, the bacteria produce potent algaecides, the roseobacticides, which kill the algal host. Here, we employed genetic and biochemical screens to identify the roseobacticide biosynthetic gene cluster. By using a transposon mutagenesis approach, we found that genes required for TDA synthesis-thetdaoperon andpaacatabolon-are also necessary for roseobacticide production. Thus, in contrast to the one-cluster-one-compound paradigm, thetdagene cluster can generate two sets of molecules with distinct structures and bioactivities. We further show that roseobacticide production is quorum sensing regulated via anN-acyl homoserine lactone signal (3-OH-C10-HSL). To ensure tight regulation of algaecide production, and thus of a lifestyle switch from mutualism to parasitism, roseobacticide biosynthesis necessitates the presence of both an algal senescence molecule and a quorum sensing signal.IMPORTANCEMarineRoseobacterspecies are abundant in the oceans and engage in symbiotic interactions with microscopic algae. One member,P. inhibens, produces the antibiotic TDA and a growth hormone thought to protect and promote algal growth. However, in the presence of molecules released by senescing algae, the bacteria produce potent algaecides, the roseobacticides, which kill the host. We examined the regulatory networks and biosynthetic genes required for roseobacticide production. We found thatP. inhibensuses largely the same set of genes for production of both TDA and roseobacticides, thus providing a rare case in which one gene cluster synthesizes two structurally and functionally distinct molecules. Moreover, we found roseobacticide production to be regulated by quorum sensing. Thus, two small molecules, the algal metabolite and the quorum-sensing signal, ensure tight control in the production of roseobacticides. These results highlight the role of small molecules in regulating microbial symbioses. 	MBio	D016428 D052061 D013485
23809633	20130702	Abolishing activity against ascorbate in a cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase from switchgrass.	Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is being developed as a bioenergy species. Recently an early version of its genome has been released permitting a route to the cloning and analysis of key proteins. Ascorbate peroxidases (APx) are an important part of the antioxidant defense system of plant cells and present a well studied model to understand structure-function relationships. Analysis of the genome indicates that switchgrass encodes several cytosolic ascorbate peroxidases with apparent varying levels of tissue expression. A major cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase was thus selected for further studies. This gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli cells to obtain purified active protein. Full heme incorporation of the enzyme was achieved utilizing slow growth and supplementing the media with 5-aminolevulinic acid. The enzyme was observed to be monomeric in solution via size exclusion chromatography. Activity toward ascorbate was observed that was non-Michaelis-Menten in nature. A site-directed mutant, R172S, was made in an attempt to differentiate activity against ascorbate versus other substrates. The R172S protein exhibited negligible ascorbate peroxidase activity, but showed near wild type activity toward other aromatic substrates. 	Phytochemistry	D016428 D052061 D013486
27990146	20161220	Leptosphaeria maculans</i>during Compatible and Incompatible Interactions with Canola.	 Leptosphaeria maculans is a hemibiotrophic fungus that causes blackleg of canola (Brassica napus), one of the most devastating diseases of this crop. In the present study, transcriptome profiling ofL. maculanswas performed in an effort to understand and define the pathogenicity genes that govern both the biotrophic and the necrotrophic phase of the fungus, as well as those that separate a compatible from an incompatible interaction. For this purpose, comparative RNA-seq analyses were performed onL. maculansisolate D5 at four different time points following inoculation on susceptible cultivar Topas-DH16516 or resistant introgression line Topas-Rlm2. Analysis of 1.6 billion Illumina reads readily identified differentially expressed genes that were over represented by candidate secretory effector proteins, CAZymes, and other pathogenicity genes. Comparisons between the compatible and incompatible interactions led to the identification of 28 effector proteins whose chronology and level of expression suggested a role in the establishment and maintenance of biotrophy with the plant. These included all knownAvrgenes of isolate D5 along with eight newly characterized effectors. In addition, another 15 effector proteins were found to be exclusively expressed during the necrotrophic phase of the fungus, which supports the concept thatL. maculanshas a separate and distinct arsenal contributing to each phase. As for CAZymes, they were often highly expressed at 3 dpi but with no difference in expression between the compatible and incompatible interactions, indicating that other factors were necessary to determine the outcome of the interaction. However, their significantly higher expression at 11 dpi in the compatible interaction confirmed that they contributed to the necrotrophic phase of the fungus. A notable exception wasLysMgenes whose high expression was singularly observed on the susceptible host at 7 dpi. In the case of TFs, their higher expression at 7 and 11 dpi on susceptible Topas support an important role in regulating the genes involved in the different pathogenic phases ofL. maculans. In conclusion, comparison of the transcriptome ofL. maculansduring compatible and incompatible interactions has led to the identification of key pathogenicity genes that regulate not only the fate of the interaction but also lifestyle transitions of the fungus.

26114292	20150627	Structure-Function Analysis of PPP1R3D, a Protein Phosphatase 1 Targeting Subunit, Reveals a Binding Motif for 14-3-3 Proteins which Regulates its Glycogenic Properties.	Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is one of the major protein phosphatases in eukaryotic cells. It plays a key role in regulating glycogen synthesis, by dephosphorylating crucial enzymes involved in glycogen homeostasis such as glycogen synthase (GS) and glycogen phosphorylase (GP). To play this role, PP1 binds to specific glycogen targeting subunits that, on one hand recognize the substrates to be dephosphorylated and on the other hand recruit PP1 to glycogen particles. In this work we have analyzed the functionality of the different protein binding domains of one of these glycogen targeting subunits, namely PPP1R3D (R6) and studied how binding properties of different domains affect its glycogenic properties. We have found that the PP1 binding domain of R6 comprises a conserved RVXF motif (R102VRF) located at the N-terminus of the protein. We have also identified a region located at the C-terminus of R6 (W267DNND) that is involved in binding to the PP1 glycogenic substrates. Our results indicate that although binding to PP1 and glycogenic substrates are independent processes, impairment of any of them results in lack of glycogenic activity of R6. In addition, we have characterized a novel site of regulation in R6 that is involved in binding to 14-3-3 proteins (RARS74LP). We present evidence indicating that when binding of R6 to 14-3-3 proteins is prevented, R6 displays hyper-glycogenic activity although is rapidly degraded by the lysosomal pathway. These results define binding to 14-3-3 proteins as an additional pathway in the control of the glycogenic properties of R6. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
17220244	20070116	Interactions of cyclosporin a with breast cancer resistance protein.	The objective of this study was to investigate whether cyclosporin A (CsA) is a modulator for breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). The interactions between CsA and BCRP were evaluated by using both membrane- and cell-based assays. CsA inhibited BCRP or BCRP R482T mutant-associated ATPase with an IC(50) of 26.1 and 7.3 microM (31,388 and 8779 ng/ml), respectively, indicating that CsA is a modulator for BCRP and its R482T mutant. The apparent permeability (P(app)) of CsA was not affected by the BCRP-specific inhibitor Ko143 in both apical-to-basolateral (A-to-B) and basolateral-to-apical (B-to-A) directions in hBCRP- or mBcrp-transfected MDCKII cells, whereas CsA at 50 microM significantly increased the A-to-B transport and decreased B-to-A transport of BCRP substrates, [(3)H]estrone-3-sulfate ([(3)H]E3S) and [(3)H]methotrexate ([(3)H]MTX), in hBCRP- and mBcrp1-trasfected MDCKII cells. Similar to cellular transport studies, CsA did not exhibit ATP-dependent uptake in BCRP-expressed membrane vesicles but inhibited the ATP-mediated E3S and MTX uptake in the same vesicles. The inhibitory constant (K(i)) of CsA toward BCRP was 6.7 microM (8507 ng/ml) and 7.8 microM (9380 ng/ml) when using E3S or MTX, respectively, as a BCRP substrate. The inhibitory potency of CsA on BCRP wild type or its R482T mutant was lower than that on P-glycoprotein. The present studies demonstrate that CsA is an inhibitor but not a substrate for BCRP, and has low potential to cause drug-drug interactions with BCRP substrate drugs due to its weak inhibitory effect on BCRP and BCRP R482T mutant at its normal therapeutic blood concentrations (200-400 ng/ml) (Blood 91:362-363, 1998).

19074151	20081217	Human prion protein (PrP) 219K is converted to PrPSc but shows heterozygous inhibition in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease infection.	Prion protein gene (PRNP) E219K is a human polymorphism commonly occurring in Asian populations but is rarely found in patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Thus the polymorphism E219K has been considered protective against sporadic CJD. The corresponding mouse prion protein (PrP) polymorphism variant (mouse PrP 218K) is not converted to the abnormal isoform (PrP(Sc)) and shows a dominant negative effect on wild-type PrP conversion. To define the conversion activity of this human molecule, we herein established knock-in mice with human PrP 219K and performed a series of transmission experiments with human prions. Surprisingly, the human PrP 219K molecule was converted to PrP(Sc) in variant CJD infection, and the conversion occurred more efficiently than PrP 219E molecule. Notably the knock-in mice with PRNP codon 219E/K showed the least efficient conversion compared with their hemizygotes with PRNP codon 219E/0 or codon 219K/0, or homozygotes with PRNP codon 219E/E or codon 219K/K. This phenomenon indicated heterozygous inhibition. This heterozygous inhibition was observed also in knock-in mice with PRNP codon 129M/V genotype. In addition to variant CJD infection, the human PrP 219K molecule is conversion-competent in transmission experiments with sporadic CJD prions. Therefore, the protective effect of PRNP E219K against sporadic CJD might be due to heterozygous inhibition. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
8760087	19960701	Expression of AT1A and AT1B angiotensin II receptor messenger RNA in forebrain of 2-wk-old rats.	The gene expression of angiotensin II receptor subtypes AT1A and AT1B was localized in the forebrain of 2-wk-old rats by in situ hybridization histochemistry and compared with [125I]Sar1-angiotensin II binding patterns. AT1A receptor mRNA was expressed in circumventricular organs, in hypothalamic nuclei like the paraventricular nucleus, in the lateral olfactory tract, in the basolateral amygdaloid and anterior olfactory nuclei, and in the piriform cortex. No AT1B receptor mRNA was detected in these areas. AT1A and AT1B receptor mRNA was detected in the hippocampus, cingulate cortex, and choroid plexus. No forebrain area studied expressed AT1B receptor mRNA exclusively. Most often, a good match for receptor mRNA and binding was found. In some areas, apparent mismatches suggested receptor formation elsewhere (median eminence) or receptor presence in local neuronal circuits (hippocampus, cingulate, and piriform cortex). Our results support the hypothesis that AT1A receptors are involved in the classical central functions of angiotensin II. Both AT1A and AT1B receptors may play roles in cortical and limbic system function, particularly early in development. 	Am._J._Physiol.	D016428
18348860	20080320	High-throughput microtiter well-based bioluminometric genotyping of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the toll-like receptor-4 gene.	Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a fundamental role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity. Genetic variations in TLR have been associated with reduced host immune response to TLR ligands. We developed a rapid, simple and cost-effective method for identification of two common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within TLR4 gene in a high-throughput format. The method consists of a single polymerase chain reaction of the region spanning the A896G and C1196T polymorphic sites, followed by two primer extension reactions at each site using primers that carry a (dA)(24) segment at the 5' end. A biotinylated nucleotide is incorporated in the extended primer. The products are captured in microtiter wells coated with streptavidin and detected using a (dT)(30)-conjugated photoprotein aequorin. A total of 209 individuals were genotyped for each SNP. The A896G and C1196T polymorphisms were found to be in linkage disequilibrium; 186 individuals (89%) were wild-type homozygous (A/A or C/C), 22 (10.5%) were heterozygotes (A/G or C/T), and 1 (0.5%) was homozygous for the mutation (G/G or T/T). The accuracy of this method was confirmed by sequencing. The newly developed method may be useful for association studies of these two SNPs with several diseases. 	Anal._Biochem.	D016428
22938506	20120904	Targeted massive parallel sequencing: the effective detection of novel causative mutations associated with hearing loss in small families.	Hereditary hearing loss is one of the most common heterogeneous disorders, and genetic variants that can cause hearing loss have been identified in over sixty genes. Most of these hearing loss genes have been detected using classical genetic methods, typically starting with linkage analysis in large families with hereditary hearing loss. However, these classical strategies are not well suited for mutation analysis in smaller families who have insufficient genetic information. Eighty known hearing loss genes were selected and simultaneously sequenced by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 8 Korean families with autosomal dominant non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. Five mutations in known hearing loss genes, including 1 nonsense and 4 missense mutations, were identified in 5 different genes (ACTG1, MYO1F, DIAPH1, POU4F3 and EYA4), and the genotypes for these mutations were consistent with the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of hearing loss in each family. No mutational hot-spots were revealed in these Korean families. Targeted NGS allowed for the detection of pathogenic mutations in affected individuals who were not candidates for classical genetic studies. This report is the first documenting the effective use of an NGS technique to detect pathogenic mutations that underlie hearing loss in an East Asian population. Using this NGS technique to establish a database of common mutations in Korean patients with hearing loss and further data accumulation will contribute to the early diagnosis and fundamental therapies for hereditary hearing loss.

26228487	20150801	The effect of long-term ruxolitinib treatment on JAK2p.V617F allele burden in patients with myelofibrosis.	The JAK2 c.1849G&gt;T (p.V617F) mutation leads to constitutive activation of Janus kinase (JAK)2 and contributes to dysregulated JAK signaling in myelofibrosis (MF), polycythemia vera (PV), and essential thrombocythemia (ET). In the phase 3 Controlled Myelofibrosis Study with Oral JAK Inhibitor Treatment-I trial, patients with MF, post-PV MF, or post-ET MF achieved significant reductions in splenomegaly and improvements in symptoms with ruxolitinib vs placebo at week 24. This long-term follow-up analysis was performed to determine whether ruxolitinib therapy altered the JAK2p.V617F allele burden in JAK2p.V617F-positive patients. Assessments at baseline and weeks 24, 48, 120, 144, 168, and 216 demonstrated reductions in allele burden from baseline with ruxolitinib treatment that correlated with spleen volume reductions. Of 236 JAK2p.V617F-positive patients analyzed, 20 achieved partial and 6 achieved complete molecular responses, with median times to response of 22.2 and 27.5 months, respectively. Allele burden reductions were greater in patients with shorter disease duration, which suggests a potential benefit of earlier treatment. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00952289. 	Blood	D016430 D016428 D016449 D052061
20959479	20101021	Identification of susceptibility loci in a mouse model of KRASG12D-driven pancreatic cancer.	Genetic background affects susceptibility to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in the Ela-KRAS(G12D) mouse model. In this model, KRAS oncogene expression is driven by an elastase promoter in acinar cells of the pancreas on an FVB/NTac (FVB) background [FVB-Tg(Ela-KRAS(G12D))] with the transgene carried on the Y chromosome. Through linkage analysis of crosses between the C57BL/6J (B6), BALB/cJ (BALB), and DBA/2J (D2) inbred strains of mice and resistant FVB-Tg(Ela-KRAS(G12D)), we have identified six susceptibility loci that affect mean preinvasive lesion multiplicity. Markers on chromosome 2 segregated with high tumor multiplicity in all three strains; these loci were designated Prsq1-3 (pancreatic ras susceptibility quantitative trait loci 1-3; combined F2 and N2 LOD(W), 6.0, 4.1, and 2.7, respectively). Susceptibility loci on chromosome 4, designated Prsq4 and Prsq5, were identified in crosses between FVB transgenic mice and B6 or BALB mice (combined F2 and N2 LOD(W), 3.6 and 2.9, respectively). A marker on chromosome 12 segregated with tumor multiplicity in a BALB ? FVB-Tg(Ela-KRAS(G12D)) cross and was designated Prsq6 (LOD(W), ?2.5). B6-Chr Y(FVB-Tg(Ela-KRASG12D)) and BALB-Chr Y(FVB-Tg(Ela-KRASG12D)) consomics, which carry the KRAS transgene on the FVB Y chromosome on an otherwise inbred B6 or BALB background, developed ?4-fold (B6) and ?10-fold (BALB) more lesions than FVB-Tg(Ela-KRAS(G12D)) mice. By 12 months of age, 10% of BALB-Chr Y(FVB-Tg(Ela-KRASG12D)) mice developed invasive carcinomas. Our findings provide evidence that regions of chromosomes 2, 4, and 12 influence the development and progression of pancreatic neoplasms initiated by an oncogenic allele of KRAS in mice. 	Cancer_Res.

26347788	20150909	Is Huachansu Beneficial in Treating Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer? Evidence from a Meta-Analysis of Its Efficacy Combined with Chemotherapy.	Background. Huachansu, the sterilized water extract of Bufo bufo gargarizans toad skin, is used in China to alleviate the side-effects and enhance the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We conducted a meta-analysis to assess Huachansu's efficacy. Methods. We extensively searched electronic databases (CENTRAL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, CBM, Cochrane Library, CNKI, CEBM, WFDP, CSCD, CSTD, and IPA) for randomized controlled trials containing Huachansu plus chemotherapy as the test group and chemotherapy as the control group. Seventeen trials were selected based on the selection criteria. The pooled relative ratio (RR) of indicators with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated for efficacy evaluation. Results. The meta-analysis demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in objective tumor response, one-year survival, Karnofsky performance status, pain relief, and alleviation of severe side-effects (nausea and vomiting, leukocytopenia) in the test group as compared to the control group, but no significant difference in thrombocytopenia. Conclusions. This study demonstrated the efficacy of Huachansu combined with chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. However, limitations exist and high-quality trials are needed for further verification. 	Evid_Based_Complement_Alternat_Med	D016428 D016454
8617783	19960301	Histidine patch thioredoxins. Mutant forms of thioredoxin with metal chelating affinity that provide for convenient purifications of thioredoxin fusion proteins.	A cluster of surface amino acid residues on Escherichia coli thioredoxin were systematically mutated in order to provide the molecule with an ability to chelate metal ions. The combined effect of two histidine mutants, E30H and Q62H, gave thioredoxin the capacity to bind to nickel ions immobilized on iminodiacetic acid- and nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose resins. Even though these two histidines were more than 30 residues apart in thioredoxin's primary sequence, they were found to satisfy the geometric constraints for metal ion coordination as a result of the thioredoxin tertiary fold. A third histidine mutation, S1H, provided additional metal ion chelation affinity, but the native histidine at position 6 of thioredoxin was found not to participate in binding. All of the histidine mutants exhibited decreased thermal stability as compared with wild-type thioredoxin; however, the introduction of an additional mutation, D26A, increased their melting temperatures beyond that of wild-type thioredoxin. The metal chelating abilities of these histidine mutants of thioredoxin were successfully utilized for convenient purifications of human interleukin-8 and -11 expressed in E. coli as soluble thioredoxin fusion proteins.

8798613	19960927	Structural and functional aspects of chloride binding to Alteromonas haloplanctis alpha-amylase.	Chloride is the allosteric effector of vertebrate pancreatic and salivary alpha-amylases and of the bacterial alpha-amylase from Alteromonas haloplanctis. Activation experiments of A. haloplanctis alpha-amylase by several monovalent anions show that a negative charge, not restricted to that of Cl-, is essential for the amylolytic reaction. Engineering of the chloride binding site reveals that a basic residue is an essential component of the site. The mutation K337R alters the Cl--binding properties, whereas the mutation K337Q produces an active, chloride-independent enzyme. Comparison of the Kd values for Cl- in three homologous alpha-amylases also indicates that the binding affinity is dependent on the chloride coordination mode by this basic residue. Analysis of substrate and chloride binding according to the allosteric kinetic model shows that the chloride effector is not involved in substrate binding. By contrast, the pH dependence of activity and experiments of chemical modifications and Ca2+ inhibition show that the chloride ion is responsible for the pKa shift of catalytic groups and interacts with active site carboxyl groups.

18682852	20080807	Effector genomics accelerates discovery and functional profiling of potato disease resistance and phytophthora infestans avirulence genes.	Potato is the world's fourth largest food crop yet it continues to endure late blight, a devastating disease caused by the Irish famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans. Breeding broad-spectrum disease resistance (R) genes into potato (Solanum tuberosum) is the best strategy for genetically managing late blight but current approaches are slow and inefficient. We used a repertoire of effector genes predicted computationally from the P. infestans genome to accelerate the identification, functional characterization, and cloning of potentially broad-spectrum R genes. An initial set of 54 effectors containing a signal peptide and a RXLR motif was profiled for activation of innate immunity (avirulence or Avr activity) on wild Solanum species and tentative Avr candidates were identified. The RXLR effector family IpiO induced hypersensitive responses (HR) in S. stoloniferum, S. papita and the more distantly related S. bulbocastanum, the source of the R gene Rpi-blb1. Genetic studies with S. stoloniferum showed cosegregation of resistance to P. infestans and response to IpiO. Transient co-expression of IpiO with Rpi-blb1 in a heterologous Nicotiana benthamiana system identified IpiO as Avr-blb1. A candidate gene approach led to the rapid cloning of S. stoloniferum Rpi-sto1 and S. papita Rpi-pta1, which are functionally equivalent to Rpi-blb1. Our findings indicate that effector genomics enables discovery and functional profiling of late blight R genes and Avr genes at an unprecedented rate and promises to accelerate the engineering of late blight resistant potato varieties.

22081160	20111115	Inactivity-induced increase in nAChRs upregulates Shal K(+) channels to stabilize synaptic potentials.	Long-term synaptic changes, which are essential for learning and memory, are dependent on homeostatic mechanisms that stabilize neural activity. Homeostatic responses have also been implicated in pathological conditions, including nicotine addiction. Although multiple homeostatic pathways have been described, little is known about how compensatory responses are tuned to prevent them from overshooting their optimal range of activity. We found that prolonged inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), the major excitatory receptors in the Drosophila CNS, resulted in a homeostatic increase in the Drosophila ?7 (D?7)-nAChR. This response then induced an increase in the transient A-type K(+) current carried by Shaker cognate L (Shal; also known as voltage-gated K(+) channel 4, Kv4) channels. Although increasing D?7-nAChRs boosted miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents, the ensuing increase in Shal channels served to stabilize postsynaptic potentials. These data identify a previously unknown mechanism for fine tuning the homeostatic response. 	Nat._Neurosci.	D016428 D052061
18305031	20080229	Mechanism for controlling the dimer-monomer switch and coupling dimerization to catalysis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3C-like protease.	Unlike 3C protease, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is only enzymatically active as a homodimer and its catalysis is under extensive regulation by the unique extra domain. Despite intense studies, two puzzles still remain: (i) how the dimer-monomer switch is controlled and (ii) why dimerization is absolutely required for catalysis. Here we report the monomeric crystal structure of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro mutant R298A at a resolution of 1.75 A. Detailed analysis reveals that Arg298 serves as a key component for maintaining dimerization, and consequently, its mutation will trigger a cooperative switch from a dimer to a monomer. The monomeric enzyme is irreversibly inactivated because its catalytic machinery is frozen in the collapsed state, characteristic of the formation of a short 3(10)-helix from an active-site loop. Remarkably, dimerization appears to be coupled to catalysis in 3CLpro through the use of overlapped residues for two networks, one for dimerization and another for the catalysis. 	J._Virol.

25022982	20140716	Cholera outbreaks (2012) in three districts of Nepal reveal clonal transmission of multi-drug resistant Vibrio cholerae O1.	Although endemic cholera causes significant morbidity and mortality each year in Nepal, lack of information about the causal bacterium often hinders cholera intervention and prevention. In 2012, diarrheal outbreaks affected three districts of Nepal with confirmed cases of mortality. This study was designed to understand the drug response patterns, source, and transmission of Vibrio cholerae associated with 2012 cholera outbreaks in Nepal. V. cholerae (n = 28) isolated from 2012 diarrhea outbreaks {n = 22; Kathmandu (n = 12), Doti (n = 9), Bajhang (n = 1)}, and surface water (n = 6; Kathmandu) were tested for antimicrobial response. Virulence properties and DNA fingerprinting of the strains were determined by multi-locus genetic screening employing polymerase chain reaction, DNA sequencing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). All V. cholerae strains isolated from patients and surface water were confirmed to be toxigenic, belonging to serogroup O1, Ogawa serotype, biotype El Tor, and possessed classical biotype cholera toxin (CTX). Double-mismatch amplification mutation assay (DMAMA)-PCR revealed the V. cholerae strains to possess the B-7 allele of ctx subunit B. DNA sequencing of tcpA revealed a point mutation at amino acid position 64 (N ? S) while the ctxAB promoter revealed four copies of the tandem heptamer repeat sequence 5'-TTTTGAT-3'. V. cholerae possessed all the ORFs of the Vibrio seventh pandemic island (VSP)-I but lacked the ORFs 498-511 of VSP-II. All strains were multidrug resistant with resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), nalidixic acid (NA), and streptomycin (S); all carried the SXT genetic element. DNA sequencing and deduced amino acid sequence of gyrA and parC of the NAR strains (n = 4) revealed point mutations at amino acid positions 83 (S ? I), and 85 (S ? L), respectively. Similar PFGE (NotI) pattern revealed the Nepalese V. cholerae to be clonal, and related closely with V. cholerae associated with cholera in Bangladesh and Haiti. In 2012, diarrhea outbreaks in three districts of Nepal were due to transmission of multidrug resistant V. cholerae El Tor possessing cholera toxin (ctx) B-7 allele, which is clonal and related closely with V. cholerae associated with cholera in Bangladesh and Haiti.

10710236	20000310	Detection of a common mutation in the RSH or Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome by a PCR-RFLP assay: IVS8-G--&gt;C is found in over sixty percent of US propositi.	The RSH or Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a relatively common autosomal recessive disorder of cholesterol biosynthesis resulting from a deficiency of the enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol delta7-reductase (7-DHCR). Mutations in 7-DHCR gene cause SLOS. Among these, a G--&gt;C transversion in the splice acceptor site of exon 9 (IVS8-1G--&gt;C) was suspected to be a frequent mutation, having been detected in about 18% of SLOS patients so far. This mutation results in the elimination of a AlwN1 restriction endonuclease site. We report a simple PCR-RFLP assay to detect the IVS8-1G--&gt;C mutation. Using this method, we identified the IVS8-1G--&gt;C mutation in 21 of 33 SLOS propositi. This mutation was detected in one of 90 normal adult Caucasian Americans; but not among 121 Africans from Sierra Leone, 120 Caucasians from Finland, 95 Chinese or 103 Japanese adults. The results of this study provide further evidence that IVS8-1G--&gt;C transversion is a very common mutation in SLOS patients from the US and that the carrier rate in US caucasians may be high. The simple PCR-RFLP assay developed makes identification of this mutation convenient for diagnosis and for carrier detection. 	Am._J._Med._Genet.	D016428 D013485 D013486
23580248	20130413	Prion protein gene variability in Spanish goats. Inference through susceptibility to classical scrapie strains and pathogenic distribution of peripheral PrP(sc.).	Classical scrapie is a neurological disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by the accumulation of an abnormal, partially protease resistant prion protein (PrP(sc)) in the CNS and in some peripheral tissues in domestic small ruminants. Whereas the pathological changes and genetic susceptibility of ovine scrapie are well known, caprine scrapie has been less well studied. We report here a pathological study of 13 scrapie-affected goats diagnosed in Spain during the last 9 years. We used immunohistochemical and biochemical techniques to discriminate between classical and atypical scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). All the animals displayed PrP(sc) distribution patterns and western blot characteristics compatible with classical scrapie. In addition, we determined the complete open reading frame sequence of the PRNP in these scrapie-affected animals. The polymorphisms observed were compared with those of the herd mates (n?=?665) and with the frequencies of healthy herds (n?=?581) of native Spanish goats (Retinta, Pirenaica and Moncaina) and other worldwide breeds reared in Spain (Saanen, Alpine and crossbreed). In total, sixteen polymorphic sites were identified, including the known amino acid substitutions at codons G37V, G127S, M137I, I142M, H143R, R151H, R154H, R211Q, Q222K, G232W, and P240S, and new polymorphisms at codons G74D, M112T, R139S, L141F and Q215R. In addition, the known 42, 138 and 179 silent mutations were detected, and one new one is reported at codon 122. The genetic differences observed in the population studied have been attributed to breed and most of the novel polymorphic codons show frequencies lower than 5%. This work provides the first basis of polymorphic distribution of PRNP in native and worldwide goat breeds reared in Spain. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485

25784931	20150319	From molecular classification to targeted therapeutics: the changing face of systemic therapy in metastatic gastroesophageal cancer.	Histological classification of adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma for esophageal cancer or using the Lauren classification for intestinal and diffuse type gastric cancer has limited clinical utility in the management of advanced disease. Germline mutations in E-cadherin (CDH1) or mismatch repair genes (Lynch syndrome) were identified many years ago but given their rarity, the identification of these molecular alterations does not substantially impact treatment in the advanced setting. Recent molecular profiling studies of upper GI tumors have added to our knowledge of the underlying biology but have not led to an alternative classification system which can guide clinician's therapeutic decisions. Recently the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network has proposed four subtypes of gastric cancer dividing tumors into those positive for Epstein-Barr virus, microsatellite unstable tumors, genomically stable tumors, and tumors with chromosomal instability. Unfortunately to date, many phase III clinical trials involving molecularly targeted agents have failed to meet their survival endpoints due to their use in unselected populations. Future clinical trials should utilize molecular profiling of individual tumors in order to determine the optimal use of targeted therapies in preselected patients.

26862836	20160211	Unraveling Entropic Rate Acceleration Induced by Solvent Dynamics in Membrane Enzymes.	Enzyme catalysis evolved in an aqueous environment. The influence of solvent dynamics on catalysis is, however, currently poorly understood and usually neglected. The study of water dynamics in enzymes and the associated thermodynamical consequences is highly complex and has involved computer simulations, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments, and calorimetry. Water tunnels that connect the active site with the surrounding solvent are key to solvent displacement and dynamics. The protocol herein allows for the engineering of these motifs for water transport, which affects specificity, activity and thermodynamics. By providing a biophysical framework founded on theory and experiments, the method presented herein can be used by researchers without previous expertise in computer modeling or biophysical chemistry. The method will advance our understanding of enzyme catalysis on the molecular level by measuring the enthalpic and entropic changes associated with catalysis by enzyme variants with obstructed water tunnels. The protocol can be used for the study of membrane-bound enzymes and other complex systems. This will enhance our understanding of the importance of solvent reorganization in catalysis as well as provide new catalytic strategies in protein design and engineering.

21755035	20110715	Resistant hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea in the primary-care setting.	We ascertained the prevalence of resistant hypertension (RH) among blacks and determined whether RH patients are at greater risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) than hypertensives. Method. Data emanated from Metabolic Syndrome Outcome Study (MetSO), a study investigating metabolic syndrome among blacks in the primary-care setting. Sample of 200 patients (mean age = 63 ? 13 years; female = 61%) with a diagnosis of hypertension provided subjective and clinical data. RH was defined using the JNC 7and European Society guidelines. We assessed OSA risk using the Apnea Risk Evaluation System ARES), defining high risk as a total ARES score ?6. Results. Overall, 26% met criteria for RH and 40% were at high OSA risk. Logistic regression analysis, adjusting for effects of age, gender, and medical co morbidities, showed that patients with RH were nearly 2.5 times more likely to be at high OSA risk, relative to those with hypertension (OR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.03-5.88, P &lt; .05). Conclusion. Our findings show that the prevalence of RH among blacks fell within the range of RH for the general hypertensive population (3-29%). However, patients with RH were at significantly greater risk of OSA compared to patients with hypertension. 	Int_J_Hypertens	D016428
11329253	20010501	Structure of the metal-water complex in Ras x GDP studied by high-field EPR spectroscopy and 31P NMR spectroscopy.	The small GTPase Ras plays a key role as a molecular switch in the intercellular signal transduction. On Mg(2+) --&gt; Mn(2+) substituted samples, the first ligand sphere of the metal ion in the inactive, GDP-bound Ras has been studied by continuous wave EPR at 94 GHz (W-band). Via replacement of normal water with (17)O-enriched water, the (17)O--(55)Mn superhyperfine coupling was used to determine the number of water ligands bound to the metal ion. In contrast to EPR data on frozen solutions and X-ray data from single crystals where four direct ligands to the metal ion are found, the wild-type protein has only three water ligands bound in solution at room temperature. The same number of water ligands is found for the mutant Ras(T35S). However, for the alanine mutant in position 35 Ras(T35A) as well as for the oncogenic mutant Ras(G12V), four water ligands can be observed in liquid solution. The EPR studies were supplemented by (31)P NMR studies on the Mg(2+) x GDP complexes of the wild-type protein and the three mutants. Ras(T35A) exists in two conformational states (1 and 2) with an equilibrium constant K(1)(1,2) of approximately 0.49 and rate constants k(1--1) which are much smaller than 40 s(-1) at 298 K. For wild-type Ras and Ras(T35S), the two states can also be observed with equilibrium constants K(1)(1,2) of approximately 0.31 and 0.21, respectively. In Ras(G12V), only one conformational state could be detected. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485
19487424	20090603	Genetic identity, biological phenotype, and evolutionary pathways of transmitted/founder viruses in acute and early HIV-1 infection.	Identification of full-length transmitted HIV-1 genomes could be instrumental in HIV-1 pathogenesis, microbicide, and vaccine research by enabling the direct analysis of those viruses actually responsible for productive clinical infection. We show in 12 acutely infected subjects (9 clade B and 3 clade C) that complete HIV-1 genomes of transmitted/founder viruses can be inferred by single genome amplification and sequencing of plasma virion RNA. This allowed for the molecular cloning and biological analysis of transmitted/founder viruses and a comprehensive genome-wide assessment of the genetic imprint left on the evolving virus quasispecies by a composite of host selection pressures. Transmitted viruses encoded intact canonical genes (gag-pol-vif-vpr-tat-rev-vpu-env-nef) and replicated efficiently in primary human CD4(+) T lymphocytes but much less so in monocyte-derived macrophages. Transmitted viruses were CD4 and CCR5 tropic and demonstrated concealment of coreceptor binding surfaces of the envelope bridging sheet and variable loop 3. 2 mo after infection, transmitted/founder viruses in three subjects were nearly completely replaced by viruses differing at two to five highly selected genomic loci; by 12-20 mo, viruses exhibited concentrated mutations at 17-34 discrete locations. These findings reveal viral properties associated with mucosal HIV-1 transmission and a limited set of rapidly evolving adaptive mutations driven primarily, but not exclusively, by early cytotoxic T cell responses.

11018587	20001006	Oxidative DNA base damage induced by singlet oxygen and photosensitization: recognition by repair endonucleases and mutagenicity.	We have analyzed the recognition by various repair endonucleases of DNA base modifications induced by three oxidants, viz. [4-(tert-butyldioxycarbonyl)benzyl]triethylammonium chloride (BCBT), a photochemical source of tert-butoxyl radicals, disodium salt of 1,4-etheno-2,3-benzodioxin-1,4-dipropanoic acid (NDPO(2)), a chemical source of singlet oxygen, and riboflavin, a type-I photosensitizer. The base modifications induced by BCBT, which were previously shown to be mostly 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoGua) residues, were recognized by Fpg and Ogg1 proteins, but not by endonuclease IIII, Ntg1 and Ntg2 proteins. In the case of singlet oxygen induced damage, 8-oxoGua accounted for only 35% of the base modifications recognized by Fpg protein. The remaining Fpg-sensitive modifications were not recognized by Ogg1 protein and relatively poor by endonuclease III, but they were relatively good substrates of Ntg1 and Ntg2. In the case of the damage induced by photoexcited riboflavin, the fraction of Fpg-sensitive base modifications identified as 8-oxoGua was only 23%. In contrast to the damage induced by singlet oxygen, the remaining lesions were not only recognized by Ntg1 and Ntg2 proteins and (relatively poor) by endonuclease III, but also by Ogg1 protein. The analysis of the mutations observed after transfection of modified plasmid pSV2gpt into Escherichia coli revealed that all agents induced near exclusively GC--&gt;TA and GC--&gt;CG transversions, the numbers of which were correlated with the numbers of 8-oxoGua residues and Ntg-sensitive modifications, respectively. In conclusion, both singlet oxygen and the type-I photosensitizer riboflavin induce predominantly oxidative guanine modifications other than 8-oxoGua, which most probably give rise to GC--&gt;CG transversions and in which eukaryotic cells are substrates of Ntg1 and Ntg2 proteins.

20511677	20100601	No association between alleles of the bradykinin receptor-B2 gene and acute mountain sickness.	The pathophysiological mechanism(s) of the development of acute mountain sickness (AMS) is still unclear. Although the chance of developing AMS and the severity of the condition are influenced by ascent rate and altitude attained, previous history is a reliable predictor of subsequent affliction, and some individuals and families are clearly predisposed, suggesting a genetic component to susceptibility. As the vasodilator bradykinin may be involved in acclimatization to altitude, we hypothesized that variants in genes encoding components of this pathway might play a role in AMS susceptibility. We tested this by looking for associations between two functional polymorphisms (the in/del polymorphism +9/-9 [rs5810761] and the single-nucleotide polymorphism C--58T [rs1799722]) of BDKRB2 (the gene encoding the bradykinin receptor B2) and susceptibility to AMS in an altitude-exposed Nepalese population. Lowland attendees (n = 233) at a religious festival at 4380 m in the Nepalese Himalaya were recruited and assessed for AMS by clinical evaluation and Lake Louise score (LLS). Those with a clinical diagnosis of AMS and an LLS &gt;or=3 were designated AMS+ (n = 100) and those without a diagnosis of AMS and with an LLS &lt;3 were categorized as AMS- (n = 117). DNA was prepared from buccal cells, genotyped for the two polymorphisms and allele frequencies compared between the two cohorts. No association was found between alleles at either polymorphism and susceptibility to AMS (P &gt; 0.50), although C - 58T heterozygotes were significantly more common (P &lt; 0.001, chi(2) = 49.6) in the subjects than would be predicted if the population was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The results of our association study do not support the hypothesis that variants in BDKRB2 influence altitude tolerance in a lowland Nepalese population; however, the deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium observed for the C - 58T polymorphism could be explained by self-selection for altitude tolerance in the festival attendees.

24582548	20140304	Dual-source parallel radiofrequency transmission for magnetic resonance breast imaging at 3T: any added clinical value?	To investigate the influence of dual-source parallel radiofrequency (RF) excitation on clinical breast MR images. A 3T MR system with both dual-source and conventional single-source RF excitations was used to examine 22 patients. Axial TSE-T2WI with fat suppression, TSE-T1WI without fat suppression, THRIVE (3D field echo) and DWI (SE-EPI) were obtained by using both excitation techniques. Image homogeneity, image contrast and lesion conspicuity were measured or independently scored by two radiologists and were compared by paired-sample t test or Wilcoxon test. Both excitations revealed 24 lesions. For SE sequences using dual-source mode, image homogeneity was improved (P=0.00), scan time was reduced, and ghost artifacts on DWI were significantly reduced (P=0.00). However, image contrast was not increased and lesion conspicuity had no significant difference between two modes, except DWI on which lesion conspicuity was significantly improved (P=0.00), due to less ghost artifacts. For field-echo sequence, image homogeneity, acquisition time, image contrast and lesion conspicuity had no significant difference between the two modes. Dual-source parallel RF transmission has some added value for improving breast image quality. However, its value is limited in terms of improving lesion detection and characterization.

26817942	20160129	Apolipoprotein E epsilon 2 allele and low serum cholesterol as risk factors for gastric cancer in a Chinese Han population.	Apolipoprotein E (apoE) mediates lipid metabolism both in peripheral and in the brain. The human APOE gene has three polymorphic alleles that influence the risk for various types of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. A potential association between APOE allele and the risk for gastric cancer has been implicated, but the specific allele involved and potential associations with the subtype and the grade of cancer malignancy need further clarification. We screened the APOE genotype in 550 gastric cancer patients and 550 non-cancer control individuals and found that the presence of the APOE ?2 and lower serum total cholesterol are associated with an increased risk for gastric cancer (all P???0.0005). Interestingly, APOE ?2 is also correlated with increased risk for both intestinal and diffuse histotypes but not with TN classification or stage in gastric cancer patients, suggesting that APOE polymorphic alleles are associated with the risk of development but unlikely the progression of gastric cancer. Since ?2 carriers have lower levels of serum total cholesterol than non-?2 carriers, our findings suggest that the increased risk for gastric cancer by APOE ?2 allele might be mediated through lowered serum total cholesterol levels.

17465020	20070428	Functional characterization of missense variants in the creatine transporter gene (SLC6A8): improved diagnostic application.	Creatine transporter deficiency is an X-linked mental retardation disorder caused by mutations in the creatine transporter gene (SLC6A8). So far, 20 mutations in the SLC6A8 gene have been described. We have developed a diagnostic assay to test creatine uptake in fibroblasts. Additionally, we expanded the assay to characterize novel SLC6A8 missense variants. A total of 13 variants were introduced in the SLC6A8 cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis. All variants were transiently transfected in SLC6A8-deficient fibroblasts and tested for restoration of creatine uptake in deficient primary fibroblasts. Thus, we proved that nine variants (p.Gly87Arg, p.Phe107del, p.Tyr317X, p.Asn336del, p.Cys337Trp, p.Ile347del, p.Pro390Leu, p.Arg391Trp, and p.Pro554Leu) are pathogenic mutations and four variants (p.Lys4Arg, p.Gly26Arg, p.Met560Val, and p.Val629Ile) are nonpathogenic. The present study provides an improved diagnostic tool to classify sequence variants of unknown significance. 	Hum._Mutat.	D023362 D016428 D013485
16651379	20060503	A functional network involved in the recycling of nucleocytoplasmic pre-60S factors.	Eukaryotic pre-ribosomes go through cytoplasmic maturation steps before entering translation. The nucleocytoplasmic proteins participating in these late stages of maturation are reimported to the nucleus. In this study, we describe a functional network focused on Rei1/Ybr267w, a strictly cytoplasmic pre-60S factor indirectly involved in nuclear 27S pre-ribosomal RNA processing. In the absence of Rei1, the nuclear import of at least three other pre-60S factors is impaired. The accumulation in the cytoplasm of a small complex formed by the association of Arx1 with a novel factor, Alb1/Yjl122w, inhibits the release of the putative antiassociation factor Tif6 from the premature large ribosomal subunits and its recycling to the nucleus. We propose a model in which Rei1 is a key factor for the coordinated dissociation and recycling of the last pre-60S factors before newly synthesized large ribosomal subunits enter translation.

24854034	20140524	Scabies mite inactive serine proteases are potent inhibitors of the human complement lectin pathway.	Scabies is an infectious skin disease caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei and has been classified as one of the six most prevalent epidermal parasitic skin diseases infecting populations living in poverty by the World Health Organisation. The role of the complement system, a pivotal component of human innate immunity, as an important defence against invading pathogens has been well documented and many parasites have an arsenal of anti-complement defences. We previously reported on a family of scabies mite proteolytically inactive serine protease paralogues (SMIPP-Ss) thought to be implicated in host defence evasion. We have since shown that two family members, SMIPP-S D1 and I1 have the ability to bind the human complement components C1q, mannose binding lectin (MBL) and properdin and are capable of inhibiting all three human complement pathways. This investigation focused on inhibition of the lectin pathway of complement activation as it is likely to be the primary pathway affecting scabies mites. Activation of the lectin pathway relies on the activation of MBL, and as SMIPP-S D1 and I1 have previously been shown to bind MBL, the nature of this interaction was examined using binding and mutagenesis studies. SMIPP-S D1 bound MBL in complex with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) and released the MASP-2 enzyme from the complex. SMIPP-S I1 was also able to bind MBL in complex with MASPs, but MASP-1 and MASP-2 remained in the complex. Despite these differences in mechanism, both molecules inhibited activation of complement components downstream of MBL. Mutagenesis studies revealed that both SMIPP-Ss used an alternative site of the molecule from the residual active site region to inhibit the lectin pathway. We propose that SMIPP-Ss are potent lectin pathway inhibitors and that this mechanism represents an important tool in the immune evasion repertoire of the parasitic mite and a potential target for therapeutics.

18550552	20080614	Lifetime body mass index and later atherosclerosis risk in young adults: examining causal links using Mendelian randomization in the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns study.	Mendelian randomization uses genetic variants related to environmentally modifiable risk factors in an attempt to improve causal inference from observational data. We examined the effect of lifetime body mass index (BMI) on adult carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and various atherosclerotic risk factors by using both Mendelian randomization and conventional analyses. A total of 2230 individuals (1218 women), aged 3-18 at study induction, took part in clinical examinations in 1980, 1983, 1986, and, most recently, 2001 when they were aged 24-39. In these analyses we utilized the known relation between FTO polymorphism rs9939609 and BMI. The dose-response association between the number of A alleles in FTO and higher mean BMI from childhood to adulthood was confirmed, but no associations with potential confounding factors were observed. In standard regression models, lifetime BMI was associated with adult CIMT, lifetime systolic blood pressure, adult fasting glucose, and adult HOMA-index. When variation in FTO was used as an instrument for unconfounded BMI levels, similar or larger effects of lifetime BMI on all these phenotypes were found, although with wider confidence intervals. Mutually supportive results from Mendelian randomization and standard regression models strengthen the evidence of the effect of lifetime BMI on atherosclerosis risk in young adults. 	Eur._Heart_J.

9434193	19980120	RNA editing and alternative splicing generate mRNA transcript diversity from the Drosophila 4f-rnp locus.	Extensive sequencing of genomic 4f-rnp and 15 cDNA clones isolated from libraries of 0-4-h embryos, pupae, and adult heads from Drosophila melanogaster has enabled identification of factors resulting in transcript sequence diversity. The 4f-rnp gene contains eight small introns. Among non-edited cDNAs, one transcript class potentially encodes a 943-amino-acid protein, within which several motifs are predicted, including a single C-terminal RNA-binding domain. Intron 5 is retained in all cDNAs examined except for a pupal cDNA, where it is excised. This potentially introduces an in-frame stop codon and predicts a truncated protein of 639 amino acids. One adult head transcript class is edited, some 31% of As being converted to Gs exclusive of edits within introns. An edit site in intron 4 changes a canonical 3'-terminal AG to GG, which interferes with splicing and is predicted to introduce a stop codon. A potential editing substrate recognition element in 4f-rnp contains the weak consensus sequence: 5'-G-G-G-N-A-A-G-3', which may interact with double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase following pairing of 4f-rnp mRNA with an antisense transcript. It is possible that extensive editing in 4f-rnp destabilizes transcripts and thus provides a novel mechanism for post-transcriptional control of gene expression, although resolution of this point will require study of additional edited transcripts.

21596131	20110521	Identification of new G?? interaction sites in adenylyl cyclase 2.	The role of G?? in adenylyl cyclase (AC) signaling is complicated due to its role as a conditional activator (AC2, AC4 and AC7) and an inhibitor (AC1, AC3 and AC8). AC2 is stimulated by G?(s) and if G?? is present the stimulation is synergistic. The precise mechanism of this synergistic activation is still not known. In order to further elucidate the role of G?? in AC2 activation by G?(s), peptides derived from the C1 domains of AC2 were synthesized and the ability of the various peptides to regulate AC2 function was tested. Our results identify two new G??-binding sites in the AC2 C1 domain, AC2 C1a 339-360 and AC2 C1b 578-602 that are involved with stimulation of AC2 by G??. These two regions are different from the previously described QEHA motif in the C2 domain of AC2. Further, the recently discovered PFAHL motif was confirmed to bind and to be involved with stimulation of AC2 by G??. These functional studies indicate that multiple regions of AC2 are involved in the interaction with G??. 	Cell._Signal.	D016428 D052061
18647346	20080724	Crystal structures of Drosophila mutant translin and characterization of translin variants reveal the structural plasticity of translin proteins.	Translin protein is highly conserved in eukaryotes. Human translin binds both ssDNA and RNA. Its nucleic acid binding site results from a combination of basic regions in the octameric structure. We report here the first biochemical characterization of wild-type Drosophila melanogaster (drosophila) translin and a chimeric translin, and present 3.5 A resolution crystal structures of drosophila P168S mutant translin from two crystal forms. The wild-type drosophila translin most likely exists as an octamer/decamer, and binds to the ssDNA Bcl-CL1 sequence. In contrast, ssDNA binding-incompetent drosophila P168S mutant translin exists as a tetramer. The structures of the mutant translin are identical in both crystal forms, and their C-terminal residues are disordered. The chimeric protein, possessing two nucleic acid binding motifs of drosophila translin, the C-terminal residues of human translin, and serine at position 168, attains the octameric state and binds to ssDNA. The present studies suggest that the oligomeric status of translin critically influences the DNA binding properties of translin proteins. 	FEBS_J.	D016428

19740433	20090911	Therapeutic targeting of the focal adhesion complex prevents oncogenic TGF-beta signaling and metastasis.	Mammary tumorigenesis is associated with the increased expression of several proteins in the focal adhesion complex, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and various integrins. Aberrant expression of these molecules occurs concomitant with the conversion of TGF-beta function from a tumor suppressor to a tumor promoter. We previously showed that interaction between beta3 integrin and TbetaR-II facilitates TGF-beta-mediated oncogenic signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastasis. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the focal adhesion complex contributes to beta3 integrin:TbetaR-II signaling and the oncogenic conversion of TGF-beta remain poorly understood. FAK expression and activity were inhibited in normal and malignant mammary epithelial cells (MECs) either genetically by using lentiviral-mediated delivery of shRNAs against FAK, or pharmacologically through in vitro and in vivo use of the FAK inhibitors, PF-562271 and PF-573228. Altered Smad2/3 and p38 MAPK activation, migration, EMT, and invasion in response to TGF-beta1 were monitored in FAK-manipulated cells. TbetaR-II expression was increased in metastatic breast cancer cells by retroviral transduction, and the metastasis of FAK- and TbetaR-II-manipulated tumors was monitored by using bioluminescent imaging. TGF-beta stimulation of MECs stabilized and activated FAK in a beta3 integrin- and Src-dependent manner. Furthermore, by using the human MCF10A breast cancer progression model, we showed that increased FAK expression in metastatic breast cancer cells mirrored the acquisition of enhanced activation of p38 MAPK by TGF-beta. Administering FAK inhibitors or rendering metastatic breast cancer cells FAK deficient abrogated the interaction between beta3 integrin and TbetaR-II, thereby preventing TGF-beta from (a) activating p38 MAPK; (b) stimulating MEC invasion, migration, and EMT; and (c) inducing early primary tumor dissemination to the lungs. Finally, in contrast to FAK depletion, adjuvant FAK chemotherapy of mammary tumors decreased their growth in part by diminished macrophage tumor infiltration. Our studies identify an essential function for FAK in mediating the interaction between beta3 integrin and TbetaR-II, and thus in facilitating the oncogenic conversion of TGF-beta required for mammary tumor metastasis. Furthermore, this study establishes chemotherapeutic targeting of FAK as an effective, two-pronged approach in preventing tumor progression both by decreasing innate immune cell infiltration, and by inhibiting early TGF-beta-dependent metastasis.

21430024	20110325	Genetic association and gene expression analysis identify FGFR1 as a new susceptibility gene for human obesity.	Previous studies suggest a role for fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) in the regulation of energy balance. Our objective was to investigate whether FGFR1 is an obesity gene by genetic association and functional studies. The study was designed to genotype common FGFR1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in large cohorts, confirm significant results in additional cohorts, and measure FGFR1 expression in human adipose tissue and in rodent hypothalamus. General community and referral centers for specialized care was the setting for the study. We genotyped FGFR1 SNP in 2438 obese and 2115 lean adults and 985 obese and 532 population-based children. Results were confirmed in 928 obese and 2738 population-based adults and 487 obese and 441 lean children. Abdominal sc adipose tissue was investigated in 202 subjects. We also investigated diet-induced, obese fasting, and fed rats. We analyzed the association between FGFR1 SNP and obesity. In secondary analyses, we related adipose FGFR1 expression to genotype, obesity, and degree of fat cell differentiation and related hypothalamic FGFR1 to energy balance. FGFR1 rs7012413*T was nominally associated with obesity in all four cohorts; metaanalysis odds ratio = 1.17 (95% confidence interval = 1.10-1.25), and P = 1.8 ? 10(-6), which was P = 7.0 ? 10(-8) in the recessive model. rs7012413*T was associated with FGFR1 expression in adipose tissue (P &lt; 0.0001). In this organ, but not in skeletal muscle, FGFR1 mRNA (P &lt; 0.0001) and protein (P &lt; 0.05) were increased in obesity. In rats, hypothalamic expression of FGFR1 declined after fasting (P &lt; ]0.001) and increased after diet-induced obesity (P &lt; 0.05). FGFR1 is a novel obesity gene that may promote obesity by influencing adipose tissue and the hypothalamic control of appetite. 	J._Clin._Endocrinol._Metab.	D016428 D013485
21864556	20110826	Polymorphic trial in oxidative damage of arsenic exposed Vietnamese.	Arsenic causes DNA damage and changes the cellular capacity for DNA repair. Genes in the base excision repair (BER) pathway influence the generation and repair of oxidative lesions. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (hOGG1) Ser326Cys; apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1) Asp148Glu; X-ray and repair and cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) Arg280His and Arg399Gln in the BER genes were analyzed, and the relationship between these 4 SNPs and the urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) concentrations of 100 Vietnamese population exposed to arsenic was investigated. Individuals with hOGG1 326Cys/Cys showed significantly higher urinary 8-OHdG concentrations than did those with 326 Ser/Cys and Ser/Ser. As for APE1 Asp148Glu, heterozygous subjects showed significantly higher urinary 8-OHdG concentrations than did those homozygous for Asp/Asp. Moreover, global ethnic comparison of the allelic frequencies of the 4SNPs was performed in 10 population and previous reported data. The mutant allele frequencies of hOGG1 Ser326Cys in the Asian populations were higher than those in the African and Caucasian populations. As for APE1 Asp148Glu, Caucasians showed higher mutant frequencies than those shown by African and Asian populations. Among Asian populations, the Bangladeshi population showed relatively higher mutant allele frequencies of the APE1 Asp148Glu polymorphism. This study is the first to demonstrate the existence of genetic heterogeneity in a worldwide distribution of SNPs (hOGG1 Ser326Cys, APE1 Asp148Glu, XRCC1 Arg280His, and XRCC1 Arg399Gln) in the BER genes.

17396163	20070331	Mechanisms of copper ion mediated Huntington's disease progression.	Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a dominant polyglutamine expansion within the N-terminus of huntingtin protein and results in oxidative stress, energetic insufficiency and striatal degeneration. Copper and iron are increased in the striata of HD patients, but the role of these metals in HD pathogenesis is unknown. We found, using inductively-coupled-plasma mass spectroscopy, that elevations of copper and iron found in human HD brain are reiterated in the brains of affected HD transgenic mice. Increased brain copper correlated with decreased levels of the copper export protein, amyloid precursor protein. We hypothesized that increased amounts of copper bound to low affinity sites could contribute to pro-oxidant activities and neurodegeneration. We focused on two proteins: huntingtin, because of its centrality to HD, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), because of its documented sensitivity to copper, necessity for normoxic brain energy metabolism and evidence for altered lactate metabolism in HD brain. The first 171 amino acids of wild-type huntingtin, and its glutamine expanded mutant form, interacted with copper, but not iron. N171 reduced Cu(2+)in vitro in a 1:1 copper:protein stoichiometry indicating that this fragment is very redox active. Further, copper promoted and metal chelation inhibited aggregation of cell-free huntingtin. We found decreased LDH activity, but not protein, and increased lactate levels in HD transgenic mouse brain. The LDH inhibitor oxamate resulted in neurodegeneration when delivered intra-striatially to healthy mice, indicating that LDH inhibition is relevant to neurodegeneration in HD. Our findings support a role of pro-oxidant copper-protein interactions in HD progression and offer a novel target for pharmacotherapeutics. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061 D013485

20231838	20100317	Effects of a genome-wide supported psychosis risk variant on neural activation during a theory-of-mind task.	Schizophrenia is associated with marked deficits in theory of mind (ToM), a higher-order form of social cognition representing the thoughts, emotions and intentions of others. Altered brain activation in the medial prefrontal cortex and temporo-parietal cortex during ToM tasks has been found in patients with schizophrenia, but the relevance of these neuroimaging findings for the heritable risk for schizophrenia is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that activation of the ToM network is altered in healthy risk allele carriers of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1344706 in the gene ZNF804A, a recently discovered risk variant for psychosis with genome-wide support. In all, 109 healthy volunteers of both sexes in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for rs1344706 were investigated with functional magnetic resonance imaging during a ToM task. As hypothesised, risk carriers exhibited a significant (P&lt;0.05 false discovery rate, corrected for multiple comparisons) risk allele dose effect on neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and left temporo-parietal cortex. Moreover, the same effect was found in the left inferior parietal cortex and left inferior frontal cortex, which are part of the human analogue of the mirror neuron system. In addition, in an exploratory analysis (P&lt;0.001 uncorrected), we found evidence for aberrant functional connectivity between the frontal and temporo-parietal regions in risk allele carriers. To conclude, we show that a dysfunction of the ToM network is associated with a genome-wide supported genetic risk variant for schizophrenia and has promise as an intermediate phenotype that can be mined for the development of biological interventions targeted to social dysfunction in psychiatry.

27144524	20160505	An integrated proteomics approach shows synaptic plasticity changes in an APP/PS1 Alzheimer's mouse model.	The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular signature of Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid pathology.We used the double APPswe/PS1?E9 mouse, a widely used model of cerebral amyloidosis, to compare changes in proteome, including global phosphorylation and sialylated N-linked glycosylation patterns, pathway-focused transcriptome and neurological disease-associated miRNAome with age-matched controls in neocortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb and brainstem. We report that signalling pathways related to synaptic functions associated with dendritic spine morphology, neurite outgrowth, long-term potentiation, CREB signalling and cytoskeletal dynamics were altered in 12 month old APPswe/PS1?E9 mice, particularly in the neocortex and olfactory bulb. This was associated with cerebral amyloidosis as well as formation of argyrophilic tangle-like structures and microglial clustering in all brain regions, except for brainstem. These responses may be epigenetically modulated by the interaction with a number of miRNAs regulating spine restructuring, A? expression and neuroinflammation.We suggest that these changes could be associated with development of cognitive dysfunction in early disease states in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

23531559	20130328	Early presymptomatic cholinergic dysfunction in a murine model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Sporadic and familiar amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases presented lower cholinergic activity than in healthy individuals in their still preserved spinal motoneurons (MNs) suggesting that cholinergic reduction might occur before MN death. To unravel how and when cholinergic function is compromised, we have analyzed the spatiotemporal expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) from early presymptomatic stages of the SOD1(G93A) ALS mouse model by confocal immunohistochemistry. The analysis showed an early reduction in ChAT content in soma and presynaptic boutons apposed onto MNs (to 76%) as well as in cholinergic interneurons in the lumbar spinal cord of the 30-day-old SOD1(G93A) mice. Cholinergic synaptic stripping occurred simultaneously to the presence of abundant surrounding major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II)-positive microglia and the accumulation of nuclear Tdp-43 and the appearance of mild oxidative stress within MNs. Besides, there was a loss of neuronal MHC-I expression, which is necessary for balanced synaptic stripping after axotomy. These events occurred before the selective raise of markers of denervation such as ATF3. By the same time, alterations in postsynaptic cholinergic-related structures were also revealed with a loss of the presence of sigma-1 receptor, a Ca2+ buffering chaperone in the postsynaptic cisternae. By 2 months of age, ChAT seemed to accumulate in the soma of MNs, and thus efferences toward Renshaw interneurons were drastically diminished. In conclusion, cholinergic dysfunction in the local circuitry of the spinal cord may be one of the earliest events in ALS etiopathogenesis. 	Brain_Behav	D016428
26425687	20151002	Inhibition of de novo Palmitate Synthesis by Fatty Acid Synthase Induces Apoptosis in Tumor Cells by Remodeling Cell Membranes, Inhibiting Signaling Pathways, and Reprogramming Gene Expression.	Inhibition of de novo palmitate synthesis via fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibition provides an unproven approach to cancer therapy with a strong biological rationale. FASN expression increases with tumor progression and associates with chemoresistance, tumor metastasis, and diminished patient survival in numerous tumor types. TVB-3166, an orally-available, reversible, potent, and selective FASN inhibitor induces apoptosis, inhibits anchorage-independent cell growth under lipid-rich conditions, and inhibits in-vivo xenograft tumor growth. Dose-dependent effects are observed between 20-200?nM TVB-3166, which agrees with the IC50 in biochemical FASN and cellular palmitate synthesis assays. Mechanistic studies show that FASN inhibition disrupts lipid raft architecture, inhibits biological pathways such as lipid biosynthesis, PI3K-AKT-mTOR and ?-catenin signal transduction, and inhibits expression of oncogenic effectors such as c-Myc; effects that are tumor-cell specific. Our results demonstrate that FASN inhibition has anti-tumor activities in biologically diverse preclinical tumor models and provide mechanistic and pharmacologic evidence that FASN inhibition presents a promising therapeutic strategy for treating a variety of cancers, including those expressing mutant K-Ras, ErbB2, c-Met, and PTEN. The reported findings inform ongoing studies to link mechanisms of action with defined tumor types and advance the discovery of biomarkers supporting development of FASN inhibitors as cancer therapeutics. Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a vital enzyme in tumor cell biology; the over-expression of FASN is associated with diminished patient prognosis and resistance to many cancer therapies. Our data demonstrate that selective and potent FASN inhibition with TVB-3166 leads to selective death of tumor cells, without significant effect on normal cells, and inhibits in vivo xenograft tumor growth at well-tolerated doses. Candidate biomarkers for selecting tumors highly sensitive to FASN inhibition are identified.

Protease inhibitors from the host may inhibit proteases from invading pathogens and confer resistance. We have previously shown that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP198C) in a serine protease inhibitor gene (cvSI-1) is associated with Perkinsus marinus resistance in the eastern oyster. As SNP198 is synonymous, we studied whether its linkage to polymorphism at the promoter region could explain the resistance. A 631 bp fragment of the promoter region was cloned by genome-walking and resequenced, revealing 22 SNPs and 3 insertion/deletions (indels). A 25 bp indel at position -404 was genotyped along with SNP198 for association analysis using before- and after-mortality samples. After mortalities that were primarily caused by P. marinus, the frequency of deletion allele at -404indel increased by 15.6% (p = 0.0437), while that of SNP198C increased by only 3.4% (p = 0.5756). The resistance alleles at the two loci were coupled in 79.6% of the oysters. Oysters with the deletion allele at -404indel showed significant (p = 0.0189) up-regulation of cvSI-1 expression under P. marinus challenge. Our results suggest that mutation at the promoter region causes increased transcription of cvSI-1, which in turn confers P. marinus resistance in the eastern oyster likely through inhibiting pathogenic proteases from the parasite.

24049082	20130920	PARP-1 dependent recruitment of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-associated protein FUS/TLS to sites of oxidative DNA damage.	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is associated with progressive degeneration of motor neurons. Several of the genes associated with this disease encode proteins involved in RNA processing, including fused-in-sarcoma/translocated-in-sarcoma (FUS/TLS). FUS is a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family of proteins that bind thousands of pre-mRNAs and can regulate their splicing. Here, we have examined the possibility that FUS is also a component of the cellular response to DNA damage. We show that both GFP-tagged and endogenous FUS re-localize to sites of oxidative DNA damage induced by UVA laser, and that FUS recruitment is greatly reduced or ablated by an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase activity. Consistent with this, we show that recombinant FUS binds directly to poly (ADP-ribose) in vitro, and that both GFP-tagged and endogenous FUS fail to accumulate at sites of UVA laser induced damage in cells lacking poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1. Finally, we show that GFP-FUS(R521G), harbouring a mutation that is associated with ALS, exhibits reduced ability to accumulate at sites of UVA laser-induced DNA damage. Together, these data suggest that FUS is a component of the cellular response to DNA damage, and that defects in this response may contribute to ALS. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D013485
21079787	20101117	Evolution of linked avirulence effectors in Leptosphaeria maculans is affected by genomic environment and exposure to resistance genes in host plants.	Brassica napus (canola) cultivars and isolates of the blackleg fungus, Leptosphaeria maculans interact in a 'gene for gene' manner whereby plant resistance (R) genes are complementary to pathogen avirulence (Avr) genes. Avirulence genes encode proteins that belong to a class of pathogen molecules known as effectors, which includes small secreted proteins that play a role in disease. In Australia in 2003 canola cultivars with the Rlm1 resistance gene suffered a breakdown of disease resistance, resulting in severe yield losses. This was associated with a large increase in the frequency of virulence alleles of the complementary avirulence gene, AvrLm1, in fungal populations. Surprisingly, the frequency of virulence alleles of AvrLm6 (complementary to Rlm6) also increased dramatically, even though the cultivars did not contain Rlm6. In the L. maculans genome, AvrLm1 and AvrLm6 are linked along with five other genes in a region interspersed with transposable elements that have been degenerated by Repeat-Induced Point (RIP) mutations. Analyses of 295 Australian isolates showed deletions, RIP mutations and/or non-RIP derived amino acid substitutions in the predicted proteins encoded by these seven genes. The degree of RIP mutations within single copy sequences in this region was proportional to their proximity to the degenerated transposable elements. The RIP alleles were monophyletic and were present only in isolates collected after resistance conferred by Rlm1 broke down, whereas deletion alleles belonged to several polyphyletic lineages and were present before and after the resistance breakdown. Thus, genomic environment and exposure to resistance genes in B. napus has affected the evolution of these linked avirulence genes in L. maculans. 	PLoS_Pathog.	D016428 D013485
21416260	20110319	Cytoskeletal protein kinases: titin and its relations in mechanosensing.	Titin, the giant elastic ruler protein of striated muscle sarcomeres, contains a catalytic kinase domain related to a family of intrasterically regulated protein kinases. The most extensively studied member of this branch of the human kinome is the Ca(2+)-calmodulin (CaM)-regulated myosin light-chain kinases (MLCK). However, not all kinases of the MLCK branch are functional MLCKs, and about half lack a CaM binding site in their C-terminal autoinhibitory tail (AI). A unifying feature is their association with the cytoskeleton, mostly via actin and myosin filaments. Titin kinase, similar to its invertebrate analogue twitchin kinase and likely other &quot;MLCKs&quot;, is not Ca(2+)-calmodulin-activated. Recently, local protein unfolding of the C-terminal AI has emerged as a common mechanism in the activation of CaM kinases. Single-molecule data suggested that opening of the TK active site could also be achieved by mechanical unfolding of the AI. Mechanical modulation of catalytic activity might thus allow cytoskeletal signalling proteins to act as mechanosensors, creating feedback mechanisms between cytoskeletal tension and tension generation or cellular remodelling. Similar to other MLCK-like kinases like DRAK2 and DAPK1, TK is linked to protein turnover regulation via the autophagy/lysosomal system, suggesting the MLCK-like kinases have common functions beyond contraction regulation.

19732760	20090908	Haplotypes in the UGT1A1 gene and their role as genetic determinants of bilirubin concentration in healthy German volunteers.	Genetic variations of UDP-glucuronyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) influence the concentration of serum bilirubin. We investigated the association of four common polymorphisms including UGT1A1-53(TA)(n), and common haplotypes of the UGT1A1 gene with bilirubin levels in 218 Caucasian volunteers. Total bilirubin was measured in serum of 218 healthy Caucasian volunteers. Genotyping of four genetic variants was performed: UGT1A1-53(TA)(6/7), UGT1A1c.-3279T&gt;G, UGT1A1c.-3156G&gt;A, and UGT1A1c.211G&gt;A. The association between polymorphisms/haplotypes and bilirubin levels were determined. Minor allele frequencies were 0.36 for UGT1A1-53(TA)(7), 0.47 for c.-3279G, 0.33 for c.-3156A and 0.006 for c.211A. The three promoter polymorphisms were in close linkage disequilibrium. Common haplotypes were: -53(TA)(6)/c.-3279T/c.211G (frequency 0.530), -53(TA)(7)/c.-3279G/c.211G (frequency 0.365), and -53(TA)(6)/c.-3279G/c.211G (frequency 0.099). Male sex, UGT1A1-53(TA)(6/7) and the c.-3279GG variant were significantly associated with higher bilirubin concentrations. Two UGT1A1 promoter polymorphisms (-53(TA)(6/7) and c.-3279T&gt;G) and a common haplotype of the UGT1A1 gene are associated with serum bilirubin concentrations in Caucasians. 	Clin._Biochem.

16680198	20060509	High-resolution recombination patterns in a region of human chromosome 21 measured by sperm typing.	For decades, classical crossover studies and linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis of genomic regions suggested that human meiotic crossovers may not be randomly distributed along chromosomes but are focused instead in &quot;hot spots.&quot; Recent sperm typing studies provided data at very high resolution and accuracy that defined the physical limits of a number of hot spots. The data were also used to test whether patterns of LD can predict hot spot locations. These sperm typing studies focused on several small regions of the genome already known or suspected of containing a hot spot based on the presence of LD breakdown or previous experimental evidence of hot spot activity. Comparable data on target regions not specifically chosen using these two criteria is lacking but is needed to make an unbiased test of whether LD data alone can accurately predict active hot spots. We used sperm typing to estimate recombination in 17 almost contiguous ~5 kb intervals spanning 103 kb of human Chromosome 21. We found two intervals that contained new hot spots. The comparison of our data with recombination rates predicted by statistical analyses of LD showed that, overall, the two datasets corresponded well, except for one predicted hot spot that showed little crossing over. This study doubles the experimental data on recombination in men at the highest resolution and accuracy and supports the emerging genome-wide picture that recombination is localized in small regions separated by cold areas. Detailed study of one of the new hot spots revealed a sperm donor with a decrease in recombination intensity at the canonical recombination site but an increase in crossover activity nearby. This unique finding suggests that the position and intensity of hot spots may evolve by means of a concerted mechanism that maintains the overall recombination intensity in the region. 	PLoS_Genet.

24688369	20140402	A review on using crumb rubber in reinforcement of asphalt pavement.	An immense problem affecting environmental pollution is the increase of waste tyre vehicles. In an attempt to decrease the magnitude of this issue, crumb rubber modifier (CRM) obtained from waste tyre rubber has gained interest in asphalt reinforcement. The use of crumb rubber in the reinforcement of asphalt is considered as a smart solution for sustainable development by reusing waste materials, and it is believed that crumb rubber modifier (CRM) could be an alternative polymer material in improving hot mix asphalt performance properties. In this paper, a critical review on the use of crumb rubber in reinforcement of asphalt pavement will be presented and discussed. It will also include a review on the effects of CRM on the stiffness, rutting, and fatigue resistance of road pavement construction. 	ScientificWorldJournal	D016428 D016454
22857951	20120804	Molecular basis for specific regulation of neuronal kinesin-3 motors by doublecortin family proteins.	Doublecortin (Dcx) defines a growing family of microtubule (MT)-associated proteins (MAPs) involved in neuronal migration and process outgrowth. We show that Dcx is essential for the function of Kif1a, a kinesin-3 motor protein that traffics synaptic vesicles. Neurons lacking Dcx and/or its structurally conserved paralogue, doublecortin-like kinase 1 (Dclk1), show impaired Kif1a-mediated transport of Vamp2, a cargo of Kif1a, with decreased run length. Human disease-associated mutations in Dcx's linker sequence (e.g., W146C, K174E) alter Kif1a/Vamp2 transport by disrupting Dcx/Kif1a interactions without affecting Dcx MT binding. Dcx specifically enhances binding of the ADP-bound Kif1a motor domain to MTs. Cryo-electron microscopy and subnanometer-resolution image reconstruction reveal the kinesin-dependent conformational variability of MT-bound Dcx and suggest a model for MAP-motor crosstalk on MTs. Alteration of kinesin run length by MAPs represents a previously undiscovered mode of control of kinesin transport and provides a mechanism for regulation of MT-based transport by local signals.

26865329	20160212	Functional role of positively selected amino acid substitutions in mammalian rhodopsin evolution.	Visual rhodopsins are membrane proteins that function as light photoreceptors in the vertebrate retina. Specific amino acids have been positively selected in visual pigments during mammal evolution, which, as products of adaptive selection, would be at the base of important functional innovations. We have analyzed the top candidates for positive selection at the specific amino acids and the corresponding reverse changes (F13M, Q225R and A346S) in order to unravel the structural and functional consequences of these important sites in rhodopsin evolution. We have constructed, expressed and immunopurified the corresponding mutated pigments and analyzed their molecular phenotypes. We find that position 13 is very important for the folding of the receptor and also for proper protein glycosylation. Position 225 appears to be important for the function of the protein affecting the G-protein activation process, and position 346 would also regulate functionality of the receptor by enhancing G-protein activation and presumably affecting protein phosphorylation by rhodopsin kinase. Our results represent a link between the evolutionary analysis, which pinpoints the specific amino acid positions in the adaptive process, and the structural and functional analysis, closer to the phenotype, making biochemical sense of specific selected genetic sequences in rhodopsin evolution.

24672570	20140328	Combined choroidal neovascularization and hypopituitarism in a patient with homozygous mutation in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene.	We report a case of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutation in a 20-year-old male patient with hypopituitarism. Treatment with three consecutive injections of intravitreal ranibizumab (anti-vascular endothelial growth factor) resulted in significant improvement of the patient's vision and the appearance of the macula. A search of the literature produced no previously reported case of MTHFR gene mutation associated both CNV and possibly hypopituitarism. With hormone replacement therapy of hypopituitarism, acetyl salicylic acid 100 mg/day also was started. The patient was clinically stable both for CNV and other thromboembolic disorders over a 6-month follow-up and also 1-year follow-up period. 	J_Res_Med_Sci	D016428
11682068	20011030	Agonist-independent and -dependent oligomerization of dopamine D(2) receptors by fusion to fluorescent proteins.	Oligomerization of the short (D(2S)) and long (D(2L)) isoforms of the dopamine D(2) receptor was explored in transfected Cos-7 cells by their C-terminal fusion to either an enhanced cyan or enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (ECFP or EYFP) and the fluorescent fusion protein interaction was monitored by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. The pharmacological properties of the fluorescent fusion proteins, as measured by both displacement of [(3)H]nemonapride binding and agonist-mediated stimulation of [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding upon co-expression with a G(alphao)Cys(351)Ile protein, were not different from the respective wild-type D(2S) and D(2L) receptors. Co-expression of D2S:ECFP+D2S:EYFP in a 1:1 ratio and D2L:ECFP+D2L:EYFP in a 27:1 ratio resulted, respectively, in an increase of 26% and 16% in the EYFP-specific fluorescent signal. These data are consistent with a close proximity of both D(2S) and D(2L) receptor pairs of fluorescent fusion proteins in the absence of ligand. The agonist-independent D(2S) receptor oligomerization could be attenuated by co-expression with either a wild-type, non-fluorescent D(2S) or D(2L) receptor subtype, but not with a distinct beta(2)-adrenoceptor. Incubation with the agonist (-)-norpropylapomorphine dose-dependently (EC(50): 0.23+/-0.06 nM) increased the FRET signal for the co-expression of D2S:ECFP and D2S:EYFP, in support of agonist-dependent D(2S) receptor oligomerization. In conclusion, our data strongly suggest the occurrence of dopamine D(2) receptor oligomers in intact Cos-7 cells. 	FEBS_Lett.	D016428
11168414	20010213	Mapping DNA-binding sites of HIV-1 integrase by protein footprinting.	The HIV-1 integrase protein catalyzes integration of the viral genome into host cell DNA. Whereas the structures of the three domains of integrase have been solved separately, both the structural organization of the full-length protein and its interaction with DNA remain unresolved. A protein footprinting approach was employed to investigate the accessibility of residues in the full-length soluble integrase mutant, INF(185K,C280S), to proteolytic attack in the absence and presence of DNA. The N-terminal and C-terminal domains were relatively more accessible to proteolytic attack than the core domain. The susceptibility to proteolytic attack was specifically affected by DNA at residues Lys34, in the N-terminal domain, Lys111, Lys136, Glu138, Lys156-Lys160, Lys185-Lys188, in the core domain, and Asp207, Lys 215, Glu246, Lys258 and Lys273 in the linker and C-terminal domain, suggesting that these regions are involved in, or shielded by, DNA binding. Lys34 is positioned in a putative dimerization domain, consistent with the notion that DNA stabilizes the dimeric state of integrase. 	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 D013485
19377787	20090421	Association between apolipoprotein E genotype, serum lipids, and colorectal cancer in Brazilian individuals.	We evaluated genetic variants of apolipoprotein E (APOE HhaI) and their association with serum lipids in colorectal cancer (CRC), together with eating habits and personal history. Eight-seven adults with CRC and 73 controls were studied. APOE*2 (rs7412) and APOE*4 (rs429358) were identified by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. APOE gene polymorphisms were similar in both groups, but the epsilon4/epsilon4 genotype (6%) was present only in controls. The patients had reduced levels (mean +/- SD) of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol fraction (180.4 +/- 49.5 and 116.1 +/- 43.1 mg/dL, respectively) compared to controls (204.2 +/- 55.6, P = 0.135 and 134.7 +/- 50.8 mg/dL; P = 0.330, respectively) indicating that they were not statistically significant after the Bonferroni correction. The APOE*4 allele was associated with lower levels of total cholesterol, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol fraction and increased levels of very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol fraction and triglycerides only among patients (P = 0.014). There was a positive correlation between the altered lipid profile and increased body mass indexes in both groups (P &lt; 0.010). Moreover, a higher rate of hypertension and overweight was observed in controls (P &lt; 0.002). In conclusion, the presence of the epsilon4/epsilon4 genotype only in controls may be due to a protective effect against CRC. Lower lipid profile values among patients, even those on lipid-rich diets associated with the APOE*4 allele, suggest alterations in the lipid synthesis and metabolism pathways in CRC.

27302215	20160616	Solute carrier 41A3 encodes for a mitochondrial Mg(2+) efflux system.	The important role of magnesium (Mg(2+)) in normal cellular physiology requires flexible, yet tightly regulated, intracellular Mg(2+) homeostasis (IMH). However, only little is known about Mg(2+) transporters of subcellular compartments such as mitochondria, despite their obvious importance for the deposition and reposition of intracellular Mg(2+) pools. In particular, knowledge about mechanisms responsible for extrusion of Mg(2+) from mitochondria is lacking. Based on circumstantial evidence, two possible mechanisms of Mg(2+) release from mitochondria were predicted: (1) Mg(2+) efflux coupled to ATP translocation via the ATP-Mg/Pi carrier, and (2) Mg(2+) efflux via a H(+)/Mg(2+) exchanger. Regardless, the identity of the H(+)-coupled Mg(2+) efflux system is unknown. We demonstrate here that member A3 of solute carrier (SLC) family 41 is a mitochondrial Mg(2+) efflux system. Mitochondria of HEK293 cells overexpressing SLC41A3 exhibit a 60% increase in the extrusion of Mg(2+) compared with control cells. This efflux mechanism is Na(+)-dependent and temperature sensitive. Our data identify SLC41A3 as the first mammalian mitochondrial Mg(2+) efflux system, which greatly enhances our understanding of intracellular Mg(2+) homeostasis. 	Sci_Rep	D016428

25006382	20140710	The reliability of an easy measuring method for abutment convergence angle with a computer-aided design (CAD) system.	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the intra-rater reliability and inter-rater reliability of three different methods using a drawing protractor, a digital protractor after tracing, and a CAD system. Twenty-four artificial abutments that had been prepared by dental students were used in this study. Three dental students measured the convergence angles by each method three times. Bland-Altman plots were applied to examine the overall reliability by comparing the traditional tracing method with a new method using the CAD system. Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) evaluated intra-rater reliability and inter-rater reliability. All three methods exhibited high intra-rater and inter-rater reliability (ICC&gt;0.80, P&lt;.05). Measurements with the CAD system showed the highest intra-rater reliability. In addition, it showed improved inter-rater reliability compared with the traditional tracing methods. Based on the results of this study, the CAD system may be an easy and reliable tool for measuring the abutment convergence angle. 	J_Adv_Prosthodont	D016428
26473826	20151017	Association of the C-Reactive Protein Gene (CRP) rs1205 C&gt;T Polymorphism with Aortic Valve Calcification in Patients with Aortic Stenosis.	Elevation in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels have been shown in patients with aortic valve stenosis (AS). Minor allele of the CRP gene (CRP) rs1205 C&gt;T polymorphism has been associated with lower plasma CRP concentrations in cohorts of healthy and atherosclerotic patients. Considering the existing similarities between atherosclerosis and AS, we examined the effect of CRP rs1205 C&gt;T polymorphism on the AS severity. Three hundred consecutive Caucasian patients diagnosed with AS were genotyped for the rs1205 C&gt;T polymorphism using the TaqMan assay. Severity of the AS was assessed using transthoracic echocardiography. The degree of calcification was analyzed semi-quantitatively. Carriers of the rs1205 T allele were characterized by elevated serum CRP levels (2.53 (1.51-3.96) vs. 1.68 (0.98-2.90) mg/L, p&lt;0.001) and a higher proportion of the severe aortic valve calcification (70.4% vs. 55.1%, p=0.01) compared with major homozygotes. The effect of CRP rs1205 polymorphism on CRP levels is opposite in AS-affected than in unaffected subjects, suggesting existence of a disease-specific molecular regulatory mechanism. Furthermore, rs1205 variant allele predisposes to larger aortic valve calcification, potentially being a novel genetic risk marker of disease progression. 	Int_J_Mol_Sci	D016428 D013485
25612896	20150124	BDNF-Val66Met-polymorphism impact on cortical plasticity in schizophrenia patients: a proof-of-concept study.	Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been shown to be a moderator of neuroplasticity. A frequent BDNF-polymorphism (Val66Met) is associated with impairments of cortical plasticity. In patients with schizophrenia, reduced neuroplastic responses following non-invasive brain stimulation have been reported consistently. Various studies have indicated a relationship between the BDNF-Val66Met-polymorphism and motor-cortical plasticity in healthy individuals, but schizophrenia patients have yet to be investigated. The aim of this proof-of-concept study was, therefore, to test the impact of the BDNF-Val66Met-polymorphism on inhibitory and facilitatory cortical plasticity in schizophrenia patients. Cortical plasticity was investigated in 22 schizophrenia patients and 35 healthy controls using anodal and cathodal transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) applied to the left primary motor cortex. Animal and human research indicates that excitability shifts following anodal and cathodal tDCS are related to molecular long-term potentiation and long-term depression. To test motor-cortical excitability before and after tDCS, well-established single- and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation protocols were applied. Our analysis revealed increased glutamate-mediated intracortical facilitation in met-heterozygotes compared to val-homozygotes at baseline. Following cathodal tDCS, schizophrenia met-heterozygotes had reduced gamma-amino-butyric-acid-mediated short-interval intracortical inhibition, whereas healthy met-heterozygotes displayed the opposite effect. The BDNF-Val66Met-polymorphism did not influence single-pulse motor-evoked potential amplitudes after tDCS. These preliminary findings support the notion of an association of the BDNF-Val66Met-polymorphism with observable alterations in plasticity following cathodal tDCS in schizophrenia patients. This indicates a complex interaction between inhibitory intracortical interneuron-networks, cortical plasticity, and the BDNF-Val66Met-polymorphism. Further replication and validation need to be dedicated to this question to confirm this relationship. 	Int._J._Neuropsychopharmacol.	D016428
15070679	20040409	Membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) cooperates with sphingosine 1-phosphate to induce endothelial cell migration and morphogenic differentiation.	Membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) has been suggested to play an important role in angiogenesis, but the mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood. Using an in vitro model of angiogenesis in which cell migration of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) and their morphogenic differentiation into capillary-like structures on Matrigel are induced by overexpression of MT1-MMP, we show that the platelet-derived bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is the predominant serum factor essential for MT1-MMP-dependent migration and morphogenic differentiation activities. In the presence of S1P, MT1-MMP-dependent cell migration and morphogenic differentiation were inhibited by pertussis toxin, suggesting the involvement of Gi-protein-coupled receptor-mediated signaling. Accordingly, cotransfection of BAECs with MT1-MMP and a constitutively active Galphai2 (Q205L) mutant increased cell migration and morphogenic differentiation, whereas treatment of BAECs overexpressing MT1-MMP with antisense oligonucleotides directed against S1P1 and S1P3, the predominant S1P receptors, significantly inhibited both processes. These results demonstrate that MT1-MMP-induced migration and morphogenic differentiation involve the cooperation of the enzyme with platelet-derived bioactive lipids through S1P-mediated activation of Galphai-coupled S1P1 and S1P3 receptors. Given the important contribution of platelets to tumor angiogenesis, the stimulation of endothelial MT1-MMP function by S1P may thus constitute an important molecular event linking hemostasis to angiogenesis.

18332217	20080312	The regulation of SIRT2 function by cyclin-dependent kinases affects cell motility.	Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) fulfill key functions in many cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and cytoskeletal dynamics. A limited number of Cdk substrates have been identified with few demonstrated to be regulated by Cdk-dependent phosphorylation. We identify on protein expression arrays novel cyclin E-Cdk2 substrates, including SIRT2, a member of the Sirtuin family of NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases that targets alpha-tubulin. We define Ser-331 as the site phosphorylated by cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin A-Cdk2, and p35-Cdk5 both in vitro and in cells. Importantly, phosphorylation at Ser-331 inhibits the catalytic activity of SIRT2. Gain- and loss-of-function studies demonstrate that SIRT2 interfered with cell adhesion and cell migration. In postmitotic hippocampal neurons, neurite outgrowth and growth cone collapse are inhibited by SIRT2. The effects provoked by SIRT2, but not those of a nonphosphorylatable mutant, are antagonized by Cdk-dependent phosphorylation. Collectively, our findings identify a posttranslational mechanism that controls SIRT2 function, and they provide evidence for a novel regulatory circuitry involving Cdks, SIRT2, and microtubules.

18829531	20081003	Prolyl isomerase cyclophilin A regulation of Janus-activated kinase 2 and the progression of human breast cancer.	The activation of the Janus-activated kinase 2 (Jak2) tyrosine kinase following ligand binding has remained incompletely characterized at the mechanistic level. We report that the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPI) cyclophilin A (CypA), which is implicated in the regulation of protein conformation, is necessary for the prolactin (PRL)-induced activation of Jak2 and the progression of human breast cancer. A direct correlation was observed between the levels or activity of CypA and the extent of PRL-induced signaling and gene expression. Loss of PRLr-CypA binding, following treatment with the PPI inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA), or overexpression of a dominant-negative PRLr mutant (P334A) resulted in a loss of PRLr/Jak2-mediated signaling. In vitro, CsA treatment of breast cancer cells inhibited their growth, motility, invasion, and soft agar colony formation. In vivo, CsA treatment of nude mice xenografted with breast cancer cells induced tumor necrosis and completely inhibited metastasis. These studies reveal that a CypA-mediated conformational change within the PRLr/Jak2 complex is required for PRL-induced transduction and function and indicate that the inhibition of prolyl isomerases may be a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of human breast cancer.

27667313	20160927	Vitamin D, vitamin A, the primary melanoma transcriptome and survival.	Survival from melanoma is influenced by several, well-established clinical and histopathological factors, e.g. age, Breslow thickness and microscopic ulceration. We (the Section of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Leeds) have carried out research to better understand the biological basis for these observations. Preliminary results indicated a protective role for vitamin D in melanoma relapse and that higher vitamin D was associated with thinner primary melanomas. Funding from the British Skin Foundation enabled JNB to establish a study of the effects of vitamin A in melanoma. The results suggested that vitamin A could reduce the protective effect of vitamin D in terms of overall survival. Therefore, we propose that vitamin D3supplementation alone might be preferable to combined multivitamin preparations, where vitamin D supplementation is deemed to be appropriate. Proving a causal link between vitamin D and melanoma-specific survival is challenging. We have shown limited evidence of causation in a Mendelian randomization experiment (described in more detail later). Recent work in Leeds has also shown that higher vitamin D may be protective for microscopic ulceration. Taken together, vitamin D appears to be associated with less aggressive primary melanomas and may itself influence outcome. We continue to explore the role of vitamin D in melanoma survival and the optimum levels that might be crucial. 	Br._J._Dermatol.	D016454 D016428
15466394	20041007	Massive CA1/2 neuronal loss with intraneuronal and N-terminal truncated Abeta42 accumulation in a novel Alzheimer transgenic model.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a substantial degeneration of pyramidal neurons and the appearance of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Here we present a novel transgenic mouse model, APP(SL)PS1KI that closely mimics the development of AD-related neuropathological features including a significant hippocampal neuronal loss. This transgenic mouse model carries M233T/L235P knocked-in mutations in presenilin-1 and overexpresses mutated human beta-amyloid (Abeta) precursor protein. Abeta(x-42) is the major form of Abeta species present in this model with progressive development of a complex pattern of N-truncated variants and dimers, similar to those observed in AD brain. At 10 months of age, an extensive neuronal loss (&gt;50%) is present in the CA1/2 hippocampal pyramidal cell layer that correlates with strong accumulation of intraneuronal Abeta and thioflavine-S-positive intracellular material but not with extracellular Abeta deposits. A strong reactive astrogliosis develops together with the neuronal loss. This loss is already detectable at 6 months of age and is PS1KI gene dosage-dependent. Thus, APP(SL)PS1KI mice further confirm the critical role of intraneuronal Abeta(42) in neuronal loss and provide an excellent tool to investigate therapeutic strategies designed to prevent AD neurodegeneration.

8717418	19960112	Torsionally-strained DNA and intermolecular purine-purine-pyrimidine triple-helix formation.	A potentially powerful pharmacological approach to modulating the expression of specific, disease-related genes involves the inhibition of transcription factor binding to promoter or enhancer elements through oligonucleotide-mediated triple-helix formation. In vivo, the typical target for intermolecular triplex formation would most likely be torsionally-strained rather than relaxed duplex DNA. To determine the effects of strained DNA on triplex formation, we investigated the interactions between a G/T-rich oligonucleotide and both supercoiled and relaxed plasmid DNA using a restriction endonuclease protection assay. Both the kinetics of formation and dissociation of purine-motif triplexes were unaffected by the conformational state of the duplex DNA. Similarly, the topological state of the plasmid targets was not affected by triplex formation. Taken together, these observations suggest that stable intermolecular triplexes can form in vivo under conditions of moderate torsional strain. 	Mol._Cell._Biochem.	D016428 D013487
8095933	19930101	Pyroglutamyl peptidase gene from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens: cloning, sequencing, expression, and crystallization of the expressed enzyme.	The pyroglutamyl peptidase [EC 3.4.11.8] gene from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli DH1. The transformant of E. coli DH1 harboring plasmid pBPG 1 with a 2.1 kb chromosomal DNA fragment showed 80-fold higher activity than B. amyloliquefaciens. The nucleotide sequence of a 0.9 kb fragment that contains the promoter and the mature protein coding region was determined by the dideoxy chain-termination method. An open reading frame of 648 bp starting with an ATG methionine codon was found, which encodes a protein of 215 amino acid residues with a deduced molecular weight of 23,286. The enzyme has two cysteine residues (Cys68 and Cys144) per subunit molecule. Substitution of Cys144 with Ser by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in a complete loss of the activity, while that of Cys68 with Ser did not affect the activity at all. This result and titration with DTNB suggest that Cys144 is concerned in the catalytic action and Cys68 is located inside the enzyme. The expressed enzyme was purified to homogeneity by hydrophobic chromatography on a Toyopearl HW-65C column and crystallization, with an activity recovery of 42.7%. The enzyme was most active at pH 6.5 and stable at pH 7.0-9.0. Its molecular weight was estimated to be 51,000 by gel filtration, suggesting it to be a dimer. Big crystals of the wild and PCMB-modified enzymes were obtained by the hanging drop method. 	J._Biochem.	D016428 D013485
26544771	20151107	Microfluidics for rapid detection of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation for intraoperative application.	OBJECT Conventional methods for isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) detection, such as DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry, are time- and labor-consuming and cannot be applied for intraoperative analysis. To develop a new approach for rapid analysis of IDH1 mutation from tiny tumor samples, this study used microfluidics as a method for IDH1 mutation detection. METHODS Forty-seven glioma tumor samples were used; IDH1 mutation status was investigated by immunohistochemistry and DNA sequencing. The microfluidic device was fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane following standard soft lithography. The immunoanalysis was conducted in the microfluidic chip. Fluorescence images of the on-chip microcolumn taken by the charge-coupled device camera were collected as the analytical results readout. Fluorescence signals were analyzed by NIS-Elements software to gather detailed information about the IDH1 concentration in the tissue samples. RESULTS DNA sequencing identified IDH1 R132H mutation in 33 of 47 tumor samples. The fluorescence signal for IDH1-mutant samples was 5.49 ? 1.87 compared with 3.90 ? 1.33 for wild type (p = 0.005). Thus, microfluidics was capable of distinguishing IDH1-mutant tumor samples from wild-type samples. When the cutoff value was 4.11, the sensitivity of microfluidics was 87.9% and the specificity was 64.3%. CONCLUSIONS This new approach was capable of analyzing IDH1 mutation status of tiny tissue samples within 30 minutes using intraoperative microsampling. This approach might also be applied for rapid pathological diagnosis of diffuse gliomas, thus guiding personalized resection. 	J._Neurosurg.	D003160 D016428
27271060	20160609	Diabetes Health Literacy Among Somali Patients with Diabetes Mellitus in a US Primary Care Setting.	The purpose of this study was to describe diabetes literacy among Somali immigrants with diabetes and its association with diabetes outcomes. Among Somali immigrants in North America, the prevalence of diabetes exceeds that of the general population, and their measures of diabetes control are suboptimal when compared with non-Somali patients. Diabetes literacy is an important mediator of diabetes outcomes in general populations that has not been previously described among Somali immigrants and refugees. Diabetes literacy was measured using a translated version of the spoken knowledge in low literacy in diabetes (SKILLD) scale among Somali immigrants and refugees with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes outcome measures, including hemoglobin A1C, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and blood pressure, were obtained for each patient. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess associations between diabetes literacy and diabetes outcomes. Among 50 Somali patients with diabetes who completed the survey, the mean SKILLD score was low (42.2?%). The diabetes outcome measures showed a mean hemoglobin A1C of 8?%, LDL cholesterol of 99.17?mg/dL (2.57?mmol/L), systolic blood pressure of 130.9?mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure of 70.2?mmHg. There was no association between diabetes literacy scores and diabetes outcome measures. Somali patients with diabetes mellitus had low diabetes literacy and suboptimal measures of diabetes disease control. However, we found no association between diabetes literacy and diabetes outcomes. Future work aimed at reduction of diabetes-related health disparities among Somali immigrants and refugees to high-income countries should go beyond traditional means of patient education for low-literacy populations.

8991934	19960601	Mutations in the core promoter region of hepatitis B virus in patients with chronic hepatitis B.	The core promoter region of hepatitis B virus genomes regulates transcription of the precore and pregenomic mRNAs encoding hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and core antigen that contain target epitopes for cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The prevalence and clinical significance of mutations in this region were investigated. DNA was extracted from six asymptomatic carriers positive for HBeAg, eight asymptomatic carriers positive for an anti-HBe antibody, and 24 patients with chronic liver disease. The core promoter and precore regions of hepatitis B virus genomes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and predominant sequences were determined by direct sequencing. Mutations were found in none of the HBeAg-positive asymptomatic carriers but in all of the anti-HBe-positive asymptomatic carriers and the patients with chronic liver disease. Especially, A to T mutations at nucleotide 1762 and G to A mutations at nucleotide 1764 were found in five anti-HBe-positive asymptomatic carriers, and 22 patients with chronic liver disease. These two mutation hot spots were located within binding sites of the nuclear factors, and nucleotide 1762 was also involved in the A, T rich sequence that is located 28 base pairs upstream of the precore mRNA initiation site. Serum HBeAg and DNA polymerase levels were significantly lower in patients with these mutations than those without these mutations, and five individuals with these mutations were positive for anti-HBe despite the absence of the precore stop codon mutation. These mutants may be selected by host immune response to HBeAg and/or core antigen. 	J._Med._Virol.	D016428
21304971	20110210	Functional promoter polymorphisms govern differential expression of HMG-CoA reductase gene in mouse models of essential hypertension.	3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A [HMG-CoA] reductase gene (Hmgcr) is a susceptibility gene for essential hypertension. Sequencing of the Hmgcr locus in genetically hypertensive BPH (blood pressure high), genetically hypotensive BPL (blood pressure low) and genetically normotensive BPN (blood pressure normal) mice yielded a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). BPH/BPL/BPN Hmgcr promoter-luciferase reporter constructs were generated and transfected into liver HepG2, ovarian CHO, kidney HEK-293 and neuronal N2A cells for functional characterization of the promoter SNPs. The BPH-Hmgcr promoter showed significantly less activity than the BPL-Hmgcr promoter under basal as well as nicotine/cholesterol-treated conditions. This finding was consistent with lower endogenous Hmgcr expression in liver and lower plasma cholesterol in BPH mice. Transfection experiments using 5'-promoter deletion constructs (strategically made to assess the functional significance of each promoter SNP) and computational analysis predicted lower binding affinities of transcription factors c-Fos, n-Myc and Max with the BPH-promoter as compared to the BPL-promoter. Corroboratively, the BPH promoter-luciferase reporter construct co-transfected with expression plasmids of these transcription factors displayed less pronounced augmentation of luciferase activity than the BPL construct, particularly at lower amounts of transcription factor plasmids. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays also showed diminished interactions of the BPH promoter with HepG2 nuclear proteins. Taken together, this study provides mechanistic basis for the differential Hmgcr expression in these mouse models of human essential hypertension and have implications for better understanding the role of this gene in regulation of blood pressure.

10384092	19990629	Cutting edge: proteasome involvement in the degradation of unassembled Ig light chains.	Several studies on disposal of nonsecreted Ig L chains have identified the endoplasmic reticulum as the site of degradation. Here, we examine degradation of a nonsecreted Ig L chain, T15L, and an experimentally endoplasmic reticulum-retained secretion-competent L chain, D16L, in the absence of H chains. We demonstrate that 1) degradation is specifically impaired by the proteasome-specific inhibitors carboxybenzyl-leucyl-leucyl-leucine vinyl sulfone (Z-L3VS) and lactacystin, 2) L chain degradation occurs early in the biosynthetic pathway, and 3) degradation does not require vesicular transport. Our findings indicate that previous assertions of L chain disposal within the endoplasmic reticulum must be modified. To our knowledge, we provide the first direct evidence supporting a new paradigm for removal of nonsecreted Ig L chains via dislocation to cytosolic proteasomes. 	J._Immunol.	D016428 D013487
27803672	20161103	Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia (Hypoparathyroidism) Types 1 and 2.	Extracellular calcium is essential for life and its concentration in the blood is maintained within a narrow range. This is achieved by a feedback loop that receives input from the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR), expressed on the surface of parathyroid cells. In response to low ionized calcium, the parathyroids increase secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) which increases serum calcium. The CASR is also highly expressed in the kidneys, where it regulates the reabsorption of calcium from the primary filtrate. Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH) type 1 is caused by heterozygous activating mutations in the CASR which increase the sensitivity of the CASR to extracellular ionized calcium. Consequently, PTH synthesis and secretion are suppressed at normal ionized calcium concentrations. Patients present with hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, low magnesium levels, and low or low-normal levels of PTH. Urinary calcium excretion is typically increased due to the decrease in circulating PTH concentrations and by the activation of the renal tubular CASR. Therapeutic attempts using CASR antagonists (calcilytics) to treat ADH are currently under investigation. Recently, heterozygous mutations in the alpha subunit of the G protein G11 (G?11) have been identified in patients with ADH, and this has been classified as ADH type 2. ADH2 mutations lead to a gain-of-function of G?11, a key mediator of CASR signaling. Therefore, the mechanism of hypocalcemia appears similar to that of activating mutations in the CASR, namely an increase in the sensitivity of parathyroid cells to extracellular ionized calcium. Studies of activating mutations in the CASR and gain-of-function mutations in G?11 can help define new drug targets and improve medical management of patients with ADH types 1 and 2.

17994383	20071113	Alpha78(EF7)Asn--&gt;Asp is a posttranslational modification in Hb J-Singapore [alpha78(EF7)Asn--&gt;Asp;alpha79(EF8)Ala--&gt;Gly].	In Hb J-Singapore, the alpha78(EF7)Asn--&gt;Asp and alpha79(EF8)Ala--&gt;Gly substitutions were initially thought to be genetic mutations. Subsequent studies on other similar hemoglobin variants suggested that the Asn--&gt;Asp change was a posttranslational modification. Nevertheless, lack of DNA evidence made it difficult to confirm the deamidation in Hb J-Singapore. We recently encountered a female patient with Hb J-Singapore trait.

22614008	20120523	Nicotine/cigarette smoke promotes metastasis of pancreatic cancer through ?7nAChR-mediated MUC4 upregulation.	Despite evidence that long-term smoking is the leading risk factor for pancreatic malignancies, the underlying mechanism(s) for cigarette-smoke (CS)-induced pancreatic cancer (PC) pathogenesis has not been well established. Our previous studies revealed an aberrant expression of the MUC4 mucin in PC as compared with the normal pancreas, and its association with cancer progression and metastasis. Interestingly, here we explore a potential link between MUC4 expression and smoking-mediated PC pathogenesis and report that both cigarette smoke extract and nicotine, which is the major component of CS, significantly upregulates MUC4 in PC cells. This nicotine-mediated MUC4 overexpression was via the ?7 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) stimulation and subsequent activation of the JAK2/STAT3 downstream signaling cascade in cooperation with the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway; this effect was blocked by the ?7nAChR antagonists, ?-bungarotoxin and mecamylamine, and by specific siRNA-mediated STAT3 inhibition. In addition, we demonstrated that nicotine-mediated MUC4 upregulation promotes the PC cell migration through the activation of the downstream effectors, such as HER2, c-Src and FAK; this effect was attenuated by shRNA-mediated MUC4 abrogation, further implying that these nicotine-mediated pathological effects on PC cells are MUC4 dependent. Furthermore, the in vivo studies showed a marked increase in the mean pancreatic tumor weight (low dose (100?mg/m(3) total suspended particulate (TSP)), P=0.014; high dose (247?mg/m(3) TSP), P=0.02) and significant tumor metastasis to various distant organs in the CS-exposed mice, orthotopically implanted with luciferase-transfected PC cells, as compared with the sham controls. Moreover, the CS-exposed mice had elevated levels of serum cotinine (low dose, 155.88?35.96?ng/ml; high dose, 216.25?29.95?ng/ml) and increased MUC4, ?7nAChR and pSTAT3 expression in the pancreatic tumor tissues. Altogether, our findings revealed for the first time that CS upregulates the MUC4 mucin in PC via the ?7nAChR/JAK2/STAT3 downstream signaling cascade, thereby promoting metastasis of PC.

25743702	20150307	Genomic landscape of paediatric adrenocortical tumours.	Paediatric adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare malignancy with poor prognosis. Here we analyse 37 adrenocortical tumours (ACTs) by whole-genome, whole-exome and/or transcriptome sequencing. Most cases (91%) show loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 11p, with uniform selection against the maternal chromosome. IGF2 on chromosome 11p is overexpressed in 100% of the tumours. TP53 mutations and chromosome 17 LOH with selection against wild-type TP53 are observed in 28 ACTs (76%). Chromosomes 11p and 17 undergo copy-neutral LOH early during tumorigenesis, suggesting tumour-driver events. Additional genetic alterations include recurrent somatic mutations in ATRX and CTNNB1 and integration of human herpesvirus-6 in chromosome 11p. A dismal outcome is predicted by concomitant TP53 and ATRX mutations and associated genomic abnormalities, including massive structural variations and frequent background mutations. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the nature, timing and potential prognostic significance of key genetic alterations in paediatric ACT and outline a hypothetical model of paediatric adrenocortical tumorigenesis.

16839194	20060715	Wiggle-predicting functionally flexible regions from primary sequence.	The Wiggle series are support vector machine-based predictors that identify regions of functional flexibility using only protein sequence information. Functionally flexible regions are defined as regions that can adopt different conformational states and are assumed to be necessary for bioactivity. Many advances have been made in understanding the relationship between protein sequence and structure. This work contributes to those efforts by making strides to understand the relationship between protein sequence and flexibility. A coarse-grained protein dynamic modeling approach was used to generate the dataset required for support vector machine training. We define our regions of interest based on the participation of residues in correlated large-scale fluctuations. Even with this structure-based approach to computationally define regions of functional flexibility, predictors successfully extract sequence-flexibility relationships that have been experimentally confirmed to be functionally important. Thus, a sequence-based tool to identify flexible regions important for protein function has been created. The ability to identify functional flexibility using a sequence based approach complements structure-based definitions and will be especially useful for the large majority of proteins with unknown structures. The methodology offers promise to identify structural genomics targets amenable to crystallization and the possibility to engineer more flexible or rigid regions within proteins to modify their bioactivity.

23748506	20130611	Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of exenatide once weekly in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: an integrated analysis of the DURATION trials.	Exenatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist demonstrated to improve glycemic control with low hypoglycemia risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The Diabetes Therapy Utilization: Researching Changes in A1C, Weight, and Other Factors Through Intervention With Exenatide Once Weekly (DURATION) program comprised 6 randomized, comparator-controlled, 24- to 30-week trials of exenatide once weekly (EQW), an extended-release formulation. This post hoc analysis pooled data from patients taking EQW across 6 trials to assess efficacy and safety in a large, varied patient population. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population contained 1379 patients (baseline mean ? standard deviation glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] levels of 8.4% ? 1.1%) who were treated with EQW over the course of 24 to 30 weeks. Changes from baseline in efficacy parameters for the ITT population and a completer population (1195 patients with ? 22 weeks of exposure) were evaluated. The ITT population experienced significant reductions from baseline (least-squares mean [95% CI]) in HbA1c levels (-1.4% [-1.5% to -1.4%]), fasting blood glucose levels (-36 mg/dL [-38.4 mg/dL to -33.8 mg/dL]), and body weight (-2.5 kg [-2.8 kg to -2.3 kg]) after 24 to 30 weeks of EQW treatment. Reductions in HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels were observed across baseline HbA1c level strata; patients with higher baseline HbA1c levels experienced greater reductions. Treatment with EQW was associated with modest, significant reductions in blood pressure (systolic blood pressure, -2.8 mm Hg [-3.5 mm Hg to -2.1 mm Hg]; diastolic blood pressure, -0.8 mm Hg [-1.2 mm Hg to -0.4 mm Hg]), and fasting lipid levels (total cholesterol, -6.5 mg/dL [-8.2 mg/dL to -4.7 mg/dL]; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, -3.9 mg/dL [5.3 mg/dL to -2.5 mg/dL]; and triglyceride [geometric least-squares mean percent change (95% CI)], -6% [-8% to -4%] levels). Similar reductions were observed in the completer population. Exenatide once weekly was generally well tolerated. Transient, mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal treatment-emergent adverse events and injection-site treatment-emergent adverse events were reported most frequently, but were seldom treatment limiting. No major hypoglycemic events were observed; minor hypoglycemic events occurred infrequently in patients not using a sulfonylurea. This post hoc analysis of &gt; 1300 patients demonstrated that EQW was associated with significant reductions in HbA1c levels, body weight, blood pressure, and fasting lipid levels, with minimal hypoglycemia risk. Consistent with established safety profiles, EQW therapy was generally well tolerated. www.ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT00308139, NCT00637273, NCT00641056, NCT00676338, NCT00877890, NCT01029886.

23373431	20130205	Complement factor B polymorphism and the phenotype of early age-related macular degeneration.	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has been associated with a number of polymorphisms in genes in the complement pathway. We examined the potential genotype-phenotype correlation of complement factor B (CFB) (R32Q) polymorphisms in Caucasian patients with AMD. Data from a Central European cohort of 349 patients with early AMD in at least one eye were analyzed for potential associations of the CFB (R32Q/rs641153) polymorphism with phenotypic features of early AMD. Early AMD was classified according to the International Classification and Grading System into predominant drusen size, largest drusen, drusen covered surface, central or ring-like location, peripheral drusen, and pigmentary changes. The potential association with single nucleotide polymorphisms on CFB (R32Q/rs641153) was evaluated for all patients, corrected for age, sex, and the polymorphisms of CFH (Y402H) and ARMS2 (A69S). CFB (R32Q) polymorphisms showed a significant association with smaller drusen size (largest drusen ? 250 ?m, p = 0.021, predominant drusen ? 125 ?m, p = 0.016), with smaller surface covered by drusen (? 10%; p = 0.02), and with more frequent occurrence of peripheral drusen (p = 0.007). No association was found for pigmentary changes. The CFB (R32Q) polymorphism was associated with AMD characterized by small drusen only, and appeared to be protective of large drusen (OR 0.48/0.45) and of larger drusen covered area (OR 0.34). Furthermore, peripheral drusen were more frequently found (OR 2.27). This result supports the role of complement components and their polymorphisms in drusen formation and may enable a better understanding of AMD pathogenesis. 	Ophthalmic_Genet.	D016428 D013486

26167078	20150714	NOD2/CARD15 gene mutations in North Algerian patients with inflammatory bowel disease.	To analyse allelic frequency of NOD2 gene variants and to assess their correlation with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Algeria. We studied 132 unrelated patients diagnosed with IBD, 86 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 46 with ulcerative colitis (UC). Data was prospectively collected between January 2011 and December 2013. The demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded for all the patients. A group of 114 healthy unrelated individuals were selected as controls. All groups studied originated from different regions of North Algeria and confirmed the Algerian origin of their parents and grandparents. Informed and written consent was obtained from each of the participants. All individuals were genotyped for the three CD-associated NOD2 variants (p.Arg(702)Trp, p.Gly908Arg and p.Leu(1007)fsinsC mutations) using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Allele and genotype frequencies in patients and control subjects were compared by ?(2) test and Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were also estimated. Association analyses were performed to study the influence of these variants on IBD and on clinical phenotypes. The p.Arg(702)Trp mutation showed the highest frequency in CD patients (8%) compared to UC patients (2%) (P = 0.09, OR = 3.67, 95%CI: 0.48-4.87) and controls (5%) (P = 0.4, OR = 1.47, 95%CI: 0.65-3.31). In CD patients allelic frequencies of p.Gly908Arg and p.Leu(1007)fsinsC variants compared to HC were 3% vs 2% (P = 0.5, OR = 1.67, 95%CI: 0.44-6.34); 2% vs 1% (P = 0.4 OR = 2.69 95%CI: 0.48-14.87 respectively). In UC patients, allelic frequencies of p.Gly908Arg and p.Leu(1007)fsinsC variants compared to HC were 1% vs 2% (P = 1, OR = 1.62, 95%CI: 0.17-4.74) and 2% vs 1% (P = 0.32, OR = 0.39, 95%CI: 0.05-2.87). The total frequency of the mutated NOD2 chromosomes was higher in CD (13%), than in HC (8%) and UC (5%). In addition, NOD2 variants were linked to a particular clinical sub-phenotype in CD in this Algerian cohort. As expected, the three NOD2 variants showed a significant association with CD but did not reach statistical significance, despite the fact that the allele frequency of NOD2 variants was in the range found in most of the European populations. This might be due to the non-exposure of the NOD2 carriers to environmental factors, required for the expression of the disease. Further analyses are necessary to study genetic and environmental factors in IBD in the Algerian population, using larger patient groups. 	World_J._Gastroenterol.	D016428 D013485
17652639	20070727	Assessing heteroplasmic load in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy mutation 3460G-&gt;A/MT-ND1 with a real-time PCR quantitative approach.	To quantify the amount of the 3460G--&gt;A/ND1 point mutation responsible for Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, we developed a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method based on the SYBR Green assay and a new approach using the TaqMan assay. Both methods were based on the amplification refractory mutation system, comparing the heteroplasmic load quantified by restriction fragment length polymorphism in 15 Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy family members, with the results obtained using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction methods. The comparative evaluation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy from blood samples showed significant correlation between restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, real-time SYBR Green assay, and TaqMan assay. We validated the last method by measuring experimental samples composed by a known proportion of cloned plasmids containing either the wild-type or mutant sequence, giving a correlation coefficient of 0.999 (P &lt; 0.0001). The real-time amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction by TaqMan assay provides a rapid, reliable, sensitive, reproducible, and one-step quantitative method to detect heteroplasmic mutant mtDNA. This method allows the quantitation of a broad range of mutational load (up to 100%, down to 0.01%) on the basis of in vitro calibration, thus rendering the TaqMan assay suitable for the diagnostic analysis of heteroplasmic load in mtDNA-related disorders.

14703719	20040106	Neuroprotection assessment by topographic electroencephalographic analysis: effects of a sodium channel blocker to reduce polymorphic delta activity following ischaemic brain injury in rats.	The spatiotemporal electroencephalogram (EEG) pathology associated with brain injury was studied using high-resolution, 10-electrode cortical EEG mapping in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Using this model we evaluated the ability of the novel sodium channel blocker and neuroprotective agent RS100642 to resolve injury-induced EEG abnormalities as a measure of neurophysiological recovery from brain injury. The middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded for 1 h during which a dramatic loss of EEG power was measured over the injured cortex with near complete recovery upon reperfusion of blood to the MCA region in all rats. The resultant progression of the MCAo/reperfusion injury (6-72 h) included the appearance of diffuse polymorphic delta activity (PDA), as visually indicated by the presence of high-amplitude slow-waves recorded from both brain hemispheres. PDA was associated with large increases in EEG power, particularly evident in outer 'peri-infarct' regions of the ipsilateral parietal cortex as visualized using topographic EEG mapping. Post-injury treatment with RS100642 (1.0 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly reduced the PDA activity and attenuated the increase in EEG power throughout the course of the injury. These effects were associated with a reduction in brain infarct volume and improved neurological function. These methods of EEG analysis may be helpful tools to evaluate the physiological recovery of the brain from injury in humans following treatment with an experimental neuroprotective compound.

12355493	20021002	Association of mutations in the NALP3/CIAS1/PYPAF1 gene with a broad phenotype including recurrent fever, cold sensitivity, sensorineural deafness, and AA amyloidosis.	Familial cold urticaria (FCU) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) are dominantly inherited autoinflammatory disorders that cause rashes, fever, arthralgia, and in some subjects, AA amyloidosis, and have been mapped to chromosome 1q44. Sensorineural deafness in MWS, and provocation of symptoms by cold in FCU, are distinctive features. This study was undertaken to characterize the genetic basis of FCU, MWS, and an overlapping disorder in French Canadian, British, and Indian families, respectively. Mutations in the candidate gene NALP3, which has also been named CIAS1 and PYPAF1, were sought in the study families, in a British/Spanish patient with apparent sporadic MWS, and in matched population controls. Identified variants were sought in 50 European subjects with uncharacterized, apparently sporadic periodic fever syndromes, 48 subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and 19 subjects with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Point mutations, encoding putative protein variants R262W and L307P, were present in all affected members of the Indian and French Canadian families, respectively, but not in controls. The R262W variant was also present in the subject with sporadic MWS. The V200M variant was present in all affected members of the British family with MWS, in 2 of the 50 subjects with uncharacterized periodic fevers, and in 1 of 130 Caucasian and 2 of 48 Indian healthy controls. No mutations were identified among the subjects with RA or JIA. These findings confirm that mutations in the NALP3/CIAS1/PYPAF1 gene are associated with FCU and MWS, and that disease severity and clinical features may differ substantially within and between families. Analysis of this gene will improve classification of patients with inherited or apparently sporadic periodic fever syndromes. 	Arthritis_Rheum.	D016428 D013485
15748238	20050308	Insertion of a C in the exon 28 of integrin alphaIIb gene leading to a frameshift mutation is responsible for Glanzmann thrombasthenia in a Japanese case.	Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is a hereditary bleeding disorder caused by a qualitative or quantitative defect in the integrin alphaIIbbeta3. Our objective is to identify the gene mutation that resulted in GT. The patient was a 66-year-old male with a history of frequent bleeding. The expression levels of the integrin proteins in the platelets were determined by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. The sequences of genomic DNA and mRNA encoding for alphaIIb and beta3 were analyzed by the dye-terminator cycle sequencing method. For transfection experiments, expression vectors encoding for wild-type alphaIIb, mutated alphaIIb, beta3, green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion wild-type alphaIIb, GFP fusion mutated alphaIIb and DsRed fusion beta3 were constructed. These vectors were transfected to COS-7 cells, and the expression levels were determined. The alphaIIb protein was remarkably reduced in the patient's platelets, and gene analysis showed that the patient possessed compound heterozygous mutations in the alphaIIb gene. One was a C --&gt; G substitution at the splice acceptor site (- 3) of exon 26 (CAG --&gt;GAG) and the other was the insertion of an additional C at the region including six C bases between 2911 and 2916 in exon 28 (InsC). Transfection experiments using COS-7 cells showed that alphaIIb containing InsC had expressed and formed a complex with beta3, but had not been transported to the Golgi apparatus. In the present study the novel mutation InsC, leading to a frameshift that affects the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail, was found to be responsible for GT. 	J._Thromb._Haemost.

26246604	20150807	Division of labor among oxidoreductases: TMX1 preferentially acts on transmembrane polypeptides.	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site of maturation for secretory and membrane proteins in eukaryotic cells. The lumen of the mammalian ER contains &gt;20 members of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) superfamily, which ensure formation of the correct set of intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds as crucial, rate-limiting reactions of the protein folding process. Components of the PDI superfamily may also facilitate dislocation of misfolded polypeptides across the ER membrane for ER-associated degradation (ERAD). The reasons for the high redundancy of PDI family members and the substrate features required for preferential engagement of one or the other are poorly understood. Here we show that TMX1, one of the few transmembrane members of the family, forms functional complexes with the ER lectin calnexin and preferentially intervenes during maturation of cysteine-containing, membrane-associated proteins while ignoring the same cysteine-containing ectodomains if not anchored at the ER membrane. As such, TMX1 is the first example of a topology-specific client protein redox catalyst in living cells. 	Mol._Biol._Cell	D016428 D013485
19457267	20090522	A kinase-dead knock-in mutation in mTOR leads to early embryonic lethality and is dispensable for the immune system in heterozygous mice.	The mammalian target of rapamycin protein (mTOR) is an evolutionarily conserved kinase that regulates protein synthesis, cell cycle progression and proliferation in response to various environmental cues. As a critical downstream mediator of PI3K signaling, mTOR is important for lymphocyte development and function of mature T and B-cells. Most studies of mTOR in immune responses have relied on the use of pharmacological inhibitors, such as rapamycin. Rapamycin-FKBP12 complex exerts its immunosuppressive and anti-proliferative effect by binding outside the kinase domain of mTOR, and subsequently inhibiting downstream mTOR signaling. To determine the requirement for mTOR kinase activity in the immune system function, we generated knock-in mice carrying a mutation (D2338) in the catalytic domain of mTOR. While homozygous mTOR kd/kd embryos died before embryonic day 6.5, heterozygous mTOR+/kd mice appeared entirely normal and are fertile. mTOR +/kd mice exhibited normal T and B cell development and unaltered proliferative responses of splenocytes to IL-2 and TCR/CD28. In addition, heterozygousity for the mTOR kinase-dead allele did not sensitize T cells to rapamycin in a CD3-mediated proliferation assay. Unexpectedly, mTOR kinase activity towards its substrate 4E-BP1 was not decreased in hearts and livers from heterozygous animals. Altogether, our findings indicate that mTOR kinase activity is indispensable for the early development of mouse embryos. Moreover, a single wild type mTOR allele is sufficient to maintain normal postnatal growth and lymphocyte development and proliferation. 	BMC_Immunol.	D016428
14755216	20040203	Audiovestibular findings in patients with mitochondrial A1555G mutation.	The aims of this study were to explore the prevalence of the A1555G mutation among a group of Japanese patients and to assess the pathophysiology of the hearing impairment associated with the mutation. Genetic study and retrospective chart review. We screened for the mitochondrial DNA A1555G mutation in 138 unrelated Japanese deaf patients, including 63 sporadic cases and 75 familial cases with different patterns of inheritance. When available, patients carrying the mutation received audiovestibular examinations, including speech audiometry, distortion-product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) testing, electrocochleography (ECochG), and electronystagmography. One of 63 sporadic cases (1.6%) and 6 of 75 familial cases (8.0%) carried the A1555G mutation. Patients with the mutation and a familial history included two with autosomal recessive inheritance and four with maternal inheritance. In addition, two of six patients (33.3%) presenting with aminoglycoside-induced sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) were associated with the A1555G mutation. All but one of the patients carrying the mutation showed high-frequency SNHL. Distortion-product levels of DPOAE were reduced to the noise levels, suggesting the A1555G mutation caused cochlear deafness. Cochlear microphonics in ECochG showed elevation of the detection thresholds and corresponding audiometric thresholds. The ECochG data implied that patients with high-frequency SNHL had impairment of the cochlear hair cells that was most severe toward the basal turn. The electronystagmographic findings indicated no apparent vestibular dysfunction. Screening for the A1555G mutation, even in patients with idiopathic bilateral SNHL, likely would be useful for preventing further development and/or acceleration of the deafness.

21750672	20110714	Borrelia burgdorferi requires glycerol for maximum fitness during the tick phase of the enzootic cycle.	Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochetal agent of Lyme disease, is a vector-borne pathogen that cycles between a mammalian host and tick vector. This complex life cycle requires that the spirochete modulate its gene expression program to facilitate growth and maintenance in these diverse milieus. B. burgdorferi contains an operon that is predicted to encode proteins that would mediate the uptake and conversion of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Previous studies indicated that expression of the operon is elevated at 23?C and is repressed in the presence of the alternative sigma factor RpoS, suggesting that glycerol utilization may play an important role during the tick phase. This possibility was further explored in the current study by expression analysis and mutagenesis of glpD, a gene predicted to encode glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Transcript levels for glpD were significantly lower in mouse joints relative to their levels in ticks. Expression of GlpD protein was repressed in an RpoS-dependent manner during growth of spirochetes within dialysis membrane chambers implanted in rat peritoneal cavities. In medium supplemented with glycerol as the principal carbohydrate, wild-type B. burgdorferi grew to a significantly higher cell density than glpD mutant spirochetes during growth in vitro at 25?C. glpD mutant spirochetes were fully infectious in mice by either needle or tick inoculation. In contrast, glpD mutants grew to significantly lower densities than wild-type B. burgdorferi in nymphal ticks and displayed a replication defect in feeding nymphs. The findings suggest that B. burgdorferi undergoes a switch in carbohydrate utilization during the mammal to tick transition. Further, the results demonstrate that the ability to utilize glycerol as a carbohydrate source for glycolysis during the tick phase of the infectious cycle is critical for maximal B. burgdorferi fitness.

15848115	20050426	The two-component cell lysis genes holWMY and lysWMY of the Staphylococcus warneri M phage varphiWMY: cloning, sequencing, expression, and mutational analysis in Escherichia coli.	From the genome library of Staphylococcus warneri M, the two successive cell-lysis genes (holWMY and lytWMY) were cloned and characterized. The lytWMY gene encoded a protein (LysWMY), whose calculated molecular mass and pI were 54 kDa and 8.95, respectively. When overproduced in Escherichia coli, lysWMY directed a protein of 45 kDa (smaller than the predicted molecular mass), having N-terminal 13 residues identical with those predicted from DNA. Comparative analysis revealed that LysWMY significantly resembles the putative N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidases encoded by the staphylococcal phages phi11, 80 alpha, and Twort. Examination of modular organization of LysWMY identified three putative domains CHAP (for D-alanyl-glycyl endopeptidase), amidase (L-muramoyl-L-alanine amidase), and SH3 (cell wall recognition). Gene knockout analysis revealed that each of the two domains of CHAP and amidase was responsible for cell-lytic activity on a zymogram gel. Site-directed mutation of Cys29Ala, His92Ala, or Asn114Ala in the CHAP domain substantially reduced cell-lytic activity, suggesting that this Cys-His-Asn triad is crucial for the enzymatic function. On the other hand, the holWMY gene encoded a protein (HolWMY) with molecular mass and pI of 16 kDa and 4.36; this protein contained two potential transmembrane helices, resembling other predicted holins (a cytoplasmic membrane-disrupting protein) encoded by the S. aureus phage, phi11, 80 alpha, and Twort. Upon mitomycin C exposure of S. warneri M, a prophage (phiWMY) was induced and the virion was examined under electron microscopy. PCR amplification and sequencing revealed the presence of the holWMY-lysWMY genes in the phage genome. 	Gene	D016428
26138448	20150704	Regulation of p53 during senescence in normal human keratinocytes.	p53, the guardian of the genome, is a tumor suppressor protein and critical for the genomic integrity of the cells. Many studies have shown that intracellular level of p53 is enhanced during replicative senescence in normal fibroblasts, and the enhanced level of p53 is viewed as the cause of senescence. Here, we report that, unlike in normal fibroblasts, the level of intracellular p53 reduces during replicative senescence and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) in normal human keratinocytes (NHKs). We found that the intracellular p53 level was also decreased in age-dependent manner in normal human epithelial tissues. Senescent NHKs exhibited an enhanced level of p16(INK4A) , induced G2 cell cycle arrest, and lowered the p53 expression and transactivation activity. We found that low level of p53 in senescent NHKs was due to reduced transcription of p53. The methylation status at the p53 promoter was not altered during senescence, but senescent NHKs exhibited notably lower level of acetylated histone 3 (H3) at the p53 promoter in comparison with rapidly proliferating cells. Moreover, p53 knockdown in rapidly proliferating NHKs resulted in the disruption of fidelity in repaired DNA. Taken together, our study demonstrates that p53 level is diminished during replicative senescence and OIS and that such diminution is associated with H3 deacetylation at the p53 promoter. The reduced intracellular p53 level in keratinocytes of the elderly could be a contributing factor for more frequent development of epithelial cancer in the elderly because of the loss of genomic integrity of cells.

15937881	20050607	Combination of Dsb coexpression and an addition of sorbitol markedly enhanced soluble expression of single-chain Fv in Escherichia coli.	Many eukaryotic proteins have been produced successfully in Escherichia coli. However, not every gene can be expressed efficiently in this organism. Most proteins, especially those with multiple disulfide bonds, have been shown to form insoluble protein or inclusion body in E. coli. An inactive form of protein would require an in vitro refolding step to regain biological functions. In this study, we described the system for soluble expression of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) against hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep27scFv) by coexpressing Dsb protein and enhancing with medium additives. The results revealed that overexpression of DsbABCD protein showed marked effect on the soluble production of Hep27scFv, presumably facilitating correct folding. The optimal condition for soluble scFv expression could be obtained by adding 0.5M sorbitol to the culture medium. The competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) indicated that soluble scFv expressed by our method retains binding activity toward the same epitope on a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HCC-S102) recognized by intact antibody (Ab) (Hep27 Mab). Here, we report an effective method for soluble expression of scFv in E. coli by the Dsb coexpression system with the addition of sorbitol medium additive. This method might be applicable for high-yield soluble expression of proteins with multiple disulfide bonds. 	Biotechnol._Bioeng.	D016428 D013485
27601205	20160908	Common variants in FKBP5 gene and major depressive disorder (MDD) susceptibility: a comprehensive meta-analysis.	Previous studies have investigated the association between common variants in FKBP5 and MDD; however, the results remain inconsistent. In order to conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis of the association between FKBP5 variants and MDD risk, seven studies involving 26582 subjects, including 12491 cases with MDD and 14091 controls, were enrolled totally. Four common SNPs (rs1360780, rs4713916, rs3800373 and rs755658) with complete data from two or more studies were analyzed. In the total sample, there was no evidence of a significant association between MDD and any of the four SNPs using a random-effects model. However, after removing one heterogeneous German study, as indicated by sensitivity analysis, both the rs1360780 T-allele (Z?=?2.95, P?=?0.003, OR?=?1.06, 95% CI?=?1.02-1.11) and the rs3800373 C-allele (Z?=?3.05, P?=?0.002, OR?=?1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.12) were significantly associated with MDD in a fixed-effect model. Our study thus provides support for an association between specific FKBP5 genetic variants and MDD risk. Rs4713916 was not significantly associated with MDD; However, this analysis had limited statistical power and larger sample sizes are required to further validate this result. Future research should also investigate possible gender- and ethnicity-specific differences in the association between FKBP5 and MDD. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
25887797	20150419	Prevalence and correlates of HPV among women attending family-planning clinics in Thailand.	Cervical cancer is the most common cancer among women of reproductive age in Thailand. However, information on the prevalence and correlates of anogenital HPV infection in Thailand is sparse. HPV genotype information, reproductive factors, sexual behavior, other STI and clinical information, and cervical cytology and histology were assessed at enrollment among one thousand two hundred and fifty-six (n=1,256) HIV negative women aged 20-37 from Thailand enrolled in a prospective study of the natural history of HPV. The type-specific prevalence of HPV was estimated using cervical swab specimens from healthy women and women with a diagnosis of CIN 2/3 at baseline. Prevalence ratios (95% CI) were estimated using Poisson regression to quantify the association of demographic, behavioral, and clinical correlates with prevalent HPV infection. Overall, 307 (24.6%) and 175 (14.0%) of women were positive for any HPV type and any HR-HPV type, respectively; the most common types were 72, 52, 62, and 16. Among women diagnosed with CIN 2/3 at enrollment (n=11), the most prevalent HPV types were 52 and 16. In multivariate analysis, HPV prevalence at enrollment was higher among women with: long-term combined oral contraceptive use, a higher number of lifetime sexual partners, a prior Chlamydia infection, and a current diagnosis of Bacterial Vaginosis. The study findings provide important information that can be used in the evaluation of primary and secondary interventions designed to reduce the burden of cervical cancer in Thailand.

23577283	20130412	Sensitive and specific discrimination of pathogenic and nonpathogenic Escherichia coli using Raman spectroscopy-a comparison of two multivariate analysis techniques.	The determination of bacterial identity at the strain level is still a complex and time-consuming endeavor. In this study, visible wavelength spontaneous Raman spectroscopy has been used for the discrimination of four closely related Escherichia coli strains: pathogenic enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 and non-pathogenic E. coli C, E. coli Hfr K-12, and E. coli HF4714. Raman spectra from 600 to 2000 cm(-1) were analyzed with two multivariate chemometric techniques, principal component-discriminant function analysis and partial least squares-discriminant analysis, to determine optimal parameters for the discrimination of pathogenic E. coli from the non-pathogenic strains. Spectral preprocessing techniques such as smoothing with windows of various sizes and differentiation were investigated. The sensitivity and specificity of both techniques was in excess of 95%, determined by external testing of the chemometric models. This study suggests that spontaneous Raman spectroscopy with visible wavelength excitation is potentially useful for the rapid identification and classification of clinically-relevant bacteria at the strain level.

20420693	20100428	Downstream targets of methyl CpG binding protein 2 and their abnormal expression in the frontal cortex of the human Rett syndrome brain.	The Rett Syndrome (RTT) brain displays regional histopathology and volumetric reduction, with frontal cortex showing such abnormalities, whereas the occipital cortex is relatively less affected. Using microarrays and quantitative PCR, the mRNA expression profiles of these two neuroanatomical regions were compared in postmortem brain tissue from RTT patients and normal controls. A subset of genes was differentially expressed in the frontal cortex of RTT brains, some of which are known to be associated with neurological disorders (clusterin and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1) or are involved in synaptic vesicle cycling (dynamin 1). RNAi-mediated knockdown of MeCP2 in vitro, followed by further expression analysis demonstrated that the same direction of abnormal expression was recapitulated with MeCP2 knockdown, which for cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 was associated with a functional respiratory chain defect. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis showed that MeCP2 associated with the promoter regions of some of these genes suggesting that loss of MeCP2 function may be responsible for their overexpression. This study has shed more light on the subset of aberrantly expressed genes that result from MECP2 mutations. The mitochondrion has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of RTT, however it has not been at the forefront of RTT research interest since the discovery of MECP2 mutations. The functional consequence of the underexpression of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 indicates that this is an area that should be revisited. 	BMC_Neurosci	D016428 D013485
24470238	20140129	High prevalence of GPRC5A germline mutations in BRCA1-mutant breast cancer patients.	In a search for new breast cancer (BC) predisposing genes, we performed a whole exome sequencing analysis using six patient samples of familial BC and identified a germline inactivating mutation c.183delG [p. Arg61fs] in an orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPRC5A. An extended case-control study revealed a tenfold enrichment for this mutation in BC patients carrying the 5382insC allele of BRCA1, the major founder mutation in the Russian population, compared to wild-type BRCA1 BC cases [6/117 (5.1%) vs. 8/1578 (0.5%), p = 0.0002]. In mammary tumors (n = 60), the mRNA expression of GPRC5A significantly correlated with that of BRCA1 (p = 0.00018). In addition, the amount of GPRC5A transcript was significantly lower in BC obtained from BRCA1 mutation carriers (n = 17) compared to noncarriers (n = 93) (p = 0.026). Accordingly, a siRNA-mediated knockdown of either BRCA1 or GPRC5A in the MDA-MB-231 human BC cell line reduced expression of GPRC5A or BRCA1, respectively. Knockdown of GPRC5A also attenuated radiation-induced BRCA1- and RAD51-containing nuclear DNA repair foci. Taken together, these data suggest that GPRC5A is a modifier of BC risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers and reveals a functional interaction of these genes. 	Int._J._Cancer	D016428 D013485
9753479	19980930	D221 in thymidylate synthase controls conformation change, and thereby opening of the imidazolidine.	In thymidylate synthase (TS), the invariant residue Asp-221 provides the only side chain that hydrogen bonds to the pterin ring of the cofactor, 5,10-methylene-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate. All mutants of D221 except cysteine abolish activity. We have determined the crystal structures of two ternary complexes of the Escherichia coli mutant D221N. In a complex with dUMP and the antifolate 10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolate (CB3717), dUMP is covalently bound to the active site cysteine, as usual. CB3717, which has no imidazolidine ring, is also bound in the usual productive orientation, but is less ordered than in wild-type complexes. The side chain of Asn-221 still hydrogen bonds to N3 of the quinazoline ring of CB3717, which must be in the enol form. In contrast, the structure of D221N with 5-fluoro-dUMP and 5,10-methylene-5,6,7, 8-tetrahydrofolate shows the cofactor bound in two partially occupied, nonproductive binding sites. In both binding modes, the cofactor has a closed imidazolidine ring and adopts the solution conformation of the unbound cofactor. In one of the binding sites, the pterin ring is turned around such that Asn-221 hydrogen bonds to the unprotonated N1 instead of the protonated N3 of the cofactor. This orientation blocks the conformational change required for forming covalent ternary complexes. Taken together, the two crystal structures suggest that the hydrogen bond between the side chain of Asp-221 and N3 of the cofactor is most critical during the early steps of cofactor binding, where it enforces the correct orientation of the pterin ring. Proper orientation of the cofactor appears to be a prerequisite for opening the imidazolidine ring prior to formation of the covalent steady-state intermediate in catalysis.

12668681	20030402	Phosphorylation of the yeast phospholipid synthesis regulatory protein Opi1p by protein kinase A.	The Opi1p transcription factor plays a negative regulatory role in the expression of UASINO-containing genes involved in phospholipid synthesis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The phosphorylation of Opi1p by protein kinase A (cAMP-dependent protein kinase) was examined in this work. Using a maltose-binding protein-Opi1p fusion protein as a substrate, protein kinase A activity was time- and dose-dependent and dependent on the concentrations of Opi1p and ATP. Protein kinase A phosphorylated Opi1p on multiple serine residues. The synthetic peptides SCRQKSQPSE and SQVRESLLNL containing the protein kinase A motif for Ser31 and Ser251, respectively, within Opi1p were substrates for protein kinase A. Phosphorylation of S31A and S251A mutant maltose-binding protein-Opi1p fusion proteins by protein kinase A was reduced when compared with the wild type protein, and phosphopeptides present in wild type Opi1p were absent from the S31A and S251A mutant proteins. In vivo labeling experiments showed that the extent of phosphorylation of the S31A and S251A mutant proteins was reduced when compared with the wild type protein. The physiological consequence of the phosphorylation of Opi1p at Ser31 and Ser251 was examined by measuring the effects of the S31A and S251A mutations on the expression of the UASINO-containing gene INO1. The beta-galactosidase activity driven by an INO1-CYC-lacZ reporter gene in opi1Delta mutant cells expressing the S31A and S251A mutant Opi1p proteins was elevated 42 and 35%, respectively, in the absence of inositol and 55 and 52%, respectively, in the presence of inositol when compared with cells expressing wild type Opi1p. These data supported the conclusion that phosphorylation of Opi1p at Ser31 and Ser251 mediated the stimulation of the negative regulatory function of Opi1p on the expression of the INO1 gene.

26600318	20151125	The Molecular Epidemiology and Evolution of Murray Valley Encephalitis Virus: Recent Emergence of Distinct Sub-lineages of the Dominant Genotype 1.	Recent increased activity of the mosquito-borne Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) in Australia has renewed concerns regarding its potential to spread and cause disease. To better understand the genetic relationships between earlier and more recent circulating strains, patterns of virus movement, as well as the molecular basis of MVEV evolution, complete pre-membrane (prM) and Envelope (Env) genes were sequenced from sixty-six MVEV strains from different regions of the Australasian region, isolated over a sixty year period (1951-2011). Phylogenetic analyses indicated that, of the four recognized genotypes, only G1 and G2 are contemporary. G1 viruses were dominant over the sampling period and found across the known geographic range of MVEV. Two distinct sub-lineages of G1 were observed (1A and 1B). Although G1B strains have been isolated from across mainland Australia, Australian G1A strains have not been detected outside northwest Australia. Similarly, G2 is comprised of only Western Australian isolates from mosquitoes, suggesting G1B and G2 viruses have geographic or ecological restrictions. No evidence of recombination was found and a single amino acid substitution in the Env protein (S332G) was found to be under positive selection, while several others were found to be under directional evolution. Evolutionary analyses indicated that extant genotypes of MVEV began to diverge from a common ancestor approximately 200 years ago. G2 was the first genotype to diverge, followed by G3 and G4, and finally G1, from which subtypes G1A and G1B diverged between 1964 and 1994. The results of this study provides new insights into the genetic diversity and evolution of MVEV. The demonstration of co-circulation of all contemporary genetic lineages of MVEV in northwestern Australia, supports the contention that this region is the enzootic focus for this virus.

21980336	20111008	Isolation of a human anti-HIV gp41 membrane proximal region neutralizing antibody by antigen-specific single B cell sorting.	Broadly neutralizing antibodies are not commonly produced in HIV-1 infected individuals nor by experimental HIV-1 vaccines. When these antibodies do occur, it is important to be able to isolate and characterize them to provide clues for vaccine design. CAP206 is a South African subtype C HIV-1-infected individual previously shown to have broadly neutralizing plasma antibodies targeting the envelope gp41 distal membrane proximal external region (MPER). We have now used a fluoresceinated peptide tetramer antigen with specific cell sorting to isolate a human neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the HIV-1 envelope gp41 MPER. The isolated recombinant mAb, CAP206-CH12, utilized a portion of the distal MPER (HXB2 amino acid residues, 673-680) and neutralized a subset of HIV-1 pseudoviruses sensitive to CAP206 plasma antibodies. Interestingly, this mAb was polyreactive and used the same germ-line variable heavy (V(H)1-69) and variable kappa light chain (V(K)3-20) gene families as the prototype broadly neutralizing anti-MPER mAb, 4E10 (residues 672-680). These data indicate that there are multiple immunogenic targets in the C-terminus of the MPER of HIV-1 gp41 envelope and suggests that gp41 neutralizing epitopes may interact with a restricted set of naive B cells during HIV-1 infection.

11796370	20020118	Very low cefotaxime concentrations select for hypermutable Streptococcus pneumoniae populations.	A mixed culture of an hypermutable hexA Streptococcus pneumoniae mutant strain and its hexA(+) isogenic ancestor was challenged with low cefotaxime concentrations. Despite identical original cefotaxime MICs, the hexA mutant population was significantly selected at very low concentrations, and all of the tested selected variants harbored the Thr550--&gt;Ala mutation in pbp2x. Since cefotaxime selects hypermutators, the risk of secondary acquisition of antibiotic resistance is increased; as expected, the cefotaxime-resistant mutants had a mutation frequency 10 times higher in response to to ciprofloxacin. The present study presents a model (not necessarily reflecting the clinical setting) illustrating the risk of selection of mutators in the evolution of multiple resistance.

Local anesthetics interact with human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) channels via the aromatic amino acids Y652 and F656 in the S6 region. This study aimed to establish whether the residues T623, S624, and V625 residing deeper within the pore are also involved in HERG channel block by bupivacaine. In addition, the study aimed to further define the role of the aromatic residues Y652 and F656 in bupivacaine inhibition by mutating these residues to threonine. Alanine and threonine mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Electrophysiologic and pharmacologic properties of wild-type and mutant HERG channels were established using two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings of Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing HERG channels. Tail currents at -120 mV through HERG wild-type channels were inhibited with an IC50 value of 132 +/- 22 microm (n = 33). Bupivacaine (300 microm) inhibited wild-type tail currents by 62 +/- 12% (n = 7). Inhibition of HERG tail currents by bupivacaine (300 microm) was reduced by all mutations (P &lt; 0.001). The effect was largest for F656A (inhibition 5 +/- 2%, n = 6) in the lower S6 region and for T623A (inhibition 13 +/- 4%, n = 9) near the selectivity filter. Introducing threonine at positions 656 and 652 significantly reduced inhibition by bupivacaine compared with HERG wild type (P &lt; 0.001). The authors' results indicate that not only the aromatic residues Y652 and F656 but also residues residing deeper within the pore and close to the selectivity filter of HERG channels are involved in inhibition of HERG channels by the low-affinity blocker bupivacaine.

23029040	20121003	15-lipoxygenase metabolites of docosahexaenoic acid inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation and survival.	A 15-LOX, it is proposed, suppresses the growth of prostate cancer in part by converting arachidonic, eicosatrienoic, and/or eicosapentaenoic acids to n-6 hydroxy metabolites. These metabolites inhibit the proliferation of PC3, LNCaP, and DU145 prostate cancer cells but only at ?1-10 ?M. We show here that the 15-LOX metabolites of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), 17-hydroperoxy-, 17-hydroxy-, 10,17-dihydroxy-, and 7,17-dihydroxy-DHA inhibit the proliferation of these cells at ?0.001, 0.01, 1, and 1 ?M, respectively. By comparison, the corresponding 15-hydroperoxy, 15-hydroxy, 8,15-dihydroxy, and 5,15-dihydroxy metabolites of arachidonic acid as well as DHA itself require ?10-100 ?M to do this. Like DHA, the DHA metabolites a) induce PC3 cells to activate a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-? (PPAR?) reporter, express syndecan-1, and become apoptotic and b) are blocked from slowing cell proliferation by pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of PPAR? or syndecan-1. The DHA metabolites thus slow prostate cancer cell proliferation by engaging the PPAR?/syndecan-1 pathway of apoptosis and thereby may contribute to the prostate cancer-suppressing effects of not only 15-LOX but also dietary DHA.

16966159	20060913	Comparison of the urinary excretion time courses of pyrene-1,6-dione, pyrene-1,8-dione and 1-hydroxypyrene in rats intravenously exposed to pyrene.	The urinary excretion time courses of pyrene-1,6-dione (P16D), pyrene-1,8-dione (P18D) and 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) were compared in Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats. Groups of five male rats, of about 200 g of body weight, were injected intravenously with 0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50 micromol pyrene kg-1 of body weight. Urine was collected at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 30, 42 and 48 h post-dosing. Pyrene metabolites were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/fluorescence after enzymatic hydrolysis of the glucurono- and sulfo-conjugates, extraction on Sep-Pak C18 cartridges and, for the analysis of dione metabolites, derivatization to stable diacetoxypyrene molecules. Over the 48-h sampling period, on average 17.4-25.6% of the injected pyrene was excreted overall as P16D, 6.4-8.8% as P18D and 0.6-0.8% as 1-OHP in the urine of Sprague-Dawley rats. By comparison, on average 10.3-14.7% of the intravenous pyrene dose was recovered as P16D, 4.8-6.4% as P18D and 0.3-0.4% as 1-OHP in the urine of Wistar rats. In both strains of rats there was no clear effect of the dose on the 0-48-h cumulative urinary excretion of P18D and 1-OHP over the entire dose range, while the percentage of dose recovered overall as P16D in urine at the highest dose (50 micromol kg-1) was statistically lower than at the other doses. The 0-48-h cumulative percentage of pyrene dose excreted as metabolites in the urine of Sprague-Dawley rats was also significantly higher than in Wistar rats (p&lt;0.01) exposed under identical conditions. As for the urinary excretion-time courses of the different metabolites, for a given dose and strain of rats, excretion curves of P16D, P18D and 1-OHP generally evolved in parallel. There was also no clear effect of the dose on the excretion rate, thus half-life, of pyrene metabolites, except for P16D in Sprague-Dawley rats at the highest dose where elimination tended to be slower compared with the other doses (p&lt;0.01). The average first-order elimination half-life of P16D, P18D and 1-OHP was 4.0, 5.7 and 4.1 h, respectively, in Sprague-Dawley rats, and 5.1, 6.1 and 5.1 h, respectively, in Wistar rats (all doses combined but excluding the highest dose for P16D). This study showed the relative importance of metabolic pathways leading to diones compared with 1-OHP. These dioxygenated metabolites appear to be interesting biomarkers of pyrene exposure at environmentally and occupationally relevant doses. Their adequacy as biomarkers of human exposure has yet to be confirmed. 	Biomarkers	D003160 D016428
19155622	20090122	Interleukin-1alpha -889 C/T polymorphism in Turkish patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.	The polymorphism (rs1800587) in the 5'-flanking regulatory region at -889 of the interleukin-1alpha gene has been shown to be associated with inflammatory diseases and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the current study is to determine whether there is an association between the promoter region polymorphism of the interleukin-1alpha gene and late-onset AD in a cohort of Turkish patients. One hundred and four subjects with dementia of the Alzheimer type and 103 age-matched controls were genotyped according to the PCR with confronting two-pair primers method. Although the distribution of genotypes did not significantly differ (p = 0.107), the difference between allelic frequency was nearly significant according to a chi(2) test (p = 0.05) when the controls and patients were compared. Our results showed that there is no association between the -889 C/T transition on the interleukin-1alpha gene and late-onset AD in the Turkish population.

20865036	20100925	A conserved stem loop motif in the 5'untranslated region regulates transforming growth factor-?(1) translation.	Transforming growth factor-?(1) (TGF-?(1)) regulates cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival. The human TGF-?(1) transcript is inherently poorly translated, and translational activation has been documented in relation to several stimuli. In this paper, we have sought to identify in cis regulatory elements within the TGF-?(1) 5'Untranslated Region (5'UTR). In silico analysis predicted formation of stable secondary structure in a G/C-rich element between nucleotides +77 to +106, and demonstrated that this element is highly conserved across species. Circular dichroism spectroscopy confirmed the presence of secondary structure in this region. The proximal 5'UTR was inhibitory to translation in reporter gene experiments, and mutation of the secondary structure motif increased translational efficiency. Translational regulation of TGF-?(1) mRNA is linked to altered binding of YB-1 protein to its 5'UTR. Immunoprecipitation-RT-qPCR demonstrated a high basal association of YB-1 with TGF-?(1) mRNA. However, mutation of the secondary structure motif did not prevent interaction of YB-1 with the 5'UTR, suggesting that YB-1 binds to this region due to its G/C-rich composition, rather than a specific, sequence-dependent, binding site. These data identify a highly conserved element within the TGF-?(1) 5'UTR that forms stable secondary structure, and is responsible for the inherent low translation efficiency of this cytokine.

25348672	20141029	Central neurocytoma with ependymoma-like glial component.	We present the first case of central neurocytoma with a component suggesting ependymal-like differentiation as an unclassified glioneuronal tumor. The patient was a 26-year-old Japanese man with a brain tumor extending from the frontal wall of the bilateral lateral ventricles to the corpus callosum. Histologically, the tumor's neuronal component consisted of small bland looking cells with fine, delicate, neuropil-like processes forming a rosette structure; its glial component consisted of tumor cells with thick processes arranged around the thinly walled vessels, resulting in a perivascular pseudo-rosette formation and indicating ependymal-like differentiation. Immunohistochemically, the cytoplasm of the tumor cells with ependymal-like features was positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein and negative for synaptophysin, while the tumor component with neuronal features showed the opposite immunohistochemical staining pattern. Most of the tumor cells were positive for Olig2, but EMA, D2-40, CD99, p53, and mutant IDH-1 (R132H) were totally negative. Its Ki-67 labeling index was less than 1?%. Histologically, this tumor was diagnosed as a central neurocytoma with an ependymoma-like glial component, and its tumor grade was estimated at grade II. The tumor location, infiltrating the corpus callosum, and histology were distinctive and might represent a peculiar subtype of glioneuronal tumor. 	Brain_Tumor_Pathol	D002363 D016428
25353170	20141030	BioGPS descriptors for rational engineering of enzyme promiscuity and structure based bioinformatic analysis.	A new bioinformatic methodology was developed founded on the Unsupervised Pattern Cognition Analysis of GRID-based BioGPS descriptors (Global Positioning System in Biological Space). The procedure relies entirely on three-dimensional structure analysis of enzymes and does not stem from sequence or structure alignment. The BioGPS descriptors account for chemical, geometrical and physical-chemical features of enzymes and are able to describe comprehensively the active site of enzymes in terms of &quot;pre-organized environment&quot; able to stabilize the transition state of a given reaction. The efficiency of this new bioinformatic strategy was demonstrated by the consistent clustering of four different Ser hydrolases classes, which are characterized by the same active site organization but able to catalyze different reactions. The method was validated by considering, as a case study, the engineering of amidase activity into the scaffold of a lipase. The BioGPS tool predicted correctly the properties of lipase variants, as demonstrated by the projection of mutants inside the BioGPS &quot;roadmap&quot;. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
26105849	20150625	OP004. A SNP associated with susceptibility to preeclampsia near the inhibin, beta B gene, is also associated with cardiovascular disease risk traits.	It is well established that preeclampsia (PE) increases later life cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Consequently, PE has started to gain a role as an early screening criterion for CVD. PE and CVD share several risk factors, pathological features and metabolic abnormalities. These common antecedents have drawn attention to the likelihood of shared genetic susceptibility. Results from our previous PE GWAS identified a significant association with the rs7579169 SNP and maternal PE susceptibility (odds ratio 1.57). This SNP resides near the Inhibin, beta B (INHBB) gene on chromosome 2q14. Therefore, this study sought to interrogate this PE susceptibility SNP against several CVD risk traits in an effort to highlight additional empirical evidence of likely shared PE/CVD genetic mechanisms. The rs7579169 SNP was genotyped in a large independent Australian cohort rich in quantitative CVD risk traits; The Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. This cohort comprises of fasting blood samples from 1246 mothers and 1461 adolescents (14- and 17-year-old) and clinical parameters pertaining, but not limited, to anthropometric measures of adiposity and lipid-related measures. Genetic association analyses of rs7579169 against the Raine CVD-related risk traits were performed using the software package R. All statistical analyses assumed an additive model of gene action. Significant associations (p&lt;0.05) for rs7579169 with CVD-related risk traits were detected, both for the mothers and the adolescents. Specifically, the minor rs7579169-T allele (MAF 0.400) was found to be significantly associated with elevated levels of triglycerides, total and LDL cholesterol, a greater average waist:hip circumference ratio and a greater average hip circumference. We have previously identified rs7579169 located near the INHBB gene on chromosome 2q14 to significantly associate with maternal PE susceptibility. We have now demonstrated that this SNP is also significantly associated with several CVD-related risk traits in an independent Caucasian population. We hereby present additional empirical evidence of possible shared genetic risk factors underlying both PE and CVD related traits. 	Pregnancy_Hypertens	D016428
20737540	20100826	Dynamic regulation of sarcomeric actin filaments in striated muscle.	In striated muscle, the actin cytoskeleton is differentiated into myofibrils. Actin and myosin filaments are organized in sarcomeres and specialized for producing contractile forces. Regular arrangement of actin filaments with uniform length and polarity is critical for the contractile function. However, the mechanisms of assembly and maintenance of sarcomeric actin filaments in striated muscle are not completely understood. Live imaging of actin in striated muscle has revealed that actin subunits within sarcomeric actin filaments are dynamically exchanged without altering overall sarcomeric structures. A number of regulators for actin dynamics have been identified, and malfunction of these regulators often result in disorganization of myofibril structures or muscle diseases. Therefore, proper regulation of actin dynamics in striated muscle is critical for assembly and maintenance of functional myofibrils. Recent studies have suggested that both enhancers of actin dynamics and stabilizers of actin filaments are important for sarcomeric actin organization. Further investigation of the regulatory mechanism of actin dynamics in striated muscle should be a key to understanding how myofibrils develop and operate.

12941950	20030828	Conformational changes in the Ca2+-regulatory region from soybean calcium-dependent protein kinase-alpha: fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies.	Calcium-dependent protein kinases are key proteins involved in plant and protozoal Ca2+ signaling. These unique molecules include a calcium regulatory calmodulin-like domain (CLD), which binds to another small regulatory domain named the junction domain (JD). Both CLD and JD are part of the same polypeptide as the protein kinase domain. The CLD consists of N- and C-terminal lobes, each having two helix-loop-helix Ca2+-binding motifs. In this study, fluorescence resonance energy transfer using a series of Trp and Cys site-directed mutants was undertaken to probe the relative motions of the two lobes of CLD between the apo- and Ca2+-saturated forms, as well as bound to a peptide encoding the JD sequence. Using an IAEDANS-modified Cys, a total of 15 Trp --&gt; Cys distances were measured in these three states from the five donor-acceptor combinations F334W-Cys436, L371W-Cys436, L403W-Cys436, F334W-L403C, and L371W-L403C. Consistent with recently reported NMR diffusion measurements and with 1H,15N heteronuclear correlation NMR spectra, the distances derived from fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements in apoCLD indicate partial unfolding and a subsequent contraction on binding Ca2+, which is maintained on addition of the JD peptide. Interpretation of the distances suggests that the Ca2+-saturated form is open with the two lobes sitting side-by-side although highly flexible. The transition to the JD-CLD state appears to be accompanied by a rotation of the N- and C-terminal domains with respect to each other inducing a slightly more closed overall complex. The observed differences between the behavior of CLD and the well studied related protein calmodulin are likely because of different physiological requirements for activation in vivo. 	J._Biol._Chem.

27927959	20161209	Vectored Intracerebral Immunization with the Anti-Tau Monoclonal Antibody PHF1 Markedly Reduces Tau Pathology in Mutant Tau Transgenic Mice.	Passive immunization with anti-tau monoclonal antibodies has been shown by several laboratories to reduce age-dependent tau pathology and neurodegeneration in mutant tau transgenic mice. These studies have used repeated high weekly doses of various tau antibodies administered systemically for several months and have reported reduced tau pathology of ?40-50% in various brain regions. Here we show that direct intrahippocampal administration of the adeno-associated virus (AAV)-vectored anti-phospho-tau antibody PHF1 to P301S tau transgenic mice results in high and durable antibody expression, primarily in neurons. Hippocampal antibody levels achieved after AAV delivery were ?50-fold more than those reported following repeated systemic administration. In contrast to systemic passive immunization, we observed markedly reduced (?80-90%) hippocampal insoluble pathological tau species and neurofibrillary tangles following a single dose of AAV-vectored PHF1 compared with mice treated with an AAV-IgG control vector. Moreover, the hippocampal atrophy observed in untreated P301S mice was fully rescued by treatment with the AAV-vectored PHF1 antibody. Vectored passive immunotherapy with an anti-tau monoclonal antibody may represent a viable therapeutic strategy for treating or preventing such tauopathies as frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, or Alzheimer's disease. We have used an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector to deliver the genes encoding an anti-phospho-tau monoclonal antibody, PHF1, directly to the brain of mice that develop neurodegeneration due to a tau mutation that causes frontotemporal dementia (FTD). When administered systemically, PHF1 has been shown to modestly reduce tau pathology and neurodegeneration. Since such antibodies do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, we used an AAV vector to deliver antibody directly to the hippocampus and observed much higher antibody levels and a much greater reduction in tau pathology. Using AAV vectors to deliver antibodies like PHF1 directly to brain may constitute a novel approach to treating various neurodegenerative disorders, such as FTD and Alzheimer's disease. 	J._Neurosci.

19771526	20090923	Cloning, purification and bioactivity assay of human CD28 single-chain antibody in Escherichia coli.	Engineered single chain antibodies have become a powerful source of immunotherapy against a wide range of diseases. Here, we present the generation of human CD28 single-chain antibody gene (CD28-ScFv), which contained variable fragments of heavy chain and light chain (VH and VL) of the anti-CD28 antibody, and a linking peptide (Gly4Ser)3 inserted in the middle of VH and VL. The fused gene CD28-ScFv was successfully expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells and confirmed by western blotting assay. The molecular weight of CD28-ScFv was 43 kDa and the major fraction was expressed as an insoluble body. By dissolving the insoluble bodies, renaturing in vitro and purifying with a Ni-NTA affinity column, highly purified expression products of CD28-ScFv were obtained. This product could recognize and bind to CD28+ positive T cells. The proliferation capacity of peripheral blood T cells was increased by purified CD28-ScFv. In this study, we improved orthodox renaturing techniques by combining the dilution renaturation with phase gradient dialysis. With this new method, highly purified CD28-ScFv products were developed and biological activity of the products was similar to that of the mouse monoclonal anti-human CD28 antibody.

24786474	20140503	Structural investigations into the stereochemistry and activity of a phenylalanine-2,3-aminomutase from Taxus chinensis.	Phenylalanine-2,3-aminomutase (PAM) from Taxus chinensis, a 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO)-dependent enzyme, catalyzes the reversible conversion of (S)-?-phenylalanine into (R)-?-phenylalanine via trans-cinnamic acid. The enzyme also catalyzes the direct addition of ammonia to trans-cinnamic acid, a reaction that can be used for the preparation of ?-amino acids, which occur as frequent constituents of bioactive compounds. Different hypotheses have been formulated to explain the stereochemistry of the PAM-catalyzed reaction, but structural evidence for these hypotheses is lacking. Furthermore, it remains unclear how the PAM MIO group is formed from the three-amino acid (A-S-G) sequence motif. For these reasons, we elucidated PAM three-dimensional (3D) structures with a bound (R)-?-phenylalanine analogue and with bound trans-cinnamic acid. In addition, 3D structures of the (inactive) Y322A and N231A mutants of PAM were elucidated, which were found to be MIO-less. We conclude that the stereochemistry of the PAM-catalyzed reaction originates from the enzyme's ability to bind trans-cinnamic acid in two different orientations, with either the si,si face or the re,re face directed toward the MIO group, as evidenced by two distinct carboxylate binding modes. The results also suggest that the N231 side chain promotes MIO group formation by increasing the nucleophilicity of the G177 N atom through acidification of the amide proton.

19605524	20090717	Agonist-biased signaling via proteinase activated receptor-2: differential activation of calcium and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.	We evaluated the ability of different trypsin-revealed tethered ligand (TL) sequences of rat proteinase-activated receptor 2 (rPAR(2)) and the corresponding soluble TL-derived agonist peptides to trigger agonist-biased signaling. To do so, we mutated the proteolytically revealed TL sequence of rPAR(2) and examined the impact on stimulating intracellular calcium transients and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. The TL receptor mutants, rPAR(2)-Leu(37)Ser(38), rPAR(2)-Ala(37-38), and rPAR(2)-Ala(39-42) were compared with the trypsin-revealed wild-type rPAR(2) TL sequence, S(37)LIGRL(42)-. Upon trypsin activation, all constructs stimulated MAP kinase signaling, but only the wt-rPAR(2) and rPAR(2)-Ala(39-42) triggered calcium signaling. Furthermore, the TL-derived synthetic peptide SLAAAA-NH2 failed to cause PAR(2)-mediated calcium signaling but did activate MAP kinase, whereas SLIGRL-NH2 triggered both calcium and MAP kinase signaling by all receptors. The peptides AAIGRL-NH2 and LSIGRL-NH2 triggered neither calcium nor MAP kinase signals. Neither rPAR(2)-Ala(37-38) nor rPAR(2)-Leu(37)Ser(38) constructs recruited beta-arrestins-1 or -2 in response to trypsin stimulation, whereas both beta-arrestins were recruited to these mutants by SLIGRL-NH2. The lack of trypsin-triggered beta-arrestin interactions correlated with impaired trypsin-activated TL-mutant receptor internalization. Trypsin-stimulated MAP kinase activation by the TL-mutated receptors was not blocked by inhibitors of Galpha(i) (pertussis toxin), Galpha(q) [N-cyclohexyl-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,4-dihydro-6-methylindeno[1,2-c]pyrazole-3-carboxamide (GP2A)], Src kinase [4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]-pyrimidine (PP1)], or the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor [4-(3'-chloroanilino)-6,7-dimethoxy-quinazoline (AG1478)], but was inhibited by the Rho-kinase inhibitor (R)-(+)-trans-N-(4-pyridyl)-4-(1-aminoethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide, 2HCl (Y27362). The data indicate that the proteolytically revealed TL sequence(s) and the mode of its presentation to the receptor (tethered versus soluble) can confer biased signaling by PAR(2), its arrestin recruitment, and its internalization. Thus, PAR(2) can signal to multiple pathways that are differentially triggered by distinct proteinase-revealed TLs or by synthetic signal-selective activating peptides. 	Mol._Pharmacol.

1989676	19910129	Site-directed alteration of four active-site residues of a pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase.	Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to examine the chemical roles of four active-site residues in histidine decarboxylase (HDC) from Lactobacillus 30a. This protein is known to undergo an autoactivation in which chain cleavage between serines-81 and -82 leads to cofactor (pyruvoyl) formation at position 82. Conversion of Ser-81 to Ala virtually eliminates productive cleavage. It is proposed that the residue plays a key role in stabilizing the transition state of the chain cleavage reaction. Conversion of Phe-83 to Met renders the proenzyme thermally less stable than wild type and appears to slightly increase the rate of autoactivation. The Km value for histidine is increased about 8-fold, confirming crystallographic evidence that Phe-83 is involved in substrate binding. Both wild-type and F83M enzymes show constant Km and steadily increasing kcat values as a function of temperature. Lys-155 and Tyr-262, by virtue of their positions in the active site of HDC, have been proposed to possibly play specific roles in either autoactivation or catalysis by active HDC. Conversion to Gln and Phe respectively suggests that these residues have real but minor roles in those processes. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485 D013487
23024788	20121002	Elevated serum ferritin is associated with reduced survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the loss of motor neurons. Its etiology remains unknown, but several hypothesis have been raised to explain motor neuron death, including oxidative stress. Dysregulation of cellular iron metabolism can lead to increased oxidative stress, and existing data argue for a role of iron metabolism in ALS pathophysiology. We performed a retrospective analysis of iron metabolism (IM) variables (serum levels of iron, transferrin, ferritin, and TSC for Transferrin Saturation Coefficient) in a cohort of 694 ALS patients and 297 healthy controls. Serum ferritin levels and TSC were higher, whereas serum transferrin levels were lower in ALS patients than controls. In addition, patients with a high level serum ferritin had a shorter survival time compared to those with low level serum ferritin (618 days versus 921 days for men subgroup; p?=?.007). Site of onset and ALS-FRS score were not associated with IM variables. This study suggests that ALS patients may have increased iron storage, as measured by increased serum ferritin and TSC. Elevated serum ferritin may also have a deleterious impact on survival in ALS. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428
15135265	20040512	Prognostic value of plasma interleukin-6 concentrations and the -174 G &gt; C and -572 G &gt; C promoter polymorphisms of the interleukin-6 gene in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with thrombolysis.	The present study was performed to investigate the prognostic value of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations and promoter polymorphisms of the IL-6 gene in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with thrombolysis. Two hundred and eight patients with myocardial infarction treated with thrombolysis were included and followed for 2-5 years. Plasma concentrations of IL-6 were measured at admission and 48 h after admission. Genotyping for the -174 G &gt; C and -572 G &gt; C IL-6 polymorphisms was performed. Patients who died of cardiovascular causes or suffered a new myocardial infarction during follow-up had increased plasma concentrations of IL-6 at admission (P &lt; 0.002) and at 48 h after admission (P &lt; 0.05) compared with patients who had an uneventful course. IL-6 levels above the median at admission were independently associated with a worse prognosis. No associations were found between IL-6 levels and the promoter polymorphisms. The -174 G &gt; C polymorphism was not associated with cardiovascular death or a new myocardial infarction, whereas the -572 G &gt; C polymorphism showed a borderline significant increase in risk (P = 0.05) in univariate analysis. In conclusion, the early IL-6 response during myocardial infarction is associated with prognosis in patients with Q-wave myocardial infarction, whereas no associations were found between IL-6 genotype and phenotype.

22649300	20120601	Preconcentration of trace amounts of Pb(II) ions without any chelating agent by using magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles prior to ETAAS determination.	This work investigates the potential of magnetic Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles as an adsorbent for separation and preconcentration of trace amounts of lead from water samples prior to electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS) determination. No chemical modifier is required in graphite furnace. Pb(II) ion was adsorbed on magnetic Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles in the pH range of 5.5-6.5, and then magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were easily separated from the aqueous solution by applying an external magnetic field; so, no filtration or centrifugation was necessary. After extraction and collection of MNPs, the analyte ions were eluted using HNO(3) 1.0 mol L(-1). Several factors that may affect the preconcentration and extraction process, such as pH, type, and volume of eluent, amount of MNPs, sample volume, salting out effect, and interference ions were studied and optimized. Under the best experimental conditions, linearity was maintained between 0.005-0.5 ng mL(-1). Detection limits for lead were 0.8 ng L(-1) based on 3S(b). The relative standard deviation of seven replicate measurements of 0.05 ng mL(-1) of Pb(II) ions was 3.8%.

Chronic inflammation has been strongly associated with tumor progression, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that E3 ligase Itch and deubiquitinase Cyld formed a complex via interaction through 'WW-PPXY' motifs. The Itch-Cyld complex sequentially cleaved Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains and catalyzed Lys48-linked ubiquitination on the kinase Tak1 to terminate inflammatory signaling via tumor necrosis factor. Reconstitution of wild-type Cyld but not the mutant Cyld(Y485A), which cannot associate with Itch, blocked sustained Tak1 activation and proinflammatory cytokine production by Cyld(-/-) bone marrow-derived macrophages. Deficiency in Itch or Cyld led to chronic production of tumor-promoting cytokines by tumor-associated macrophages and aggressive growth of lung carcinoma. Thus, we have identified an Itch-Cyld-mediated regulatory mechanism in innate inflammatory cells. 	Nat._Immunol.	D016428 D052061
26621748	20151202	Ack1 is a dopamine transporter endocytic brake that rescues a trafficking-dysregulated ADHD coding variant.	The dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) facilitates high-affinity presynaptic DA reuptake that temporally and spatially constrains DA neurotransmission. Aberrant DAT function is implicated in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder. DAT is a major psychostimulant target, and psychostimulant reward strictly requires binding to DAT. DAT function is acutely modulated by dynamic membrane trafficking at the presynaptic terminal and a PKC-sensitive negative endocytic mechanism, or &quot;endocytic brake,&quot; controls DAT plasma membrane stability. However, the molecular basis for the DAT endocytic brake is unknown, and it is unknown whether this braking mechanism is unique to DAT or common to monoamine transporters. Here, we report that the cdc42-activated, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Ack1, is a DAT endocytic brake that stabilizes DAT at the plasma membrane and is released in response to PKC activation. Pharmacologic and shRNA-mediated Ack1 silencing enhanced basal DAT internalization and blocked PKC-stimulated DAT internalization, but had no effects on SERT endocytosis. Both cdc42 activation and PKC stimulation converge on Ack1 to control Ack1 activity and DAT endocytic capacity, and Ack1 inactivation is required for stimulated DAT internalization downstream of PKC activation. Moreover, constitutive Ack1 activation is sufficient to rescue the gain-of-function endocytic phenotype exhibited by the ADHD DAT coding variant, R615C. These findings reveal a unique endocytic control switch that is highly specific for DAT. Moreover, the ability to rescue the DAT(R615C) coding variant suggests that manipulating DAT trafficking mechanisms may be a potential therapeutic approach to correct DAT coding variants that exhibit trafficking dysregulation.

11833529	20020209	Microbial diversity of a mesophilic hydrogen-producing sludge.	A hydrogen-producing sludge degraded 99% of glucose at 36 degrees C and pH 5.5, producing a methane-free biogas (comprising 64% hydrogen) and an effluent comprising mostly butyrate, acetate, and ethanol. The yield was 0.26 l H2 g(-1) glucose and the production rate per gram of volatile suspended solids was 4.6 1 H2 day(-1). A 16S rDNA library was constructed from the sludge for microbial species determination. A total of 96 clones were selected for plasmids recovery, screened by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and sequenced for rDNA. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the rDNA sequences, 64.6% of all the clones were affiliated with three Clostridium species (Clostridiaceae), 18.8% with Enterobacteriaceae, and 3.1% with Streptococcus bovis (Streptococcaceae). The remaining 13.5% belonged to eight operational taxonomic units, the affiliations of which were not identified. 	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485

The title compound, C(13)H(14)N(2)O(3)?0.5H(2)O, was synthesized by the condensation of methyl 3-amino-propionate with 3-trichloro-acetyl-indole. The two organic mol-ecules in the asymmetric unit are both close to planar, with r.m.s. deviations from the best fit plane through all of the non-H atoms of 0.004?(2)?? for mol-ecule A and 0.006?(1)?? for mol-ecule B. Also, the five- and six-membered rings of the indole systems are inclined at 1.67?(8) and 1.50?(8)? in mol-ecules A and B, respectively. In the crystal structure, the organic molecules are connected by inter-molecular N-H?O hydrogen bonds, forming chains. O-H?O and N-H?O hydrogen-bond inter-actions involving the water molecules inter-link these chains, forming double chains approximately parallel to the a axis.

26588898	20151122	HIV-1 functional cure: will the dream come true?	The reservoir of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a long-lived pool of latently infected cells harboring replication-competent viruses, is the major obstacle to curing acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Although the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) can successfully suppress HIV-1 viremia and significantly delay the progression of the disease, it cannot eliminate the viral reservoir and the patient must continue to take anti-viral medicines for life. Currently, the appearance of the 'Berlin patient', the 'Boston patients', and the 'Mississippi baby' have inspired many therapeutic strategies for HIV-1 aimed at curing efforts. However, the specific eradication of viral latency and the recovery and optimization of the HIV-1-specific immune surveillance are major challenges to achieving such a cure. Here, we summarize recent studies addressing the mechanisms underlying the viral latency and define two categories of viral reservoir: 'shallow' and 'deep'. We also present the current strategies and recent advances in the development of a functional cure for HIV-1, focusing on full/partial replacement of the immune system, 'shock and kill', and 'permanent silencing' approaches.

25456137	20141203	The RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 controls innate immune responses to RNA.	The ADAR RNA-editing enzymes deaminate adenosine bases to inosines in cellular RNAs. Aberrant interferon expression occurs in patients in whom ADAR1 mutations cause Aicardi-Gouti?res syndrome (AGS) or dystonia arising from striatal neurodegeneration. Adar1 mutant mouse embryos show aberrant interferon induction and die by embryonic day E12.5. We demonstrate that Adar1 embryonic lethality is rescued to live birth in Adar1; Mavs double mutants in which the antiviral interferon induction response to cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is prevented. Aberrant immune responses in Adar1 mutant mouse embryo fibroblasts are dramatically reduced by restoring the expression of editing-active cytoplasmic ADARs. We propose that inosine in cellular RNA inhibits antiviral inflammatory and interferon responses by altering RLR interactions. Transfecting dsRNA oligonucleotides containing inosine-uracil base pairs into Adar1 mutant mouse embryo fibroblasts reduces the aberrant innate immune response. ADAR1 mutations causing AGS affect the activity of the interferon-inducible cytoplasmic isoform more severely than the nuclear isoform. 	Cell_Rep	D016428 D013485
17804462	20070907	Two-tier approach for the detection of alpha-galactosidase A deficiency in a predominantly female haemodialysis population.	Fabry's disease (AFD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease, resulting from a deficiency in alpha-galactosidase A (AGALA). Untreated, this leads to precocious failure of vital organ function and death. As enzyme replacement therapy is available, it is of vital importance that affected individuals can be traced. We set up a screening in the Flemish haemodialysis population using a two-tier approach. The first tier was a determination of alpha-galactosidase A activity using a dried blood spot on filter paper, in the second tier, patients with the lowest alpha-galactosidase levels were further subjected to mutation analysis of the GLA gene. 1284 patients (1047 women, 237 men) were evaluated for inclusion, eliminating patients with definite renal diagnoses. Total 922 patients (71.8 %) were screened (742 women, 180 men). Fifty seven patients were subjected to further genetic analysis. Three GLA mutation carriers were identified: two apparently nonrelated female patients carry the missense mutation p.Ala143Thr (c.427G &gt; A), a missense mutation p.Trp236Arg (c.706T &gt; C) was identified in a man. While the male patient had been clinically diagnosed with AFD, the female patients had remained unrecognized. Additional family based screening resulted in the identification of nine mutation carriers (four males and five females). We demonstrated that the prevalence of GLA mutation carriers in our haemodialysis population is 0.3%. Our results show that the proposed approach accurately detects AFD patients. We conclude that screening for AFD in high risk populations is a cost-effective, technically feasible and clinically valuable objective. 	Nephrol._Dial._Transplant.	D016428 D013485
25970626	20150514	FBXO44-Mediated Degradation of RGS2 Protein Uniquely Depends on a Cullin 4B/DDB1 Complex.	The ubiquitin-proteasome system for protein degradation plays a major role in regulating cell function and many signaling proteins are tightly controlled by this mechanism. Among these, Regulator of G Protein Signaling 2 (RGS2) is a target for rapid proteasomal degradation, however, the specific enzymes involved are not known. Using a genomic siRNA screening approach, we identified a novel E3 ligase complex containing cullin 4B (CUL4B), DNA damage binding protein 1 (DDB1) and F-box protein 44 (FBXO44) that mediates RGS2 protein degradation. While the more typical F-box partners CUL1 and Skp1 can bind FBXO44, that E3 ligase complex does not bind RGS2 and is not involved in RGS2 degradation. These observations define an unexpected DDB1/CUL4B-containing FBXO44 E3 ligase complex. Pharmacological targeting of this mechanism provides a novel therapeutic approach to hypertension, anxiety, and other diseases associated with RGS2 dysregulation. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061 D013485
15819676	20050412	Fetal-neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia and unexpected Glanzmann thrombasthenia carrier: report of two cases.	Discrepancy between phenotyping and genotyping during the investigation of maternofetal alloimmunization leads to the identification of defects on genes encoding membrane glycoproteins (GPs) IIb and IIIa. Human platelet (PLT) alloantigen (HPA)-1 and -3 PLT phenotypes and genotypes were performed by use of, respectively, the monoclonal antibody-specific immobilization of PLT antigens and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-sequence-specific priming techniques for up to 2400 families with thrombocytopenic newborn. When a discrepancy was detected, genomic DNA from the mother was amplified for coding sequences of either the GPIIb or GPIIIa genes. The genetic abnormality responsible for the discrepancy was determined by direct sequencing of the PCR products. Two cases of discrepancy were identified among 2400 families tested. In the first case, Mother L, serologically assigned as HPA-1b-homozygous, was genotyped HPA-1a/1b. In the second case, Mother S, serogically defined HPA-3b-homozygous, was genotyped HPA-3a/3b. DNA sequence analysis revealed for Mother L a T(1447)--&gt;C a point mutation within exon 10 of the GPIIIa gene and for Mother S a C(480)--&gt;G point mutation within exon 4 of the GPIIb gene. These mutations reported in Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) patients account for nonexpression of the implicated allele on the PLT surface. Thus, the mothers are GT carriers. Alloantibodies, hallmarks of immunization, were not detected in the maternal serum samples. Although this situation is rarely encountered, it is important to combine phenotyping and genotyping to avoid false PLT typing assignation and erroneous diagnosis when alloimmunization might occur.

20824059	20100909	The peptide sequence of diacyl lipopeptides determines dendritic cell TLR2-mediated NK activation.	Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocyte effectors that are activated to control certain microbial infections and tumors. Many NK-activating and regulating receptors are involved in regulating NK cell function. In addition, activation of na?ve NK cells is fundamentally triggered by cytokines or myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) in various modes. In this study, we synthesized 16 S-[2,3-bis(palmitoyl)propyl]cysteine (Pam2Cys) lipopeptides with sequences designed from lipoproteins of Staphylococcus aureus, and assessed their functional properties using mouse (C57BL/6) bone marrow-derived DC (BMDC) and NK cells. NK cell activation was evaluated by three criteria: IFN-gamma production, up-regulation of NK activation markers and cytokines, and NK target (B16D8 cell) cytotoxicity. The diacylated lipopeptides acted as TLR2 ligands, inducing up-regulation of CD25/CD69/CD86, IL-6, and IL-12p40, which represent maturation of BMDC. Strikingly, the Pam2Cys lipopeptides induced mouse NK cell activation based on these criteria. Cell-cell contact by Pam2Cys peptide-stimulated BMDC and NK cells rather than soluble mediators released by stimulated BMDC induced activation of NK cells. For most lipopeptides, the BMDC TLR2/MyD88 pathway was responsible for driving NK activation, while some slightly induced direct activation of NK cells via the TLR2/MyD88 pathway in NK cells. The potential for NK activation was critically regulated by the peptide primary sequence. Hydrophobic or proline-containing sequences proximal to the N-terminal lipid moiety interfered with the ability of lipopeptides to induce BMDC-mediated NK activation. This mode of NK activation is distinctly different from that induced by polyI:C, which is closely associated with type I IFN-inducing pathways of BMDC. These results imply that the MyD88 pathway of BMDC governs an alternative NK-activating pathway in which the peptide sequence of TLR2-agonistic lipopeptides critically affects the potential for NK activation.

23719599	20130531	Association of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene polymorphism and increased serum VEGF concentration with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.	BACKGROUND &amp;AIM: Pancreatic cancer is related to high mortality rate. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has a strong influence in tumor-related angiogenesis having association with the grade of angiogenesis and the prognosis of different solid tumors including pancreatic cancer. The present study was aimed to analyze the genotype and haplotype distribution of VEGF gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),?-460T/C,?+405G/C,?+936C/T, in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma from South India, and the effect of these SNPs on serum VEGF level. Total 80?patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 87 controls were recruited. The genotype of VEGF gene polymorphisms was determined in both patients and controls using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The serum VEGF protein was estimated by standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The genotype,?+405G/G of VEGF gene showed a significant association with the patients with?pancreatic adenocarcinoma (P?=?0.012, Odds ratio: 2.133), whereas no significant difference was found in the genotype distribution of SNPs,?-460C/T and?+936C/T between patient and control groups (P?&gt;?0.05). Serum VEGF level was found to be significantly high in patients (1315.10?pg/Ml, SD???230.79) when?compared to controls (591.35?pg/mL, SD???92.48) (P?&lt;?0.0001), which showed a strong genotype-phenotype correlation between genotype?+405G/G and serum VEGF level. Further, the haplotype C-G-T showed a strong association with the disease, and no specific haplotype was associated with increased serum VEGF level. The polymorphism,?+405G/C but not?-460T/C and?+936C/T, of VEGF gene is strongly associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and this SNP has significant influence on serum VEGF level.

21092188	20101125	miRNA-145 inhibits non-small cell lung cancer cell proliferation by targeting c-Myc.	MicroRNAs are important gene regulators that potentially play a profound role in tumorigenesis. Increasing evidence indicates that miR-145 is a tumor suppressor capable of inhibiting breast and colon cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. However, the biological function of miR-145 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is largely unknown. In colon cancer cells, c-Myc is a confirmed direct target for miR-145. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of miR-145 and c-Myc on proliferation of NSCLC cells, using the NSCLC cell lines A549 and H23 as models. We determined the expression level of miR-145 in tumor tissues relative to adjacent non-tumor tissues, and in NSCLC cell lines relative to non-malignant lung cells. Downregulation of miR-145 was seen in tumor tissues and the two NSCLC cell lines by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. MTT and focus formation assays were conducted to measure cell proliferation rates. Cell growth was inhibited and the G1/S transition was blocked by miR-145 in transfection assays of A549 and H23 cells. We further showed that c-Myc was a direct target for miR-145. Introduction of miR-145 dramatically suppressed the c-Myc/eIF4E pathway, which was demonstrated to be crucial for cell proliferation in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, we found that CDK4 was regulated by miR-145 in cell cycle control. Taken together, our study results demonstrate that miR-145 inhibits proliferation of NSCLC cells through c-Myc. Increasing miR-145 expression may provide a novel approach for the treatment of NSCLC. 	J._Exp._Clin._Cancer_Res.	D016428 D013485
17998016	20071114	Association between a beta2-adrenergic receptor polymorphism and elite endurance performance.	The Arg16Gly single nucleotide polymorphism of the human beta(2)-adrenoceptor (ADRB2) gene was evaluated in a case-control study that included 313 white male elite endurance athletes and 297 white male sedentary controls (SCs) recruited in a multicenter project from North America, Finland, and Germany. The groups were matched by country of origin. The elite endurance athletes were required to have a maximum oxygen uptake &gt; or = 75 mL.kg(-1).min(-1) (mean [SD], 79.0 [3.5]), whereas SC subjects had to be sedentary with a measured maximum oxygen uptake &lt; or = 50 mL.kg(-1).min(-1) (40.1 [7.0]). Polymerase chain reaction technique was used to amplify the single nucleotide polymorphism-containing region in codon 16 of the ADRB2 gene. ADRB2 genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both groups. Genotypes did not differ between countries or sports of the athletes. The chi(2) analysis for the genotype distribution showed a significant difference between the 2 cohorts (P = .030), suggesting a positive association between the tested Arg16Gly polymorphism and endurance performance. Comparing carriers vs non-carriers for the 2 alleles, an excess of Gly allele carriers was seen in the SC group (P = .009), indicating an unfavorable effect of the Gly allele with respect to the performance status. In conclusion, we found suggestive evidence that the Arg16Gly polymorphism in the gene encoding for the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor may associate with endurance performance status in white men.

12579405	20030213	Renin-angiotensin gene polymorphism in children with uremia and essential hypertension.	The M235T polymorphism of the angiotensinogen (ANG) gene, the I/D polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene, and the A1166C polymorphism of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) gene were identified in 70 patients with end-stage renal disease [20 pediatric ESRD, aged 14.9+/-3.1, years blood pressure (BP) 139+/-14/91+/-13 mmHg, 50 adult ESRD, aged 48.7+/-18.7 years, BP 149.1+/-24/96.9+/-12 mmHg], 35 with juvenile essential hypertension (JEHT, aged 14.4+/-2.7 years, 24-h mean BP 135.37+/-7.37/72.4+/-7.68 mmHg), 130 adult healthy normotensive controls (aged 34.9+/-8.1 years, BP 117.8+/-8.7/78.7+/-8.5 mmHg), and 20 pediatric controls (aged 13.2+/-1.2 years, BP 109+/-6.5/71+/-5.9 mmHg). The ACE gene polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction and the ANG and AT1R gene polymorphisms by single-step LightCycler technology. The ACE gene distribution of the Hungarian controls did not differ from the results of the other Caucasian populations. In JEHT and pediatric ESRD patients, the MT genotype of ANG was more frequent than in controls (JEHT 80%, pediatric ESRD 74% versus controls 50%, P&lt;0.02). The DD genotype of ACE was over-represented in pediatric ESRD compared with controls (ESRD 45% versus controls 22%, P&lt;0.05). There was a non-significant increase in the CC genotype frequency of AT1R in adult patients with ESRD compared with controls. In conclusion, there was an increased frequency of the ACE DD genotype in pediatric ESRD, which could be a genetic risk factor for the development of ESRD. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in MT genotype frequency of ANG M235T polymorphism in pediatric ESRD and JEHT. The role of AT1R gene polymorphism needs further investigation.

24184873	20131105	Vitamin E isoforms as modulators of lung inflammation.	Asthma and allergic diseases are complex conditions caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Clinical studies suggest a number of protective dietary factors for asthma, including vitamin E. However, studies of vitamin E in allergy commonly result in seemingly conflicting outcomes. Recent work indicates that allergic inflammation is inhibited by supplementation with the purified natural vitamin E isoform ?-tocopherol but elevated by the isoform ?-tocopherol when administered at physiological tissue concentrations. In this review, we discuss opposing regulatory effects of ?-tocopherol and ?-tocopherol on allergic lung inflammation in clinical trials and in animal studies. A better understanding of the differential regulation of inflammation by isoforms of vitamin E provides a basis towards the design of clinical studies and diets that would effectively modulate inflammatory pathways in lung disease.

18665162	20080731	Dietary intake of selected B vitamins in relation to risk of major cancers in women.	Although folic acid has been investigated for its potential to inhibit carcinogenesis, few epidemiologic studies have assessed the effects of intake of thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin, which may reduce cancer risk by acting as cofactors in folate metabolism or by other mechanisms. Using data from a large cohort of Canadian women, we examined the association of dietary intake of these nutrients, as well as intake of folate, methionine, and alcohol, with cancers of the breast, endometrium, ovary, colorectum, and lung ascertained during an average of 16.4 years of follow-up. After exclusions, the following numbers of incident cases were available for analysis: breast, n=2491; endometrium, n=426; ovary, n=264; colorectum, n=617; and lung, n=358. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate risk of each cancer with individual nutrients and to explore possible effect modification by combinations of nutrients on cancer risk. Few significant associations of intake of individual B vitamins with the five cancers were observed. Alcohol consumption showed a modest positive association with breast cancer risk but not with risk of the other cancers. There was no evidence of effect modification among the nutrients. This large study provides little support for an association of dietary intake thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, or methionine with five major cancers in women.

10582878	19991203	Expanded-spectrum nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors inhibit clinically relevant mutant variants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.	A research program targeted toward the identification of expanded-spectrum nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors which possess increased potency toward K103N-containing mutant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and which maintain pharmacokinetics consistent with once-a-day dosing has resulted in the identification of the 4-cyclopropylalkynyl-4-trifluoromethyl-3, 4-dihydro-2(1H)quinazolinones DPC 961 and DPC 963 and the 4-cyclopropylalkenyl-4-trifluoromethyl-3, 4-dihydro-2(1H)quinazolinones DPC 082 and DPC 083 for clinical development. DPC 961, DPC 963, DPC 082, and DPC 083 all exhibit low-nanomolar potency toward wild-type virus, K103N and L100I single-mutation variants, and many multiply amino acid-substituted HIV type 1 mutants. This high degree of potency is combined with a high degree of oral bioavailability, as demonstrated in rhesus monkeys and chimpanzees, and with plasma serum protein binding that can result in significant free levels of drug.

24206662	20131112	Mineralocorticoid receptor phosphorylation regulates ligand binding and renal response to volume depletion and hyperkalemia.	Nuclear receptors are transcription factors that regulate diverse cellular processes. In canonical activation, ligand availability is sufficient to produce receptor binding, entraining downstream signaling. The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is normally activated by aldosterone, which is produced in both volume depletion and hyperkalemia, states that require different homeostatic responses. We report phosphorylation at S843 in the MR ligand-binding domain that prevents ligand binding and activation. In kidney, MR(S843-P) is found exclusively in intercalated cells of the distal nephron. In volume depletion, angiotensin II and WNK4 signaling decrease MR(S843-P) levels, whereas hyperkalemia increases MR(S843-P). Dephosphorylation of MR(S843-P) results in aldosterone-dependent increases of the intercalated cell apical proton pump and Cl(-)/HCO3(-) exchangers, increasing Cl(-) reabsorption and promoting increased plasma volume while inhibiting K(+) secretion. These findings reveal a mechanism regulating nuclear hormone receptor activity and implicate selective MR activation in intercalated cells in the distinct adaptive responses to volume depletion and hyperkalemia.

8504493	19930501	Autocrine production of TGF-alpha and TGF-beta during tumour progression of rat oral keratinocytes.	This study describes a new technique to separate transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) from culture supernatants using ion exchange chromatography; assays of competitive inhibition of ligand binding were used to quantify the amount of growth factor. The method was simple, inexpensive and did not require large volumes of culture medium. The autocrine production of TGF-alpha and TGF-beta was examined in oral keratinocyte cell lines derived from the palatal and lingual mucosa of rats painted with the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide (4NQO). Escape from cellular senescence (immortality) was associated with a marked increase in TGF-alpha production (cell line R2P) but tumour progression, as reflected by the development of anchorage independence in agarose gels and tumorigenicity in athymic mice, did not result in a consistent increase or decrease of TGF-alpha production compared to normals. Four cell lines (R8AP, R1T, R3T, R1P), with different functional cellular phenotypes, produced two to three times more TGF-alpha than normals. TGF-alpha production was inversely correlated to epidermal growth factor cell surface receptor expression. The autocrine production of TGF-beta was variable with the majority of cell lines producing markedly little TGF-beta; three cell lines (R4T, R8BP, R9T) produced more TGF-beta than normals. The production of TGF-beta was unrelated to tumour progression, the expression of TGF-beta cell surface receptors or TGF-alpha production. The results indicate that the autocrine production of TGF-alpha and TGF-beta are not accurate markers of tumour progression in the rat 4NQO model of oral carcinogenesis.

23718892	20130531	Differential effects of the ?-adrenoceptor blockers carvedilol and metoprolol on SQT1- and SQT2-mutant channels.	N588K-KCNH2 and V307L-KCNQ1 mutations lead to a gain-of-function of IKr and IKs thus causing short-QT syndromes (SQT1, SQT2). Combined pharmacotherapies using K(+) -channel-blockers and ?-blockers are effective in SQTS. Since ?-blockers can block IKr and IKs , we aimed at determining carvedilol's and metoprolol's electrophysiological effects on N588K-KCNH2 and V307L-KCNQ1 channels. Wild-type (WT)-KCNH2, WT-KCNQ1 and mutant N588K-KCNH2 and V307L-KCNQ1 channels were expressed in CHO-K1 or HEK-293T cells and IKs and IKr were recorded at baseline and during ?-blocker exposure. Carvedilol (10 ?M) reduced IKs tail in WT- and V307L-KCNQ1 by 36.5 ? 5% and 18.6 ? 9% (P &lt; 0.05). IC50 values were 16.3 ?M (WT) and 46.1 ?M (V307L), indicating a 2.8-fold decrease in carvedilol's IKs -blocking potency in V307L-KCNQ1. Carvedilol's (1 ?M) inhibition of the IKr tail was attenuated in N588K-KCNH2 (4.5 ? 3% vs 50.3 ? 4%, WT, P &lt; 0.001) with IC50 values of 2.8 ?M (WT) and 25.4 ?M (N588K). Carvedilol's IKr end-pulse inhibition, however, was increased in N588K-KCNH2 (10 ?M, 60.7 ? 6% vs 36.5 ? 5%, WT, P &lt; 0.01). Metoprolol (100 ?M) reduced IKr end-pulse by 0.23 ? 3% (WT) and 74.1 ? 7% (N588K, P &lt; 0.05), IKr tail by 32.9 ? 10% (WT) and 68.8 ? 7% (N588K, P &lt; 0.05), and reduced IKs end-pulse by 18.3 ? 5% (WT) and 57.1 ? 11% (V307L, P &lt; 0.05) and IKs tail by 3.3 ? 1% (WT) and 45.1 ? 13 % (V307L, P &lt; 0.05), indicating an increased sensitivity to metoprolol in SQT mutated channels. N588K-KCNH2 and V307L-KCNQ1 mutations decrease carvedilol's inhibition of the IKs or IKr tail but increase carvedilol's IKr end-pulse inhibition and metoprolol's inhibition of tail and end-pulse currents. These different effects on SQT1 and SQT2 mutated channels should be considered when using ?-blocker therapy in SQTS patients. 	J._Cardiovasc._Electrophysiol.	D003160 D016428 D013485
21358803	20110302	CCR3 and choroidal neovascularization.	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the elderly in industrialized countries. The &quot;wet&quot; AMD, characterized by the development of choroidal neovacularization (CNV), could result in rapid and severe loss of central vision. The critical role of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) in CNV development has been established and VEGF-A neutralization has become the standard care for wet AMD. Recently, CCR3 was reported to play an important role in CNV development and that CCR3 targeting was reported to be superior to VEGF-A targeting in CNV suppression. We investigated the role of CCR3 in CNV development using the Matrigel induced CNV and found that in both rats and mice, CNV was well-developed in the control eyes as well as in eyes treated with CCR3 antagonist SB328437 or CCR3 neutralizing antibodies. No statistically significant difference in CNV areas was found between the control and SB328437 or CCR3-ab treated eyes. Immunostaining showed no specific expression of CCR3 in or near CNV. In contrast, both VEGF-A neutralizing antibodies and rapamycin significantly suppressed CNV. These results indicate that CCR3 plays no significant role in CNV development and question the therapeutic approach of CCR3 targeting to suppress CNV. On the other hand, our data support the therapeutic strategies of VEGF-A and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) targeting for CNV. 	PLoS_ONE	D023362 D016428 D052061 D013485 D013486
26169941	20150715	Blocking neutrophil diapedesis prevents hemorrhage during thrombocytopenia.	Spontaneous organ hemorrhage is the major complication in thrombocytopenia with a potential fatal outcome. However, the exact mechanisms regulating vascular integrity are still unknown. Here, we demonstrate that neutrophils recruited to inflammatory sites are the cellular culprits inducing thrombocytopenic tissue hemorrhage. Exposure of thrombocytopenic mice to UVB light provokes cutaneous petechial bleeding. This phenomenon is also observed in immune-thrombocytopenic patients when tested for UVB tolerance. Mechanistically, we show, analyzing several inflammatory models, that it is neutrophil diapedesis through the endothelial barrier that is responsible for the bleeding defect. First, bleeding is triggered by neutrophil-mediated mechanisms, which act downstream of capturing, adhesion, and crawling on the blood vessel wall and require G?i signaling in neutrophils. Second, mutating Y731 in the cytoplasmic tail of VE-cadherin, known to selectively affect leukocyte diapedesis, but not the induction of vascular permeability, attenuates bleeding. Third, and in line with this, simply destabilizing endothelial junctions by histamine did not trigger bleeding. We conclude that specifically targeting neutrophil diapedesis through the endothelial barrier may represent a new therapeutic avenue to prevent fatal bleeding in immune-thrombocytopenic patients.

25885222	20150418	Understanding the molecular basis of EGFR kinase domain/MIG-6 peptide recognition complex using computational analyses.	Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling plays a major role in biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Since the over-expression of EGFR causes human cancers, EGFR is an attractive drug target. A tumor suppressor endogenous protein, MIG-6, is known to suppress EGFR over-expression by binding to the C-lobe of EGFR kinase. Thus, this C-lobe of the EGFR kinase is a potential new target for EGFR kinase activity inhibition. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and binding free energy calculations were used to investigate the protein-peptide interactions between EGFR kinase and a 27-residue peptide derived from MIG-6_s1 segment (residues 336-362). These 27 residues of MIG-6_s1 were modeled from the published MIG-6 X-ray structure. The binding dynamics were detailed by applying the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method to predict the binding free energy. Both van der Waals interactions and non-polar solvation were favorable driving forces for binding process. Six residues of EGFR kinase and eight residues of MIG-6_s1 residues were shown to be responsible for interface binding in which we investigated per residue free energy decomposition and the results from the computational alanine scanning approach. These residues also had higher hydrogen bond occupancies than other residues at the binding interface. The results from the aforementioned calculations reasonably agreed with the previous experimental mutagenesis studies. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate the interactions of MIG-6_s1 to EGFR kinase domain. Our study provides an insight into such interactions that is useful in guiding the design of novel anticancer therapeutics. The information on our modelled peptide interface with EGFR kinase could be a possible candidate for an EGFR dimerization inhibitor. 	BMC_Bioinformatics	D016428 D013486
23278580	20130103	SOX1 antibodies in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and screening for small cell lung carcinoma.	Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular synapse. About half of LEMS patients have an associated small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), which is usually detected after diagnosis of LEMS. This short review summarizes clinical and serological markers shown to predict the presence of SCLC in LEMS patients. SOX1 antibodies are a specific marker for SCLC-LEMS but they are also found in SCLC patients without paraneoplastic neurological syndromes. No relation to any clinical characteristic or survival effect has been found for SOX1-positive patients. Several clinical markers also discriminate between SCLC-LEMS and nontumor LEMS. Detailed analysis of these clinical and demographic characteristics from two independent patient cohorts has led to development of the DELTA-P score. This prediction model has provided for a simple clinical tool to indicate the presence of SCLC early in the course of the disease. The DELTA-P score can be used to guide tumor screening in individual patients. 	Ann._N._Y._Acad._Sci.	D016428 D013485 D016454
16622703	20060420	Single skeletal muscle fiber behavior after a quick stretch in young and older men: a possible explanation of the relative preservation of eccentric force in old age.	The origins of the smaller age-related decrease in eccentric force compared to isometric and concentric conditions in vivo remain unclear. Could this originate from contractile elements of muscle cells? The main intent of the current investigation was to assess the force behavior of muscle cells with aging, during lengthening. Chemically skinned single muscle fibers (n=235) from m. vastus lateralis of six young (mean age 31.6 years) and six older men (mean age 66.1 years) were maximally activated with pCa 4.5 at 15 degrees C. Maximal isometric force and cross-sectional area were measured allowing the calculation of the tension (T (0)). A quick stretch (2 nm per half-sarcomere length) was applied and caused an immediate increase in tension followed by a decrease and a secondary delayed and transient rise in tension (phase 3); finally, the tension recovered a steady state value (phase 4). The tension enhancements during phase 3 (DeltaT (3)) and phase 4 (DeltaT (4)) were evaluated. The myosin heavy-chain isoform composition of each single fiber was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. DeltaT (3) and DeltaT (4) were preserved in older men for both type I and IIa fibers despite a reduction in T (0). Therefore, the age-related preservation of the tension increments after a quick stretch in single muscle fibers could explain in part the smaller decrease in force during eccentric contractions compared to isometric and concentric conditions in vivo with aging usually observed.

23653632	20130509	Neuronal inputs and outputs of aging and longevity.	An animal's survival strongly depends on its ability to maintain homeostasis in response to the changing quality of its external and internal environment. This is achieved through intracellular and intercellular communication within and among different tissues. One of the organ systems that plays a major role in this communication and the maintenance of homeostasis is the nervous system. Here we highlight different aspects of the neuronal inputs and outputs of pathways that affect aging and longevity. Accordingly, we discuss how sensory inputs influence homeostasis and lifespan through the modulation of different types of neuronal signals, which reflects the complexity of the environmental cues that affect physiology. We also describe feedback, compensatory, and feed-forward mechanisms in these longevity-modulating pathways that are necessary for homeostasis. Finally, we consider the temporal requirements for these neuronal processes and the potential role of natural genetic variation in shaping the neurobiology of aging. 	Front_Genet	D016428
21041916	20101103	Improving the prediction of virological response to tipranavir: the development and validation of a tipranavir-weighted mutation score.	The purpose of this study was to develop a tipranavir-weighted mutation score that provides guidance to treating physicians on the relative effect of specific protease mutations on tipranavir activity. Weights were developed using data from RESIST tipranavir-treated patients based on regressions of virological response at weeks 8 and 24, accounting for baseline CD4(+) T-cell count and background regimen activity. The resulting weighted score and cutoffs were validated using a set of cohort patients external to the tipranavir development programme. Response rates were tabulated for the new weighted score and compared with other tipranavir mutation scores used in clinical practice. The final weights were 74P, 82L/T, 83D and 47V (+4), 58E and 84V (+3), 36I, 43T and 54A/M/V (+2), 10V, 33F and 46L (+1), 24I and 76V (-2), 50L/V (-4), and 54L (-6). Tipranavir-weighted score susceptibility categories were susceptible ?3, partially susceptible &gt;3 but ?10, and resistant ?11. Week 48 response rates for RESIST patients were 34.6%, 15.9% and 5.9%, respectively. Using the external cohort data (n=150), the weighted score was highly associated with week 8 viral load reduction (P=0.0027). Only one other score achieved statistical significance. The tipranavir-weighted score developed and externally validated here, in three datasets representing a broad population of treatment-experienced patients, can be used to make clinical decisions about whether to consider tipranavir in a treatment-experienced patient who has limited treatment options.

27378695	20160706	Exome genotyping arrays to identify rare and low frequency variants associated with epithelial ovarian cancer risk.	Rare and low frequency variants are not well covered in most germline genotyping arrays and are understudied in relation to epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) risk. To address this gap, we used genotyping arrays targeting rarer protein-coding variation in 8,165 EOC cases and 11,619 controls from the international Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC). Pooled association analyses were conducted at the variant and gene level for 98,543 variants directly genotyped through two exome genotyping projects. Only common variants that represent or are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with previously-identified signals at established loci reached traditional thresholds for exome-wide significance (P?&lt;?5.0???10?-?7). One of the most significant signals (Pall histologies?=?1.01???10?-?13;Pserous?=?3.54???10?-?14) occurred at 3q25.31 for rs62273959, a missense variant mapping to the LEKR1 gene that is in LD (r2?=?0.90) with a previously identified 'best hit' (rs7651446) mapping to an intron of TIPARP. Suggestive associations (5.0???10?-?5?&gt;?P?5.0 ?10?-?7) were detected for rare and low-frequency variants at 16 novel loci. Four rare missense variants were identified (ACTBL2 rs73757391 (5q11.2), BTD rs200337373 (3p25.1), KRT13 rs150321809 (17q21.2) and MC2R rs104894658 (18p11.21)), but only MC2R rs104894668 had a large effect size (OR?=?9.66). Genes most strongly associated with EOC risk included ACTBL2 (PAML?=?3.23 ? 10?-?5; PSKAT-o?=?9.23???10?-?4) and KRT13 (PAML?=?1.67 ? 10?-?4; PSKAT-o?=?1.07???10?-?5), reaffirming variant-level analysis. In summary, this large study identified several rare and low-frequency variants and genes that may contribute to EOC susceptibility, albeit with possible small effects. Future studies that integrate epidemiology, sequencing, and functional assays are needed to further unravel the unexplained heritability and biology of this disease. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.

1276164	19760423	Metabolic aspects of the secretion of stored compounds from blood platelets. IV. Effects of ionophore X537A on washed platelets.	1. X537A at concentrations below 10 muM can liberate platelet serotonin from washed human platelets without inducing the platelet release reaction. Up to 100% of serotonin preabsorbed by the platelets can be liberated before initiation of the release reaction. 2. Concentrations of X537A above 10muM initiate the platelet release reaction, with a maximum release of adenine nucleotides and platelet factor 4 antigen comparable to that obtained with 1.25 units thrombin/ml. 3. The changes in ATP metabolism at the concentration necessary for X537A-induced release are more profound than those in platelets exposed to concentrations of thrombin or A23187 giving the same degree of release, and approach those seen with high concentrations of A23187. At concentrations where serotonin is liberated but no adenine nucleotide or platelet factor 4 antigen is released, short time incubation causes no change in the level of metabolic ATP.

25066259	20140729	Retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration in a patient with ataxia with isolated vitamin E deficiency with a novel c.717 del C mutation in the TTPA gene.	Ataxia with isolated vitamin E deficiency (AVED) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a mutation in the ?-tocopherol transfer protein gene (TTPA). The clinical features of the disease resemble Friedreich's ataxia. However, AVED is associated with low plasma vitamin E levels, which results in compromised antioxidant function. Dysregulation of this lipid-soluble antioxidant vitamin plays a major role in the neurodegeneration observed in AVED. Some AVED patients experience decreased visual acuity. Retinitis pigmentosa is thought to be the main cause of this visual impairment. Although antioxidant levels are important for the prevention of macular degeneration, there have been no reports of macular degeneration in AVED. Here, we describe a patient with AVED with progressive macular degeneration, who carried a novel truncating mutation-c.717 del C (p.D239EfsX25)-in exon 5 of the TTPA gene. These findings suggest that this newly identified mutation results in severely low serum vitamin E levels, which may be associated with the development of retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration.

15914859	20050526	Full restoration of viral fitness by multiple compensatory co-mutations in the nucleoprotein of influenza A virus cytotoxic T-lymphocyte escape mutants.	Amino acid substitutions have been identified in the influenza A virus nucleoprotein that are associated with escape from recognition by virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). One of these is the arginine-to-glycine substitution at position 384 (R384G). This substitution alone, however, is detrimental to viral fitness, which is overcome in part by the functionally compensating co-mutation E375G. Here, the effect on viral fitness of four other co-mutations associated with R384G was investigated by using plasmid-driven rescue of mutant viruses. Whilst none of these alternative co-mutations alone compensated functionally for the detrimental effect of the R384G substitution, the M239V substitution improved viral fitness of viruses containing 375G and 384R. The nucleoprotein displays unexpected flexibility to overcome functional constraints imposed by CTL epitope sequences, allowing influenza viruses to escape from specific CTLs. 	J._Gen._Virol.

20697431	20100811	EphA3 functions are regulated by collaborating phosphotyrosine residues.	Ephrin ligands interact with Eph receptors to regulate a wide variety of biological and pathological processes. Recent studies have identified several downstream pathways that mediate the functions of these receptors. Activation of the receptors by ephrin binding results in the phosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine residues. These phosphorylated residues serve as docking sites for many of the downstream signaling pathways. However, the relative contributions of different phosphotyrosine residues remain undefined. In the present study, we mutated each individual tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of EphA3 receptor and studied the effects using cell migration, process retraction, and growth cone collapse assays. Stimulation of the EphA3 receptor with ephrin-A5 inhibits 293A cell migration, reduces NG108-15 cell neurite outgrowth, and induces growth cone collapse in hippocampal neurons. Mutation of either Y602 or Y779 alone partially decreases EphA3-induced responses. Full abrogation can only be achieved with mutations of both Y602 and Y779. These observations suggest a collaborative model of different downstream pathways. 	Cell_Res.	D016428 D052061 D013486
24022875	20130912	Genetic variant of AKT1 and AKTIP associated with late-onset depression in a Brazilian population.	Examine the association between polymorphisms in the AKT1 and AKTIP genes and late-onset depression (LOD). Major depressive disorder is one of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric diseases. LOD is a disorder that starts after 65?years old. AKT1 is a downstream enzyme that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurotransmitter-related disorders, such as depression. The identification of a novel AKT1-binding protein (AKTIP) was pointed as an important new target. AKTIP binds directly to AKT1, enhancing the phosphorylation of regulatory sites, and this modulation are affected by AKT1 activation. The association of AKT1 and AKTIP polymorphisms with depressive symptoms was not investigated in LOD. Genotype tagSNPs in the AKT1 and AKTIP in LOD patients and controls. An academic medical center. Sample composed by 190 outpatients with LOD and 77 healthy individuals. The participants were evaluated using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV criteria, MINI-PLUS and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Our findings suggested an association between the tagSNP rs3730358 homozygous A/A (p?=?0.006) and LOD. A strong association of allele A and increased association for LOD was demonstrated with tagSNP rs3730358 (p-value?=?0.003). Limitation include composition of our control group, where the exclusion criteria generated a kind of super-healthy older group what might have produced a hidden stratification when compared with the LOD. This study is the first one to establish the association of the AKT1/AKTIP genes and LOD, and further studies are necessary to clarify the functional role of these proteins.

21887308	20110903	Low dynamics, high longevity and persistence of sessile structural species dwelling on Mediterranean coralligenous outcrops.	There is still limited understanding of the processes underlying benthic species dynamics in marine coastal habitats, which are of disproportionate importance in terms of productivity and biodiversity. The life-history traits of long-lived benthic species in these habitats are particularly poorly documented. In this study, we assessed decadal patterns of population dynamics for ten sponge and anthozoan species that play key structural roles in coralligenous outcrops (?25 m depth) in two areas of the NW Mediterranean Sea. This study was based on examination of a unique long-term photographic series, which allowed analysis of population dynamics over extensive spatial and time spans for the very first time. Specifically, 671 individuals were censused annually over periods of 25-, 15-, and 5-years. This long-term study quantitatively revealed a common life-history pattern among the ten studied species, despite the fact they present different growth forms. Low mortality rates (3.4% yr(-1) for all species combined) and infrequent recruitment events (mean value of 3.1?0.5 SE recruits yr(-1)) provided only a very small fraction of the new colonies required to maintain population sizes. Overall, annual mortality and recruitment rates did not differ significantly among years; however, some species displayed important mortality events and recruitment pulses, indicating variability among species. Based on the growth rates of these 10 species, we projected their longevity and, obtained a mean estimated age of 25-200 years. Finally, the low to moderate turnover rates (mean value 0.80% yr(-1)) observed among the coralligenous species were in agreement with their low dynamics and persistence. These results offer solid baseline data and reveal that these habitats are among the most vulnerable to the current increases of anthropogenic disturbances. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
26919806	20160228	Mass spectrometric analysis of dimer-disrupting mutations in Plasmodium triosephosphate isomerase.	Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS) under nanospray conditions has been used to examine the effects of mutation at two key dimer interface residues, Gln (Q) 64 and Thr (T) 75, in Plasmodium falciparum triosephosphate isomerase. Both residues participate in an intricate network of intra- and intersubunit hydrogen bonds. The gas phase distributions of dimeric and monomeric protein species have been examined for the wild type enzyme (TWT) and three mutants, Q64N, Q64E, and T75S, under a wide range of collision energies (40-160?eV). The results established the order of dimer stability as TWT?&gt;?T75S?&gt;?Q64E???Q64N. The mutational effects on dimer stability are in good agreement with the previously reported estimates, based on the concentration dependence of enzyme activity. Additional experiments in solution, using inhibition of activity by a synthetic dimer interface peptide, further support the broad agreement between gas phase and solution studies. 	Anal._Biochem.

9679546	19980729	Structure of the human allelic glutathione S-transferase-pi gene variant, hGSTP1 C, cloned from a glioblastoma multiforme cell line.	We recently reported the cloning of full-length cDNAs corresponding to mRNAs of three GST-pi genes, hGSTP1*A, hGSTP1*B and hGSTP1*C, as well as, the isolation of the full-length hGSTP1*C, of the human glutathione S-transferase-pi (GST-pi) gene that is characterized by a A--&gt;G transition at +1404 in exon 5 and a C--&gt;T transition at +2294 in exon 6. Although the promoter of the isolated gene was identical to that of the previously described GST-pi gene isolated from the MCF 7 and the HPB-ALL cell lines, both of which were hGSTP1*A, a number of structural differences were observed, including, nucleotide transitions, transversions, deletions and insertions, some of which created new restriction enzyme cleavage sites. A guanine insertion in the insulin response element, IRE, in intron 1 created an additional site for 5'-cytosine methylation. Seven repeat retinoic acid response element (RARE) consensus half sites, A(G)GG(T)TC(G)A at +1521 to +1644 were identified in the cloned hGSTP1*C. Five of the RARE half-sites had the minimal spacer nucleotide requirement for functionality and DNA mobility shift analysis with different pairs of the RARE half-sites and supershift studies using antibodies against RAR-beta showed significant binding of nuclear protein complexes from RA-treated cells to these RAREs. GST-pi gene expression was increased significantly in cells transfected with the GST-pi gene and treated with all-trans RA. These results contrast with those in a previous report in which RA was shown to suppress the GST-pi promoter, and indicate a complex mechanism of RA-mediated GST-pi gene regulation in tumor cells.

24094130	20131008	Association between FAS and FASL genetic variants and risk of primary brain tumor.	The purpose of this study was to investigate whether functional polymorphisms of apoptosis pathway genes FAS and FASL are associated with the development of primary brain tumors. The study constituted 83 patients with primary brain tumor and 108 healthy individuals. In the present case-control study, the primary brain tumors were divided into two groups: gliomas and meningiomas. Evaluation of FAS -1377?G/A and FASL -844 T/C gene polymorphisms were performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). To confirm the genotyping, results were examined by DNA sequencing method. Our results were analyzed by SPSS. The frequency of the FAS -1377 AA genotype was significantly lower in meningioma and glioma patients compared to controls (p = 0.023; p = 0.001, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that FAS -1377 AA genotype was associated with decreased risk of meningioma and glioma (OR = 0.092, 95% CI: 0.012-0.719, p = 0.023 for meningiomas; OR = 0.056, 95% CI: 0.007-0.428, p = 0.006 for gliomas). However, there was no significant differences in FASL -844 T/C genotype frequencies between patients with primary brain tumors and controls (p &gt; 0.05). In this study, combined genotypes were evaluated for association with primary brain tumors. Combined genotype analysis showed that the frequencies of AATC and AACC were significantly lower in glioma patients in comparison with those of controls (p = 0.023; p = 0.022, respectively). This study provides the first evidence that FAS -1377 AA genotype may have a protective effect on the developing primary brain tumor in a Turkish population. 	Int._J._Neurosci.	D016428
15371569	20040917	C-terminal truncated dystrophin identified in skeletal muscle of an asymptomatic boy with a novel nonsense mutation of the dystrophin gene.	Mutations that cause premature stop codons in the dystrophin gene lead to a complete loss of dystrophin from skeletal muscle, resulting in severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Here, a C-terminally truncated dystrophin resulting from a novel nonsense mutation is shown for the first time to be localized to the muscle plasma membrane. An asymptomatic 8-y-old boy was examined for dystrophin in skeletal muscle because of high serum creatine kinase activity. Remarkably, no dystrophin labeling was seen with an MAb against the C-terminal domain, suggesting the presence of an early stop codon in the dystrophin gene. Labeling with an antibody specific to the N-terminal domain, however, revealed weak, patchy, and discontinuous staining, suggesting limited production of a truncated form of the protein. Molecular analysis revealed a novel nonsense mutation (Q3625X) as a result of a single nucleotide change in the patient's genomic DNA (C10873T), leaving 1.6% of dystrophin gene product unsynthesized at the C terminus. Dystrophin mRNA analysis did not show rescue of the nonsense mutation as a result of exon-skipping by an alternative splicing mechanism. This is the first report of an asymptomatic dystrophinopathy with a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene. 	Pediatr._Res.	D002363 D016428 D013485
16736287	20060601	Late-onset common cancers in a kindred with an Arg213Gln TP53 germline mutation.	Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal-dominant condition characterized by early-onset sarcoma, breast cancer and other specific tumour types. In most LFS kindreds germline TP53 mutations have been identified. In general, TP53 germline mutations are not associated with late-onset common cancers. We encountered a large kindred in which a wide spectrum of tumour types occurred, including melanoma, breast, ovarian, colorectal, stomach and renal cell cancer, without clear-cut early ages at onset of disease. An Arg213Gln TP53 germline mutation was detected in 12 out of 15 affected family members whereas testing for other cancer susceptibility genes in selected patients was negative. In vitro testing indicated that the specific TP53 mutation inactivates the protein transcriptionally. Our findings suggest that this TP53 germline mutation is a causative factor in this family and that specific TP53 germline mutations can be associated with relatively late-onset common cancers.

24912939	20140611	NQO1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix.	NQO1 (NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase-1), located on chromosome 16q22, functions primarily to protect normal cells from oxidant stress and electrophilic attack. Recent studies have revealed that NQO1 is expressed at a high level in most human solid tumors including those of the colon, breast, pancreas, ovaries and thyroid, and it has also been detected following the induction of cell cycle progression and proliferation of melanoma cells. In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinicopathological significance of upregulated NQO1 protein expression in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the uterine cervix. The localization of the NQO1 protein was determined in the SiHa cervical squamous cancer cell line using immunofluorescence (IF) staining, and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining performed on paraffin-embedded cervical SCC specimens from 177 patients. For comparison, 94 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and 25 normal cervical epithelia samples were also included. QRT-PCR was performed on RNA from fresh tissues to detect NQO1 mRNA expression levels, and HPV infection status was genotyped using oligonucleotide microarray. Disease-free survival (DFS) and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates for all cervical SCC patients were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and univariate and multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. The NQO1 protein showed a mainly cytoplasmic staining pattern in cervical cancer cells, and only three cases of cervical SCC showed a nuclear staining pattern. The strongly positive rate of NQO1 protein expression was significantly higher in cervical SCCs and CINs than in normal cervical epithelia. High-level NQO1 expression was closely associated with poor differentiation, late-stage, lymph node metastasis and high-risk for HPV infection. Additionally, high-level NQO1 expression was associated with lower DFS and 5-year OS rates, particularly for patients with early-stage cervical SCCs. Furthermore, Cox analysis revealed that NQO1 expression emerged as a significant independent hazard factor for DFS rate in patients with cervical SCC. NQO1 overexpression might be an independent biomarker for prognostic evaluation of cervical SCCs. 	BMC_Cancer	D016428 D013485

11904227	20020321	Substrate activation in acetylcholinesterase induced by low pH or mutation in the pi-cation subsite.	Substrate inhibition is considered a defining property of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), whereas substrate activation is characteristic of butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). To understand the mechanism of substrate inhibition, the pH dependence of acetylthiocholine hydrolysis by AChE was studied between pH 5 and 8. Wild-type human AChE and its mutants Y337G and Y337W, as well as wild-type Bungarus fasciatus AChE and its mutants Y333G, Y333A and Y333W were studied. The pH profile results were unexpected. Instead of substrate inhibition, wild-type AChE and all mutants showed substrate activation at low pH. At high pH, there was substrate inhibition for wild-type AChE and for the mutant with tryptophan in the pi-cation subsite, but substrate activation for mutants containing small residues, glycine or alanine. This is particularly apparent in the B. fasciatus AChE. Thus a single amino acid substitution in the pi-cation site, from the aromatic tyrosine of B. fasciatus AChE to the alanine of BuChE, caused AChE to behave like BuChE. Excess substrate binds to the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE. The finding that AChE is activated by excess substrate supports the idea that binding of a second substrate molecule to the PAS induces a conformational change that reorganizes the active site.

25480861	20141207	Interferon-beta affects mitochondrial activity in CD4+ lymphocytes: Implications for mechanism of action in multiple sclerosis.	Whereas cellular immune function depends on energy supply and mitochondrial function, little is known on the impact of immunotherapies on cellular energy metabolism. The objective of this paper is to assess the effects of interferon-beta (IFN-?) on mitochondrial function of CD4(+) T cells. Intracellular adenosine triphosphate (iATP) in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated CD4(+) cells of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients treated with IFN-? and controls were analyzed in a luciferase-based assay. Mitochondrial-transmembrane potential (??m) in IFN-?-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was investigated by flow cytometry. Expression of genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in CD4(+) cells of IFN-?-treated individuals and correlations between genetic variants in the key metabolism regulator PGC-1? and IFN-? response in MS were analyzed. IFN-?-treated MS patients exhibited a dose-dependent reduction of iATP levels in CD4(+) T cells compared to controls (p &lt; 0.001). Mitochondrial effects were reflected by depolarization of ??m. Expression data revealed changes in the transcription of OXPHOS-genes. iATP levels in IFN-?-responders were reduced compared to non-responders (p &lt; 0.05), and the major T allele of the SNP rs7665116 of PGC-1? correlated with iATP-levels. Reduced iATP-synthesis ex vivo and differential expression of OXPHOS-genes in CD4(+) T cells point to unknown IFN-? effects on mitochondrial energy metabolism, adding to potential pleiotropic mechanisms of action.

15548545	20041119	Mouse model carrying H222P-Lmna mutation develops muscular dystrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy similar to human striated muscle laminopathies.	Laminopathies are a group of disorders caused by mutations in the LMNA gene encoding A-type lamins, components of the nuclear lamina. Three of these disorders affect specifically the skeletal and/or cardiac muscles, and their pathogenic mechanisms are still unknown. We chose the LMNA H222P missense mutation identified in a family with autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, one of the striated muscle-specific laminopathies, to create a faithful mouse model of this type of laminopathy. The mutant mice exhibit overtly normal embryonic development and sexual maturity. At adulthood, male homozygous mice display reduced locomotion activity with abnormal stiff walking posture and all of them die by 9 months of age. As for cardiac phenotype, they develop chamber dilation and hypokinesia with conduction defects. These abnormal skeletal and cardiac features were also observed in the female homozygous mice but with a later-onset than in males. Histopathological analysis of the mice revealed muscle degeneration with fibrosis associated with dislocation of heterochromatin and activation of Smad signalling in heart and skeletal muscles. These results demonstrate that LmnaH222P/H222P mice represent a good model for studying laminopathies affecting striated muscles as they develop a dystrophic condition of both skeletal and cardiac muscles similar to the human diseases.

21352494	20110301	Expression of CYP2E1 increases oxidative stress and induces apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in transgenic mice.	Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is an effective generator of reactive oxygen species. Marked expression of CYP2E1 occurs in the heart and it is known to be regulated in the course of progression of myocardial ischemia and cardiomyopathy. We provide evidence that the expression of CYP2E1 is strongly up-regulated in cTnT(R141W) transgenic mice with dilated cardiomyopathy. Heart tissue-specific CYP2E1 transgenic mice were produced to study the effects of CYP2E1 overexpression on the heart. Increased mortality, chamber dilation and contractile dysfunction, as well as myocyte disarray, interstitial fibrosis, ultrastructural degeneration with myofibrillar disorganization and mitochondria damage, were observed in CYP2E1 transgenic mice and cTnT(R141W) transgenic mice. In addition, levels of H(2) O(2) and malondialdehyde were increased and levels of glutathione and total antioxidant capability were strongly reduced in CYP2E1 transgenic mice and cTnT(R141W) transgenic mice. Myocyte apoptosis was significantly increased by 19-fold in CYP2E1 transgenic mice and by 11-fold in cTnT(R141W) transgenic mice, respectively, compared to wild-type mice. Mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic signal transduction events, such as cytochrome?c release from mitochondria into the cytosol and the expression of cleaved (active) caspases 3 and 9, were significantly increased in CYP2E1 transgenic mice and cTnT(R141W) transgenic mice. These results demonstrate that CYP2E1 over-expression produces apoptosis and that the up-regulation of CYP2E1 in cTnT(R141W) transgenic mice also correlates with apoptosis in this model. 	FEBS_J.

25657757	20150207	A systematic review of the role of renin angiotensin aldosterone system genes in diabetes mellitus, diabetic retinopathy and diabetic neuropathy.	The renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a vital role in regulating glucose metabolism and blood pressure, electrolyte and fluid homeostasis. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the association of the RAAS genes with diabetes mellitus (DM) and its complications of retinopathy, neuropathy and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The relevant English-language studies were identified using the key words of DM, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), T2DM, renin angiotensin aldosterone polymorphisms or genotypes and RAAS from the search engines of MEDLINE/PubMed, and Scopus from January 1, 1995 to July 30, 2014. Inclusion criteria for selecting relevant studies were reporting the role of RAAS gene variants in the pathogenesis of T1DM or T2DM, diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic neuropathy and cardiovascular complication of DM. The reviewers identified 204 studies of which 73 were eligible for inclusion in the present systematic review. The review indicates the angiotensinogen (AGT) M235T polymorphism might not affect the risk of DM. The role of angiotensin converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene (AT1R) A1166C polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of DM could not be established. Studies indicate the absence of an association between three polymorphisms of AGT M235T, ACE I/D and AT1R A1166C and DR in DM patients. A protective role for ACE II genotype against diabetic peripheral neuropathy has been suggested. Also, the ACE I/D polymorphism might be associated with the risk of CVD in DM patients. More studies with adequate sample size that investigate the influence of all RAAS gene variants together on the risk of DM and its complications are necessary to provide a more clear picture of the RAAS genes polymorphisms involvement in the pathogenesis of DM and its complications.

10902909	20000721	Isolation and analysis of three peroxide sensor regulatory gene homologs ahpC, ahpX and oxyR in Streptomyces viridosporus T7A--a lignocellulose degrading actinomycete.	Increased lignolytic peroxidase activity has been demonstrated with the addition of sublethal doses of toxic H2O2 in Streptomyces viridosporus T7A. Until now, the effect of H2O2 at the molecular level has not been well characterized. Here, for the first time we report the isolation and analysis of three peroxide-induced gene homologs from S. viridosporus T7A; ahpC and ahpX (encoding alkyl hydroxyperoxidase subunits) and oxyR (encoding oxygen stress regulatory protein). The genome organization of these stress related genes were found to be divergently adjacent to each other. The protein sequence analysis of the oxyR homolog revealed a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif characteristic to the LysR of regulatory proteins induced by H2O2. The nucleotide sequence analysis of the intergenic region between ahpC and oxyR revealed that they shared a core T-n11-A, a signature protein-binding region of LysR family members. Based on similarities in sequence analysis, genetic organization, and the induction of lignin peroxidase activity upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide, we hypothesize a peroxide induction mechanism for the regulation of oxidative lignin biodegradation by S. viridosporus, possibly via use of OxyR which is also involved in regulating the peroxide stress response in this actinomycete.

21672359	20110616	Functional effect of platelet membrane glycoprotein ia gene polymorphism in the pathogenesis of unstable angina pectoris.	The functional effect of platelet membrane glycoprotein Ia (GPIa) gene 807C/T polymorphism in unstable angina pectoris (UAP) pathogenesis was investigated in Chinese Han individuals. Collagen type I-induced platelet aggregation was measured in 33 healthy subjects. Plasma levels of ?-granule membrane protein (GMP-140) were measured in 33 healthy subjects and in 35 patients with recent-onset angina at rest within 24 h of hospitalization. Platelet membrane GPIa gene 807C/T polymorphism was determined in all subjects. Lag-time before 30% platelet aggregation was significantly longer in CC genotype than in TC genotype healthy subjects, although there was no significant difference in maximal platelet aggregation between healthy subjects with either genotype. Plasma GMP-140 levels were significantly higher in TC genotype patients compared with CC genotype patients or healthy subjects; a significant difference was also observed between the latter two groups. It was concluded that rapid initiation of collagen-induced platelet aggregation may be associated with the platelet membrane GPIa T807 allele, which may be important in UAP pathogenesis.

26800492	20160123	Characterization of patients at high risk of melanoma in Austria.	Risk of melanoma is determined by genetic and exogenous factors. Only a few studies have included both characteristics in a comprehensive multivariable analysis. To find determinants of patients at high risk of melanoma in Austria, including phenotype, genotype and lifestyle characteristics in comprehensive analyses. In total, 1668 patients with melanoma from the M3 case-control study were studied. Overall, 567 participants were sequenced for CDKN2A, 232 for CDK4, 123 for MITF encoding the variant E318K and 964 for MC1R. Patients with melanoma with a positive family history (n = 190, 11?6%), multiple primary melanomas (n = 261, 15?7%) and younger age (&lt; 50 years, n = 675, 40?5%) were defined as being at high risk. All other patients with melanoma were defined as the reference group. We found significant differences between those two groups and between the high-risk subgroups (positive family history, multiple primary melanomas and younger age). Pigmentation phenotype was associated with the high-risk group in general (childhood freckling, odds ratio 1?46, P = 0?007; blond/reddish hair colour, odds ratio 1?43, P = 0?011). Patients with a positive family history and patients with early-onset disease were similar regarding both their phenotypic characteristics and external factors. Established high-risk mutations in CDKN2A were found in cases with a positive family history (n = 12) or multiple melanomas (n = 2). Moreover, we found three patients carrying the MITF p.E318K variant, two with a CDK4 variant and seven with nonsynonymous MC1R variants with undescribed biological significance, of which four were predicted as damaging. Austrian patients could represent a reservoir for novel genetic variants. Further investigation of populations in Central and Eastern Europe might reveal more novel and disease-relevant variants.

24345699	20131219	No association between peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and uncoupling protein gene polymorphisms and obesity in Malaysian university students.	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are expressed in adipose tissue, where PPARs are nuclear receptors that function as transcription regulators of the expression of UCPs, mitochondria proteins which uncouple protons in exchange of heat released. The PPAR? L162V; PPAR?2 C161T; UCP1 -3826A/G; UCP2 45 bp Ins/Del and -866G/A; and UCP3 -55C/T gene polymorphisms have been previously associated with obesity in different populations, but with inconclusive findings. This study was to investigate the prevalence of these gene polymorphisms and their possible association with obesity in a cohort of Malaysian university students in Kuala Lumpur. Random convenience sampling was performed with informed consents and anthropometric measurements were taken. Mouthwash samples were obtained for genomic DNA extraction and genotyping was performed using Polymerase Chain Reaction - Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism. Out of the 256 subjects (140 males and 116 females), 170 were lean and 86 were overweight/obese. The mutated PPAR? L162V; PPAR?2 C161T; UCP1 -3826A/G; UCP2 45 bp Ins/Del and -866G/A; and UCP3 -55C/T allele frequencies were 0.006, 0.36, 0.58, 0.12, 0.56 and 0.34, respectively. This study failed to find significant differences in the anthropometric indicators of obesity (Body Mass Index, Waist-Hip Ratio and Total Body Fat) between the genotypes of all the PPAR and UCP gene variants. Overall, the genotype and allele distributions were also not significantly different between genders and BMI status. In conclusion, overweight/obesity is not prevalent among the Malaysian university students and the PPAR and UCP gene polymorphisms are not associated with obesity.: 	Obes_Res_Clin_Pract	D016428
19500377	20090609	Effect of dioxins on regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression by aryl hydrocarbon receptor: a neurotoxicology study.	Dioxins and related compounds are suspected of causing neurological disruption. Epidemiological studies indicated that exposure to these compounds caused neurodevelopmental disturbances such as learning disability and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which are thought to be closely related to dopaminergic dysfunction. Although the molecular mechanism of their actions has not been fully investigated, a major participant in the process is aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). This study focused on the effect of 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) exposure on the regulation of TH, a rate-limiting enzyme of dopamine synthesis, gene expression by AhR. N2a-Rbeta cells were established by transfecting murine neuroblastoma Neuro2a with the rat AhR cDNA. TH expression induced by TCDD was assessed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Participation of AhR in TCDD-induced TH gene expression was confirmed by suppressing AhR expression using the siRNA method. Catecholamines including dopamine were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. A reporter gene assay was used to identify regulatory motifs in the promoter region of TH gene. Binding of AhR with the regulatory motif was confirmed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Induction of TH by TCDD through AhR activation was detected at mRNA and protein levels. Induced TH protein was functional and its expression increased dopamine synthesis. The reporter gene assay and EMSA indicated that AhR directly regulated TH gene expression. Regulatory sequence called aryl hydrocarbon receptor responsive element III (AHRE-III) was identified upstream of the TH gene from -285 bp to -167 bp. Under TCDD exposure, an AhR complex was bound to AHRE-III as well as the xenobiotic response element (XRE), though AHRE-III was not identical to XRE, the conventional AhR-binding motif. Our results suggest TCDD directly regulate the dopamine system by TH gene transactivation via an AhR-AHRE-III-mediated pathway. The AhR- mediated pathway could have a particular AhR-mediated genomic control pathway transmitting the effects of TCDD action to target cells in the development of dopaminergic disabilities.

22936817	20120901	The paternal role in pre-eclampsia and giving birth to a small for gestational age infant; a population-based cohort study.	To estimate the effect of partner change on risks of pre-eclampsia and giving birth to a small for gestational age infant. Prospective population study. Sweden. Women with their first and second successive singleton births in Sweden between 1990 and 2006 without pregestational diabetes and/or hypertension (n=446 459). Preterm (&lt;37 weeks) and term (?37 weeks) pre-eclampsia, and giving birth to a small for gestational age (SGA) infant. Risks were adjusted for interpregnancy interval, maternal age, body mass index, height and smoking habits in second pregnancy, years of involuntary childlessness before second pregnancy, mother's country of birth, years of formal education and year of birth. Further, when we calculated risks of SGA we restricted the study population to women with non-pre-eclamptic pregnancies. In women who had a preterm pre-eclampsia in first pregnancy, partner change was associated with a strong protective effect for preterm pre-eclampsia recurrence (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.88). Similarly, partner change was also associated with a protective effect of recurrence of SGA birth (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.84). In contrast, among women without SGA in first birth, partner change was associated with an increased risk of SGA in second pregnancy. Risks of term pre-eclampsia were not affected by partner change. There is a paternal effect on risks of preterm pre-eclampsia and giving birth to an SGA infant. 	BMJ_Open	D016428
20693349	20100810	Mannose-binding lectin genotype and phenotype in patients with type 2 diabetes and myocardial infarction: a report from the DIGAMI 2 trial.	The present study characterizes mannose-binding lectin (MBL), an activator of the complement system and thereby important for inflammatory activation, in patients with diabetes and myocardial infarction. Serum (S)-MBL was determined at hospital admission in 387 patients with type 2 diabetes (median age 70 years; 68% male) with myocardial infarction, and genotyping was performed in 287 patients. Cardiovascular events (cardiovascular mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke) were recorded during 2.5 years. Median S-MBL was 1,212 ?g/l (interquartile range [IQR] 346-2,681 ?g/l). Of the subjects, 54% in the geno- and phenotype subgroup had a high-coding MBL genotype (median S-MBL=2,658 ?g/l [IQR 1,715-3,829]) and 46% a low-coding MBL genotype (373 ?g/l [100-765]). S-MBL did not correlate with age, BMI, creatinine clearance, glucose, or A1C. Cardiovascular events occurred in 136 (35%) patients. S-MBL did not predict events in univariable analyses (hazard ratio 0.93 [95% CI 0.85-1.01]; P=0.09). In unadjusted analyses, the risk of events was lower in patients with a high genotype and S-MBL above the median for their genotype (0.49 [0.26-0.92]; P=0.026) than for patients with a low genotype and S-MBL below the median for their genotype. The prediction capacity of the geno- and phenotype model was of borderline significance in adjusted Cox regression. Patients with type 2 diabetes and myocardial infarction have MBL genotypes that are similar to those known in the general population. The combination of a low-coding MBL genotype with a low S-MBL appears to be prognostically unfavorable, but the association is blunted by traditional risk markers. 	Diabetes_Care	D016428 D013485
17506883	20070518	The Deuterator: software for the determination of backbone amide deuterium levels from H/D exchange MS data.	The combination of mass spectrometry and solution phase amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange (H/D exchange) experiments is an effective method for characterizing protein dynamics, and protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions. Despite methodological advancements and improvements in instrumentation and automation, data analysis and display remains a tedious process. The factors that contribute to this bottleneck are the large number of data points produced in a typical experiment, each requiring manual curation and validation, and then calculation of the level of backbone amide exchange. Tools have become available that address some of these issues, but lack sufficient integration, functionality, and accessibility required to address the needs of the H/D exchange community. To date there is no software for the analysis of H/D exchange data that comprehensively addresses these issues. We have developed an integrated software system for the automated analysis and representation of H/D exchange data that has been titled &quot;The Deuterator&quot;. Novel approaches have been implemented that enable high throughput analysis, automated determination of deuterium incorporation, and deconvolution of overlapping peptides. This has been achieved by using methods involving iterative theoretical envelope fitting, and consideration of peak data within expected m/z ranges. Existing common file formats have been leveraged to allow compatibility with the output from the myriad of MS instrument platforms and peptide sequence database search engines.A web-based interface is used to integrate the components of The Deuterator that are able to analyze and present mass spectral data from instruments with varying resolving powers. The results, if necessary, can then be confirmed, adjusted, re-calculated and saved. Additional tools synchronize the curated calculation parameters with replicate time points, increasing throughput. Saved results can then be used to plot deuterium buildup curves and 3D structural overlays. The system has been used successfully in a production environment for over one year and is freely available as a web tool at the project home page http://deuterator.florida.scripps.edu. The automated calculation and presentation of H/D exchange data in a user interface enables scientists to organize and analyze data efficiently. Integration of the different components of The Deuterator coupled with the flexibility of common data file formats allow this system to be accessible to the broadening H/D exchange community.

23189200	20121129	Characterization of a new Vaccinia virus isolate reveals the C23L gene as a putative genetic marker for autochthonous Group 1 Brazilian Vaccinia virus.	Since 1999, several Vaccinia virus (VACV) isolates, the etiological agents of bovine vaccinia (BV), have been frequently isolated and characterized with various biological and molecular methods. The results from these approaches have grouped these VACV isolates into two different clusters. This dichotomy has elicited debates surrounding the origin of the Brazilian VACV and its epidemiological significance. To ascertain vital information to settle these debates, we and other research groups have made efforts to identify molecular markers to discriminate VACV from other viruses of the genus Orthopoxvirus (OPV) and other VACV-BR groups. In this way, some genes have been identified as useful markers to discriminate between the VACV-BR groups. However, new markers are needed to infer ancestry and to correlate each sample or group with its unique epidemiological and biological features. The aims of this work were to characterize a new VACV isolate (VACV DMTV-2005) molecularly and biologically using conserved and non-conserved gene analyses for phylogenetic inference and to search for new genes that would elucidate the VACV-BR dichotomy. The VACV DMTV-2005 isolate reported in this study is biologically and phylogenetically clustered with other strains of Group 1 VACV-BR, the most prevalent VACV group that was isolated during the bovine vaccinia outbreaks in Brazil. Sequence analysis of C23L, the gene that encodes for the CC-chemokine-binding protein, revealed a ten-nucleotide deletion, which is a new Group 1 Brazilian VACV genetic marker. This deletion in the C23L open reading frame produces a premature stop-codon that is shared by all Group 1 VACV-BR strains and may also reflect the VACV-BR dichotomy; the deletion can also be considered to be a putative genetic marker for non-virulent Brazilian VACV isolates and may be used for the detection and molecular characterization of new isolates.

24673452	20140329	Role of MDM2 T309G polymorphism in susceptibility and prognosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer: a meta-analysis.	This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships of a common polymorphism (T309G, rs2279744 T&gt;G) in the murine double minute 2 (MDM2) gene with susceptibility and prognosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The PubMed, CISCOM, CINAHL, Web of Science, Google Scholar, EBSCO, Cochrane Library, and CBM databases were searched for relevant articles published before November 1st, 2013 without any language restrictions. Meta-analysis was conducted using the STATA 12.0 software. Crude odds ratios (ORs) or hazard risk (HR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Seven clinical studies with a total 3732 NSCLC patients and 1472 healthy controls met the inclusion criteria. The results of our meta-analysis suggested that MDM2 T309G polymorphism might be strongly correlated with an increased risk of NSCLC (G allele vs. T allele: OR=1.63, 95% CI: 1.42-1.89, p&lt;0.001; TG+GG vs. TT: OR=1.54, 95% CI: 1.31-1.80, p&lt;0.001; respectively). Furthermore, we observed significant associations of MDM2 T309G polymorphism with poor overall survival (TT vs. GT: HR=1.22, 95% CI: 101-1.43, p&lt;0.001; TT vs. GG: HR=1.31, 95% CI: 1.04-1.59, p&lt;0.001; TT vs. GT+GG: HR=1.44, 95% CI: 1.13-1.76, p&lt;0.001; respectively) and progression-free survival (TT vs. GT+GG: HR=1.26, 95% CI: 0.82-1.69, p&lt;0.001) of NSCLC patients. Our findings provide convincing evidence that the MDM2 T309G polymorphism may contribute to individual differences in NSCLC susceptibility and prognosis. Thus, the MDM2 T309G polymorphism may be a promising potential biomarker for NSCLC diagnosis and prognosis. 	Genet_Test_Mol_Biomarkers	D016428 D017418 D013485
22996643	20120922	Knockdown of Pnpla6 protein results in motor neuron defects in zebrafish.	Mutations in patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 6 (PNPLA6), also known as neuropathy target esterase (NTE) or SPG39, cause hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Although studies on animal models, including mice and Drosophila, have extended our understanding of PNPLA6, its roles in neural development and in HSP are not clearly understood. Here, we describe the generation of a vertebrate model of PNPLA6 insufficiency using morpholino oligonucleotide knockdown in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Pnpla6 knockdown resulted in developmental abnormalities and motor neuron defects, including axon truncation and branching. The phenotypes in pnpla6 knockdown morphants were rescued by the introduction of wild-type, but not mutant, human PNPLA6 mRNA. Our results also revealed the involvement of BMP signaling in pnpla6 knockdown phenotypes. Taken together, these results demonstrate an important role of PNPLA6 in motor neuron development and implicate overexpression of BMP signaling as a possible mechanism underlying the developmental defects in pnpla6 morphants.

Predicting the impacts of ocean acidification on coccolithophore calcification has received much recent attention and requires improved knowledge of cellular calcification mechanisms. Uniquely amongst calcifying organisms, coccolithophores produce calcified scales (coccoliths) in an intracellular compartment and secrete them to the cell surface, requiring large transcellular ionic fluxes to support calcification. In particular, intracellular calcite precipitation using HCO?? as the substrate generates equimolar quantities of H+ that must be rapidly removed to prevent cytoplasmic acidification. We have used electrophysiological approaches to identify a plasma membrane voltage-gated H+ conductance in Coccolithus pelagicus ssp braarudii with remarkably similar biophysical and functional properties to those found in metazoans. We show that both C. pelagicus and Emiliania huxleyi possess homologues of metazoan H(v)1 H+ channels, which function as voltage-gated H+ channels when expressed in heterologous systems. Homologues of the coccolithophore H+ channels were also identified in a diversity of eukaryotes, suggesting a wide range of cellular roles for the H(v)1 class of proteins. Using single cell imaging, we demonstrate that the coccolithophore H+ conductance mediates rapid H+ efflux and plays an important role in pH homeostasis in calcifying cells. The results demonstrate a novel cellular role for voltage gated H+ channels and provide mechanistic insight into biomineralisation by establishing a direct link between pH homeostasis and calcification. As the coccolithophore H+ conductance is dependent on the trans-membrane H+ electrochemical gradient, this mechanism will be directly impacted by, and may underlie adaptation to, ocean acidification. The presence of this H+ efflux pathway suggests that there is no obligate use of H+ derived from calcification for intracellular CO? generation. Furthermore, the presence of H(v)1 class ion channels in a wide range of extant eukaryote groups indicates they evolved in an early common ancestor. 	PLoS_Biol.	D016428 D013485 D013486
23650574	20130508	Utrophin ABD binds to F-actin in an open conformation.	Structural analyses of actin binding regions comprising tandem calponin homology domains alone and when bound to F-actin have revealed a number of different conformations with calponin homology domains in 'open' and 'closed' positions. In an attempt to resolve these issues we have examined the properties of the utrophin actin binding domain in open and closed conformations in order to verify the conformation when bound to F-actin. Locking the actin binding domain in a closed conformation using engineered cysteine residues in each calponin homology domain reduced the affinity for F-actin without affecting the stoichiometry furthermore differential scanning calorimetry experiments revealed a reduction in melting temperature on binding to actin. The data suggest the amino-terminal utrophin actin binding domain is in an open conformation in solution and when bound to F-actin. 	FEBS_Open_Bio	D016428
21690306	20110622	CDK-1 inhibits meiotic spindle shortening and dynein-dependent spindle rotation in C. elegans.	In animals, the female meiotic spindle is positioned at the egg cortex in a perpendicular orientation to facilitate the disposal of half of the chromosomes into a polar body. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the metaphase spindle lies parallel to the cortex, dynein is dispersed on the spindle, and the dynein activators ASPM-1 and LIN-5 are concentrated at spindle poles. Anaphase-promoting complex (APC) activation results in dynein accumulation at spindle poles and dynein-dependent rotation of one spindle pole to the cortex, resulting in perpendicular orientation. To test whether the APC initiates spindle rotation through cyclin B-CDK-1 inactivation, separase activation, or degradation of an unknown dynein inhibitor, CDK-1 was inhibited with purvalanol A in metaphase-I-arrested, APC-depleted embryos. CDK-1 inhibition resulted in the accumulation of dynein at spindle poles and dynein-dependent spindle rotation without chromosome separation. These results suggest that CDK-1 blocks rotation by inhibiting dynein association with microtubules and with LIN-5-ASPM-1 at meiotic spindle poles and that the APC promotes spindle rotation by inhibiting CDK-1.

12198610	20020829	Association of hypercoagulable states and increased platelet adhesion and aggregation with bacterial colonization of intravenous catheters.	Bacterial adherence to intravenous catheters may be mediated, in part, by adherence to coagulation proteins and platelets. The possibility that catheter infection is associated with gene polymorphisms that cause hypercoagulability or increased platelet stickiness was examined. Among patients with infected catheters, there was no increase in the frequency of polymorphisms that increase coagulability, including factor V Leiden R506G, factor II (prothrombin) G20210A, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T, compared with control subjects. The incidence of polymorphisms of the platelet beta(3) integrin among patients with infected catheters was also similar to that among control subjects. The C/D heterozygote of the variable number tandem repeat polymorphism and the C/T heterozygote of the KO polymorphism of glycoprotein Ibalpha were more frequent among patients with infected catheters than they were among control subjects. In a small proportion of patients, a genetic predisposition to platelet stickiness may be associated with infection of intravenous catheters, but in the majority, a recognized genetic tendency to hypercoagulability or platelet stickiness does not underlie infection.

24996251	20140706	Interferon-? regulates growth and controls Fc? receptor expression and activation in human intestinal mast cells.	Development and function of tissue resident mast cells (MCs) is tightly controlled by various cytokines, most of which belong to the typical T helper (Th) 2-type cytokines such as IL-3 and IL-4. The effects of the Th1-type cytokine IFN-? on human MCs is less clear. Here, we analyzed the effects of IFN-? on tissue-derived, mature human MCs. We found that INF-? decreases proliferation, without affecting apoptosis in human intestinal MCs cultured in the presence of optimal concentrations of stem cell factor (SCF) or SCF and IL-4. However, in the absence of growth factors or at suboptimal concentrations of SCF, INF-? promotes survival through inhibition of MC apoptosis. Interestingly, we found that INF-? has no effect on Fc?RI expression and Fc?RI-mediated release of histamine and leukotriene (LT)C4, while it has profound effects on Fc?R expression and activation. We show that intestinal MCs express Fc?RI, Fc?RIIa, and Fc?RIIc, whereas Fc?RIIb expression was found in only 40% of the isolates and Fc?RIII was never detectable. INF-? strongly increases Fc?RI and decreases Fc?RIIa expression. INF-?-na?ve MCs produce LTC4 but fail to degranulate upon crosslinking of surface-bound monomeric IgG. In contrast, INF-?-treated MCs rapidly release granule-stored histamine in addition to de novo-synthesized LTC4. In summary, we identify INF-? as an important regulator of tissue-resident human MCs. IFN-? displays a dual function by blocking extensive MC proliferation, while decreasing apoptosis in starving MCs and enhancing Fc?RI expression and activation. These results emphasize the involvement of mucosal MCs in Th1-mediated disorders. 	BMC_Immunol.	D016428
20554794	20100618	Distinctive structure and interfacial activity of the human apolipoprotein A-IV 347S isoprotein.	The T347S polymorphism in the human apolipoprotein (apo) A-IV gene is present at high frequencies among all the world's populations. Carriers of a 347S allele exhibit faster clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, greater adiposity, and increased risk for developing atherosclerosis, which suggests that this conservative amino acid substitution alters the structure of apo A-IV. Herein we have used spectroscopic and surface chemistry techniques to examine the structure, stability, and interfacial properties of the apo A-IV 347S isoprotein. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that the 347S isoprotein has similar alpha-helical structure but lower thermodynamic stability than the 347T isoprotein. Fluorescence spectroscopy found that the 347S isoprotein exhibits an enhanced tyrosine emission and reduced tyrosine--&gt;tryptophan energy transfer, and second derivative UV absorption spectra noted increased tyrosine exposure, suggesting that the 347S isoprotein adopts a looser tertiary conformation. Surface chemistry studies found that although the 347S isoprotein bound rapidly to the lipid interface, it has a lower interfacial exclusion pressure and lower elastic modulus than the 347T isoprotein. Together, these observations establish that the T347S substitution alters the conformation of apo A-IV and lowers its interfacial activity-changes that could account for the effect of this polymorphism on postprandial lipid metabolism.

18800245	20080919	Detection of bovine spongiform encephalopathy-related prion protein gene promoter polymorphisms in local Turkish cattle.	Polymorphisms in open reading frames of the prion protein gene (PRNP) have been shown to be associated with prion disease susceptibility in humans, sheep, and mice. Studies in recent years have demonstrated a similar effect of PRNP promoter and intron-1 polymorphisms on bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) susceptibility in cattle. In this study, the deletion/insertion (indel) polymorphisms of the bovine PRNP gene within the promoter sequence (23 bp) and intron 1 (12 bp) were analyzed in local Turkish cattle. For this, 150 animals belonging to three different local breeds--the South Anatolian red, the East Anatolian red, and the Turkish gray--were tested using DNA purification and polymerase chain reaction. The ins allele in the 12 bp indel, which is associated with low susceptibility to BSE, showed a high frequency in all three breeds. The low-susceptibility allele of the 23-bp indel was identified in Turkish gray cattle with a frequency of 0.80. Results of the study have shown that local Turkish cattle might have an important genetic value for selection against BSE. 	Biochem._Genet.	D016428 D013485
26626025	20151203	Rapid, efficient, and simple motor neuron differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells.	Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are being applied in regenerative medicine and for the in vitro modeling of human intractable disorders. In particular, neural cells derived from disease-specific human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) established from patients with neurological disorders have been used as in vitro disease models to recapitulate in vivo pathogenesis because neural cells cannot be usually obtained from patients themselves. In this study, we established a rapid, efficient, and simple method for efficiently deriving motor neurons from hPSCs that is useful for pathophysiological analysis and the development of drugs to treat motor neuron diseases. Treatment with GSK3? inhibitors during the initial phase of differentiation in combination with dual SMAD inhibition was sufficient to induce PAX6 (+) and SOX1 (+) neural progenitors within 1?week, and subsequent treatment with retinoic acid (RA) and purmorphamine, which activates sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling, resulted in the highly efficient induction of HB9(+) and ISL-1(+) motor neurons within 2?weeks. After 4?weeks of monolayer differentiation in motor neuron maturation medium, hPSC-derived motor neurons were shown to mature, displaying larger somas and clearer staining for the mature motor neuron marker choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Moreover, hPSC-derived motor neurons were able to form neuromuscular junctions with human myotubes in vitro and induced acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering, as detected by Alexa 555-conjugated ?-Bungarotoxin (?-BTX), suggesting that these hPSC-derived motor neurons formed functional contacts with skeletal muscles. This differentiation system is simple and is reproducible in several hiPSC clones, thereby minimizing clonal variation among hPSC clones. We also established a system for visualizing motor neurons with a lentiviral reporter for HB9 (HB9 (e438) ::Venus). The specificity of this reporter was confirmed through immunocytochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR analysis of high-positive fractions obtained via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), suggesting its applicability for motor neuron-specific analysis. Our motor neuron differentiation system and lentivirus-based reporter system for motor neurons facilitate the analysis of disease-specific hiPSCs for motor neuron diseases.

27592518	20160906	Regional Variation of CH4 and N2 Production Processes in the Deep Aquifers of an Accretionary Prism.	Accretionary prisms are mainly composed of ancient marine sediment scraped from the subducting oceanic plate at a convergent plate boundary. Large amounts of anaerobic groundwater and natural gas, mainly methane (CH4) and nitrogen gas (N2), are present in the deep aquifers associated with an accretionary prism; however, the origins of these gases are poorly understood. We herein revealed regional variations in CH4 and N2 production processes in deep aquifers in the accretionary prism in Southwest Japan, known as the Shimanto Belt. Stable carbon isotopic and microbiological analyses suggested that CH4 is produced through the non-biological thermal decomposition of organic matter in the deep aquifers in the coastal area near the convergent plate boundary, whereas a syntrophic consortium of hydrogen (H2)-producing fermentative bacteria and H2-utilizing methanogens contributes to the significant production of CH4 observed in deep aquifers in midland and mountainous areas associated with the accretionary prism. Our results also demonstrated that N2 production through the anaerobic oxidation of organic matter by denitrifying bacteria is particularly prevalent in deep aquifers in mountainous areas in which groundwater is affected by rainfall.

18628979	20080717	The polycomb repressive complex 2 is a potential target of SUMO modifications.	The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) functions as a transcriptional repressor through a mechanism that involves methylation of Histone H3 at lysine 27. The PRC2 complex activity is essential for cellular proliferation, development, and cell fate decisions. PRC2 target genes include important regulators of development and proliferation as well as tumor suppressor genes. Consistent with this, the activity of several Polycomb group (PcG) proteins is deregulated in human cancer suggesting an important role for PcGs in tumor development. Whereas the downstream functions of PcGs are well characterized, the mechanisms of their recruitment to target genes and the regulation of their activity are not fully understood. Here we show that the two PRC2 components SUZ12 and EZH2 are sumoylated in vitro and in vivo. Among several putative sumoylation sites we have mapped the major site of SUZ12 sumoylation. Furthermore, we show that SUZ12 interacts with the E2-conjugating enzyme UBC9 both in vitro and in vivo and that mutation of the SUZ12 sumoylation site does not abolish this binding. Finally, we provide evidence that the E3-ligase PIASXbeta interacts and enhances the sumoylation of SUZ12 in vivo suggesting that PIASXbeta could function as an E3-ligase for SUZ12. Taken together, our data identify sumoylation as a novel post-translational modification of components of the PRC2 complex, which could suggest a potential new mechanism to modulate PRC2 repressive activity. Further work aimed to identify the physiological conditions for these modifications will be required to understand the role of SUZ12 and EZH2 sumoylation in PcG-mediated epigenetic regulation of transcription.

14605873	20031108	Analysis of heat-shock protein 70 gene polymorphisms and the risk of Parkinson's disease.	Parkinson's disease (PD) involves several genetic and environmental components. Heat-shock protein 70, a chaperone that is up-regulated in stress responses and that refolds protein, may be involved in the pathogenesis of PD. We have investigated the association of polymorphisms -110 A/C, +190 G/C, +1267 A/G, +2074 G/C, and +2437 G/C in the 5' and coding regions of the HSP70-1, HSP70-2, and HSP70-hom genes with the risk of PD by screening DNA samples from 274 PD patients and 183 controls in assays based on the polymerase chain reaction. There was no statistically significant difference in genotype distribution between patients and controls for the three coding-region polymorphisms in HSP70-2 and HSP70-hom. However, for HSP70-1, the overall genotype distribution was significantly different at the -110 site (P=0.004) and tended to be different at the +190 site (P=0.012) between patients and controls. The frequencies of the -110 CC and +190 CC genotypes were significantly higher in PD patients than in controls (P=0.001 and 0.006, respectively). Both -110 CC (odds ratio: 2.91; 95% CI: 1.51-5.96; P=0.002) and +190 CC (odds ratio: 3.59; 95% CI: 1.53-9.88; P=0.006) genotypes were significantly associated with PD. Reporter constructs containing the -110 A allele cloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid drove marginally higher transcriptional activity of HSP70-1 compared with the -110 C allele in both control and heat-shocked IMR32 and 293 cells. Therefore, -110 A/C may be a functional polymorphism in the 5' promoter region of HSP70-1 and may affect susceptibility to PD. 	Hum._Genet.	D003160 D016428 D013485
22852072	20120802	Identification of TNIP1 Polymorphisms by High Resolution Melting Analysis with Unlabelled Probe: Association with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.	Background. TNF?-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) interacting with protein 1 (TNIP1) acts as a negative regulator of NF-?B and plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of immune system. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) showed that the polymorphism of TNIP1 was associated with the disease risk of SLE in Caucasian. In this study, we investigated whether the association of TNIP1 with SLE was replicated in Chinese population. Methods. The association of TNIP1 SNP rs7708392 (G/C) was determined by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis with unlabeled probe in 285 SLE patients and 336 healthy controls. Results. A new SNP rs79937737 located on 5 bp upstream of rs7708392 was discovered during the HRM analysis. No association of rs7708392 or rs79937737 with the disease risk of SLE was found. Furthermore, rs7708392 and rs79937737 were in weak linkage disequilibrium (LD). Hypotypes analysis of the two SNPs also showed no association with SLE in Chinese population. Conclusions. High resolution melting analysis with unlabeled probes proves to be a powerful and efficient genotyping method for identifying and screening SNPs. No association of rs7708392 or rs79937737 with the disease risk of SLE was observed in Chinese population. 	Autoimmune_Dis	D016428

25615593	20150124	Tanshinone I induces cyclin D1 proteasomal degradation in an ERK1/2 dependent way in human colorectal cancer cells.	Tanshinone I (TAN I) as one of the naturally occurring diterpenes from Salvia miltiorrhizae Bunge (Danshen) has been reported to exhibit an anti-cancer activity. However, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Thus, we performed in vitro study to elucidate the biological mechanism by which TAN I may induce the inhibition of cell growth in human colorectal cancer cells. The treatment of TAN I suppressed the cell proliferation in HCT116 and SW480 cells and decreased the level of cyclin D1 protein. However, the mRNA level of cyclin D1 did not changed by TAN I treatment. Inhibition of proteasomal degradation by MG132 blocked TAN I-mediated cyclin D1 downregulation and the half-life of cyclin D1 was decreased in the cells treated with TAN I. In addition, phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at threonine-286 was increased by TAN I and a point mutation of threonine-286 to alanine attenuated TAN I-mediated cyclin D1 downregulation. Inhibition of ERK1/2 suppressed cyclin D1 phosphorylation and subsequent downregulation by TAN I. From these results, we suggest that TAN I-mediated cyclin D1 downregulation may result from proteasomal degradation through its ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation of threonine-286. In conclusion, the current study provides new mechanistic link between TAN I, cyclin D1 downregulation and cell growth in human colorectal cancer cells. 	Fitoterapia	D016428 D013485
27230773	20160528	Analysis of mitochondrial alterations in Brazilian patients with sensorineural hearing loss using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.	Mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been associated with aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic deafness in different populations. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of mutations in mitochondrial genes to the etiology of hearing loss in a Brazilian sample. Using mass spectrometry genotyping technology, combined with direct sequencing, 50 alterations previously described in 14 mitochondrial genes were screened in 152 patients with sensorineural hearing loss and in104 normal hearing controls. Fifteen known mitochondrial alterations were detected (G709A, A735G, A827G, G988A, A1555G, T4363C, T5628C, T5655C, G5821A, C7462T, G8363A, T10454C, G12236A, T1291C, G15927A). Pathogenic mutations in MT-RNR1 and MT-TK genes were detected in 3?% (5/152) of the patients with hearing loss. This study contributed to show the spectrum of mitochondrial variants in Brazilian patients with hearing loss. Frequency of A1555G was relatively high (2.6?%), indicating that this mutation is an important cause of hearing loss in our population. This work reports for the first time the investigation and the detection of the tRNA(Lys) G8363A mutation in Brazilian patients with maternally inherited sensorineural hearing loss. 	BMC_Med._Genet.

17164261	20061214	Fine mapping of a linkage region on chromosome 17p13 reveals that GABARAP and DLG4 are associated with vulnerability to nicotine dependence in European-Americans.	A two-stage association study was conducted targeting a genomic region on chromosome 17p13 that we reported likely to harbor susceptibility gene(s) for nicotine dependence (ND). Participants were 2037 subjects from 602 nuclear families of either African-American (AA) or European-American (EA) origin from our Mid-South Tobacco Family (MSTF) cohort. We first examined 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six genes within the targeted region of about 90 kb to determine which SNP/gene was associated with ND, assessed by smoking quantity (SQ), the heaviness of smoking index (HSI) and the Fagerstr?m Test for ND (FTND). Individual SNP analysis revealed that SNPs rs17710 and rs222843 in GABA(A) receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) exhibited a significant association with at least one age- and gender-adjusted ND measure in the EA sample and rs222843 remained significant with the FTND after correction for multiple testing (P = 0.009). Although no SNP in DLG4 was significantly associated with ND, we found a G-G haplotype with a frequency of 14.2% formed by SNPs rs2242449 and rs507506 within the gene that showed significant inverse associations with all three ND measures [P = 0.003, 0.015 and 0.024, for SQ (defined as the number of cigarettes smoked per day), HSI and FTND, respectively]. We also found an A-A haplotype with a frequency of 8.8% formed by SNPs rs17710 and rs222843 in GABARAP, which revealed significant associations with all three ND measures (P = 0.006, 0.019 and 0.024, for SQ, HSI and FTND, respectively). To confirm these findings with a better coverage of GABARAP and DLG4, we conducted a second-stage association analysis by genotyping four more SNPs for GABARAP and nine more for DLG4 on the same set of samples. Our results from the second stage of individual SNP- and/or haplotype-based association analysis supported our finding of significant association of the DLG4 gene with ND. No significant association of GABARAP or DLG4 with ND was detected in the AA sample. Further, by comparing the linkage signal before and after adjustment for the SNPs of GABARAP and DLG4, we found that inclusion of the SNPs of the two genes as covariates largely reduced the linkage signal in the EA sample, but kept nearly unchanged in the AA sample. Taken together, our two-stage association analysis and linkage analysis results indicate that the GABARAP and DLG4 genes are involved in the etiology of ND in EA smokers. Further investigation of neurobiological mechanisms of the two genes in the etiology of ND is thus warranted. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D003160 D016428 D052061
25142580	20140822	Recombinant adeno-associated virus utilizes cell-specific infectious entry mechanisms.	Understanding the entry and trafficking mechanism(s) of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) into host cells can lead to evolution in capsid and vector design and delivery methods, resulting in enhanced transduction and therapeutic gene expression. Variability of findings regarding the early entry pathway of rAAV supports the possibility that rAAV, like other viruses, can utilize more than one infectious entry pathway. We tested whether inhibition of macropinocytosis impacted rAAV transduction of HeLa cells compared to hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. We found that macropinocytosis inhibitor cytochalasin D blocked rAAV transduction of HeLa cells (&gt;2-fold) but enhanced (10-fold) transduction in HepG2 and Huh7 lines. Similar results were obtained with another macropinocytosis inhibitor, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA). The augmented transduction was due to neither viral binding nor promoter activity, affected multiple rAAV serotypes (rAAV2, rAAV2-R585E, and rAAV8), and influenced single-stranded and self-complementary virions to comparable extents. Follow-up studies using CDC42 inhibitor ML141 and p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) siRNA knockdown also resulted in enhanced HepG2 transduction. Microscopy revealed that macropinocytosis inhibition correlated with expedited nuclear entry of the rAAV virions into HepG2 cells. Enhancement of hepatocellular rAAV transduction extended to the mouse liver in vivo (4-fold enhancement) but inversely blocked heart tissue transduction (13-fold). This evidence of host cell-specific rAAV entry pathways confers a potent means for controlling and enhancing vector delivery and could help unify the divergent accounts of rAAV cellular entry mechanisms. There is a recognized need for improved rAAV vector targeting strategies that result in delivery of fewer total particles, averting untoward toxicity and/or an immune response against the vector. A critical step in rAAV transduction is entry and early trafficking through the host cellular machinery, the mechanisms of which are under continued study. However, should the early entry and trafficking mechanisms of rAAV differ across virus serotype or be dependent on host cell environment, this could expand our ability to target particular cells and tissue for selective transduction. Thus, the observation that inhibiting macropinocytosis leads to cell-specific enhancement or inhibition of rAAV transduction that extends to the organismic level exposes a new means of modulating vector targeting.

27372014	20160704	Regulation of Retinoic Acid Inducible Gene-I (RIG-I) Activation by the Histone Deacetylase 6.	Retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) is a cytosolic pathogen recognition receptor that initiates the immune response against many RNA viruses. Upon RNA ligand binding, RIG-I undergoes a conformational change facilitating its homo-oligomerization and activation that results in its translocation from the cytosol to intracellular membranes to bind its signaling adaptor protein, mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS). Here we show that RIG-I activation is regulated by reversible acetylation. Acetyl-mimetic mutants of RIG-I do not form virus-induced homo-oligomers, revealing that acetyl-lysine residues of the RIG-I repressor domain prevent assembly to active homo-oligomers. During acute infection, deacetylation of RIG-I promotes its oligomerization upon ligand binding. We identify histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) as the deacetylase that promotes RIG-I activation and innate antiviral immunity to recognize and restrict RNA virus infection. 	EBioMedicine	D016428
6517915	19841214	A variant prealbumin-related low molecular weight amyloid fibril protein in familial amyloid polyneuropathy of Japanese origin.	Amyloid fibril protein with a molecular weight of 8K daltons, in addition to one of 16K daltons, has been isolated and characterized from an autopsy sample of a patient with familial amyloid polyneuropathy in a Japanese family from Ogawa Village, Nagano Prefecture. The component was shown to react with an antiserum to normal plasma prealbumin, as did the other. Following the purification by reverse phase liquid chromatography, it was digested with trypsin and the peptides, after the purification by HPLC were sequenced. The data showed that the component was a distinct fragment whose sequence was identical with that of the residues from Gly-6 to Tyr-78 of the prealbumin, except that it had a methionine for a valine at position 25. This corresponded with the position 30 where a valine residues has been reported for the sequence of the normal plasma prealbumin. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.	D016428 D013485
24521460	20140214	Reaction mechanism of N-acetylneuraminic acid lyase revealed by a combination of crystallography, QM/MM simulation, and mutagenesis.	N-Acetylneuraminic acid lyase (NAL) is a Class I aldolase that catalyzes the reversible condensation of pyruvate with N-acetyl-d-mannosamine (ManNAc) to yield the sialic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). Aldolases are finding increasing use as biocatalysts for the stereospecific synthesis of complex molecules. Incomplete understanding of the mechanism of catalysis in aldolases, however, can hamper development of new enzyme activities and specificities, including control over newly generated stereocenters. In the case of NAL, it is clear that the enzyme catalyzes a Bi-Uni ordered condensation reaction in which pyruvate binds first to the enzyme to form a catalytically important Schiff base. The identity of the residues required for catalysis of the condensation step and the nature of the transition state for this reaction, however, have been a matter of conjecture. In order to address, this we crystallized a Y137A variant of the E. coli NAL in the presence of Neu5Ac. The three-dimensional structure shows a full length sialic acid bound in the active site of subunits A, B, and D, while in subunit C, discontinuous electron density reveals the positions of enzyme-bound pyruvate and ManNAc. These 'snapshot' structures, representative of intermediates in the enzyme catalytic cycle, provided an ideal starting point for QM/MM modeling of the enzymic reaction of carbon-carbon bond formation. This revealed that Tyr137 acts as the proton donor to the aldehyde oxygen of ManNAc during the reaction, the activation barrier is dominated by carbon-carbon bond formation, and proton transfer from Tyr137 is required to obtain a stable Neu5Ac-Lys165 Schiff base complex. The results also suggested that a triad of residues, Tyr137, Ser47, and Tyr110 from a neighboring subunit, are required to correctly position Tyr137 for its function, and this was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. This understanding of the mechanism and geometry of the transition states along the C-C bond-forming pathway will allow further development of these enzymes for stereospecific synthesis of new enzyme products.

25299655	20141010	Agrobacterium uses a unique ligand-binding mode for trapping opines and acquiring a competitive advantage in the niche construction on plant host.	By modifying the nuclear genome of its host, the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens induces the development of plant tumours in which it proliferates. The transformed plant tissues accumulate uncommon low molecular weight compounds called opines that are growth substrates for A. tumefaciens. In the pathogen-induced niche (the plant tumour), a selective advantage conferred by opine assimilation has been hypothesized, but not experimentally demonstrated. Here, using genetics and structural biology, we deciphered how the pathogen is able to bind opines and use them to efficiently compete in the plant tumour. We report high resolution X-ray structures of the periplasmic binding protein (PBP) NocT unliganded and liganded with the opine nopaline (a condensation product of arginine and ?-ketoglurate) and its lactam derivative pyronopaline. NocT exhibited an affinity for pyronopaline (K(D) of 0.6 ?M) greater than that for nopaline (KD of 3.7 ?M). Although the binding-mode of the arginine part of nopaline/pyronopaline in NocT resembled that of arginine in other PBPs, affinity measurement by two different techniques showed that NocT did not bind arginine. In contrast, NocT presented specific residues such as M117 to stabilize the bound opines. NocT relatives that exhibit the nopaline/pyronopaline-binding mode were only found in genomes of the genus Agrobacterium. Transcriptomics and reverse genetics revealed that A. tumefaciens uses the same pathway for assimilating nopaline and pyronopaline. Fitness measurements showed that NocT is required for a competitive colonization of the plant tumour by A. tumefaciens. Moreover, even though the Ti-plasmid conjugal transfer was not regulated by nopaline, the competitive advantage gained by the nopaline-assimilating Ti-plasmid donors led to a preferential horizontal propagation of this Ti-plasmid amongst the agrobacteria colonizing the plant-tumour niche. This work provided structural and genetic evidences to support the niche construction paradigm in bacterial pathogens. 	PLoS_Pathog.	D016428 D013485
26613680	20151129	Identification of a Japanese Lynch syndrome patient with large deletion in the 3' region of the EPCAM gene.	Germline deletion of the 3' portion of the Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EPCAM) gene located 5' upstream of MutS Homolog 2 (MSH2) is a novel mechanism for its inactivation in Lynch syndrome. However, its contribution in Japanese Lynch syndrome patients is poorly understood. Moreover, somatic events inactivating the remaining allele of MSH2 in cancer tissue have not been elucidated in Lynch syndrome patients with such EPCAM deletions. We identified a Japanese Lynch syndrome patient with colon cancer who evidenced germline deletion of a 4130 bp fragment of EPCAM encompassing exons 8 and 9 (c.859-672_*2170del). In normal colonic mucosa, two known fusion-transcripts of EPCAM/MSH2 generated from the rearranged gene were observed and heterozygous methylation of the MSH2 gene promoter was detected. In cancer tissue, dense methylation of MSH2 was observed and MLPA analysis demonstrated somatic deletion of the remaining EPCAM allele including exon 9, indicating that somatic deletion of EPCAM is responsible for complete inactivation of MSH2.

24501624	20140207	Complete genome sequence of Dehalobacter restrictus PER-K23(T.).	Dehalobacter restrictus strain PER-K23 (DSM 9455) is the type strain of the species Dehalobacter restrictus. D. restrictus strain PER-K23 grows by organohalide respiration, coupling the oxidation of H2 to the reductive dechlorination of tetra- or trichloroethene. Growth has not been observed with any other electron donor or acceptor, nor has fermentative growth been shown. Here we introduce the first full genome of a pure culture within the genus Dehalobacter. The 2,943,336 bp long genome contains 2,826 protein coding and 82 RNA genes, including 5 16S rRNA genes. Interestingly, the genome contains 25 predicted reductive dehalogenase genes, the majority of which appear to be full length. The reductive dehalogenase genes are mainly located in two clusters, suggesting a much larger potential for organohalide respiration than previously anticipated. 	Stand_Genomic_Sci	D016428
15188372	20040610	Molecular analysis of the MVK and TNFRSF1A genes in patients with a clinical presentation typical of the hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with periodic fever syndrome: a low-penetrance TNFRSF1A variant in a heterozygous MVK carrier possibly influences the phenotype of hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with periodic fever syndrome or vice versa.	To describe biochemical findings and the spectrum of mevalonate kinase (MVK) gene mutations as well as an associated TNFRSF1A low-penetrance variant in a series of patients with clinical features of the hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with periodic fever syndrome (HIDS). The MVK gene was sequenced in 8 children and 1 adult (including 2 siblings) fulfilling the clinical criteria for HIDS. In addition, sequencing of exons 2, 3, 4, and 6 of the TNFRSF1A gene was performed in patients with only one or no MVK mutation. Mevalonate kinase (MK) enzyme activity in leukocytes and renal excretion of mevalonic acid were also measured. Mutations in the coding region of the MVK gene were detected in 6 patients, and the most common mutation was V377I. Among these patients were 2 novel mutations, both of which were located in exon 6. These novel mutations resulted in the substitution of tryptophan (TGG) by a stop codon (TGA) at amino acid position 188 (W188X) and in the exchange of valine (GTG) for alanine (GCG) at amino acid position 203 (V203A). In 1 patient, a combination of one MVK (V377I) mutation and one TNFRSF1A (R92Q) mutation was present. The patient's clinical phenotype resembled a mixture of variant-type HIDS and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS). Her IgD values varied between normal and slightly increased, and the MK activity was in the low-normal range, while urinary mevalonate concentrations were always normal. The genotype findings indicate that a relatively small number of genes may be involved in the clinical manifestation of HIDS, with low-penetrance TNFRSF1A variants possibly influencing the HIDS phenotype or MVK mutations contributing to TRAPS.

8468348	19930401	Study of the synthesis and secretion of normal and artificial mutants of murine amyloid precursor protein (APP): cleavage of APP occurs in a late compartment of the default secretion pathway.	Amyloid precursor protein (APP) secretase plays a pivotal role in the processing of APP since its activity precludes the formation of amyloid peptide in Alzheimer's Disease. The identity and the subcellular localization of this enzyme are at this moment unknown. It is also unclear how APP escapes the activity of this enzyme when amyloid is formed. We have previously shown that APP-secretase activity is not inhibited by exogenously added proteinase inhibitors of different specificity (De Strooper, B., F. Van Leuven, and H. Van Den Berghe. 1992. FEBS (Fed. Eur. Biochem. Soc.) Lett. 308:50-53). We show here that the primary amine methylamine inhibits the secretion of APP into the medium. Furthermore, we show that a truncated form of APP, devoid of the cytoplasmic domain, is more efficiently cleaved and secreted than wild-type APP, which together with the methylamine block, shows that APP-secretase is located in a late compartment of the default constitutional secretion pathway. The sorting signals in the cytoplasmic domain of APP are therefore important in the deviation of APP from the secretase pathway. Finally we show that mutation of Arg609 to Asp in combination with Lys612 to Glu makes APP a less efficiently cleaved substrate for APP-secretase. The results are discussed in the context of recent findings on the targeting of APP and a parallel is drawn with some lysosomal glycoproteins that follow similar pathways. 	J._Cell_Biol.

12244049	20020924	HLA-B27 subtypes differentially associated with disease exhibit subtle structural alterations.	The reasons for the association of the human major histocompatibility complex protein HLA-B27 with spondyloarthropathies are unknown. To uncover the underlying molecular causes, we determined the crystal structures of the disease-associated B*2705 and the nonassociated B*2709 subtypes complexed with the same nonapeptide (GRFAAAIAK). Both differ in only one residue (Asp(116) and His(116), respectively) in the F-pocket that accommodates the peptide C terminus. Several different effects of the Asp(116) --&gt; His replacement are observed. The bulkier His(116) induces a movement of peptide C-terminal pLys(9), allowing the formation of a novel salt bridge to Asp(77), whereas the salt bridge between pLys(9) and Asp(116) is converted into a hydrogen bond with His(116). His(116) but not Asp(116) adopts two alternative conformations, one of which leads to breakage of hydrogen bonds. Water molecules near residue 116 differ with regard to number, position, and contacts made. Furthermore, F-pocket atoms exhibit higher B-factors in B*2709 than in B*2705, indicating an increased flexibility of the entire region in the former subtype. These changes induce subtle peptide conformational alterations that may be responsible for the immunobiological differences between these HLA-B27 subtypes. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
27066592	20160412	The Relationship between RUVBL1 (Pontin, TIP49, NMP238) and BCL6 in Benign and Malignant Human Lymphoid Tissues.	The human BCL6 gene, which is involved in the pathogenesis of certain human lymphomas, encodes a transcriptional repressor that is needed for germinal center B cell development and T follicular helper cell differentiation. Our goal was to identify BCL6 target genes using a cell system in which BCL6 repressive effects are inhibited followed by subtractive hybridization, and we detected the RUVBL1 (Pontin, TIP49) gene as a potential target of BCL6 repression. Here we show that the BCL6 protein significantly represses RUVBL1 transcription (6.8-fold). Knockdown of endogenous BCL6 in a human B cell lymphoma line leads to significant upregulation of RUVBL1, and there is an inverse expression pattern between the BCL6 and RUVBL1 proteins in certain human lymphomas. RUVBL1 is part of the AAA+ superfamily and participates in multiple processes, including gene transcription regulation, chromatin remodeling, and DNA repair, which, if dysregulated, may promote lymphoma development. A further understanding of the relationship between RUVBL1 and BCL6 should improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of human lymphomas. 	Biochem_Biophys_Rep	D016428
26564023	20151114	Quality of life of patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.	Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare disorder characterized by episodes of acute pain and heterotopic ossification of soft tissue, and progressively limited physical function and social participation. We aimed to determine the impact of FOP on quality of life, specifying areas or dimensions most affected. This was a transverse observational study; patients with FOP were assessed using the Short Form 36. Questionnaire results were obtained using Quality Metric software and analyzed using frequency distribution, percentages and measures of central tendency. Eight patients, mean age 30.2?years, were included. The physical dimension was the most affected, with an average of 25.5 points. The most representative items were impaired function and physical role. Physical pain was found with an average of 44.5 points. The best scores were reported in the areas of emotional role and mental health, with an average of 79 and 76 respectively. FOP is a severely disabling disease, generating a significant deterioration in quality of life secondary to progressive deterioration in physical abilities. The findings of this study demonstrate good self-rated health of participants. 	J_Child_Orthop	D016428
20593013	20100702	A major histocompatibility Class I locus contributes to multiple sclerosis susceptibility independently from HLA-DRB1*15:01.	In Northern European descended populations, genetic susceptibility for multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with alleles of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class II gene DRB1. Whether other major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes contribute to MS susceptibility is controversial. A case control analysis was performed using 958 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the MHC assayed in two independent datasets. The discovery dataset consisted of 1,018 cases and 1,795 controls and the replication dataset was composed of 1,343 cases and 1,379 controls. The most significantly MS-associated SNP in the discovery dataset was rs3135391, a Class II SNP known to tag the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele, the primary MS susceptibility allele in the MHC (O.R. = 3.04, p &lt; 1 x 10(-78)). To control for the effects of the HLA-DRB1*15:01 haplotype, case control analysis was performed adjusting for this HLA-DRB1*15:01 tagging SNP. After correction for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate = .05) 52 SNPs in the Class I, II and III regions were significantly associated with MS susceptibility in both datasets using the Cochran Armitage trend test. The discovery and replication datasets were merged and subjects carrying the HLA-DRB1*15:01 tagging SNP were excluded. Association tests showed that 48 of the 52 replicated SNPs retained significant associations with MS susceptibility independently of the HLA-DRB1*15:01 as defined by the tagging SNP. 20 Class I SNPs were associated with MS susceptibility with p-values &lt; or = 1 x 10(-8). The most significantly associated SNP was rs4959039, a SNP in the downstream un-translated region of the non-classical HLA-G gene (Odds ratio 1.59, 95% CI 1.40, 1.81, p = 8.45 x 10(-13)) and is in linkage disequilibrium with several nearby SNPs. Logistic regression modeling showed that this SNP's contribution to MS susceptibility was independent of the Class II and Class III SNPs identified in this screen. A MHC Class I locus contributes to MS susceptibility independently of the HLA-DRB1*15:01 haplotype. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061 D013485
24911161	20140610	Delayed fracture healing and increased callus adiposity in a C57BL/6J murine model of obesity-associated type 2 diabetes mellitus.	Impaired healing and non-union of skeletal fractures is a major public health problem, with morbidity exacerbated in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). DM is prevalent worldwide and affects approximately 25.8 million US adults, with &gt;90% having obesity-related type 2 DM (T2DM). While fracture healing in type 1 DM (T1DM) has been studied using animal models, an investigation into delayed healing in an animal model of T2DM has not yet been performed. Male C57BL/6J mice at 5 weeks of age were placed on either a control lean diet or an experimental high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. A mid-diaphyseal open tibia fracture was induced at 17 weeks of age and a spinal needle was used for intra-medullary fixation. Mice were sacrificed at days 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, and 35 for micro-computed tomography (?CT), histology-based histomorphometry and molecular analyses, and biomechanical testing. HFD-fed mice displayed increased body weight and impaired glucose tolerance, both characteristic of T2DM. Compared to control mice, HFD-fed mice with tibia fractures showed significantly (p&lt;0.001) decreased woven bone at day 28 by histomorphometry and significantly (p&lt;0.01) decreased callus bone volume at day 21 by ?CT. Interestingly, fracture calluses contained markedly increased adiposity in HFD-fed mice at days 21, 28, and 35. HFD-fed mice also showed increased PPAR? immunohistochemical staining at day 14. Finally, calluses from HFD-fed mice at day 35 showed significantly (p&lt;0.01) reduced torsional rigidity compared to controls. Our murine model of T2DM demonstrated delayed fracture healing and weakened biomechanical properties, and was distinctly characterized by increased callus adiposity. This suggests altered mesenchymal stem cell fate determination with a shift to the adipocyte lineage at the expense of the osteoblast lineage. The up-regulation of PPAR? in fracture calluses of HFD-fed mice is likely involved in the proposed fate switching. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061 D013485
8919033	19960101	Design and characterisation of long-R3-insulin-like growth factor-I muteins which show resistance to pepsin digestion.	Site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct pepsin-resistant, single-point mutations of the N-terminal extended IGF-I analogue, long-R3-IGF-I. In order to identify the most susceptible sites, the kinetics of long-R3-IGF-I digestion by purified porcine pepsin were determined. Pepsin initially cleaved the Leu10-Phe11 bond in the N-terminal extension peptide to generate FVN-R3-IGF-I, followed in rapid succession by cleavage at Gln15-Phe16, Tyr24-Phe25, Leu10-Val11 and Met59-Tyr60 in the IGF-I moiety. Single-point mutations at these sites were designed on the basis of the preferred cleavage bonds for pepsin, as well as amino acid substitutions less likely to disturb protein structure. These included Leu10Val, Phe16Ala, Phe25Leu, Asp53Glu and Met59Gln. All five muteins retained growth-promoting activity equivalent to or higher than that of IGF-I. In terms of pepsin susceptibility, Leu10Val and Asp53Glu were degraded as rapidly as the parent long-R3-IGF-I, Met59Gln and Phe25Leu were partially stabilised, and Phe16Ala showed a marked improvement in stability over a wide range of pepsin:substrate ratios. Accordingly, the Phe16Ala mutein, long-R3A16-IGF-I, has potential for oral applications to enhance gastric growth and repair. 	Growth_Factors	D016428 D013485
2995324	19851001	Marker-exchange mutagenesis of a pectate lyase isozyme gene in Erwinia chrysanthemi.	The phytopathogenic enterobacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi contains pel genes encoding several different isozymes of the plant-tissue-disintegrating enzyme pectate lyase (PL). The pelC gene, encoding an isozyme with an approximate isoelectric point of 8.0, was mutagenized by a three-step procedure involving (i) insertional inactivation of the cloned gene by ligation of a kan-containing BamHI fragment from pUC4K with a partial Sau3A digest of E. chrysanthemi pelC DNA in pBR322; (ii) mobilization of the pBR322 derivative from Escherichia coli to E. chrysanthemi by the helper plasmids R64drd11 and pLVC9; and (iii) exchange recombination of the pelC::kan mutation into the E. chrysanthemi chromosome by selection for kanamycin resistance in transconjugants cultured in phosphate-limited medium (which renders pBR322 unstable). The resulting E. chrysanthemi mutant was Kanr Amps, lacked pBR322 sequences, and was deficient in only one of the four major PL isozymes, PLc, as determined by activity-stained isoelectric-focusing polyacrylamide gels. The rates of PL induction and cell growth in a medium containing polygalacturonic acid as the sole carbon source were not significantly reduced in the mutant. No difference was detected in the ability of the mutant to macerate potato tuber tissue. The evidence suggests that this isozyme is not necessary for soft-rot pathogenesis. 	J._Bacteriol.

2606726	19890101	Studies of beta-thalassemia mutations in families living in three provinces in southern China.	beta-Thalassemia is a common disease in Southern China and 10 different mutations or frameshifts are responsible for most types of beta-thalassemia in this area. We studied 126 chromosomes of 80 beta-thalassemia patients from the Guangxi, Guangdong, and Sichuan Provinces using the polymerase chain reaction followed by dot-blot hybridization with specific oligonucleotide probes. The most common mutation in the three provinces is the frameshift at codons 41-42, followed by the A----T mutation at codon 17. The A----G mutation at nt -29 of the promoter is common in Sichuan but not in the other two provinces. Three mutations (T----C at nt -30; G----T at IVS-I-1, and G----C at IVS-I-5) were not observed. These data were used to initiate a prenatal diagnosis program using the same techniques for identification. Eleven fetuses at risk for beta-thalassemia have been diagnosed.

25183061	20140904	Physical justification for negative remanent magnetization in homogeneous nanoparticles.	The phenomenon of negative remanent magnetization (NRM) has been observed experimentally in a number of heterogeneous magnetic systems and has been considered anomalous. The existence of NRM in homogenous magnetic materials is still in debate, mainly due to the lack of compelling support from experimental data and a convincing theoretical explanation for its thermodynamic validation. Here we resolve the long-existing controversy by presenting experimental evidence and physical justification that NRM is real in a prototype homogeneous ferromagnetic nanoparticle, an europium sulfide nanoparticle. We provide novel insights into major and minor hysteresis behavior that illuminate the true nature of the observed inverted hysteresis and validate its thermodynamic permissibility and, for the first time, present counterintuitive magnetic aftereffect behavior that is consistent with the mechanism of magnetization reversal, possessing unique capability to identify NRM. The origin and conditions of NRM are explained quantitatively via a wasp-waist model, in combination of energy calculations. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D013486
19142020	20090115	ACTN4 gene mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms in idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.	To investigate the association between mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the gene ACTN4 in Chinese patients with idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Genomic DNA of 82 Chinese idiopathic FSGS patients and 70 healthy people were used to analyze ACTN4 gene mutations by polymerase chain reaction, direct sequencing and GenBank matching. Hair follicle DNA of novel mutated patients' parents were sequenced and alpha-actinin-4 expression in patients' kidney was examined by immunofluorescence. For SNPs, after the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test, allele association and the frequencies of genotypes were analyzed, followed by association analysis between genotypes and clinical diagnosis. We found a heterozygous candidate mutation 184T&gt;A (S62T) in 1 patient and a 5' UTR candidate mutation 1-34C&gt;T in another patient. Both patients had non-nephrotic syndrome FSGS with reduced kidney alpha-actinin-4 expression. Promoter activity analysis suggests that the 1-34C&gt;T candidate mutation may affect the transcriptional regulation of ACTN4 gene. Additionally, 6 novel silent variants and 2 novel SNPs were also found in this study. Novel SNP 484 + 87C&gt;G had a significant association with the level of urine protein excretion in these idiopathic FSGS patients. Our data suggest that mutations and SNP of ACTN4 gene may contribute to be associated with Chinese idiopathic FSGS. 	Nephron_Clin_Pract	D003160 D016428
24402172	20140110	2.7 ?m emission of high thermally and chemically durable glasses based on AlF3.	AlF3-based glasses (AlF3-YF3-CaF2-BaF2-SrF2-MgF2) with enhanced thermal and chemical stability were synthesized and compared with the well-known fluorozirconate glass (ZBLAN). The 2.7 ?m mid-infrared emission in the AlF3-based glasses was also investigated through the absorption and emission spectra. Both the temperature of glass transition and the characteristic temperatures (?T, Hr, k(gl)) of the fluoroaluminate glasses were much larger than those of the ZBLAN glasses. The corrosion phenomenon can be observed by naked-eye, and the transmittance dropped dramatically (0% at 3 ?m) when the ZBLAN glass was placed into distilled water. However, the AlF3-based glass was relatively stable. The fluoroaluminate glasses possessed large branching ratio (20%) along with the emission cross section (9.4?10(-21) cm(-2)) of the Er(3+):(4)I(11/2)?(4)I(13/2) transition. Meanwhile, the enhanced 2.7 ?m emission in highly Er(3+)-doped AYF glass was obtained. Therefore, these results showed that this kind of fluoride glass has a promising application for solid state lasers at 3 ?m. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
20406784	20100422	Identification of drought-responsive compounds in potato through a combined transcriptomic and targeted metabolite approach.	Two potato clones (Solanum tuberosum L.) of the Andean cultivar group, called Sullu and SS2613, with different drought-tolerance phenotypes were exposed to a continuously increasing drought stress in a field trial. At the physiological level, while relative leaf water contents were similar in both clones, osmotic potential was lower in Sullu and declined more strongly during drought compared with SS2613. In the drought-stressed plants, tuber yield was reduced by about 70% compared with control plants in both clones. Potato cDNA microarrays and target metabolite analysis were performed on leaves sampled at several time-points after the onset of drought. At the transcriptomic level, photosynthesis-related genes were already strongly repressed in Sullu after 28 d of withholding irrigation and even more strongly after a longer stress duration, whereas, in SS2613, repression occurred only after 49 d of soil drying; similarly, a strong perturbation of carbohydrate-related genes was observed in Sullu. At the metabolite level, differential accumulation of osmotically active solutes was observed between the two cultivars; indeed, in Sullu, contents of galactose, inositol, galactinol, proline, and proline analogues were higher upon drought stress compared with SS2613. These results point to different drought responses in the cultivars at the leaf level, with, however, similar tuber yield reductions. The previously shown tolerant clone Sullu lost part of its tolerance under the experimental conditions used here; it was, however, able to maintain an absolute yield three times higher than SS2613.

10922411	20000803	High frequency of multiple melanomas and breast and pancreas carcinomas in CDKN2A mutation-positive melanoma families.	: Inherited mutations in the CDKN2A tumor suppressor gene, which encodes the p16(INK4a) protein, and in the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) gene confer susceptibility to cutaneous malignant melanoma. We analyzed families with two or more cases of melanoma for germline mutations in CDKN2A and CDK4 to elucidate the contribution of these gene defects to familial malignant melanoma and to the occurrence of other cancer types. : The entire CDKN2A coding region and exon 2 of the CDK4 gene of an affected member of each of 52 families from southern Sweden with at least two cases of melanoma in first- or second-degree relatives were screened for mutations by use of polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Statistical tests were two-sided. : CDKN2A mutations were found in 10 (19%) of the 52 families. Nine families carried an identical alteration consisting of the insertion of arginine at position 113 of p16(INK4a), and one carried a missense mutation, in which the valine at position 115 was replaced with a glycine. The 113insArg mutant p16(INK4a) was unable to bind cdk4 and cdk6 in an in vitro binding assay. Six of the 113insArg families had at least one member with multiple primary melanomas; the 113insArg families also had a high frequency of other malignancies-in particular, breast cancer (a total of eight cases compared with the expected 2.1; P =.0014) and pancreatic cancer (a total of six cases compared with the expected 0.16; P&lt;.0001). Families with breast cancer also had a propensity for multiple melanomas in females, suggesting that a sex-dependent factor may modify the phenotypic expression of CDKN2A alterations. : Our findings confirm that the majority of CDKN2A-associated melanoma families in Sweden are due to a single founder mutation. They also show that families with the CDKN2A 113insArg mutation have an increased risk not only of multiple melanomas and pancreatic carcinoma but also of breast cancer. 	J._Natl._Cancer_Inst.

17573343	20070619	Synapsis of loxP sites by Cre recombinase.	Cre recombinase catalyzes site-specific recombination between 34-bp loxP sites in a variety of topological and cellular contexts. An obligatory step in the recombination reaction is the association, or synapsis, of Cre-bound loxP sites to form a tetrameric protein assembly that is competent for strand exchange. Using analytical ultracentrifugation and electrophoresis approaches, we have studied the energetics of Cre-mediated synapsis of loxP sites. We found that synapsis occurs with a high affinity (Kd = 10 nM) and is pH-dependent but does not require divalent cations. Surprisingly, the catalytically inactive Cre K201A mutant is fully competent for synapsis of loxP sites, yet the inactive Y324F and R173K mutants are defective for synapsis. These findings have allowed us to determine the first crystal structures of a pre-cleavage Cre-loxP synaptic complex in a configuration representing the starting point in the recombination pathway. When combined with a quantitative analysis of synapsis using loxP mutants, the structures explain how the central 8 bp of the loxP site are able to dictate the order of strand exchange in the Cre system.

Knowledge of the existence of filaggrin (FLG) gene mutations might be helpful for a subclassification of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) which can be used to introduce individualized treatments. In this work the filaggrin content in the skin is assessed using Raman spectroscopy and the results are compared to FLG genotyping of Mexican-mestizo patients. Results showed that the 2282del4 and R501X mutations present in the European population but absent in people of Asian or African descent are also present in the Mexican-mestizo population. The results also showed that patients with filaggrin gene mutations presented lower filaggrin concentrations measured using the vector correlation of their skin Raman spectra and a fixed spectrum of pure human recombinant filaggrin, these results indicate that Raman spectroscopy may be used as a noninvasive tool to detect FLG gene mutations.

20360539	20100403	Belgian Fabry study: prevalence of Fabry disease in a cohort of 1000 young patients with cerebrovascular disease.	Data on the prevalence of Fabry disease in patients with central nervous system pathology are limited and controversial. In this study, we assessed the prevalence of Fabry disease in young patients presenting with cerebrovascular disease in Belgium. In this national, prospective, multicenter study, we screened for Fabry disease in 1000 patients presenting with ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or intracranial hemorrhage; unexplained white matter lesions; or vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia. In male patients, we measured alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-GAL A) activity in dried blood spots. Female patients were screened for mutations by exonic DNA sequencing of the alpha-GAL A gene. alpha-GAL A activity was deficient in 19 men (3.5%), although all had normal alpha-GAL A gene sequences. Enzymatic deficiency was confirmed on repeat assessment in 2 male patients (0.4%). We identified missense mutations in 8 unrelated female patients (1.8%): Asp313Tyr (n=5), Ala143Thr (n=2), and Ser126Gly (n=1). The pathogenicity of the 2 former missense mutations is controversial. Ser126Gly is a novel mutation that can be linked to late-onset Fabry disease. alpha-GAL A deficiency may play a role in up to 1% of young patients presenting with cerebrovascular disease. These findings suggest that atypical variants of Fabry disease with late-onset cerebrovascular disease exist, although the clinical relevance is unclear in all cases. 	Stroke	D003160 D016428 D016448
26904066	20160224	Overexpression of an Orchid (Dendrobium nobile) SOC1/TM3-Like Ortholog, DnAGL19, in Arabidopsis Regulates HOS1-FT Expression.	Flowering in the appropriate season is critical for successful reproduction in angiosperms. The orchid species, Dendrobium nobile, requires vernalization to achieve flowering in the spring, but the underlying regulatory network has not been identified to date. The MADS-box transcription factor DnAGL19 was previously identified in a study of low-temperature treated D. nobile buds and was suggested to regulate vernalization-induced flowering. In this study, phylogenetic analysis of DnAGL9 and the MADS-box containing proteins showed that DnAGL19 is phylogenetically closely related to the SOC1-like protein from orchid Dendrobium Chao Parya Smile, DOSOC1. The orchid clade closed to but is not included into the SOC1-1/TM3 clades associated with either eudicots or monocots, suggesting that DnAGL19 is an SOC1-1/TM3-like ortholog. DnAGL19 was found to be highly expressed in pseudobulbs, leaves, roots, and axillary buds but rarely in flowers, and to be substantially upregulated in axillary buds by prolonged low-temperature treatments. Overexpression of DnAGL19 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in a small but significantly reduced time to bolting, suggesting that flowering time was slightly accelerated under normal growth conditions. Consistent with this, the A. thaliana APETELA1 (AP1) gene was expressed at an earlier stage in transgenic lines than in wild type plants, while the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene was suppressed, suggesting that altered regulations on these transcription factors caused the weak promotion of flowering. HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENE 1 (HOS1) was slightly activated under the same conditions, suggesting that the HOS1-FT module may be involved in the DnAGL19-related network. Under vernalization conditions, FT expression was significantly upregulated, whereas HOS1 expression in the transgenic A. thaliana has a level similar to that in wild type. Taken together, these results suggest that DnAGL19 controls the action of the HOS1-FT module depending on temperature cues, which could contribute to regulation of D. nobile flowering time. These data provide insights into how flowering is fine-tuned in D. nobile to acclimate the plant to seasonal changes in temperature. 	Front_Plant_Sci	D016428
23847747	20130713	?</i>Asn78Cys or<i>?</i>Gly83Cys.	Octameric hemoglobins have been developed by the introduction of surface cysteines in either the alpha or beta chain. Originally designed as a blood substitute, we report here the structure and ligand binding function; in addition the interaction with haptoglobin was studied. The recombinant Hbs (rHbs) with mutations alpha Asn78Cys or beta Gly83Cys spontaneously form octamers under conditions where the cysteines are oxidized. Oxygen binding curves and CO kinetic studies indicate a correct allosteric transition of the tetramers within the octamer. Crystallographic studies of the two rHbs show two disulfide bonds per octamer. Reducing agents may provoke dissociation to tetramers, but the octamers are stable when mixed with fresh human plasma, indicating that the reduction by plasma is slower than the oxidation by the dissolved oxygen, consistent with an enhanced stability. The octameric rHbs were also mixed with a solution of haptoglobin (Hp), which binds the dimers of Hb: there was little interaction for incubation times of 15 min; however, on longer timescales a complex was formed. Dynamic light scattering was used to follow the interaction of Hp with the alpha Asn78Cys octamer during 24 hours; a transition from a simple complex of 15 nm to a final size of 60 nm was observed. The results indicate a specific orientation of the??dimers may be of importance for the binding to haptoglobin. 	Am_J_Mol_Biol	D016428
1319679	19920601	Na+-H+ antiport and monensin effects on cytosolic pH and iodide transport in FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells.	Na+-H+ exchange may proceed via an endogenous antiporter or by exposure to the Na+ ionophore monensin. We investigated the characteristics of Na+-H+ exchange induced by antiporter stimulation and by monensin in FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells. We also examined the effects of intracellular pH (pHi) changes on iodide uptake and efflux. pHi was determined using 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. The resting pHi was 7.33 +/- 0.02 units; this level correlated directly with extracellular pH. In acid-loaded cells, Km for external Na+ activation of the antiporter was 7.1 mM and maximum velocity was 0.3801 delta pH units/min. Dimethylamiloride was 42 times more potent than amiloride in inhibiting sodium-dependent recovery in acidified cells. Metabolic inhibition reduced the initial alkalinization rate. Monensin increased pHi, and this response was dependent on extracellular Na+ and HCO3- but not on antiporter function. Low-dose monensin (1 microM) and 1 mM NH4Cl enhanced 125I uptake. High-dose monensin (100 microM), but not NH4Cl, reduced iodide uptake. Neither NH4Cl nor monensin altered 125I efflux. Thus FRTL-5 cells possess an amiloride-sensitive Na+-H+ exchanger, which is not essential for maintaining basal pHi but is affected by ATP depletion. Monensin also alkalinizes these cells but independently of the antiporter. Iodide uptake, but not efflux, is affected by changes in intracellular Na+ and H+ levels. 	Am._J._Physiol.	D016428
23028283	20121003	Mechanism of bacterial signal transduction revealed by molecular dynamics of Tsr dimers and trimers of dimers in lipid vesicles.	Bacterial chemoreceptors provide an important model for understanding signalling processes. In the serine receptor Tsr from E. coli, a binding event in the periplasmic domain of the receptor dimer causes a shift in a single transmembrane helix of roughly 0.15 nm towards the cytoplasm. This small change is propagated through the ? 22 nm length of the receptor, causing downstream inhibition of the kinase CheA. This requires interactions within a trimer of receptor dimers. Additionally, the signal is amplified across a 53,000 nm(2) array of chemoreceptor proteins, including ? 5,200 receptor trimers-of-dimers, at the cell pole. Despite a wealth of experimental data on the system, including high resolution structures of individual domains and extensive mutagenesis data, it remains uncertain how information is communicated across the receptor from the binding event to the downstream effectors. We present a molecular model of the entire Tsr dimer, and examine its behaviour using coarse-grained molecular dynamics and elastic network modelling. We observe a large bending in dimer models between the linker domain HAMP and coiled-coil domains, which is supported by experimental data. Models of the trimer of dimers, built from the dimer models, are more constrained and likely represent the signalling state. Simulations of the models in a 70 nm diameter vesicle with a biologically realistic lipid mixture reveal specific lipid interactions and oligomerisation of the trimer of dimers. The results indicate a mechanism whereby small motions of a single helix can be amplified through HAMP domain packing, to initiate large changes in the whole receptor structure. 	PLoS_Comput._Biol.

12971424	20030916	CblE type of homocystinuria: mild clinical phenotype in two patients homozygous for a novel mutation in the MTRR gene.	Patients with the cblE type of homocystinuria usually present with megaloblastic anaemia, feeding difficulties, developmental delay and cerebral atrophy. We present a 14-year-old Spanish girl (patient 1) and a 10-year-old Portuguese boy (patient 2) with cblE disease and mild clinical phenotype. The main clinical feature in both patients was persistent megaloblastic anaemia observed at 3 years and at 2 months of age, respectively. Diagnosis was made at the ages of 9 and 7 years, respectively, owing to persistent macrocytosis despite cobalamin treatment. Plasma total homocysteine values at diagnosis were 91 micromol/L and 44 micromol/L, respectively, in the absence of methylmalonic aciduria. Neurological and neurophysiological examinations were normal except for two small lesions on brain MRI suggestive of ischaemia and slight abnormalities in somatosensitive evoked potentials. Enzymatic analysis, complementation studies and clearly reduced production of methylcobalamin from 57Co-labelled cyanocobalamin indicated functional methionine synthase reductase deficiency due to the cblE defect. Genetic analysis confirmed that both patients are homozygous for a novel mutation c.1361C&gt;T in the methionine synthase reductase gene leading to a replacement of serine by leucine (S454L) in a highly conserved FAD-binding domain. We propose that homozygosity for this novel mutation may be associated with a mild phenotype, although its long-term deleterious neurological consequences remain possible. Furthermore, we propose that even in the absence of apparent neurological involvement, total homocysteine should be investigated in patients with resistant megaloblastic anaemia to detect possible mild forms of the cblE type of homocystinuria.

22573891	20120511	GBF1 bears a novel phosphatidylinositol-phosphate binding module, BP3K, to link PI3K? activity with Arf1 activation involved in GPCR-mediated neutrophil chemotaxis and superoxide production.	Most chemoattractants for neutrophils bind to the G?(i) family of heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and release G?? subunits to activate chemotaxis and superoxide production. GIT2, a GTPase-activating protein for Arf1, forms a complex with G?? and is integral for directional sensing and suppression of superoxide production. Here we show that GBF1, a guanine nucleotide exchanging factor for Arf-GTPases, is primarily responsible for Arf1 activation upon GPCR stimulation and is important for neutrophil chemotaxis and superoxide production. We find that GBF1 bears a novel module, namely binding to products of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which binds to products of PI3K?. Through this binding, GBF1 is translocated from the Golgi to the leading edge upon GPCR stimulation to activate Arf1 and recruit p22phox and GIT2 to the leading edge. Moreover, GBF1-mediated Arf1 activation is necessary to unify cell polarity during chemotaxis. Our results identify a novel mechanism that links PI3K? activity with chemotaxis and superoxide production in GPCR signaling. 	Mol._Biol._Cell	D016428 D013485
18515095	20080603	PAK1 interacts with beta-catenin and is required for the regulation of the beta-catenin signalling pathway by gastrins.	Beta-catenin regulates cell-cell adhesion by binding to E-cadherin at the cell membrane and, when translocated into the nucleus, mediates signalling by activation of transcription factors such as TCF4. Mutations of the components of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway are found in many gastrointestinal cancers. Gastrins, including amidated (Gamide) and glycine-extended (Ggly) gastrin(17), stimulate the proliferation of gastrointestinal cancer cells. Gastrins also regulate beta-catenin signalling through multiple pathways which seem to converge on p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1). In this study, we have investigated the role of PAK1 in the regulation of beta-catenin signalling by gastrins. Here we report for the first time that PAK1 associated with beta-catenin. Both Gamide and Ggly stimulated the phosphorylation and activation of beta-catenin in a PAK1-dependent manner. A kinase-inactive mutant PAK1(K299A) blocked the gastrin-stimulated dissociation of beta-catenin from E-cadherin, translocation of beta-catenin from the cell membrane to the nucleus, and association of beta-catenin with the transcription factor TCF4. The PAK1(K299A) mutant also inhibited the stimulation of the expression of c-myc and cyclin D1, and of cell proliferation and migration, by gastrins. The results indicate that gastrins regulate beta-catenin signalling through a PAK1-dependent pathway. PAK1 seems to be the point of convergence of multiple signalling pathways activated by gastrins.

18632730	20080718	Hexameric oligomerization of mitochondrial peroxiredoxin PrxIIF and formation of an ultrahigh affinity complex with its electron donor thioredoxin Trx-o.	Mitochondria from plants, yeast, and animals each contain at least one peroxiredoxin (Prx) that is involved in peroxide detoxification and redox signalling. The supramolecular dynamics of atypical type II Prx targeted to the mitochondrion was addressed in pea. Microcalorimetric (ITC) titrations identified an extremely high-affinity binding between the mitochondrial PsPrxIIF and Trx-o with a K(D) of 126+/-14 pM. Binding was driven by a favourable enthalpy change (DeltaH= -60.6 kcal mol(-1)) which was counterbalanced by unfavourable entropy changes (TDeltaS= -47.1 kcal mol(-1)). This is consistent with the occurrence of large conformational changes during binding which was abolished upon site-directed mutaganesis of the catalytic C59S and C84S. The redox-dependent interaction was confirmed by gel filtration of mitochondrial extracts and co-immunoprecipitation from extracts. The heterocomplex of PsPrxIIF and Trx-o reduced peroxide substrates more efficiently than free PsPrxIIF suggesting that Trx-o serves as an efficient and specific electron donor to PsPrxIIF in vivo. Other Trx-s tested by ITC analysis failed to interact with PsPrxIIF indicating a specific recognition of PsPrxIIF by Trx-o. PsPrxIIF exists primarily as a dimer or a hexamer depending on the redox state. In addition to the well-characterized oligomerization of classical 2-Cys Prx the results also show that atypical Prx undergo large structural reorganization with implications for protein-protein interaction and function.

22140592	20111206	Targeting the Wolbachia cell division protein FtsZ as a new approach for antifilarial therapy.	The use of antibiotics targeting the obligate bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia of filarial parasites has been validated as an approach for controlling filarial infection in animals and humans. Availability of genomic sequences for the Wolbachia (wBm) present in the human filarial parasite Brugia malayi has enabled genome-wide searching for new potential drug targets. In the present study, we investigated the cell division machinery of wBm and determined that it possesses the essential cell division gene ftsZ which was expressed in all developmental stages of B. malayi examined. FtsZ is a GTPase thereby making the protein an attractive Wolbachia drug target. We described the molecular characterization and catalytic properties of Wolbachia FtsZ. We also demonstrated that the GTPase activity was inhibited by the natural product, berberine, and small molecule inhibitors identified from a high-throughput screen. Furthermore, berberine was also effective in reducing motility and reproduction in B. malayi parasites in vitro. Our results should facilitate the discovery of selective inhibitors of FtsZ as a novel anti-symbiotic approach for controlling filarial infection. NOTE: The nucleotide sequences reported in this paper are available in GenBank? Data Bank under the accession number wAlB-FtsZ (JN616286). 	PLoS_Negl_Trop_Dis	D016428 D013485
23813023	20130702	Small hepatic veins Budd-Chiari syndrome.	Budd-Chiari syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by hepatic venous outflow obstruction at any level from the small hepatic veins to the atrio-caval junction, in the absence of heart failure or constrictive pericarditis. Various imaging modalities are available for investigating the gross hepatic vascular anatomy but there are rare forms of this disease where the obstruction is limited to the small intrahepatic veins, with normal appearance of the large hepatic veins at imaging. In this cases only a liver biopsy can demonstrate the presence of a small vessels outflow block. We report two cases of small hepatic veins Budd-Chiari syndrome. 	J._Thromb._Thrombolysis	D016428
