D016428 D013485 	The beta-1,3-exoglucanase gene exgA (exg1) of Aspergillus oryzae is required to catabolize extracellular glucan, and is induced in growth on a solid surface.	The biological role of ExgA (Exg1), a secretory beta-1,3-exoglucanase of Aspergillus oryzae, and the expression pattern of the exgA (exg1) gene were analyzed. The exgA disruptant and the exgA-overexpressing mutant were constructed, and phenotypes of both mutants were compared. Higher mycelial growth rate and conidiation efficiency were observed for the exgA-overexpressing mutant than for the exgA disruptant when beta-1,3-glucan was supplied as sole carbon source. On the other hand, no difference in phenotype was observed between them in the presence or absence of the inhibitors of cell wall beta-glucan remodeling when grown with glucose. exgA Expression was induced in growth on solid surfaces such as filter membrane and onion inner skin. A combination of poor nutrition and mycelial attachment to a hydrophobic solid surface appears to be an inducing factor for exgA expression. These data suggest that ExgA plays a role in beta-glucan utilization, but is not much involved in cell wall beta-glucan remodeling. 
1557023	19920301	Mol._Gen._Genet.	D016428 	Cloning and analysis of CUT1, a cutinase gene from Magnaporthe grisea.	A gene from Magnaporthe grisea was cloned using a cDNA clone of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides cutinase gene as a heterologous probe; the nucleotide sequence of a 2 kb DNA segment containing the gene has been determined. DNA hybridization analysis shows that the M. grisea genome contains only one copy of this gene. The predicted polypeptide contains 228 amino acids and is homologous to the three previously characterized cutinases, showing 74% amino acid similarity to the cutinase of C. gloeosporioides. Comparison with previously determined cutinase sequences suggests that the gene contains two introns, 115 and 147 bp in length. The gene is expressed when cutin is the sole carbon source but not when the carbon source is cutin and glucose together or glucose alone. Levels of intracellular and extracellular cutinase activity increase in response to growth in the presence of cutin. The activity level is higher in a transformant containing multiple copies of the cloned gene than in the parent strain. Non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels stained for esterase activity show a single major band among intracellular and extracellular proteins from cutin-grown cultures that is not present among intracellular and extracellular proteins prepared from glucose-grown or carbon-starved cultures. This band stains more intensely in extracts from the multicopy transformant than in extracts from the parent strain. We conclude that the cloned DNA contains a M. grisea gene for cutinase, which we have named CUT1. 
22575895	20120512	Microbiology_(Reading,_Engl.)	D016428 D013485 	Biochemical characterization of Aspergillus niger CfcI, a glycoside hydrolase family 18 chitinase that releases monomers during substrate hydrolysis.	The genome of the industrially important fungus Aspergillus niger encodes a large number of glycoside hydrolase family 18 members annotated as chitinases. We identified one of these putative chitinases, CfcI, as a representative of a distinct phylogenetic clade of homologous enzymes conserved in all sequenced Aspergillus species. Where the catalytic domain of more distantly related chitinases consists of a triosephosphate isomerase barrel in which a small additional (α+β) domain is inserted, CfcI-like proteins were found to have, in addition, a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM18) that is inserted in the (α+β) domain next to the substrate-binding cleft. This unusual domain structure and sequence dissimilarity to previously characterized chitinases suggest that CfcI has a novel activity or function different from chitinases investigated so far. Following its heterologous expression and purification, its biochemical characterization showed that CfcI displays optimal activity at pH 4 and 55-65 °C and degrades chitin oligosaccharides by releasing N-acetylglucosamine from the reducing end, possibly via a processive mechanism. This is the first fungal family 18 exochitinase described, to our knowledge, that exclusively releases monomers. The cfcI expression profile suggests that its physiological function is important in processes that take place during the late stages of the aspergillus life cycle, such as autolysis or sporulation. 
10993164	20000919	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 	Purification and characterization of an endo-polygalacturonase. From Aspergillus awamori.	An extracellular endo-polygalacturonase (PGase) produced by Aspergillus awamori IFO 4033 was isolated from the culture filtrate. The enzyme was purified to a homogeneous preparation with cation-exchange and size-exclusion chromatographies. Its properties were investigated, comparing them with that of recombinant pgx2 gene product, a PGase having protopectinase activity. This enzyme was a monomeric protein of 41 kDa, with an isoelectric point of pH 6.1. The characteristics of this PGase substantially coincide, with that of recombinant pgx2 gene product, and the PGase is assumed to be native pgx2 gene product. The production of PGase-X2 was confirmed to be regulated by ambient pHs. 
15194814	20040615	Mol._Biol._Cell	D016428 D013485 	Role of the alpha-glucanase Agn1p in fission-yeast cell separation.	Cell division in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe yields two equal-sized daughter cells. Medial fission is achieved by deposition of a primary septum flanked by two secondary septa within the dividing cell. During the final step of cell division, cell separation, the primary septum is hydrolyzed by an endo-(1,3)-beta-glucanase, Eng1p. We reasoned that the cell wall material surrounding the septum, referred to here as the septum edging, also must be hydrolyzed before full separation of the daughter cells can occur. Because the septum edging contains (1,3)-alpha-glucan, we investigated the cellular functions of the putative (1,3)-alpha-glucanases Agn1p and Agn2p. Whereas agn2 deletion results in a defect in endolysis of the ascus wall, deletion of agn1 leads to clumped cells that remained attached to each other by septum-edging material. Purified Agn1p hydrolyzes (1,3)-alpha-glucan predominantly into pentasaccharides, indicating an endo-catalytic mode of hydrolysis. Furthermore, we show that the transcription factors Sep1p and Ace2p regulate both eng1 and agn1 expression in a cell cycle-dependent manner. We propose that Agn1p acts in concert with Eng1p to achieve efficient cell separation, thereby exposing the secondary septa as the new ends of the daughter cells. 
19793137	20091002	J._Appl._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning, characterization and heterologous expression of the first Penicillium echinulatum cellulase gene.	Penicillium echinulatum is effective for bioconversion processes. However, nothing is known about the molecular biology of its cellulolytic system. We describe for the first time the isolation, cloning and expression of a P. echinulatum cellulase cDNA (Pe-egl1) encoding a putative endoglucanase. Pe-egl1 cDNA was identified from random sequencing of a P. echinulatum cDNA library. The deduced EGL1 protein possibly belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase family 5A, with 387 amino acid residues and strong similarity with other fungal endoglucanases. The cDNA was heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant EGL1 secreted by a Pic. pastoris recombinant strain revealed the characteristics of particular interest: an optimal activity over a broad pH range (5.0-9.0), and an optimal temperature of 60 degrees C. The recombinant EGL1 also showed high thermostability (84% of residual activity after 1 h of pre-incubation at 70 degrees C). Calcium exerted a strong stimulatory effect over EGL1 activity. Altogether, these results point to the potential application of this P. echinulatum endoglucanase in cellulose processing industries, particularly the textile one because of its biochemical properties. The characterization and heterologous expression of the first P. echinulatun cDNA inaugurates the exploitation of this potential industrial micro-organism. 
8948429	19950615	Biochem._J.	D016428 D013485 	Purification and characterization of the cell-wall-associated and extracellular alpha-glucosidases from Saccharomycopsis fibuligera.	Cell-wall-associated and extracellular alpha-glucosidases were purified to homogeneity from Saccharomycopsis fibuligera KZ growing on a medium containing cellobiose as the sole source of carbon; this substrate has the greatest inducing effect on the production of both forms of the enzyme. Depending on the source of carbon, 75-90% of the enzyme is associated with cell wall, from which it can be completely released by 1% Triton X-100 at 25 degrees C in 2 h. Both enzymes are glycoproteins in monomeric form with an apparent molecular mass of 132 kDa estimated by SDS/PAGE and 135 kDa estimated by gel filtration. N-linked carbohydrate accounts for 12% of the total mass. Both forms exhibited optimum activity at pH 5.5 and seem to be stable in the pH range 4.0-8.0 on incubation at 4 degrees C for 24 h. The cell-wall-associated form had an optimum activity at 42.5 degrees C and was stable in the absence of substrate up to 30 degrees C, while the extracellular form had optimal activity at 52.5 degrees C and was stable up to 40 degrees C. Both forms are unable to renature after thermal inactivation. The cell-wall-associated and extracellular alpha-glucosidases cleaved the same kind of substrates, from maltose to maltoheptaose, isomaltase and panose, although showing different rates of hydrolysis, and had little or no activity with polysaccharides. The extracellular form cross-reacts with antibody raised against the cell-wall-associated form, and both forms show the same peptide pattern after cleavage with chymotrypsin. The amino acid sequences of six peptides from both forms show marked similarity to those of Schwanniomyces occidentalis glucoamylase. 
15838031	20050420	J._Bacteriol.	D016428 	Alternative splicing produces two endoglucanases with one or two carbohydrate-binding modules in Mucor circinelloides.	We previously cloned three endoglucanase genes, rce1, rce2, and rce3, that were isolated from Rhizopus oryzae as the first cellulase genes from a member of the subdivision Zygomycota. In this study, two cDNAs homologous to the rce1 gene, designated the mce1 and mce2 cDNAs, were cloned from Mucor circinelloides, a member of the subdivision Zygomycota. The mce1 cDNA encoded an endoglucanase (family 45 glycoside hydrolase) having one carbohydrate-binding module (CBM), designated MCE1, and the mce2 cDNA encoded the same endoglucanase having two tandem repeated CBMs, designated MCE2. The two cDNAs contained the same sequences but with a 147-bp insertion. The corresponding genomic mce gene consisted of four exons. The mce1 cDNA was created from exons 1, 3, and 4, and the mce2 cDNA was created from exons 1, 2, 3, and 4. These results indicate that the mce1 and mce2 cDNAs were created from one genomic mce gene by alternative splicing. MCE1 and MCE2, purified to apparent homogeneity from the culture supernatant of M. circinelloides, had molecular masses of 43 and 47 kDa, respectively. The carboxymethyl cellulase specific activity of MCE2 was almost the same as that of MCE1, whereas the Avicelase specific activity of MCE2 was two times higher than that of MCE1. Furthermore, MCE2, whose two tandem CBMs might be more effective for degradation of crystalline cellulose than one CBM, was secreted only at an early culture stage when crystalline cellulose was abundant. 
21948841	20110928	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 D013486 	Proteomic and functional analysis of the cellulase system expressed by Postia placenta during brown rot of solid wood.	Brown rot basidiomycetes have an important ecological role in lignocellulose recycling and are notable for their rapid degradation of wood polymers via oxidative and hydrolytic mechanisms. However, most of these fungi apparently lack processive (exo-acting) cellulases, such as cellobiohydrolases, which are generally required for efficient cellulolysis. The recent sequencing of the Postia placenta genome now permits a proteomic approach to this longstanding conundrum. We grew P. placenta on solid aspen wood, extracted proteins from the biodegrading substrate, and analyzed tryptic digests by shotgun liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Comparison of the data with the predicted P. placenta proteome revealed the presence of 34 likely glycoside hydrolases, but only four of these--two in glycoside hydrolase family 5, one in family 10, and one in family 12--have sequences that suggested possible activity on cellulose. We expressed these enzymes heterologously and determined that they all exhibited endoglucanase activity on phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose. They also slowly hydrolyzed filter paper, a more crystalline substrate, but the soluble/insoluble reducing sugar ratios they produced classify them as nonprocessive. Computer simulations indicated that these enzymes produced soluble/insoluble ratios on reduced phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose that were higher than expected for random hydrolysis, which suggests that they could possess limited exo activity, but they are at best 10-fold less processive than cellobiohydrolases. It appears likely that P. placenta employs a combination of oxidative mechanisms and endo-acting cellulases to degrade cellulose efficiently in the absence of a significant processive component.

An exoinulinase, P-I, was purified from the culture filtrate of Penicillium sp. strain TN-88 grown on inulin. The enzyme was homogeneous as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent Mr of 81 kDa. The purified enzyme had extremely high specific activity, 743 U/mg, toward inulin. Inulinase activity was optimal at pH 4.0 and 55 degrees C. A genomic DNA and cDNAs encoding this protein were cloned and sequenced. The exoinulinase gene (inuD) was present as a single copy in the genome. An open reading frame of 2,106 bp was interrupted by a single intron of 56 bp, and encoded a 25-amino acid signal peptide and a 677-amino acid mature protein. The mature protein contained two Cys residues and eight potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The 5'-noncoding region had a putative CAAT box at position -239. Four distinct transcription start points were observed at positions -98 (A), -91 (A), -80 (A), and -76 (A) from the start codon. The exoinulinase gene inuD was located 860-bp upstream of the previously reported endoinulinase gene inuC in the opposite direction of transcription.

The nucleotide sequences of the 5' and 3' non-coding regions were found to contain motifs probably involved in initiation, regulation and termination of gene transcription. The amino-acid sequence shows significant identity with other yeast, bacterial and plant beta-fructofuranosidases. The INV1 gene from C. utilis was able to complement functionally the suc2 mutation of S. cerevisiae.

Fungal endophytes of the genera Neotyphodium and Epichlolë are important mutualistic symbionts and pathogens of many cool-season grass species. Here we report the characterization of a secreted N-acetylglucosaminidase from the Neotyphodium sp. endophyte that infects the grass Poa ampla. The enzyme was expressed at low levels within the host, and activity could be detected in the apoplastic protein fraction. Low-level expression could also be detected in endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), Chewings fescue (Festuca rubra subsp. fallax), and tall fescue (L. arundinaceum). The enzyme may function in the recycling of chitin oligomers generated from turnover of the fungal cell wall. This is the first report of a secreted N-acetylglucosaminidase expressed by an endophytic fungus in the infected host plant.

20077114	20100116	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular cloning and characterization of the novel acidic xylanase XYLD from Bispora sp. MEY-1 that is homologous to family 30 glycosyl hydrolases.	We cloned and sequenced a xylanase gene named xylD from the acidophilic fungus Bispora sp. MEY-1 and expressed the gene in Pichia pastoris. The 1,422-bp full-length complementary DNA fragment encoded a 457-amino acid xylanase with a calculated molecular mass of 49.8 kDa. The mature protein of XYLD showed high sequence similarity to both glycosyl hydrolase (GH) families 5 and 30 but was more homologous to members of GH 30 based on phylogenetic analysis. XYLD shared the highest identity (49.9%) with a putative endo-1,6-beta-D-glucanase from Talaromyces stipitatus and exhibited 21.1% identity and 34.3% similarity to the well-characterized GH family 5 xylanase from Erwinia chrysanthemi. Purified recombinant XYLD showed maximal activity at pH 3.0 and 60 degrees C, maintained more than 60% of maximal activity when assayed at pH 1.5-4.0, and had good thermal stability at 60 degrees C and remained stable at pH 1.0-6.0. The enzyme activity was enhanced in the presence of Ni(2+) and beta-mercaptoethanol and inhibited by some metal irons (Hg(2+), Cu(2+), Pb(2+), Mn(2+), Li(+), and Fe(3+)) and sodium dodecyl sulfate. The specific activity of XYLD for beechwood xylan, birchwood xylan, 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronoxylan, and oat spelt xylan was 2,463, 2,144, 2,020, and 1,429 U mg(-1), respectively. The apparent K (m) and V (max) values for beechwood xylan were 5.6 mg ml(-1) and 3,622 micromol min(-1) mg(-1), respectively. The hydrolysis products of different xylans were mainly xylose and xylobiose.

The yeast Lipomyces kononenkoae (Lk) secretes a highly active raw starch-degrading alpha-amylase (alpha Amy) that liberates reducing groups from glucose polymers containing both alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 bonds. The LKA1 gene encoding this industrially important alpha Amy was cloned as a 2261-bp cDNA fragment from a glucose-derepressed mutant (IGC4052B) of Lk and characterized. The nucleotide (nt) sequence of the cDNA fragment was determined, revealing an open reading frame of 1872 bp, encoding a 596 amino-acid (aa) mature protein (LKA1) with a calculated M(r) of 65,706. The similarity between the aa sequence of LKA1 and those of other alpha Amy showed four common conserved regions characteristic of the alpha Amy protein family: (A) 264DIVVNH269, (B) 349GLRIDTVKH357, (B') 376GEVFD380 and (C) 439FLENQD444. The deduced aa sequence revealed significant homology to the aa sequences of the Aspergillus oryzae, Schwanniomyces occidentalis and Saccharomycopsis fibuligera alpha Amy, various bacterial cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferases, a beta-amylase and the 5'-region of a glucoamylase. LKA1 was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) under the control of the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1) promoter and Northern blot analysis showed the presence of a single 2.3-kb transcript. The 28-aa signal peptide of the LKA1 protein efficiently directed its secretion into the medium when expressed in Sc. 
20652740	20100724	Glycoconj._J.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and characterization of a sialidase from the filamentous fungus, Aspergillus fumigatus.	A gene encoding a putative sialidase was identified in the genome of the opportunistic fungal pathogen, Aspergillus fumigatus. Computational analysis showed that this protein has Asp box and FRIP domains, it was predicted to have an extracellular localization, and a mass of 42 kDa, all of which are characteristics of sialidases. Structural modeling predicted a canonical 6-bladed beta-propeller structure with the model's highly conserved catalytic residues aligning well with those of an experimentally determined sialidase structure. The gene encoding the putative Af sialidase was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Enzymatic characterization found that the enzyme was able to cleave the synthetic sialic acid substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUN), and had a pH optimum of 3.5. Further kinetic characterization using 4-methylumbelliferyl alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminylgalactopyranoside revealed that Af sialidase preferred alpha2-3-linked sialic acids over the alpha2-6 isomers. No trans-sialidase activity was detected. qPCR studies showed that exposure to MEM plus human serum induced expression. Purified Af sialidase released sialic acid from diverse substrates such as mucin, fetuin, epithelial cell glycans and colominic acid, though A. fumigatus was unable to use either sialic acid or colominic acid as a sole source of carbon. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the fungal sialidases were more closely related to those of bacteria than to sialidases from other eukaryotes.

D016428 D013486 	Purification and characterization of beta 2-tomatinase, an enzyme involved in the degradation of alpha-tomatine and isolation of the gene encoding beta 2-tomatinase from Septoria lycopersici.	Lycopersicon species often contain the toxic glycoalkaloid alpha-tomatine, which is proposed to protect these plants from general microbial infection. however, fungal pathogens of tomato often are tolerant to alpha-tomatine and detoxification of alpha-tomatine may be how these pathogens avoid this potential barrier. As an initial step to evaluate this possibility, we have purfied to homogeneity a beta-1,2-D glucosidase from the tomato pathogen Septoria lycopersici that hydrolyzes the beta-1,2-D glucosyl bond on the tetrasaccharide moiety of alpha-tomatine to produce beta2-tomatine. The enzyme is a 110-kDa protein with a pI of 4.5 and a Km for alpha-tomatine of 62 microM. Little or no activity was detected on a variety of other glycosides. The gene encoding this protein was isolated and contains an open reading frame of 803 amino acids that shares sequence homology with several other beta-D-glucosidases. When S. lycopersici was incubated with alpha-tomatine, beta2-tomatinase mRNA accumulated, suggesting that the enzyme is substrate inducible. Aspergillus nidulans expressed ¿beta2-tomatinase¿ activity when transformed with this gene but transformants were still sensitive to alpha-tomatine.

An endoglucanase gene (celA) was isolated from a genomic library of the ruminal fungus Orpinomyces joyonii. DNA sequence analysis of celA revealed an intronless gene encoding a typical signal sequence, an N-terminal catalytic domain, two repeated regions linked by a short Ser/Thr-rich linker and a domain of unknown function. The deduced amino acid sequence of the catalytic domain showed homology with the family 5 cellulases. While the catalytic domain of CelA was not homologous to the catalytic domain of the endoglucanase gene (EG3) from the ruminal bacterium Fibrobacter succinogenes, the repeated regions of CelA were very similar to the noncatalytic domain of EG3. This suggests that evolutionary shuffling of endoglucanase domains might occur among bacteria and fungi within the anaerobic ecosystem of the rumen. The celA gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the periplasmic endoglucanase was used for the characterization studies of the enzyme. CelA exhibited both endoglucanase and xylanase activities. Its pH optimum was 4 and the temperature optimum was 40 degrees C. Deletion analysis showed that the repeated sequences and C-terminal domain of CelA were not required for enzyme activity.

A gene (ech-42; previously named ThEn-42) coding for one of the endochitinases produced by the biocontrol agent Trichoderma harzianum IMI206040 was cloned and characterized. Expression of the cDNA clone in Escherichia coli resulted in bacteria with chitinase activity. This chitinase has been shown to have lytic activity on Botrytis cinerea cell walls in vitro. The ech-42 gene was assigned to a double chromosomal band (chromosome V or VI) upon electrophoretic separation and Southern analysis of the chromosomes. Primer extension analysis indicated that transcription of the gene begins preferentially 109 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon. Expression of ech-42 was strongly enhanced during direct interaction of the mycoparasite with a phytopathogenic fungus when confronted in vitro and by growing it in minimal medium containing chitin as sole carbon source. Similarly, light-induced sporulation resulted in high levels of transcript, suggesting developmental regulation of the gene. The implications of these findings are discussed.

D016428 	Cloning and amplification of the gene encoding an extracellular beta-glucosidase from Trichoderma reesei: evidence for improved rates of saccharification of cellulosic substrates.	We have cloned and determined the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding an extracellular beta-glucosidase (bgl1) from the cellulolytic fungus Trichoderma reesei. The predicted open reading frame of the bgl1 gene is interrupted by two putative introns of 70 and 64 bp and encodes a protein with a calculated molecular weight of 75,341. The genomic segment encoding bgl1 was cloned into a vector that contained the selectable marker gene, amdS. Transformation of T. reesei with this vector resulted in several stable transformant strains all possessing an increased copy number of the bgl1 gene integrated into the genome together with elevated rates of glucose production from avicel. One transformant produced an extracellular cellulase with a five-fold increase in the rate of production of glucose from cellobiose, a 33% rate increase from avicel, and a 17% increase from phosphoric acid swollen cellulose. These data suggest that the cellulolytic activity of T. reesei strains may be specifically improved by transformation with cloned cellulase genes.

Sakano et al., Denpun Kagaku, 37, 39-41 (1990)] was separated into two active components, IPU F1 (pI = 5.0) and IPU F2 (pI = 4.9), using a Mono-P HR 5/20 column. The substrate specificity on pullulan and panose, specific activity, optimum pH, pH stability, and susceptibility to certain chemical reagents were similar between IPU F1 and IPU F2. IPU F1 and F2 had an identical N-terminal amino acid sequence, A-V-T-A-D-N-S-Q-L-L. However, IPU F1 contained more total carbohydrate (15.3%) than IPU F2 (12.4%). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the molecular weight of IPU F1 (71,000) was greater than that of IPU F2 (69,000). After deglycosylation of IPU F1 and F2 with peptide-N-glycosidase F, the molecular weights of IPU F1 and F2 became 59,000.

A cDNA designated celE cloned from Orpinomyces PC-2 consisted of an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide (CelE) of 477 amino acids. CelE was highly homologous to CelBs of Orpinomyces (72.3% identity) and neocallimastix (67.9% identity) and like them it had a non-catalytic repeated peptide domain (NCRPD) at the C-terminal end. The catalytic domain of CelE was homologous to glycosyl hydrolases of Family 5, found in several anaerobic bacteria. The gene of celE was devoid of introns. The recombinant proteins CelE and CelB of Orpinomyces PC-2 randomly hydrolyzed carboxymethylcellulose and cello-oligosaccharides in the pattern of endoglucanases. The results indicated that a gene of bacterial origin was duplicated to form celE and celB of Orpinomyces PC-2.

Apparently axe1 codes for the two forms, pI 7 and pI 6.8, of acetyl xylan esterase previously characterized. The axe1 encodes 302 amino acids including a signal sequence and a putative propeptide. The catalytic domain has no amino acid similarity with the reported acetyl xylan esterases but has a clear similarity, especially in the active site, with fungal cutinases which are serine esterases. Similarly to serine esterases, the axe1 product was inactivated with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. At its C-terminus it carries a cellulose binding domain of fungal type, which is separated from the catalytic domain by a region rich in serine, glycine, threonine and proline. The binding domain can be separated from the catalytic domain by limited proteolysis without affecting the activity of the enzyme towards acetylated xylan, but abolishing its capability to bind cellulose. 
12374797	20021011	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 	Purification, characterization, cloning, and expression of a novel xyloglucan-specific glycosidase, oligoxyloglucan reducing end-specific cellobiohydrolase.	A novel oligoxyloglucan-specific glycosidase, oligoxyloglucan reducing end-specific cellobiohydrolase (OXG-RCBH), with a molecular mass of 97 kDa and a pI of 6.1, was isolated from the fungus Geotrichum sp. M128. Analysis of substrate specificity using various xyloglucan oligosaccharide structures revealed that OXG-RCBH had exoglucanase activity. It recognized the reducing end of oligoxyloglucan and released two glucosyl residue segments from the main chain. The full-length cDNA encoding OXG-RCBH was cloned and sequenced, and it had a 2436-bp open reading frame encoding an 812amino acid protein. The deduced protein showed approximately 35% identity to members of glycoside hydrolase family 74. The cDNA encoding OXG-RCBH was then expressed in Escherichia coli. Although the recombinant protein was expressed as an inclusion body, renaturation was successful, and enzymatically active recombinant OXG-RCBH was obtained. 
11257513	20010321	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D013485 	Expression of Pleurotus eryngii aryl-alcohol oxidase in Aspergillus nidulans: purification and characterization of the recombinant enzyme.	Aryl-alcohol oxidase (AAO) is an extracellular flavoenzyme involved in lignin biodegradation by some white-rot fungi. The enzyme catalyzes the extracellular oxidation of aromatic alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes. The electron acceptor is molecular oxygen yielding H(2)O(2) as the product. Herein we describe, for the first time, the expression of AAO from Pleurotus eryngii in the ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans. The activity of the recombinant enzyme in A. nidulans cultures is much higher than found in the extracellular fluid of P. eryngii. The recombinant enzyme showed the same molecular mass, pI and catalytic properties as that of the mature protein secreted by P. eryngii. The enzymic properties are also similar to those reported from other Pleurotus and Bjerkandera species. 
18720841	20080830	Wei_Sheng_Wu_Xue_Bao	D004740 D016428 D013485 	[Molecular cloning and heterologous expression of a new xylanase gene from Verticillium dahliae].	Fungus Verticillium dahliae caused greensickness of cotton and xylanase is necessary in this pathogenesis. Cloning xylanase gene from V. dahliae and heterologous expression might obtain new xylanase. By comparing the amino acid sequences of over 10 xylanases in 11 families from fungi through BLAST, we found 2 highly conserved regions, with a fragment of about 150 amino acids coding sequence in between. Degenerate primers complementary to the ends of these two conserved regions were designed to amplify the in-between sequence from V. dahliae. The whole xylanse gene containing intron was achieved by Genome-walking PCR method. A 63 bp intron was found through BLAST, the whole cDNA xynG was cloned by Dpn I -mediated PCR to delete intron. The cDNA was inserted into pHBM905 and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115, xylanase-secreting transformants were selected on plate containing RBB-xylan. The transformant with the largest halos was selected for study the character of xylanase. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 72% identity with endo-beta-1, 4-xylanase from Cochliobolus carbonum and C. sativus in the GenBank, which means xynG is a new xylanase gene. The optimal pH of the purified recombinant enzyme was pH6. It remains over 50% relative activity at pH5-9. The optimal temperature was 45 degrees C. The most favorable substrate for the xylanase (XYNG) is Beechwood xylan. Mg2+ and Ca2+ improve the enzyme activity by 33.7% and 16.6%, respectively. EDTA, beta-Mercaptoethanol and NaN3 don't affect the enzyme activity. Tween-80 and DMSO activated enzyme activity by 28.4% and 12.8%. Hg+, in concentration of 5 mmol/L, also inhibited the enzyme activity. The xylanase gene xynG was firstly cloned from the fungi that caused greensickness of cotton. The xylanase genes containing one intron can be efficiently cloned from plant pathogens and white-rot fungi using strategy in this research. It is unnecessary to explore enzyme expression condition and measure enzyme activity of the original strain. Enzyme character analysis showed that the XynG have potential application in the production of xylo-oligosaccharide and the improvement of bread quality. 
3246351	19881230	Gene	D016428 D013485 	The identification, molecular cloning and characterisation of a gene from Phanerochaete chrysosporium that shows strong homology to the exo-cellobiohydrolase I gene from Trichoderma reesei.	We have identified a genomic DNA fragment from the lignin-degrading fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium (P.c.) that hybridizes to a DNA probe encoding part of the exo-cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) gene of Trichoderma reesei (T.r.). This fragment has been subcloned and its nucleotide sequence determined. We demonstrate that it could encode a 516 residue protein that shows strong homology with the known protein sequence of CBHI from T.r. Comparison of the two nucleotide sequences identifies two regions within the P.c. sequence that are not represented in T.r. Further inspection of these regions reveals sequences closely related to the conserved elements of filamentous fungal introns. We conclude that the P.c. genomic sequence contains the same number of introns (2) as found in T.r. but that these are located at different relative positions within the two genes. The transcript from the P.c. sequence is induced in the presence of cellulose but not by glucose and we therefore conclude that this sequence represents the first cellulase gene to have been described from this organism. 
12594027	20030221	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D016428 D013485 	Purification and characterization of an exo-beta-1,3-glucanase produced by Trichoderma asperellum.	Trichoderma asperellum produces at least two extracellular beta-1,3-glucanases upon induction with cell walls from Rhizoctonia solani. A beta-1,3-glucanase was purified by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. A typical procedure provided 35.7-fold purification with 9.5% yield. The molecular mass of the purified exo-beta-1,3-glucanases was 83.1 kDa as estimated using a 12% (w/v) SDS-electrophoresis slab gel. The enzyme was only active toward glucans containing beta-1,3-linkages and hydrolyzed laminarin in an exo-like fashion to form glucose. The K(m) and V(max) values for exo-beta-1,3-glucanase, using laminarin as substrate, were 0.087 mg ml(-1) and 0.246 U min(-1), respectively. The pH optimum for the enzyme was pH 5.1 and maximum activity was obtained at 55 degrees C. Hg(2+) strongly inhibited the purified enzyme.

We describe the identification and expression cloning of two novel enzymes, a beta-glucanase and an aspartic protease, secreted from the basidiomycetous yeast Phaffia rhodozyma. A cDNA library from P. rhodozyma CBS 6938 was constructed, and full-length cDNA encoding an endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase (bg1) and an aspartic protease (pr1) were cloned by expression cloning in Saccharomyces cerevisiae W3124. The bg1 cDNA encodes a 424-residue precursor protein with a putative signal peptide. The pr1 cDNA encodes a 405-residue prepropolypeptide with an 81-residue leader peptide. The aspartic protease was purified and characterized. It has a molecular mass of 36 kDa, an isoelectric point of pH 7.5, a pH activity optimum at 4.0-6.0, and a temperature activity optimum around 40 degrees C. Both enzymes show only low sequence identity to other known enzymes. 
1429462	19921101	J._Bacteriol.	D016428 	Purification of two chitinases from Rhizopus oligosporus and isolation and sequencing of the encoding genes.	Two chitinases were purified from Rhizopus oligosporus, a filamentous fungus belonging to the class Zygomycetes, and designated chitinase I and chitinase II. Their N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined, and two synthetic oligonucleotide probes corresponding to these amino acid sequences were synthesized. Southern blot analyses of the total genomic DNA from R. oligosporus with these oligonucleotides as probes indicated that one of the two genes encoding these two chitinases was contained in a 2.9-kb EcoRI fragment and in a 3.6-kb HindIII fragment and that the other one was contained in a 2.9-kb EcoRI fragment and in a 11.5-kb HindIII fragment. Two DNA fragments were isolated from the phage bank of R. oligosporus genomic DNA with the synthetic oligonucleotides as probes. The restriction enzyme analyses of these fragments coincided with the Southern blot analyses described above and the amino acid sequences deduced from their nucleotide sequences contained those identical to the determined N-terminal amino acid sequences of the purified chitinases, indicating that each of these fragments contained a gene encoding chitinase (designated chi 1 and chi 2, encoding chitinase I and II, respectively). The deduced amino acid sequences of these two genes had domain structures similar to that of the published sequence of chitinase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, except that they had an additional C-terminal domain. Furthermore, there were significant differences between the molecular weights experimentally determined with the two purified enzymes and those deduced from the nucleotide sequences for both genes. Analysis of the N- and C-terminal amino acid sequences of both chitinases and comparison of them with the amino acid sequences deduced from the nucleotide sequences revealed posttranslational processing not only at the N-terminal signal sequences but also at the C-terminal domains. It is concluded that these chitinases are synthesized with pre- and prosequences in addition to the mature enzyme sequences and that the prosequences are located at the C terminal.

D003160 D016428 	Induction of a Cryphonectria parasitica cellobiohydrolase I gene is suppressed by hypovirus infection and regulated by a GTP-binding-protein-linked signaling pathway involved in fungal pathogenesis.	Extracellular cellulase activity is readily induced when the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica is grown on cellulose substrate as the sole carbon source. However, an isogenic C. parasitica strain rendered hypovirulent due to hypovirus infection failed to secrete detectable cellulase activity when grown under parallel conditions. Efforts to identify C. parasitica cellulase-encoding genes resulted in the cloning of a cellobiohydrolase (exoglucanase, EC 3.2.1.91) gene designated chb-1. Northern blot analysis revealed an increase in cbh-1 transcript accumulation in a virus-free virulent C. parasitica strain concomitant with the induction of extracellular cellulase activity. In contrast, induction of cbh-1 transcript accumulation was suppressed in an isogenic hypovirus-infected strain. Significantly, virus-free C. parasitica strains rendered hypovirulent by transgenic cosuppression of a GTP-binding protein alpha subunit were also found to be deficient in the induction of cbh-1 transcript accumulation. 
21708265	20110629	Protein_Expr._Purif.	D016428 D013485 	Expression, purification and characterization of two thermostable endoglucanases cloned from a lignocellulosic decomposing fungi Aspergillus fumigatus Z5 isolated from compost.	Two genes encoding endoglucanase, designated as egl2 and egl3, were cloned from a lignocellulosic decomposing fungus Aspergillus fumigatus Z5 and were successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris X33. The deduced amino acid sequences encoded by egl2 and egl3 showed strong similarity with the sequence of glycoside hydrolase family 5. SDS-PAGE and western blot assays indicated that the recombinant enzymes were secreted into the culture medium and the zymogram analysis confirmed that both recombinant enzymes had endoglucanase activity. Several biochemical properties of the two recombinant enzymes were studied: Egl2 and Egl3 showed optimal activity at pH 5.0 and 4.0, respectively, and at 50 and 60°C, respectively. Egl2 and Egl3 showed good pH stability in the range of 4-7, and both enzymes demonstrated good thermostability ranging from 30 to 60°C. The K(m) and V(max) values using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, soluble cellulose, polymerized by β-1, 4-linked glucose residues) as the substrate at optimal conditions were determined. The activities of the enzymes on a variety of cello-oligosaccharide substrates were investigated, and Egl2 can hydrolyze cellotetraose and cellopentaose but not cellobiose and cellotriose, whereas Egl3 can hydrolyze all cello-oligosaccharides, except cellobiose. 
18563407	20080620	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning and characterization of a novel chitinase gene (chi46) from Chaetomium globosum and identification of its biological activity.	Chitinases play a major role in the defensive strategies of plants against fungal pathogens. In the current study, the gene for a 46-kDa endochitinase (chi46) was cloned from Chaetomium globosum, an important biocontrol fungus. The corresponding complementary deoxyribonucleic acid sequence was 1,350 bp in length, encoding 449 amino acid residues. The temporal expression of chi46, in response to the treatments of cell walls of six pathogens and confrontation against two fungal pathogens, was measured in C. globosum using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The expression of chi46 can be highly induced by exposure to the cell walls of plant pathogens and living pathogens, suggesting a role in plant disease resistance. The chi46 gene was inserted into the pPIC9 vector and transferred into the cells of Pichia pastoris GS115 for heterologous expression. The optimal reaction conditions for chitinase CHI46 activity were: 45 degrees C, pH of 5.0, and 5 mmol l(-1) of Cu2+. The maximum enzyme activity was 1.42 U ml(-1) following exposure to the cell wall chitin of Septoria tritici. The CHI46 enzyme can efficiently degrade cell walls of the phytopathogenic Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium oxysporum, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Valsa sordida, S. tritici, and Phytophthora sojae, demonstrating that it may be involved in the biocontrol mechanism of C. globosum. 
7859305	19940901	Curr._Genet.	D016428 	Isolation and characterization of a 1,4-beta-endoxylanase gene of A. awamori.	An enzyme with a particular 1,4-beta-xylanase activity was identified and purified from wheat-bran culture medium of an Aspergillus awamori strain. With oligonucleotides based on the N-terminal amino-acid sequence of the enzyme, the exlA gene of A. awamori, encoding 1,4-beta-xylanase A, has been cloned. Based on the deduced amino-acid sequence, 1,4-beta-xylanase A is produced as a 211 amino-acid-residue-long precursor, which is converted post-translationally into a 184-aa residue-long mature protein. Transformation of the original A. awamori strain with multiple copies of the exlA gene resulted in a 40-fold overproduction of 1,4-beta-xylanase A. The overproduced enzyme has the same biochemical and enzymological properties as the wild-type enzyme.

A type II arabinogalactan-degrading enzyme (FoGal1) was purified from Fusarium oxysporum 12S, and the corresponding cDNA was isolated. FoGal1 had high similarity to enzymes of glycoside hydrolase family 5. Treatment of larch wood arabinogalactan with the recombinant enzyme indicated that FoGal1 is a beta-1,6-galactanase that preferentially debranches beta-1,6-galactobiose from the substrate.

We have succeeded in the expression of Stereum purpureum endopolygalacturonase I (EndoPG I) using the Pichia expression system and in purification of the three kinds of recombinant EndoPG I, which have one to three sugar chains by using CM52 column chromatography. The sugar chains which were added to EndoPG I were the M8, M9, and/or M10 high-mannose type. The results of LC-MS analysis showed that recombinant EndoPG Is were randomly glycosylated at four N-glycosylation sites. From the thermal denaturation curves of the recombinant enzymes, it was suggested that EndoPG I differing in thermal stability was included in the sample after purification. Therefore, we investigated the disulfide bonds of recombinant EndoPG I by LC-MS analysis. As a result, peptides without a second or third disulfide bond were detected. This result is the first indicating that there are incomplete enzymes in terms of disulfide bonds in the Pichia expression system.

Pyranose 2-oxidase (POX) was recovered from Phanerochaete chrysosporium BKM-F-1767 solid substrate culture using mild extraction conditions and was purified. (13)C-nuclear magnetic resonance confirmed production of d-arabino-hexos-2-ulose (glucosone) from d-glucose with the oxidase. Peptide fingerprints generated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of tryptic digests and analysis of the corresponding cDNA revealed a structurally unusual sequence for the P. chrysosporium POX. Relatively high levels of pox transcript were detected under carbon-starved culture conditions but not under nutrient sufficiency. This regulation pattern is similar to that observed for lignin peroxidases, manganese peroxidases, and glyoxal oxidase of P. chrysosporium, supporting evidence that POX has a role in lignocellulose degradation.

A system of synergistically acting enzymes homologous to Trichoderma reesei.	A physico-chemical and structural characterization of three 1,4-beta-D-glucan cellobiohydrolases (EC. 3.2.1.91), isolated from a culture filtrate of the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, reveals that the cellulolytic enzyme secretion pattern and thus the general degradation strategy for P. chrysosporium is similar to that of Trichoderma reesei. Partial sequence data show that two of the isolated enzymes, i.e., CBHI, pI 3.82 and CBH62, pI 4.85, are homologous with CBHI and EGI from T. reesei; while, the third, i.e., CBH50, pI 4.87, is homologous to T. reesei CBHII. Limited proteolysis with papain cleaved each of the three enzymes into two domains: a core protein which retained full catalytic activity against low molecular weight substrates and a peptide fragment corresponding to the cellulose binding domain, in striking similarity to the structural organization of T. reesei. CBHI and CBH62 have their binding domain located at the C-terminus, whereas in CBH50 it is located at the N-terminus. It is evident that synergistically acting cellobiohydrolases is a general requirement for efficient hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose by cellulolytic fungi.

An endo-beta-1,4-xylanase gene was cloned from Neocallimastix patriciarum 27 in the bacteriophage vector lambda gtWES lambda B and was subcloned into the plasmid vectors pUC18 and pUC19 in which xylanase activity was expressed in both orientations. The xylanase was located in the periplasmic space of the host, Escherichia coli HB101. The pH and temperature optima for periplasmic xylanase activity were 6.2 and 40 degrees C, respectively, and the Km for oat spelt xylan hydrolysis was 0.89 mg.mL-1. It also exhibited hydrolytic activity on carboxymethyl cellulose that was equivalent to 28% of the activity exhibited by the enzyme on xylan. It bound to crystalline cellulose, but lacked hydrolytic activity on amorphous cellulose. SDS-PAGE followed by zymogram analysis showed active bands of 68, 58, and 51 kDa. Isoelectric focusing in gels combined with zymogram analysis showed one band of xylanase activity with a pI of 3.6.

D016428 D013485 	Cloning and expression of a thermostable alpha-galactosidase from the thermophilic fungus Talaromyces emersonii in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.	The first gene (alpha-gal1) encoding an extracellular alpha-Dgalactosidase from the thermophilic fungus Talaromyces emersonii was cloned and characterized. The alpha-gal1 gene consisted of an open reading frame of 1,792 base pairs interrupted by six introns that encoded a mature protein of 452 amino acids, including a 24 amino acid secretory signal sequence. The translated protein had highest identity with other fungal alpha-galactosidases belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 27. The alpha-gal1 gene was overexpressed as a secretory protein with an N-terminal histidine tag in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. Recombinant alpha-Gal1 was secreted into the culture medium as a monomeric glycoprotein with a maximal yield of 10.75 mg/l and purified to homogeneity using Hisbinding nickel-agarose affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme was maximally active at 70 degrees C, pH 4.5, and lost no activity over 10 days at 50 degrees C. alpha-Gal1 followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Vmax of 240.3 micronM/min/mg, Km of 0.294 mM) and was inhibited competitively by galactose (Km obs of 0.57 mM, Ki of 2.77 mM). The recombinant T. emersonii alpha-galactosidase displayed broad substrate preference, being active on both oligo- and polymeric substrates, yet had strict specificity for the alpha-galactosidic linkage. Owing to its substrate preference and noteworthy stability, alpha-Gal1 is of particular interest for possible biotechnological applications involving the processing of plant materials. 
16461639	20060208	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013486 	Identification of an endo-beta-1,4-D-xylanase from Magnaporthe grisea by gene knockout analysis, purification, and heterologous expression.	Magnaporthe grisea, a destructive ascomycetous pathogen of rice, secretes cell wall-degrading enzymes into a culture medium containing purified rice cell walls as the sole carbon source. From M. grisea grown under the culture conditions described here, we have identified an expressed sequenced tag, XYL-6, a gene that is also expressed in M. grisea-infected rice leaves 24 h postinoculation with conidia. This gene encodes a protein about 65% similar to endo-beta-1,4-D-glycanases within glycoside hydrolase family GH10. A M. grisea knockout mutant for XYL-6 was created, and it was shown to be as virulent as the parent strain in infecting the rice host. The proteins secreted by the parent strain and by the xyl-6Delta mutant were each fractionated by liquid chromatography, and the collected fractions were assayed for endo-beta-1,4-D-glucanase or endo-beta-1,4-D-xylanase activities. Two protein-containing peaks with endo-beta-1,4-D-xylanase activity secreted by the parent strain are not detectable in the column eluant of the proteins secreted by the mutant. The two endoxylanases (XYL-6alpha and XYL-6beta) from the parent were each purified to homogeneity. N-terminal amino acid sequencing indicated that XYL-6alpha is a fragment of XYL-6beta and that XYL-6beta is identical to the deduced protein sequence encoded by the XYL-6 gene. Finally, XYL-6 was introduced into Pichia pastoris for heterologous expression, which resulted in the purification of a fusion protein, XYL-6H, from the Pichia pastoris culture filtrate. XYL-6H is active in cleaving arabinoxylan. These experiments unequivocally established that the XYL-6 gene encodes a secreted endo-beta-1,4-D-xylanase. 
7824933	19950120	Science	D016428 D013485 	Host range of a plant pathogenic fungus determined by a saponin detoxifying enzyme.	Antifungal saponins occur in many plant species and may provide a preformed chemical barrier to attack by phytopathogenic fungi. Some fungal pathogens can enzymatically detoxify host plant saponins, which suggests that saponin detoxification may determine the host range of these fungi. A gene encoding a saponin detoxifying enzyme was cloned from the cereal-infecting fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis. Fungal mutants generated by targeted gene disruption were no longer able to infect the saponin-containing host oats but retained full pathogenicity to wheat (which does not contain saponins). Thus, the ability of a phytopathogenic fungus to detoxify a plant saponin can determine its host range. 
19269961	20090310	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485 	Molecular basis of arabinobio-hydrolase activity in phytopathogenic fungi: crystal structure and catalytic mechanism of Fusarium graminearum GH93 exo-alpha-L-arabinanase.	The phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium graminearum secretes a very diverse pool of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) aimed at degrading plant cell walls. alpha-l-Arabinanases are essential GHs participating in the complete hydrolysis of hemicellulose, a natural resource for various industrial processes, such as bioethanol or pharmaceuticals production. Arb93A, the exo-1,5-alpha-l-arabinanase of F. graminearum encoded by the gene fg03054.1, belongs to the GH93 family, for which no structural data exists. The enzyme is highly active (1065 units/mg) and displays a strict substrate specificity for linear alpha-1,5-l-arabinan. Biochemical assays and NMR experiments demonstrated that the enzyme releases alpha-1,5-l-arabinobiose from the nonreducing end of the polysaccharide. We determined the crystal structure of the native enzyme and its complex with alpha-1,5-l-arabinobiose, a degradation product of alpha-Me-1,5-l-arabinotetraose, at 1.85 and 2.05A resolution, respectively. Arb93A is a monomeric enzyme, which presents the six-bladed beta-propeller fold characteristic of sialidases of clan GHE. The configuration of the bound arabinobiose is consistent with the retaining mechanism proposed for the GH93 family. Catalytic residues were proposed from the structural analysis, and site-directed mutagenesis was used to validate their role. They are significantly different from those observed for GHE sialidases.

Lignin and Mn peroxidases are two families of isozymes produced by the lignin-degrading fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium under nutrient nitrogen or carbon limitation. We purified to homogeneity the three major Mn peroxidase isozymes, H3 (pI = 4.9), H4 (pI = 4.5), and H5 (pI = 4.2). Amino-terminal sequencing of these isozymes demonstrates that they are encoded by different genes. We also analyzed the regulation of these isozymes in carbon- and nitrogen-limited cultures and found not only that the lignin and Mn peroxidases are differentially regulated but also that differential regulation occurs within the Mn peroxidase isozyme family. The isozyme profile and the time at which each isozyme appears in secondary metabolism differ in both nitrogen- and carbon-limited cultures. Each isozyme also responded differently to the addition of a putative inducer, divalent Mn. The stability of the Mn peroxidases in carbon- and nitrogen-limited cultures was also characterized after cycloheximide addition. The Mn peroxidases are more stable in carbon-limited cultures than in nitrogen-limited cultures. They are also more stable than the lignin peroxidases. These data collectively suggest that the Mn peroxidase isozymes serve different functions in lignin biodegradation. 
16822232	20060711	Biochem._J.	D016428 D013485 	A new group of exo-acting family 28 glycoside hydrolases of Aspergillus niger that are involved in pectin degradation.	The fungus Aspergillus niger is an industrial producer of pectin-degrading enzymes. The recent solving of the genomic sequence of A. niger allowed an inventory of the entire genome of the fungus for potential carbohydrate-degrading enzymes. By applying bioinformatics tools, 12 new genes, putatively encoding family 28 glycoside hydrolases, were identified. Seven of the newly discovered genes form a new gene group, which we show to encode exoacting pectinolytic glycoside hydrolases. This group includes four exo-polygalacturonan hydrolases (PGAX, PGXA, PGXB and PGXC) and three putative exo-rhamnogalacturonan hydrolases (RGXA, RGXB and RGXC). Biochemical identification using polygalacturonic acid and xylogalacturonan as substrates demonstrated that indeed PGXB and PGXC act as exo-polygalacturonases, whereas PGXA acts as an exo-xylogalacturonan hydrolase. The expression levels of all 21 genes were assessed by microarray analysis. The results from the present study demonstrate that exo-acting glycoside hydrolases play a prominent role in pectin degradation. 
11254576	20010320	Infect._Immun.	D016428 D013487 	Cloning and expression of the gene which encodes a tube precipitin antigen and wall-associated beta-glucosidase of Coccidioides immitis.	We report the structure and expression of the Coccidioides immitis BGL2 gene which encodes a previously characterized 120-kDa glycoprotein of this fungal respiratory pathogen. The glycoprotein is recognized by immunoglobulin M tube precipitin (TP) antibody present in sera of patients with coccidioidomycosis, a reaction which has been used for serodiagnosis of early coccidioidal infection. The deduced amino acid sequence of BGL2 shows 12 potential N glycosylation sites and numerous serine-threonine-rich regions which could function as sites for O glycosylation. In addition, the protein sequence includes a domain which is characteristic of family 3 glycosyl hydrolases. Earlier biochemical studies of the purified 120-kDa TP antigen revealed that it functions as a beta-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21). Its amino acid sequence shows high homology to several other reported fungal beta-glucosidases which are members of the family 3 glycosyl hydrolases. Results of previous studies have also suggested that the 120-kDa beta-glucosidase participates in wall modification during differentiation of the parasitic cells (spherules) of C. immitis. In this study we showed that expression of the BGL2 gene is elevated during isotropic growth of spherules and the peak of wall-associated BGL2 enzyme activity correlates with this same phase of parasitic cell differentiation. These data support our hypothesis that the 120-kDa beta-glucosidase plays a morphogenetic role in the parasitic cycle of C. immitis. 
20143777	20100211	J._Agric._Food_Chem.	D016428 D013485 	An acidophilic and acid-stable beta-mannanase from phialophora sp. p13 with high mannan hydrolysis activity under simulated gastric conditions.	A beta-mannanase gene, man5AP13, was cloned from Phialophora sp. P13 and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature enzyme, MAN5AP13, had highest identity (53%) with the glycoside hydrolase family 5 beta-mannanase from Bispora sp. MEY-1. The purified recombinant beta-mannanase was acidophilic and acid stable, exhibiting maximal activity at pH 1.5 and retaining >60% of the initial activity over the pH range 1.5-7.0. The optimum temperature was 60 degrees C. The specific activity, K(m) and V(max) for locust bean gum substrate were 851 U/mg, 2.5 mg/mL, and 1667.7 U/min.mg, respectively. The enzyme had excellent activity and stability under simulated gastric conditions, and the released reducing sugar of locust bean gum was significantly enhanced by one-fold in simulated gastric fluid containing pepsin in contrast to that without pepsin. All these properties make MAN5AP13 a potential additive for use in the food and feed industries. 
10517025	19991012	Mol._Plant_Microbe_Interact.	D016428 D013485 	Tomatinase from Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici defines a new class of saponinases.	Plants produce a variety of secondary metabolites, many of which have antifungal activity. Saponins are plant glycosides that may provide a preformed chemical barrier against phytopathogenic fungi. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici and other tomato pathogens produce extracellular enzymes known as tomatinases, which deglycosylate alpha-tomatine to yield less toxic derivatives. We have cloned and characterized the cDNA and genomic DNA encoding tomatinase from the vascular pathogen of tomato F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. This gene encodes a protein (FoTom1) with no amino acid sequence homology to any previously described saponinase, including tomatinase from Septoria lycopersici. Although FoTom1 is related to family 10 glycosyl hydrolases, which include mainly xylanases, it has no detectable xylanase activity. We have overexpressed and purified the protein with a bacterial heterologous system. The purified enzyme is active and cleaves alpha-tomatine into the less toxic compounds tomatidine and lycotetraose. Tomatinase from F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici is encoded by a single gene whose expression is induced by alpha-tomatine. This expression is fully repressed in the presence of glucose, which is consistent with the presence of two putative CREA binding sites in the promoter region of the tomatinase gene. The tomatinase gene is expressed in planta in both roots and stems throughout the entire disease cycle of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. 
7987261	19940801	Biochem._Mol._Biol._Int.	D016428 	Expression cloning, purification and characterization of a beta-1,4-mannanase from Aspergillus aculeatus.	A cDNA library from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus aculeatus was constructed in the yeast expression vector pYES2.0 and used to isolate 57 full length cDNA's encoding beta-1,4-mannanase by expression in S. cerevisiae. The positive clones were identified on agar plates containing 0.2% azurine dyed cross-linked mannan by the formation of blue halos around the colonies. All clones represented transcripts of the same mannanase gene (man1). The gene was sub-cloned into an Aspergillus expression vector and transformed into Aspergillus oryzae for overexpression and purification of the enzyme. The recombinant enzyme had a molecular weight of 45 kDa, an isoelectric point of pH 4.5, a pH optimum of pH 5.0 and a temperature optimum of 60-70 degrees. 
15541293	20041116	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D013485 	Purification and characterization of two forms of endo-beta-1,4-mannanase from a thermotolerant fungus, Aspergillus fumigatus IMI 385708 (formerly Thermomyces lanuginosus IMI 158749).	Two extracellular endo-beta-1,4-mannanases, MAN I (major form) and MAN II (minor form), were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from a locust bean gum-spent culture fluid of Aspergillus fumigatus IMI 385708 (formerly Thermomyces lanuginosus IMI 158749). Molecular weights of MAN I and MAN II estimated by SDS-PAGE were 60 and 63 kDa, respectively. IEF afforded several glycoprotein bands with pI values in the range of 4.9-5.2 for MAN I and 4.75-4.9 for MAN II, each exhibiting enzyme activity. MAN I as well as MAN II showed highest activity at pH 4.5 and 60 degrees C and were stable in the pH range 4.5-8.5 and up to 55 degrees C. In accordance with the ability of the enzymes to catalyze transglycosylation reactions, 1H NMR spectroscopy of reaction products generated from mannopentaitol confirmed the retaining character of both enzymes. Both MAN I and MAN II exhibited essentially identical kinetic parameters for polysaccharides and a similar hydrolysis pattern of various oligomeric and polymeric substrates. Both beta-mannanases contained identical internal amino acid sequence corresponding to glycoside hydrolase family 5 and also a cellulose-binding module. These data suggested that both MAN I and MAN II are products of the same gene differing in posttranslational modification. Indeed, the corresponding gene was identified within the recently sequenced Aspergillus fumigatus genome (http://sanger.ac.uk/Projects/A_fumigatus/). 
20547381	20100616	J._Biosci._Bioeng.	D016428 	Cell-associated beta-xylosidase from Aureobasidium pullulans ATCC 20524: Purification, properties, and characterization of the encoding gene.	A cell-associated enzyme exhibiting beta-xylosidase activity was purified from the cell extract of the dimorphic fungus, Aureobasidium pullulans strain ATCC 20524, grown on oat spelt xylan. The purified enzyme was homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE, which showed an apparent M(r) of 88.5 kDa. beta-Xylosidase activity was optimal at pH 3.5 and 70 degrees C. The enzyme exhibited apparent K(m) and V(max) values of 3.5 mM and 263 micromol/mg/min, respectively, for p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside. The enzyme also showed some alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase activity. Southern blot analysis indicated that the beta-xylosidase gene (xylI) was present as a single copy in the genome. The genomic DNA and cDNA encoding this protein were cloned and sequenced. The open reading frame of 2415 bp was interrupted by two introns of 54 and 52 bp, and it encoded a presumed signal peptide of 20 residues and a mature protein of 785 residues with a calculated M(r) of 85,045 Da and a deduced isoelectric point of 4.57. The protein was N-glycosylated and possessed 16 potential N-glycosylation sites. Two distinct transcription start points of the xylI gene were present at nt -32 (A) and -26 (A) from the start codon. The xylI cDNA was functionally expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The deduced amino acid sequence of the xylI gene product was 49% identical to the Talaromyces emersonii beta-xylosidase Bxl1, which belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 3. 
11722552	20011128	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Endoglucanase I from the edible straw mushroom, Volvariella volvacea. Purification, characterization, cloning and expression.	We isolated an endoglucanase, EG1, from culture fluid of Volvariella volvacea grown on crystalline cellulose by ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography, and preparative PAGE. EG1 has a molecular mass of 42 kDa as determined by SDS/PAGE and an isoelectric point of 7.7. Enzyme-catalysed hydrolysis of carboxymethyl-cellulose (CM-cellulose) is maximal at pH 7.5 and 55 degrees C. EG1 also hydrolysed phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose and filter paper (at rates of 29% and 6%, respectively, compared with CM-cellulose), but did not hydrolyse crystalline cellulose, cotton, oat spelt xylan, and birchwood xylan. Degenerate primers based on the N-terminal sequences of purified EGI and a protease-generated fragment were used to generate cDNA fragments encoding a portion of the EG1 gene (eg1), and RACE was used to obtain full-length cDNA clones. The cDNA of eg1 contained an ORF of 1167 bp encoding 389 amino acids. The amino-acid sequence from Ala24 to Thr40 corresponded to the N-terminal sequence of the purified protein. The first 23 amino acids are presumed to be a signal peptide. V. volvacea EG1 has been assigned to glycoside hydrolase family 5 according to the classification of glycohydrolases based on amino-acid sequence similarities. Transcripts of eg1 were detected in total RNA from mycelium grown on cellulose but not from mycelium grown on glucose. Cellobiose also induced eg1 expression in 1- to 4-day-old cultures but the signal intensity was lower than that obtained with cellulose. Catabolite repression was observed 24 h after addition of 1% (w/v) glucose, alpha-lactose, beta-lactose, xylose, mannose, sorbose or fructose to medium containing 1% (w/v) crystalline cellulose. Eg1 was expressed at a high level in the yeast, Pichia pastoris, and the catalytic activity of the recombinant EG1 was confirmed. 
8358830	19930701	Curr._Genet.	D016428 	Cloning and expression of Hormoconis resinae glucoamylase P cDNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	A cDNA coding for glucoamylase P of Hormoconis resinae was cloned using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe coding for a peptide fragment of the purified enzyme and polyclonal anti-glucoamylase antibodies. Nucleotide-sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1848 base pairs coding for a protein of 616 amino-acid residues. Comparison with other fungal glucoamylase amino-acid sequences showed homologies of 37-48%. The glucoamylase cDNA, when introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the control of the yeast ADC1 promoter, directed the secretion of active glucoamylase P into the growth medium. 
15870328	20050505	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013486 	Processive endoglucanase active in crystalline cellulose hydrolysis by the brown rot basidiomycete Gloeophyllum trabeum.	Brown rot basidiomycetes have long been thought to lack the processive cellulases that release soluble sugars from crystalline cellulose. On the other hand, these fungi remove all of the cellulose, both crystalline and amorphous, from wood when they degrade it. To resolve this discrepancy, we grew Gloeophyllum trabeum on microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel) and purified the major glycosylhydrolases it produced. The most abundant extracellular enzymes in these cultures were a 42-kDa endoglucanase (Cel5A), a 39-kDa xylanase (Xyn10A), and a 28-kDa endoglucanase (Cel12A). Cel5A had significant Avicelase activity--4.5 nmol glucose equivalents released/min/mg protein. It is a processive endoglucanase, because it hydrolyzed Avicel to cellobiose as the major product while introducing only a small proportion of reducing sugars into the remaining, insoluble substrate. Therefore, since G. trabeum is already known to produce a beta-glucosidase, it is now clear that this brown rot fungus produces enzymes capable of yielding assimilable glucose from crystalline cellulose.

D016428 D013485 	Molecular characterization of a new acetyl xylan esterase (AXEII) from edible straw mushroom Volvariella volvacea with both de-O-acetylation and de-N-acetylation activity.	A new Volvariella volvacea gene encoding a carbohydrate esterase (CE) family 4 acetyl xylan esterase (AXE) (designated as VvaxeII) was cloned and characterized. The coded polypeptide had 253 amino acid residues, with the first 19 serving as a secretion signal peptide. The VvaxeII transcript levels were high when the fungus was grown on oat spelt xylan, cellobiose, microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethyl-cellulose, lactose, galactose, and chitin from crab as carbon sources. The recombinant VvAXEII produced by expression of VvaxeII in Pichia pastoris exhibited activity toward acetylated oat spelt xylan and various chitinous substrates, but was totally inactive against artificial aromatic acetates such as beta-nitrophenyl, 4-methylumbelliferyl, and alpha-naphthyl acetates. Enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis was maximal at pH 7.0 and 60 degrees C, and reciprocal plots revealed an apparent K(m) value of 1.42 mg mL(-1) and a V(max) value of 833 IU micromol(-1) protein using glycol chitin as a substrate. The recombinant VvAXEII requires activation by bivalent cations such as Co2+ and Mg2+. Interestingly, the recombinant VvAXEII showed no deacetylation activity to fully acetylated monosaccharides such as xylose tetraacetate.

The extracellular beta-1,3-glucanases in the supernatant of cell culture of the marine yeast Williopsis saturnus WC91-2 was purified to homogeneity with a 115-fold increase in specific beta-1,3-glucanase activity as compared to that in the supernatant by ultrafiltration, gel filtration chromatography, and anion-exchange chromatography. According to the data from sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the molecular mass of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 47.5 kDa. The purified enzyme could convert laminarin into monosaccharides and disaccharides, but had no killer toxin activity. The optimal pH and temperature of the purified enzyme were 4.0 and 40 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme was significantly stimulated by Li+, Ni2+, and Ba2+. The enzyme was inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, iodoacetic acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, ethylene glycol bis(2-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, and 1,10-phenanthroline. The Km and Vmax values of the purified enzyme for laminarin were 3.07 mg/ml and 4.02 mg/min ml, respectively. Both matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectroscopy and DNA sequencing identified a peptide YIEAQLDAFEKR which is the conserved motif of the beta-1,3-glucanases from other yeasts.

Aureobasidium pullulans Y-2311-1 produced four major xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8) with pI values of 4.0, 7.3, 7.9, and 9.4 as revealed by isoelectric focusing and zymogram analysis when grown for 4 days on 1.0% oat spelt xylan. The enzyme with a pI of 9.4 was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, chromatography on a DEAE-Sephadex A-50 column, and gel filtration with a Sephadex G-75 column. The enzyme had a mass of about 25 kDa as determined by both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography. The purified enzyme had a Km of 7.6 mg . ml(-1) and Vmax of 2,650 micromol . min(-1) . mg(-1) for birchwood xylan at 28 degrees C and pH 4.5. It lacked activity towards carboxymethylcellulose, cellobiose, starch, mannan, p-nitrophenyl (pNP)-beta-D-xylopyranoside, pNP-beta-D-glucopyranoside, pNP-alpha-D-glucopyranoside, pNP-beta-D-cellobioside, pNP-beta-D-fucopyranoside, or pNP-alpha-D-galactopyranoside. The predominant end products of birchwood xylan or xylohexaose hydrolysis were xylobiose and xylose. The enzyme had the highest activity of pH 4.8 and 54 degrees C. Sixty percent of the activity remained after the enzyme had been incubated at 55 degrees C and pH 4.5 for 30 min. The sequence of the first 68 amino acid residues at the amino terminus showed homology to those of several other xylonases. Immunoblot analysis with antiserum raised against the purified xylanase revealed that two immunologically related polypeptides of 25 and 22 kDa were produced in A. pullulans cultures containing oat spelt xylan or xylose as carbon sources but not in cultures containing glycerol or glucose.

A xylanase-encoding gene, xyn11F63, was isolated from Penicillium sp. F63 CGMCC1669 using degenerated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and thermal asymmetric interlaced (TAIL)-PCR techniques. The full-length chromosomal gene consists of 724 bp, including a 73-bp intron, and encodes a 217 amino acid polypeptide. The deduced amino acid sequence of xyn11F63 shows the highest identity of 70% to the xylanase from Penicillium sp. strain 40, which belongs to glycosyl hydrolases family 11. The gene was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris, and its activity in the culture medium reached 516 U ml(-1). After purification to electrophoretic homogeneity, the enzyme showed maximal activity at pH 4.5 and 40 degrees C, was stable at acidic buffers of pH 4.5-9.0, and was resistant to proteases (proteinase K, trypsin, subtilisin A, and alpha-chymotrypsin). The specific activity, K (m), and V (max) for oat spelt xylan substrate was 7,988 U mg(-1), 22.2 mg ml(-1), and 15,105.7 micromol min(-1) mg(-1), respectively. These properties make XYN11F63 a potential economical candidate for use in feed and food industrial applications. 
23170978	20121123	Microb_Biotechnol	D016428 D013485 	Transcriptional response of lignin-degrading enzymes to 17α-ethinyloestradiol in two white rots.	Fungal, ligninolytic enzymes have attracted a great attention for their bioremediation capabilities. A deficient knowledge of regulation of enzyme production, however, hinders the use of ligninolytic fungi in bioremediation applications. In this work, a transcriptional analyses of laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP) production by two white rots was combined with determination of pI of the enzymes and the evaluation of 17α-ethinyloestradiol (EE2) degradation to study regulation mechanisms used by fungi during EE2 degradation. In the cultures of Trametes versicolor the addition of EE2 caused an increase in laccase activity with a maximum of 34.2 ± 6.7 U g⁻¹ of dry mycelia that was observed after 2 days of cultivation. It corresponded to a 4.9 times higher transcription levels of a laccase-encoding gene (lacB) that were detected in the cultures at the same time. Simultaneously, pI values of the fungal laccases were altered in response to the EE2 treatment. Like T. versicolor, Irpex lacteus was also able to remove 10 mg l⁻¹ EE2 within 3 days of cultivation. While an increase to I. lacteus MnP activity and MnP gene transcription levels was observed at the later phase of the cultivation. It suggests another metabolic role of MnP but EE2 degradation.

The gene encoding xylanase G2 (xynG2) was isolated from a genomic library of Aspergillus oryzae KBN616, used for making shoyu koji. The structural part of xynG2 was found to be 767 bp. The nucleotide sequence of cDNA amplified by RT-PCR showed that the open reading frame of xynG2 was interrupted by a single intron which was 71 bp in size and encoded 232 amino acids. Direct N-terminal amino acid sequencing showed that the precursor of XynG2 had a signal peptide of 44 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence of XynG2 has strong similarity to other family 11 xylanases from fungi. The xynG2 gene was successfully overexpressed in A. oryzae and the overpexpressed XynG2 was purified. The molecular weight of XynG2 estimated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 21,000. This was almost the same as the molecular weight of 20,047 calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence. The purified XynG2 showed an optimum activity at pH 6.0 and 58 degrees C. It had a Km of 5.1 mg/ml and a Vmax of 123 micromol/min/mg when birch wood xylan was used as a substrate. 
23645193	20130507	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485 	Insights into exo- and endoglucanase activities of family 6 glycoside hydrolases from Podospora anserina.	The ascomycete Podospora anserina is a coprophilous fungus that grows at late stages on droppings of herbivores. Its genome encodes a large diversity of carbohydrate-active enzymes. Among them, four genes encode glycoside hydrolases from family 6 (GH6), the members of which comprise putative endoglucanases and exoglucanases, some of them exerting important functions for biomass degradation in fungi. Therefore, this family was selected for functional analysis. Three of the enzymes, P. anserina Cel6A (PaCel6A), PaCel6B, and PaCel6C, were functionally expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. All three GH6 enzymes hydrolyzed crystalline and amorphous cellulose but were inactive on hydroxyethyl cellulose, mannan, galactomannan, xyloglucan, arabinoxylan, arabinan, xylan, and pectin. PaCel6A had a catalytic efficiency on cellotetraose comparable to that of Trichoderma reesei Cel6A (TrCel6A), but PaCel6B and PaCel6C were clearly less efficient. PaCel6A was the enzyme with the highest stability at 45°C, while PaCel6C was the least stable enzyme, losing more than 50% of its activity after incubation at temperatures above 30°C for 24 h. In contrast to TrCel6A, all three studied P. anserina GH6 cellulases were stable over a wide range of pHs and conserved high activity at pH values of up to 9. Each enzyme displayed a distinct substrate and product profile, highlighting different modes of action, with PaCel6A being the enzyme most similar to TrCel6A. PaCel6B was the only enzyme with higher specific activity on carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) than on Avicel and showed lower processivity than the others. Structural modeling predicts an open catalytic cleft, suggesting that PaCel6B is an endoglucanase.  
9492270	19980310	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	pgaE encodes a fourth member of the endopolygalacturonase gene family from Aspergillus niger.	In the present study, the molecular and basic biochemical characterization of endopolygalacturonase E, the fourth Aspergillus niger N400 endopolygalacturonase, is reported. The entire endopolygalacturonase E gene consists of 1293 bp interrupted by three short introns (50, 50, and 59 bp, respectively) as concluded from the cDNA sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence comprises 378 residues that include 39 N-terminal amino acids of the prepropeptide. The calculated Mr and pI of the mature protein are 35,584 and 3.6, respectively. Compared with other endopolygalacturonases from A. niger N400, the mature protein endopolygalacturonase E has the highest sequence identity with endopolygalacturonase C (77.6%) followed by endopolygalacturonase I (57.6%) and endopolygalacturonase II (54.3%). For overproduction of endopolygalacturonase E, an A. niger multicopy strain was used that was transformed with a promoter gene fusion construct that directs expression from the glycolytic A. niger pyruvate kinase promoter. The enzyme was purified and characterized as an endopolygalacturonase based on product analysis after polygalacturonate hydrolysis and on bond cleavage frequencies of oligogalacturonates of different degree of polymerisation (n = 2-7). The pH optimum was 3.8. The Km and Vmax for polygalacturonate hydrolysis were 2.5 +/- 0.4 mg x ml(-1) and 1.3 +/- 0.2 microkat x mg(-1), respectively. A subsite map was calculated by the combination of the methods of Suganuma et al. [Suganuma, T., Matsuno, R., Ohnishi, M. & Hiromi, K. (1978) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 84, 293-316] and Nitta et al. [Nitta, Y., Mizushima, M., Hiromi, K. & Ono, S. (1971) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 69, 567-576]. This indicated that the enzyme was composed of at least five subsites.

D016428 D013485 	De novo synthesis, constitutive expression of Aspergillus sulphureus beta-xylanase gene in Pichia pastoris and partial enzymic characterization.	The endo-beta-1, 4-xylanase gene xynA from Aspergillus sulphureus, encoded a lack-of-signal peptide protein of 184 amino acids, was de novo synthesized by splicing overlap extension polymerase chain reaction according to Pichia pastoris protein's codon bias. The synthetic DNA, composed of 572 nucleotides, was ligated into the downstream sequence of an alpha-mating factor in a constitutive expression vector pGAPzalphaA and electrotransformed into the P. pastoris X-33 strain. The transformed yeast screened by Zeocin was able to constitutively secrete the xylanase in yeast-peptone-dextrose liquid medium. The heterogenous DNA was stabilized in the strain by 20-times passage culture. The recombinant enzyme was expressed with a yield of 120 units/mL under the flask culture at 28 degrees C for 3 days. The enzyme showed optimal activity at 50 degrees C and pH 2.4-3.4. Residual activity of the raw recombinant xylanase was not less than 70% when fermentation broth was directly heated at 80 degrees C for 30 min. However, the dialyzed xylanase supernatant completely lost the catalytic activity after being heated at 60 degrees C for 30 min. The recombinant xylanase showed no obvious activity alteration by being pretreated with Na(2)HPO(4)-citric acid buffer of pH 2.4 for 2 h. The xylanase also showed resistance to certain metal ions (Na(+), Mg(2+), Ca(2+), K(+), Ba(2+), Zn(2+), Fe(2+), and Mn(2+)) and EDTA. These biochemical characteristics suggest that the recombinant xylanase has a prospective application in feed industry as an additive.

We previously described five arabinanolytic enzymes secreted by Penicillium chrysogenum 31B into the culture medium. Here, we describe a sixth such enzyme, termed AbnS1. Analysis of the reaction products of debranched arabinan revealed that AbnS1 cleaved the substrate in an endo manner. The optimum temperature of AbnS1 was 60°C, which was much higher than that of a cold-adapted endo-arabinanase (Abnc) produced by this strain. The abns1 cDNA gene encoding AbnS1 was isolated by in vitro cloning. The deduced amino acid sequence of AbnS1 had 70% identity with that of Abnc. Pfam analysis revealed a Glyco_hydro_43 domain at positions 28 to 318 of AbnS1. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that the abns1 gene was constitutively expressed in P. chrysogenum 31B at a low level, although the expression was only slightly induced with arabinose and arabinan. In contrast, expression of the abnc gene encoding Abnc was strongly induced by arabinose, arabinitol, and arabinan. Using debranched arabinan as substrate, recombinant AbnS1 (rAbnS1) accumulated arabinobiose and arabinotriose as the major products. Recombinant Abnc (rAbnc) released mainly arabinotriose and lesser amounts of arabinose and arabinobiose than did rAbnS1. Branched arabinan was completely degraded to arabinose by the action of rAbnS1 or rAbnc in combination with α-L: -arabinofuranosidase.

Xylanase A, one of several extracellular xylanases produced by Schizophyllum commune strain Delmar when grown in submerged culture with spruce sawdust as carbon source, was purified 43-fold in 25% yield with respect to total xylanase activity. Although some polysaccharide was strongly bound to the purified enzyme, the complex could be dissociated by sodium dodecyl sulfate and appeared homogeneous on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the protein, calculated from the electrophoretic mobility, was 33,000. The molecular activity of the purified xylanase A, determined with soluble larch xylan as substrate, was 1.4 X 10(5) min-1, with xylobiose and xylose as the major products. The enzyme had a pH optimum of 5.0 and a temperature optimum of 55 degrees C in 10-min assays. The acid hydrolysate of xylanase A was rich in aspartic acid and aromatic amino acids. The sequence of 27 residues at the amino terminus showed no homology with known sequences of other proteins. 
10491168	19990922	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 D013485 	Purification and properties of a basic endo-beta-1,6-glucanase (BGN16.1) from the antagonistic fungus Trichoderma harzianum.	The antagonistic fungus Trichoderma harzianum CECT 2413 produces at least two extracellular beta-1,6-glucanases, among other hydrolases acting on polysaccharides from fungal cell walls, when grown in chitin as the sole carbon source. We have previously reported on the purification and biochemical characterization of the major activity, which corresponds to an acidic enzyme named BGN16.2 [de la Cruz, J., Pintor-Toro, J.A., Benítez, T. & Llobell, A. (1995) J. Bacteriol. 177, 1864-1871]. In this paper, we report on the purification to electrophoretical homogeneity of BGN16.1, the second beta-1, 6-glucanase enzyme. BGN16.1 was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by adsorption and digestion of pustulan (a beta-1,6-glucan), chromatofocusing and gel-filtration chromatography. BGN16.1 is a non-glycosylated protein with an apparent molecular mass of 51 kDa and a basic isoelectric point (pI 7.4-7.7). The enzyme was active toward substrates containing beta-1,6-glycosidic linkages, including yeast cell walls. The Km was 0.8 mg x mL-1 with pustulan as the substrate. Reaction product analysis by HPLC clearly indicated that BGN16.1 has an endo-hydrolytic mode of action. The probable role of this enzyme in the antagonistic action of T. harzianum is also discussed. 
14565843	20031021	Biochem._J.	D016428 	Molecular cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of a Trichoderma viride endo-beta-(1-->6)-galactanase gene.	The nucleotide sequence depicted in Figure 1 has been submitted to the DDBJ nucleotide sequence database under the accession no. AB104898. A gene encoding endo-beta-(1-->6)-galactanase from Trichoderma viride was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR and expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene contained an open reading frame consisting of 1437 bp (479 amino acids). The deduced amino acid sequence of the protein showed little similarity with other known glycoside hydrolases. A signal sequence (20 amino acids) was found at the N-terminal region of the protein and the molecular mass of the mature form was calculated to be 50.488 kDa. The gene product expressed in E. coli as a recombinant protein fused with thioredoxin and His(6) tags had almost the same substrate specificity and mode of action as native enzyme purified from a commercial cellulase preparation of T. viride, i.e. recombinant enzyme endo-hydrolysed beta-(1-->6)-galacto-oligomers with a DP (degree of polymerization) higher than 3, and it could also hydrolyse alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase-treated arabinogalactan protein from radish. It produced beta-(1-->6)-galacto-oligomers ranging from DP 2 to at least 8 at the initial hydrolysis stage and galactose and beta-(1-->6)-galactobiose as the major products at the final reaction stage. These results indicate that the cloned gene encodes an endo-beta-(1-->6)-galactanase. As far as we know, this is the first time an endo-beta-(1-->6)-galactanase has been cloned. 
12702357	20030419	FEMS_Yeast_Res.	D016428 D013485 	High-level production of recombinant Aspergillus niger cinnamoyl esterase (FAEA) in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.	The cDNA encoding Aspergillus niger cinnamoyl esterase (FAEA) with its native signal sequence was isolated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, sequenced, and expressed in Pichia pastoris. Secretion yields up to 300 mg l(-1) were obtained in buffered medium. The recombinant FAEA was purified to homogeneity using a one-step purification protocol and found to be identical to the native enzyme with respect to size, pI, immunoreactivity and N-terminal sequence. Specific activity, pH and temperature optimum, and kinetic parameters were also found similar to the native esterase. FAEA is thus the first fungal esterase efficiently produced using a heterologous system. 
14642815	20031204	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 	A cold-adapted endo-arabinanase from Penicillium chrysogenum.	Previously, three arabinan-degrading enzymes were isolated from Penicillium chrysogenum 31B. Here we describe another arabinan-degrading enzyme, termed Abnc, from the culture filtrate of the same organism. Analysis of the reaction products of debranched arabinan by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) revealed that Abnc cleaved the substrate in an endo manner and that the final major product was arabinotriose. The molecular mass of Abnc was estimated to be 35 kDa by SDS-PAGE. Enzyme activity of Abnc was highest at pH 6.0 to 7.0. The enzyme was stable up to 30 degrees C and showed optimum activity at 30 to 40 degrees C. Compared with a mesophilic counterpart from Aspergillus niger, Abnc exhibited a lower thermal stability and optimum enzyme activity at lower temperatures. Production of Abnc in P. chrysogenum was found to be strongly induced by arabinose-containing polymers and required a longer culture time than did other arabinanase isozymes in this strain. 
18512263	20080531	Biotechnol._Bioeng.	D016428 D013485 	Cloning, expression, and characterization of novel thermostable family 7 cellobiohydrolases.	As part of the effort to find better cellulases for bioethanol production processes, we were looking for novel GH-7 family cellobiohydrolases, which would be particularly active on insoluble polymeric substrates and participate in the rate-limiting step in the hydrolysis of cellulose. The enzymatic properties were studied and are reported here for family 7 cellobiohydrolases from the thermophilic fungi Acremonium thermophilum, Thermoascus aurantiacus, and Chaetomium thermophilum. The Trichoderma reesei Cel7A enzyme was used as a reference in the experiments. As the native T. aurantiacus Cel7A has no carbohydrate-binding module (CBM), recombinant proteins having the CBM from either the C. thermophilum Cel7A or the T. reesei Cel7A were also constructed. All these novel acidic cellobiohydrolases were more thermostable (by 4-10 degrees C) and more active (two- to fourfold) in hydrolysis of microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel) at 45 degrees C than T. reesei Cel7A. The C. thermophilum Cel7A showed the highest specific activity and temperature optimum when measured on soluble substrates. The most effective enzyme for Avicel hydrolysis at 70 degrees C, however, was the 2-module version of the T. aurantiacus Cel7A, which was also relatively weakly inhibited by cellobiose. These results are discussed from the structural point of view based on the three-dimensional homology models of these enzymes. 
17027758	20061010	FEBS_Lett.	D016428 D013485 	Respective importance of protein folding and glycosylation in the thermal stability of recombinant feruloyl esterase A.	The thermal stability of four molecular forms (native, refolded, glycosylated, non-glycosylated) of feruloyl esterase A (FAEA) was studied. From the most to the least thermo-resistant, the four molecular species ranked as follows: (i) glycosylated form produced native, (ii) non-glycosylated form produced native, (iii) non-glycosylated form produced as inclusion bodies and refolded, and (iv) glycosylated form produced native chemically denatured and then refolded. On the basis of these results and of crystal structure data, we discuss the respective importance of protein folding and glycosylation in the thermal stability of recombinant FAEA. 
23299456	20130110	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	A family 5 β-mannanase from the thermophilic fungus Thielavia arenaria XZ7 with typical thermophilic enzyme features.	A novel β-mannanase gene, man5XZ7, was cloned from thermophilic fungus Thielavia arenaria XZ7, and successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris. The gene (1,110 bp) encodes a 369-amino acid polypeptide with a molecular mass of approximately 40.8 kDa. The deduced sequence of Man5XZ7 consists of a putative 17-residue signal peptide and a catalytic module belonging to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 5, and displays 76 % identity with the experimentally verified GH 5 endo-β-1,4-mannanase from Podospora anserina. Recombinant Man5XZ7 was optimally active at 75 °C and pH 5.0 and exhibited high activity at a wide temperature range (>50.0 % activity at 50-85 °C). Moreover, it had good adaptability to acidic to basic pH (>74.1 % activity at pH 4.0-7.0 and 25.6 % even at pH 9.0) and good stability from pH 3.0 to 10.0. These enzymatic properties showed that Man5XZ7 was a new thermophilic and alkali-tolerant β-mannanase. Further amino acid composition analysis indicated that Man5XZ7 has several characteristic features of thermophilic enzymes.  
15322773	20040824	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 	Characterization and molecular cloning of a novel endoglucanase from Trichoderma sp. C-4.	A fungal strain, C-4, was isolated from etiolated leaves. Based on taxonomic studies, the fungus C-4 can be classified as a strain of Trichoderma species. When strain C-4 was cultured in Mandels' medium at 28 degrees C for 6 days, the enzyme activities detected in the broth corresponded to 8.2 U/ml (28.1 U/mg) carboxymethylcellulase activity. An endoglucanase (EG; F-I-II) was purified from the culture filtrate of the strain through a four-step procedure-chromatography on Sephacryl S-200, DEAE-Sephadex A-50, Con A-Sepharose, and Chromatofocusing on Mono-P (HPLC). The molecular weight of this EG, which was called C4endoII, was determined to be about 51 kDa. The optimum temperature and pH of C4endoII were 50 degrees C and 5.0, respectively. Incubation at 50 degrees C for 24 h did not destroy the cellulose degradation activity. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed the N-terminal sequence of an internal peptide of C4endoII to be Phe-Ala-Gly-Ile-Asn-Ile-Ala-Gly-Phe-Asp-Phe, which is homologous to EGII from Trichoderma reesei. A C4endoII cDNA (C4endoII) was cloned from a cDNA library constructed using the mRNA of the strain cultivated in a cellulase-induction medium. The deduced protein sequence of C4endoII was 417 amino acids long and had a putative signal sequence of 21 amino acids with a predicted cleavage site after Ala-21. A single potential N-glycosylation site was present in the amino acid sequence. 
7805053	19941017	Carbohydr._Res.	D016428 D013485 	Degradation of feruloylated oligosaccharides from sugar-beet pulp and wheat bran by ferulic acid esterases from Aspergillus niger.	The activity of two forms of ferulic acid esterase (FAE) from Aspergillus niger on a synthetic feruloylated substrate (methyl ferulate) and on 11 different feruloylated oligosaccharides from sugar-beet pulp and wheat bran was determined. The enzymes exhibited different specificities for the various feruloylated substrates and were more active on certain substrates of cell-wall origin than on methyl ferulate. Both enzymes preferred the arabinose residue to which ferulic acid is attached in the furanose form. FAE-I had no clear preference for the type of linkage involved between the ferulic acid units and the oligosaccharide chain. In contrast, FAE-III had a clear requirement for ferulic acid to be attached to O-5 of the Ara f ring while no catalysis was observed when ferulic acid was attached to O-2. Both enzymes showed maximum activity on feruloylated trisaccharides. An increase in the length of the oligosaccharide chain did not preclude catalysis, but feruloylated oligosaccharides of a dp > 3 were hydrolysed at a reduced rate. Our results support the hypothesis that different kinds of ferulic acid esterases exist with different specificities for the oligosaccharide chain of the feruloylated substrates. 
15555940	20041124	Protein_Expr._Purif.	D016428 	Expression in Trichoderma reesei and characterisation of a thermostable family 3 beta-glucosidase from the moderately thermophilic fungus Talaromyces emersonii.	The gene encoding a thermostable beta-glucosidase (cel3a) was isolated from the thermophilic fungus Talalaromyces emersonii by degenerate PCR and expressed in the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei. The cel3a gene encodes an 857 amino acid long protein with a calculated molecular weight of 90.59 kDa. Tal. emersonii beta-glucosidase falls into glycosyl hydrolase family 3, showing approximately 56 and 67% identity with Cel3b (GenBank ) from T. reesei, and a beta-glucosidase from Aspergillus Niger (GenBank ), respectively. The heterologously expressed enzyme, Cel3a, was a dimer equal to 130 kDa subunits with 17 potential N-glycosylation sites and a previously unreported beta-glucosidase activity produced extracellularly by Tal. emersonii. Cel3a was thermostable with an optimum temperature of 71.5 degrees C and half life of 62 min at 65 degrees C and was a specific beta-glucosidase with no beta-galactosidase side activity. Cel3a had a high specific activity against p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (Vmax, 512 IU/mg) and was competitively inhibited by glucose (k(i), 0.254 mM). Cel3a was also active against natural cellooligosacharides with glucose being the product of hydrolysis. It displayed transferase activity producing mainly cellobiose from glucose and cellotetrose from cellobiose.
