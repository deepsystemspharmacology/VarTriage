18698679	20080814	Single nucleotide polymorphism in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene affects inflammatory bowel diseases risk.	To investigate the role that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter of the tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene play in the risk of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) in a New Zealand population, in the context of international studies. DNA samples from 388 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 405 ulcerative colitis (UC), 27 indeterminate colitis (IC) and 201 randomly selected controls, from Canterbury, New Zealand were screened for 3 common polymorphisms in the TNF-alpha receptor: -238 G--&gt;A, -308 G--&gt;A and -857C--&gt;T, using a Taqman assay. A meta-analysis was performed on the data obtained on these polymorphisms combined with that from other published studies. Individuals carrying the -308 G/A allele had a significantly (OR = 1.91, c2 = 17.36, P &lt; 0.0001) increased risk of pancolitis, and a 1.57-fold increased risk (OR = 1.57, c2 = 4.34, P = 0.037) of requiring a bowel resection in UC. Carrying the -857 C/T variant decreased the risk of ileocolonic CD (OR = 0.56, c2 = 4.32, P = 0.037), and the need for a bowel resection (OR = 0.59, c2 = 4.85, P = 0.028). The risk of UC was reduced in individuals who were smokers at diagnosis, (OR = 0.48, c2 = 4.86, P = 0.028). TNF-alpha is a key cytokine known to play a role in inflammatory response, and the locus for the gene is found in the IBD3 region on chromosome 6p21, known to be associated with an increased risk for IBD. The -308 G/A SNP in the TNF-alpha promoter is functional, and may account in part for the increased UC risk associated with the IBD3 genomic region. The -857 C/T SNP may decrease IBD risk in certain groups. Pharmaco- or nutrigenomic approaches may be desirable for individuals with such affected genotypes. 	World_J._Gastroenterol.	D016428 D013485
22659663	20120605	[Diagnostic value of transcranial Doppler ultrasound in early stage cerebral arteriosclerosis].	To investigate the diagnostic value of transcranial Doppler ultrasound in early stage cerebral arteriosclerosis. We selected 50 patients with early cerebral arteriosclerosis as the disease group. At the same time we selected another 50 patients as a control group with no significant symptoms in the nervous system. By 2 MHz pulse Doppler probe through double-temporal windows and pillow windows Basilar artery (BA), the bilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) was detected. In the TCD spectrum, we selected the spectrum of a single-family cardiac cycle, identified the starting point (ts), pulse-incisure point (ti), end point (te), and the peak velocity (tp), measured the time of the spectrum starting point to the peak velocity (Tp) and calculated the time required for the peak velocity in the share of ventricular systolic (Tp/Ti), the time required for the peak velocity in the share of the whole cardiac cycle (Tp/T). Tp, Tp/Ti and Tp/T were respectively named as time to peak velocity (TPV), peak-time index-1 (PTI-1) and peak-time index-2 (PTI-2). All data were analyzed by SPSS13.0. There was no significant difference in blood vessel velocity, PI, RI and S/D of BA and RMCA (P&gt;0.05) between the control group and the disease group. Compared with the control group, TPV of the BA, LMCA and RMCA significantly extended, PTI-1 and PTI-2 of BA, LMCA and RMCA increased significantly in the disease group (P&lt;0.01). In the disease group, there was no significant correlation between peak time index and PI, S/D (P&gt;0.05). TPV, PTI-1 and PTI-2 are sensitive indicators of early stage cerebral arteriosclerosis.

21774451	20110722	Phenotype analysis of an Australian DFNA9 family with the 1109N COCH mutation.	We studied the clinical characteristics of an Australian family with an autosomal dominant sensorineural hearing impairment (DFNA9) caused by an I109N mutation in COCH. Retrospective analyses of audiometric data from 8 mutation carriers of an Australian DFNA9 family with the I109N COCH mutation were performed. Cross-sectional hearing levels related to age, age-related typical audiograms, and speech recognition scores related to age and to the level of hearing impairment were investigated. Data were compared to those obtained in previously identified DFNA9 families with P51S, V66G, G87W, G88E, I109T, and C542F COCH mutations. Deterioration of hearing in the I109N mutation carriers started before the age of 40 years. The audiometric characteristics of the I109N mutation carriers are essentially similar to those previously established in I109T mutation carriers and, to a lesser extent, in P51S, G87W, and G88E mutation carriers. The phenotype associated with the I109N COCH mutation is largely similar to that associated with the I109T, P51S, G87W, and G88E mutation carriers. However, subtle differences seem to exist in terms of age of onset and rate of progression. 	Ann._Otol._Rhinol._Laryngol.	D003160 D016428 D013485
26345891	20150909	Lack of association between potential prothrombotic genetic risk factors and arterial and venous thrombosis.	Recent studies have shown an association between thrombosis and factor VII (FVII), tissue factor (TF), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). This suggests that individuals with FVII-402 G/A, FVII-401 G/T, TF+5466 A/G, and ACE-287 insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphisms present an increased risk of venous thrombosis, heart disease, and ischemic stroke compared with controls. In this study, we investigated the frequencies of these polymorphisms and their association with arterial and venous thrombosis. For the FVII-402 G/A polymorphism, there were 57.3% heterozygote (HT) genotypes and 8.3% homozygote (HM) genotypes in the patients, and 45.2% HT genotypes and 15.4% HM genotypes in the controls. For the FVII-401 G/T polymorphism, there were 37.5% HT genotypes and 3.1% HM genotypes in the patients, and 32.7% HT genotypes and 4.8% HM genotypes in the controls. The polymorphism TF+5466 A/G was not found in any of the samples analyzed. For the ACE-287 I/D polymorphism, there were 43 (40.6%) HT genotypes and 63 (59.4%) HM genotypes in the controls and 28 (45.2%) HT genotypes and 34 (54.8%) HM genotypes in the patients. No significant difference was observed by comparing patients and controls. In this study, no association was found between the presence of the evaluated polymorphisms and the occurrence of thrombotic events. 	Genet._Mol._Res.	D016428 D013485
26622462	20151202	Chlamydia trachomatis</i>isolates.	The aim of the present study was to determine thein vitrosusceptibility of wild-type and mutant clinical isolates ofChlamydia (C.) trachomatisstrains to erythromycin, azithromycin and josamycin, and to identify the resistance-conferring 23S ribosomal (r)RNA mutations in the isolates. The wild-type resistant isolates were defined as those with minimum inhibitory concentration values above the tissue concentration of the antibiotic in the urogenital system. Furthermore, all resistantC. trachomatisisolates were exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of macrolides, and 13 resistant mutants were selected following serial passages. Among the 8 wild-type isolates that were resistant to erythromycin, 3 isolates had a mutation at T2611C in the 23S rRNA gene while the others did not show any 23S rRNA mutations. The selected mutant isolates showed a 4- to 16-fold reduction inin vitrosensitivities. With regard to the mutant strains, the T2611C mutation was found in 10 isolates, A2057G mutation in 6 isolates, and A2059G mutation in 1 isolate. Thus, the macrolide-resistant isolates of the wild-type strain had different mutations from those selected by exposure to sub-inhibitory concentrations of macrolides. Also, since 23S rRNA mutations were not identified in certain isolates, it was considered that other molecular mechanisms may also be responsible for the macrolide resistance ofC. trachomatis.

24604454	20140308	Plexin-A1 is required for Toll-like receptor-mediated microglial activation in the development of lipopolysaccharide-induced encephalopathy.	Recent investigations have suggested that semaphorins, which are known repulsive axon guidance molecules, may play a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis by regulating microglial activity. Sema3A, secreted in higher amounts from injured neurons, is considered to suppress excessive inflammatory responses by inducing microglial apoptosis through its binding to Plexin-A1 receptors on activated microglia. To clarify the in vivo role of Plexin-A1-mediated signaling in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced injury in mouse brain, we examined the neuroinflammatory changes initiated by LPS administration to the cerebral ventricles of wild-type (WT) and Plexin-A1-deficient (-/-) mice. WT mice administered LPS exhibited a significantly higher expression of COX-2, iNOS, IL-1? and TNF-? in the hippocampus, and a significantly greater ventricular enlargement and intracerebral infiltration of leukocytes, as compared with the saline-treated group. By contrast, Plexin-A1-/- mice administered LPS did not exhibit a significantly increased expression of COX-2, iNOS, IL-1? or TNF-? in the hippocampus as compared with the saline-treated group. Plexin-A1-/- mice administered LPS did not show significant increases in ventricle size or infiltration of leukocytes into the brain, as compared with the saline-treated group. In WT, but not in the Plexin-A1-/- primary microglia treated with LPS, Sema3A induced significantly more nitric oxide production than in the immunoglobulin G control. These results revealed the crucial role of the Sema3A-Plexin-A1 interaction in the Toll-like receptor 4-mediated signaling of the LPS-induced activation of microglia. Thus, results of the present study revealed the essential role of Plexin-A1 in the development of LPS-induced neuroinflammation in mice, suggesting the possible application of microglial control of the semaphorin-plexin signaling system to the treatment of LPS-induced encephalopathy and other psychiatric diseases associated with neuroinflammation.

23462954	20130307	Splicing proofreading at 5' splice sites by ATPase Prp28p.	Fidelity and efficiency of pre-mRNA splicing are critical for generating functional mRNAs, but how such accuracy in 5' splice site (SS) selection is attained is not fully clear. Through a series of yeast genetic screens, we isolated alleles of prp28 that improve splicing of suboptimal 5'SS substrates, demonstrating that WT-Prp28p proofreads, and consequently rejects, poor 5'SS. Prp28p is thought to facilitate the disruption of 5'SS-U1 snRNA pairing to allow for 5'SS-U6 snRNA pairing in the catalytic spliceosome; unexpectedly, 5'SS proofreading by Prp28p is dependent on competition with the stability of the 5'SS:U6 duplex, but not the 5'SS:U1 duplex. E404K, the strongest prp28 allele containing a mutation located in the linker region between adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) subdomains, exhibited lower RNA-binding activity and enhanced splicing of suboptimal substrates before first-step catalysis, suggesting that decreased Prp28p activity allows longer time for suboptimal 5'SS substrates to pair with U6 snRNA and thereby reduces splicing fidelity. Residue E404 is critical for providing high splicing activity, demonstrated here in both yeast and Drosophila cells. Thus, the subdomain linker in Prp28p plays important roles both in splicing efficiency across species and in proofreading of 5'SS. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D052061 D013485
27050946	20160407	Expression of asthma susceptibility genes in bronchial epithelial cells and bronchial alveolar lavage in the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) cohort.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified genes associated with asthma, however expression of these genes in asthma-relevant tissues has not been studied. This study tested expression and correlation between GWAS-identified asthma genes and asthma or asthma severity. Correlation analyses of expression levels of GWAS-identified asthma genes and asthma-related biomarkers were performed in cells from human bronchial epithelial biopsy (BEC, n = 107) and bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL, n = 94). Expression levels of asthma genes between BEC and BAL and with asthma or asthma severity were weakly correlated. The expression levels of IL18R1 were consistently higher in asthma than controls or in severe asthma than mild/moderate asthma in BEC and BAL (p &lt; 0.05). In RAD50-IL13 region, the expression levels of RAD50, not IL4, IL5, or IL13, were positively correlated between BEC and BAL (? = 0.53, P = 4.5 ? 10(-6)). The expression levels of IL13 were positively correlated with IL5 in BEC (? = 0.35, P = 1.9 ? 10(-4)) and IL4 in BAL (? = 0.42, P = 2.5 ? 10(-5)), respectively. rs3798134 in RAD50, a GWAS-identified SNP, was correlated with IL13 expression and the expression levels of IL13 were correlated with asthma (P = 0.03). rs17772583 in RAD50 was significantly correlated with RAD50 expression in BAL and BEC (P = 7.4 ? 10(-7) and 0.04) but was not associated with asthma. This is the first report studying the expression of GWAS-identified asthma genes in BEC and BAL. IL13, rather than RAD50, IL4, or IL5, is more likely to be the asthma susceptibility gene. Our study illustrates tissue-specific expression of asthma-related genes. Therefore, whenever possible, disease-relevant tissues should be used for transcription analysis. 	J_Asthma	D016428
25615450	20150124	Human mitochondrial Hsp70 (mortalin): shedding light on ATPase activity, interaction with adenosine nucleotides, solution structure and domain organization.	The human mitochondrial Hsp70, also called mortalin, is of considerable importance for mitochondria biogenesis and the correct functioning of the cell machinery. In the mitochondrial matrix, mortalin acts in the importing and folding process of nucleus-encoded proteins. The in vivo deregulation of mortalin expression and/or function has been correlated with age-related diseases and certain cancers due to its interaction with the p53 protein. In spite of its critical biological roles, structural and functional studies on mortalin are limited by its insoluble recombinant production. This study provides the first report of the production of folded and soluble recombinant mortalin when co-expressed with the human Hsp70-escort protein 1, but it is still likely prone to self-association. The monomeric fraction of mortalin presented a slightly elongated shape and basal ATPase activity that is higher than that of its cytoplasmic counterpart Hsp70-1A, suggesting that it was obtained in the functional state. Through small angle X-ray scattering, we assessed the low-resolution structural model of monomeric mortalin that is characterized by an elongated shape. This model adequately accommodated high resolution structures of Hsp70 domains indicating its quality. We also observed that mortalin interacts with adenosine nucleotides with high affinity. Thermally induced unfolding experiments indicated that mortalin is formed by at least two domains and that the transition is sensitive to the presence of adenosine nucleotides and that this process is dependent on the presence of Mg2+ ions. Interestingly, the thermal-induced unfolding assays of mortalin suggested the presence of an aggregation/association event, which was not observed for human Hsp70-1A, and this finding may explain its natural tendency for in vivo aggregation. Our study may contribute to the structural understanding of mortalin as well as to contribute for its recombinant production for antitumor compound screenings. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485

24857113	20140527	Management of vulvar and vaginal melanomas: current and future strategies.	Melanomas arising in the vulva and vagina are rare and therefore there is minimal data specific to these malignancies. Data are often extrapolated from other cutaneous melanomas, which may or may not be appropriate. Surgery remains the primary treatment modality at initial diagnosis and in select recurrent cases. Wide local excision of the primary lesion not requiring an exenteration, along with sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping, should be routinely considered in vulvar melanomas. Local excision and SLN mapping is difficult and often not considered for vaginal melanomas. Primary exenterative procedures should not be routinely offered. In locally advanced cases potentially requiring an exenterative procedure, radiation therapy with or without concurrent immunotherapy is a consideration. The role of adjuvant therapy remains unclear. Surgery or radiation therapy can be considered in recurrent cases. Systemic chemotherapy agents have a modest response rate with associated poor survival outcomes. Novel immunotherapeutic and targeted agents have been reported to improve survival in melanoma and should be considered in cases of vulvovaginal melanoma. All cases should be tested for at least c-KIT and BRAF V600E mutations. Patients with vulvovaginal melanomas should be strongly encouraged to participate in clinical trials.

7629142	19950804	The asparagine to aspartic acid substitution at position 276 of TEM-35 and TEM-36 is involved in the beta-lactamase resistance to clavulanic acid.	TEM-35 (inhibitor resistant TEM (IRT)-4) and TEM-36 (IRT-7) clavulanic acid-resistant beta-lactamases have evolved from TEM-1 beta-lactamase by two substitutions: a methionine to a leucine or a valine at position 69 and an asparagine to an aspartic acid at position 276. The substitutions at position 69 have previously been shown to be responsible for the resistance to clavulanic acid, and they are the only mutations encountered in TEM-33 (IRT-5) and TEM-34 (IRT-6). However, the N276D substitution has never been found alone in inhibitor-resistant beta-lactamases, and its role in resistance to clavulanic acid was thus unclear. The N276D mutant was constructed, purified, and kinetically characterized. It was shown that the substitution has a direct effect on substrate affinities and leads to slightly decreased catalytic efficiencies and that clavulanic acid becomes a poor substrate of the enzyme. Electrospray mass spectrometry demonstrated the simultaneous presence of free and inhibited enzymes after incubation with clavulanic acid and showed that a cleaved moiety of clavulanic acid leads to the formation of the major inactive complex. The kinetic properties of the N276D mutant could be linked to a salt-bridge interaction of aspartic acid 276 with arginine 244 that alters the electrostatic properties in the substrate binding area.

19331823	20090401	A novel pocket in 14-3-3epsilon is required to mediate specific complex formation with cdc25C and to inhibit cell cycle progression upon activation of checkpoint pathways.	Mitotic progression requires the activity of the dual specificity phosphatase, cdc25C. Cdc25C function is inhibited by complex formation with two 14-3-3 isoforms, 14-3-3epsilon and 14-3-3gamma. To understand the molecular basis of specific complex formation between 14-3-3 proteins and their ligands, chimeric 14-3-3 proteins were tested for their ability to form a complex with cdc25C in vivo. Specific complex formation between cdc25C and 14-3-3epsilon in vivo requires a phenylalanine residue at position 135 (F135) in 14-3-3epsilon. Mutation of this residue to the corresponding residue present in other 14-3-3 isoforms (F135V) leads to reduced binding to cdc25C and a decrease in the ability to inhibit cdc25C function in vivo. Similarly, F135V failed to rescue the incomplete S phase and the G2 DNA damage checkpoint defects observed in cells lacking 14-3-3epsilon. A comparative analysis of the 14-3-3 structures present in the database suggested that the F135 in 14-3-3epsilon was required to maintain the integrity of a pocket that might be involved in secondary interactions with cdc25C. These results suggest that the specificity of the 14-3-3 ligand interaction may be dependent on structural motifs present in the individual 14-3-3 isoforms. 	Exp._Cell_Res.	D016428 D013485
19300439	20090321	Acid sphingomyelinase activity triggers microparticle release from glial cells.	We have earlier shown that microglia, the immune cells of the CNS, release microparticles from cell plasma membrane after ATP stimulation. These vesicles contain and release IL-1beta, a crucial cytokine in CNS inflammatory events. In this study, we show that microparticles are also released by astrocytes and we get insights into the mechanism of their shedding. We show that, on activation of the ATP receptor P2X7, microparticle shedding is associated with rapid activation of acid sphingomyelinase, which moves to plasma membrane outer leaflet. ATP-induced shedding and IL-1beta release are markedly reduced by the inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase, and completely blocked in glial cultures from acid sphingomyelinase knockout mice. We also show that p38 MAPK cascade is relevant for the whole process, as specific kinase inhibitors strongly reduce acid sphingomyelinase activation, microparticle shedding and IL-1beta release. Our results represent the first demonstration that activation of acid sphingomyelinase is necessary and sufficient for microparticle release from glial cells and define key molecular effectors of microparticle formation and IL-1beta release, thus, opening new strategies for the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases.

22621339	20120525	Genetic variations of patients with familial or multiple melanoma in Southern Brazil.	Patients with familial melanoma or multiple primary melanoma represent a high-risk population to hereditary melanoma. Mutations in susceptibility genes, such as CDKN2A, CDK4 and MC1R, have been associated with the development of melanoma. The purpose of this study was to determine the genotypic background of patients with familial and/or multiple melanoma in southern Brazil. This study analysed 33 cases (5 patients with multiple primary melanoma and 28 patients from families with at least two well documented cases) and 29 controls. Genomic analysis of CDKN2A and CDK4 genes by PCR-SSCP analysis and sequencing and direct sequencing of MC1R were performed in all individuals. No functional mutations in CDKN2A or CDK4 were detected in the 62 individuals. Infrequent variants in polymorphic loci of CDKN2A gene were identified in 15 participants (24.2%) and 24/33 (72.8%) cases and 19/27 (70.4%) controls reported at least one infrequent variant in MC1R (P = 0.372). Furthermore, a non-significant tendency towards an association between melanoma risk and MC1R variants G274A and C451T and a non-significant linear tendency to the number of infrequent high-risk variants in MC1R were observed. These results suggest that in southern Brazilian population, CDKN2A or CDK4 germinal alterations may have a weaker influence than previously thought and environmental risk factors may play a central role in melanoma susceptibility. However, considering the tendency observed for gene MC1R, low-penetrance genes may be a relevant aetiological factor in southern Brazil with fair skin population and high sunlight exposure.

27216259	20160525	Enhancing antibody folding and secretion by tailoring the Saccharomyces cerevisiae endoplasmic reticulum.	The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides intriguing possibilities for synthetic biology and bioprocess applications, but its use is still constrained by cellular characteristics that limit the product yields. Considering the production of advanced biopharmaceuticals, a major hindrance lies in the yeast endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as it is not equipped for efficient and large scale folding of complex proteins, such as human antibodies. Following the example of professional secretory cells, we show that inducing an ER expansion in yeast by deleting the lipid-regulator gene OPI1 can improve the secretion capacity of full-length antibodies up to fourfold. Based on wild-type and ER-enlarged yeast strains, we conducted a screening of a folding factor overexpression library to identify proteins and their expression levels that enhance the secretion of antibodies. Out of six genes tested, addition of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase CPR5 provided the most beneficial effect on specific product yield while PDI1, ERO1, KAR2, LHS1 and SIL1 had a mild or even negative effect to antibody secretion efficiency. Combining genes for ER enhancement did not induce any significant additional effect compared to addition of just one element. By combining the ?opi1 strain, with the enlarged ER, with CPR5 overexpression, we were able to boost the specific antibody product yield by a factor of 10 relative to the non-engineered strain. Engineering protein folding in vivo is a major task for biopharmaceuticals production in yeast and needs to be optimized at several levels. By rational strain design and high-throughput screening applications we were able to increase the specific secreted antibody yields of S. cerevisiae up to 10-fold, providing a promising strain for further process optimization and platform development for antibody production.

12829500	20030628	Crystal structure of the bromide-bound D85S mutant of bacteriorhodopsin: principles of ion pumping.	We report the crystal structure of a bromide-bound form of the D85S mutant of bacteriorhodopsin, bR(D85S), a protein that uses light energy rather than ATP to pump halide ions across the cell membrane. Comparison of the structure of the halide-bound and halide-free states reveals that both displacements of individual side-chain positions and concerted helical movements occur on the extracellular side of the protein. Analysis of these structural changes reveals how this ion pump first facilitates ion uptake deep within the cell membrane and then prevents the backward escape of ions later in the pumping cycle. Together with the information provided by structures of intermediate states in the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle, this study also suggests the overall design principles that are necessary for ion pumping.

9237779	19970601	Gestational diabetes mellitus and gene mutations which affect insulin secretion.	We investigated whether genetic mutations known to impair insulin secretion and glucose tolerance are operative in a group of American women with gestational diabetes mellitus. Study groups were comprised of elderly non-diabetic controls (n = 55) with normal glucose tolerance and patients with gestational diabetes (n = 50), together with one family with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (three controls and three affected). No mutations were detected in any exon of the human glucokinase gene or the mitochondrial tRNA[Leu](UUR) gene by single strand conformational analysis and direct exon sequencing. Also, chi2 analysis showed no significant association with gestational diabetes for a polymorphism at position -30 (G --&gt; A) of the beta-cell-specific glucokinase gene promoter. We have determined that glucokinase and mitochondrial tRNA[Leu](UUR) gene mutations, which are known to impair insulin secretion are relatively uncommon and do not constitute a large component of genetic risk for gestational diabetes in the study population.

15293102	20040805	Lupus anticoagulant, factor V Leiden, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene mutation in a lupus patient with cerebral venous thrombosis.	We describe the case of a young Lebanese woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a positive lupus anticoagulant (LAC) who developed right internal jugular vein and sigmoid sinus thrombosis. Coagulation studies showed that in addition to the LAC the patient was heterozygous for the factor V (FV) Leiden mutation, and C677T mutation of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene. The high prevalence of FV Leiden in the eastern Mediterranean region suggests that we should probably screen our SLE patients in this area, especially those with anticardiolipin antibodies and/or LAC who have no history of thrombosis, for this and other thrombophilia markers. The detection of such abnormalities may have major practical consequences for the long-term management of these patients to prevent further thrombotic episodes. 	Clin._Rheumatol.	D002363 D016428
7590234	19951015	Enhancer-independent variants of phage Mu transposase: enhancer-specific stimulation of catalytic activity by a partner transposase.	Assembly of the functional tetrameric form of phage Mu transposase (A protein) requires specific interactions between the Mu A monomer and its cognate sequences at the ends of the Mu genome (attL and attR) as well as those internal to it (the enhancer element). We describe here deletion variants of Mu A that show enhancer-independence in the assembly of the strand cleavage complex. These deletions remove the amino-terminal region of Mu A required for its interactions with the enhancer elements. The basal enhancer-independent activity of the variant proteins can be stimulated by a partner variant harboring an intact enhancer-binding domain. By exploiting the identical att-binding, and nonidentical enhancer-binding specificities of Mu A and D108 A (transposase of the Mu related phage D108), we show that the stimulation of activity is enhancer-specific. Taken together, these results suggest that the domain of Mu A that includes the enhancer-interacting region may exert negative as well as positive modulatory effects on the strand cleavage reaction. We discuss the implications of these results in the framework of a recent model for the assembly of shared active sites within the Mu A tetramer. 	Genes_Dev.	D016428 D013487
20607329	20100708	Iron-containing lipoprotein SiaA in SiaABC, the primary heme transporter of Streptococcus pyogenes.	The cell-surface lipoprotein SiaA, a component of the SiaABC transporter, acts as the primary receptor for heme in the infamous human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of heme binding and release as well as the role of heme-binding ligands that contribute to the uptake of heme into the pathogenic bacteria. The present report aims to clarify the coordination properties of heme iron in SiaA. By substitution of either Met79 or His229 with alanine, the mutant M79A and H229A proteins display significantly decreased heme-binding affinity and substantially increased heme-release rates, as compared with wild-type SiaA protein. Both fluorescence and circular dichroism spectra indicated that heme binding results in alterations in the secondary structure of the protein. Heme release from SiaA is a stepwise process in which heme dissociates firstly from Met79 and then from His229 with distinct conformational changes. His229 may serve as an anchor for heme binding in SiaA and thus may play a major role in the stability of the coordination between heme and the protein. 	J._Biol._Inorg._Chem.	D016428 D013485

Among the biologically active triterpenes, friedelin has the most-rearranged structure produced by the oxidosqualene cyclases and is the only one containing a cetonic group. In this study, we cloned and functionally characterized friedelin synthase and one cycloartenol synthase from Maytenus ilicifolia (Celastraceae). The complete coding sequences of these 2 genes were cloned from leaf mRNA, and their functions were characterized by heterologous expression in yeast. The cycloartenol synthase sequence is very similar to other known OSCs of this type (approximately 80% identity), although the M. ilicifolia friedelin synthase amino acid sequence is more related to ?-amyrin synthases (65-74% identity), which is similar to the friedelin synthase cloned from Kalanchoe daigremontiana. Multiple sequence alignments demonstrated the presence of a leucine residue two positions upstream of the friedelin synthase Asp-Cys-Thr-Ala-Glu (DCTAE) active site motif, while the vast majority of OSCs identified so far have a valine or isoleucine residue at the same position. The substitution of the leucine residue with valine, threonine or isoleucine in M. ilicifolia friedelin synthase interfered with substrate recognition and lead to the production of different pentacyclic triterpenes. Hence, our data indicate a key role for the leucine residue in the structure and function of this oxidosqualene cyclase. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
23799152	20130627	WW domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (WWP1) negatively regulates TLR4-mediated TNF-? and IL-6 production by proteasomal degradation of TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6).	Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a pivotal role in the defense against invading pathogens by detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria, resulting in the induction and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-? and IL-6. The WW domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (WWP1) regulates a variety of cellular biological processes. Here, we investigated whether WWP1 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in TLR-mediated inflammation. Knocking down WWP1 enhanced the TNF-? and IL-6 production induced by LPS, and over-expression of WWP1 inhibited the TNF-? and IL-6 production induced by LPS, but not by TNF-?. WWP1 also inhibited the I?B-?, NF-?B, and MAPK activation stimulated by LPS. Additionally, WWP1 could degrade TRAF6, but not IRAK1, in the proteasome pathway, and knocking down WWP1 reduced the LPS-induced K48-linked, but not K63-linked, polyubiquitination of endogenous TRAF6. We identified WWP1 as an important negative regulator of TLR4-mediated TNF-? and IL-6 production. We also showed that WWP1 functions as an E3 ligase when cells are stimulated with LPS by binding to TRAF6 and promoting K48-linked polyubiquitination. This results in the proteasomal degradation of TRAF6. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
22833753	20120727	Genetic variations and alternative splicing: the Glioma associated oncogene 1, GLI1.	Alternative splicing is a post-transcriptional regulatory process that is attaining stronger recognition as a modulator of gene expression. Alternative splicing occurs when the primary RNA transcript is differentially processed into more than one mature RNAs. This is the result of a variable definition/inclusion of the exons, the sequences that are excised from the primary RNA to form the mature RNAs. Consequently, RNA expression can generate a collection of differentially spliced RNAs, which may distinctly influence subsequent biological events, such as protein synthesis or other biomolecular interactions. Still the mechanisms that control exon definition and exon inclusion are not fully clarified. This mini-review highlights advances in this field as well as the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms in affecting splicing decisions. The Glioma-associated oncogene 1, GLI1, is taken as an example in addressing the role of nucleotide substitutions for splicing regulation. 	Front_Genet	D016428
17804495	20070907	A single-amino-acid substitution in the P2 domain of VP1 of murine norovirus is sufficient for escape from antibody neutralization.	Noroviruses cause epidemic outbreaks of acute viral gastroenteritis worldwide, and the number of reported outbreaks is increasing. Human norovirus strains do not grow in cell culture. However, murine norovirus (MNV) replicates in the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line and thus provides a tractable model to investigate norovirus interactions with host cells. Epitopes recognized by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the human norovirus strains Norwalk virus and Snow Mountain virus (SMV) identified regions in the P domain of major capsid protein VP1 important for interactions with putative cellular receptors. To determine if there was a relationship between domains of MNV VP1 and VP1 of human norovirus strains involved in cell binding, epitope mapping by phage display was performed with an MNV-1-neutralizing MAb, A6.2.1. A consensus peptide, GWWEDHGQL, was derived from 20 third-round phage clones. A synthetic peptide containing this sequence and constrained through a disulfide linkage reacted strongly with the A6.2.1 MAb, whereas the linear sequence did not. Four residues in the A6.2.1-selected peptide, G327, G333, Q334, and L335, aligned with amino acid residues in the P2 domain of MNV-1 VP1. This sequence is immediately adjacent to the epitope recognized by anti-SMV MAb 61.21. Neutralization escape mutants selected with MAb A6.2.1 contained a leucine-to-phenylalanine substitution at position 386 in the P2 domain. The predicted location of these residues on VP1 suggests that the phage peptide and the mutation in the neutralization-resistant viruses may be in close proximity to each other and to residues reported to be important for carbohydrate binding to VP1 of human norovirus strains.

11063747	20001117	Hormone status selects for spontaneous somatic androgen receptor variants that demonstrate specific ligand and cofactor dependent activities in autochthonous prostate cancer.	We have used the autochthonous transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model to investigate the relationship between somatic mutation in the androgen receptor (AR) and the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer. Here we report the identification, isolation, and characterization of distinct classes of AR variants from spontaneous prostate tumors in the TRAMP model. Using cDNA cloning, single stranded conformation polymorphism and sequencing strategies, 15 unique somatic mutations in the AR were identified in prostate tumors obtained from eight TRAMP mice between 24 and 29 weeks of age. At least one mutation was isolated from each mouse. All mutations were single base substitutions, 10 were missense and 5 were silent. Nine mutations in the AR were identified in tumors of four mice that were castrated at 12 weeks of age. Interestingly, the majority of mutations (seven out of nine, 78%) identified in the androgen-independent tumors colocalized in the AR transactivation domain. The remaining mutations colocalized in the AR ligand binding domain. In general, the AR variants demonstrated promoter-, cell-, and cofactor-specific activities in response to various hormones. All AR variants isolated in this study maintained strong sensitivity for androgens, and four AR variants isolated from castrated mice demonstrated increased activities in the absence of ligand. The K638M and F677S variants demonstrated increased activities in response to androgen, and K638M also demonstrated increased response to estradiol. In the presence of AR coactivator ARA70 the E231G variant demonstrated increased activity in response to both androgen and estradiol. However, in the presence of AR coactivator ARA160 the E231G variant was selectively responsive to androgen. Collectively these analyses not only indicate that somatic mutations in the AR gene occur spontaneously in TRAMP tumors but also how changes in the hormonal environment may drive the selection of spontaneous somatic mutations that provide a growth advantage.

25258482	20140927	The Potential effect of G915C polymorphism in regulating TGF-?1 transport into Endoplasmic Reticulum for cytokine production.	The TGF-?1 cytokine concentration is known to be higher in nephritis with implied Lupus Nephritis severity. The production of TGF-?1 cytokine is associated with G915C polymorphism. Therefore, it is of interest to study G915C polymorphism. The G915C polymorphism changes codon 25 which encodes arginine into proline in the signal peptide of TGF-?1. The amino acid substitution affects signal peptide properties that may inhibit the transport of TGF-?1 into the endoplasmic reticulum and eventually decline the cytokine production. Hence, the effect of G915C polymorphism on the properties of the signal peptide, the ability of TGF-?1 transport into the endoplasmic reticulum and the concentrations of urinary TGF-?1 in Lupus Nephritis patients was studied. The arginine substitution into proline decreased the polarity of the signal peptide for TGF-?1. The increased hydrophobicity with increased binding energy of the signal peptide for TGF-?1 to Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) and translocon is shown. This implies decreased protein complex stability in potentially blocking the transport of TGF-?1 into the endoplasmic reticulum. This transport retention possibly hampers the synthesis and maturation of TGF-?1 leading to decreased cytokine production. 	Bioinformation	D016428

25140303	20140821	?-Tocotrienol oxazine derivative antagonizes mammary tumor cell compensatory response to CoCl2-induced hypoxia.	In response to low oxygen supply, cancer cells elevate production of HIF-1?, a hypoxia-inducible transcription factor that subsequently acts to stimulate blood vessel formation and promote survival. Studies were conducted to determine the role of ?-tocotrienol and a semisynthetic ?-tocotrienol oxazine derivative, compound 44, on +SA mammary tumor cell hypoxic response. Treatment with 150 ?M CoCl2 induced a hypoxic response in +SA mammary tumor cells as evidenced by a large increase in HIF-1? levels, and combined treatment with compound 44 attenuated this response. CoCl2-induced hypoxia was also associated with a large increase in Akt/mTOR signaling, activation of downstream targets p70S6K and eIF-4E1, and a significant increase in VEGF production, and combined treatment with compound 44 blocked this response. Additional in vivo studies showed that intralesional treatment with compound 44 in BALB/c mice bearing +SA mammary tumors significantly decreased the levels of HIF-1?, and this effect was associated with a corresponding decrease in Akt/mTOR signaling and activation of downstream targets p70S6 kinase and eIF-4E1. These findings demonstrate that treatment with the ?-tocotrienol oxazine derivative, compound 44, significantly attenuates +SA mammary tumor cell compensatory responses to hypoxia and suggests that this compound may provide benefit in the treatment of rapidly growing solid breast tumors.

19401933	20090430	Clinical aspects of acute intermittent porphyria in northern Sweden: a population-based study.	The objective of this study was to update the clinical issues of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), as they have not been in focus for years, and to be aware of potentially associated disorders and social consequences. A total of 356 gene carriers of AIP from northern Sweden participated in this retrospective population-based study. Eight mutations were found with a predominance of W198X (89%). Clinical manifestations of AIP (manifest AIP) were identified in 42%, 65% were women. Women were more severely stricken by AIP attacks concerning number and duration, hospital admission and early onset. Men reporting most attacks were &gt; 40 years of age. In addition to traditional symptoms during attacks, fatigue was commonly described. Chronic AIP symptoms and disability pension due to AIP were reported in about 20% of subjects. Precipitating factors were reported with evident sex differences. Half of the gene carriers who were on medications used drugs considered not safe (in 1999), mainly antihypertensive drugs. Smoking was associated with high AIP attack frequency. Elevated levels of ALT, bile acids, creatinine, U-ALA and U-PBG and decreased levels of creatinine clearance were associated with manifest AIP. The same was true for hypertension and myalgia in the legs. Hepatoma was strikingly overrepresented. The high prevalence of manifest AIP in this study could be explained by a mutation-dependent penetrance. Our results emphasize the importance of early diagnosis, counselling and treatment of attacks, screening and treatment of associated disorders. 	Scand._J._Clin._Lab._Invest.	D016428
548122	19790101	Plasma sorbitol dehydrogenase in diabetic subjects with or without vascular complications.	Plasma Sorbitol Dehydrogenase levels were determined in subjects with diabetes mellitus and normal people. The diabetic subjects had circulating plasma levels of SDH significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than those observed in controls. Moreover, the diabetics with vascular complications presented the highest SDH values. The lack of positive correlation between plasma glucose and SDH levels suggests that SDH, like hemoglobin A1C, reflect the degree of previous metabolic control of diabetes mellitus.

15982260	20050629	The variation of the novel allele HLA-B*0739 suggests low alloreactivity when mismatched with HLA-B*0702.	We here report the identification of a new HLA-B*07 allele in a male Caucasian. The new allele was initially typed as B*0713 by sequence-specific primed PCR. Because of the infrequence of that allele, a sequencing-based typing was performed to confirm that result. This yielded the detection of the novel allele. It is closest to B*070201, while it differs from B*0713 in 12 positions in exon 2. Compared to B*070201, the new variant is characterized by a non-synonymous nucleotide exchange (C--&gt;T) at nucleotide position 118 of exon 2. Previously, this was considered a constant position, suggesting that it is likely to be caused by a single-point mutation. It results in the amino acid exchange Ala--&gt;Val at position 40 of the mature polypeptide. As this position is located in an outer loop of the HLA molecule, it is highly unlikely to affect peptide binding or T-cell receptor interaction. Thus, the newly found allele should have a low alloreactive potential in case of a mismatch to the most common HLA-B allele B*0702. 	Tissue_Antigens	D016428 D013485
23164656	20121121	Synthesis, structure-activity relationships, and docking studies of N-phenylarylformamide derivatives (PAFAs) as non-nucleoside HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors.	A series of N-phenylarylformamide derivatives (PAFAs) with anti-wild-type HIV-1 activity (EC(50) values) ranging from 0.3 nM to 5.1 nM and therapeutic index (TI) ranging from 10 616 to 271 000 were identified as novel non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Among them, compound 13g (EC(50) = 0.30 nM, TI = 184 578), 13l (EC(50) = 0.37 nM, TI = 212 819), 13m (EC(50) = 0.32 nM, TI = 260 617) and 13r (EC(50) = 0.27 nM, TI = 271 000) displayed the highest activity against this type virus nearly as potent as lead compound GW678248. Moreover, all of them were also active to inhibit the double mutant strain A(17) (K103N + Y181C) with EC(50) values of 0.29 ?M, 0.14 ?M, 0.10 ?M and 0.27 ?M, respectively. In particular, compound 13m, which showed broad-spectrum anti-HIV activity, was also effective to inhibit the HIV-2 ROD replication within 4.37 ?M concentration. 	Eur_J_Med_Chem	D016428 D013485
24865853	20140529	Ubiquitin ligase ITCH recruitment suppresses the aggregation and cellular toxicity of cytoplasmic misfolded proteins.	The protein quality control (QC) system protects cells against cellular toxicity induced by misfolded proteins and maintains overall cellular fitness. Inefficient clearance of or failure to degrade damaged proteins causes several diseases, especially age-linked neurodegenerative disorders. Attenuation of misfolded protein degradation under severe stress conditions leads to the rapid over-accumulation of toxic proteinaceous aggregates in the cytoplasmic compartment. However, the precise cytoplasmic quality control degradation mechanism is unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that the Nedd4-like E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH specifically interacts with mutant bona fide misfolded proteins and colocalizes with their perinuclear aggregates. In a cell culture model, we demonstrate ITCH recruitment by cytoplasmic inclusions containing polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin or ataxin-3 proteins. Transient overexpression of ITCH dramatically induced the degradation of thermally denatured misfolded luciferase protein. Partial depletion of ITCH increased the rate of aggregate formation and cell death generated by expanded polyglutamine proteins. Finally, we demonstrate that overexpression of ITCH alleviates the cytotoxic potential of expanded polyglutamine proteins and reduces aggregation. These observations indicate that ITCH is involved in the cytosolic quality control pathway and may help to explain how abnormal proteins are targeted by QC ubiquitin-protein ligases.

3259418	19880101	Rumen microbial changes in calves fed on alpha amylase diet.	Fifty-six calves in the period of a milk nutrition, randomly assigned to two groups (control and alpha amylase fed) were used to monitor the changes in the rumen microbial populations and total volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentrations associated with feeding Amylosubtilin G10X (0.6 g.day-1). Statistically significant increase was observed for amylolytic counts in experimental calves on 20th or 30th days. The counts of rumen cellulolytic bacteria and selenomonas tended to have increase in the value, but were not significantly different from those in the control valves. The results show that alpha amylase fed calves has a relative higher rumen microbial population. 	Arch_Tierernahr	D016428
20142846	20100210	A splice site mutation in CRYBA1/A3 causing autosomal dominant posterior polar cataract in a Chinese pedigree.	To identify the mutant gene for autosomal dominant posterior polar congenital cataract in a four-generation Chinese pedigree. The clinical data of patients from the family were recorded by slit-lamp photography. Genomic DNA samples from peripheral blood of the pedigree members were then isolated to map the relevant gene, using microsatellite markers for two-point linkage analysis. Genotype and haplotypes of the pedigree were constructed using Cyrillic software to locate the relevant region. Direct sequencing was performed to screen out the disease-causing mutation. The congenital cataract phenotype of the pedigree was labeled as the posterior polar type by using slit-lamp photography. Linkage analysis results indicated a maximum logarithm of odds LOD score of (Z(max)) 2.02 at D17S1800 (theta(max)=0.00). Haplotyping identified a 26-cM region flanked by D17S921 and D17S800 on 17p12-21.2, namely at the betaA1/A3-crystallin (CRYBA1/A3) gene locus. Sequencing revealed a splice site mutation, G--&gt;A, at the first base of intron 3 of CRYBA1/A3, which co-segregated with the affected individuals in the pedigree but which was not found in the unaffected members of the family or in the 50 unrelated controls. Our results demonstrated that a splice site mutation of CRYBA1/A3 was responsible for the autosomal dominant posterior polar congenital cataract in a four-generation Chinese pedigree. The same mutation in this gene had previously been reported to be associated with other phenotype cataracts. This study is the first report relating a mutation of CRYBA1/A3 to posterior polar cataract. 	Mol._Vis.	D016428 D013485

The novel variations were as follows: -94C&gt;A in the 5'-untranslated region (A of the translation start codon is numbered +1 in the cDNA sequence; MPJ6_OC1001), 350C&gt;T (MPJ6_OC1004), IVS1-35T&gt;C (MPJ6_OC1006), 561G&gt;A (MPJ6_OC1010), IVS6+75C&gt;G (MPJ6_OC1014), IVS8+108A&gt;G (MPJ6_OC1017), and 1671_1673delATG (MPJ6_OC1020). The frequencies were 0.082 for IVS1-35T&gt;C, 0.022 for IVS6+75C&gt;G, 0.009 for 561G&gt;A, and 0.004 for the other 4 variations. Among them, 350C&gt;T resulted in the amino acid substitution Pro117Leu, which is located in the large extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 1 and 2. Also, we detected the four previously reported nonsynonymous variations, 123C&gt;G (Phe41Leu), 480C&gt;G (Phe160Leu), 1022C&gt;T (Pro341Leu), and 1222A&gt;G (Met408Val) with frequencies of 0.004, 0.086, 0.168, and 0.810, respectively.

25379004	20141108	Ginsenoside-Rp1-induced apolipoprotein A-1 expression in the LoVo human colon cancer cell line.	Ginsenoside Rp1 (G-Rp1) is a novel ginsenoside derived from ginsenoside Rk1. This compound was reported to have anticancer, anti-platelet, and anti-inflammatory activities. In this study, we examined the molecular target of the antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities of G-Rp1. To examine the effects of G-Rp1, cell proliferation assays, propidium iodine staining, proteomic analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting analysis, and a knockdown strategy were used. G-Rp1 dose-dependently suppressed the proliferation of colorectal cancer LoVo cells and increased their apoptosis. G-Rp1 markedly upregulated the protein level of apolipoprotein (Apo)-A1 in LoVo, SNU-407, DLD-1, SNU-638, AGS, KPL-4, and SK-BR-3 cells. The knockdown of Apo-A1 by its small-interfering RNA increased the levels of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and p53 and diminished the proliferation of LoVo cells. These results suggest that G-Rp1 may act as an anticancer agent by strongly inhibiting cell proliferation and enhancing apoptosis through upregulation of Apo-A1. 	J_Ginseng_Res	D016428
8650176	19960611	Receptor stimulation causes slow inhibition of IRK1 inwardly rectifying K+ channels by direct protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation.	Strongly rectifying IRK-type inwardly rectifying K+ channels are involved in the control of neuronal excitability in the mammalian brain. Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments show that cloned rat IRK1 (Kir 2.1) channels, when heterologously expressed in mammalian COS-7 cells, are inhibited following the activation of coexpressed serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) type 1A receptors by receptor agonists. Inhibition is mimicked by internal perfusion with GTP[gamma-S] and elevation of internal cAMP concentrations. Addition of the catalytic subunits of protein kinase A (PKA) to the internal recording solution causes complete inhibition of wild-type IRK1 channels, but not of mutant IRK1(S425N) channels in which a C-terminal PKA phosphorylation site has been removed. Our data suggest that in the nervous system serotonin may negatively control IRK1 channel activity by direct PKA-mediated phosphorylation. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 D013485
15305604	20040813	The necrotic pathotype of the cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) ns strain is solely determined by amino acid 461 of the 1a protein.	The unique Ns isolate of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) induces necrotic lesions on several Nicotiana spp. in contrast to other strains that cause systemic mosaic on these plants. By using biologically active RNA transcripts from cDNAs of Ns-CMV and a reference subgroup I strain Rs-CMV, we confined the genetic determinant solely responsible for necrosis induction to amino acid 461 of the la protein translated from genomic RNA1. An Arg to Cys change at this position (R461C) rendered Rs-CMV necrotic, whereas the reciprocal C461R mutation reverted the necrotic phenotype of Ns-CMV. Necrotic (Ns-CMV, R461C) and non-necrotic (Rs-CMV and C461R) viruses accumulated to similar levels in Nicotiana clevelandii protoplasts. Deletion of the residue at position 461 abolished replicase activity of the Ns-CMV 1a protein. The R461C mutation also was introduced into the 1a protein of Trk7-CMV, a subgroup II isolate. Symptoms induced by the Trk7/R461C mutant were identical to those caused by wild-type Trk7-CMV, even when the mutant Trk7 RNA1 was co-inoculated with RNA2 and 3 of the necrotic Ns strain.

24480837	20140201	Multimodal retinal imaging in a Chinese kindred with familial amyloid polyneuropathy secondary to transthyretin Ile107Met mutation.	To investigate the ocular phenotype and gene mutation of a Chinese pedigree with familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) and vitreous amyloidosis. A Chinese pedigree with familial amyloid polyneuropathy and vitreous amyloidosis was recruited. Combined phacoemulsification, vitrectomy and intraocular lens implantation were performed on the right eye of the index patient. Ophthalmic investigations were performed before and after surgery. The DNA from the pedigree was sequenced for the transthyretin (TTR) gene. After vitrectomy, the best-corrected visual acuity of the patient improved from counting finger to 20/20. Red-free confocal ophthalmoscopy demonstrated perifoveal ring and several perivessel white sheaths. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed cotton wool like reflections on the vitreoretinal interface. Electroretinogram and autofluorescence was normal. Amyloid was present in the vitreous specimen. A substitution of T to G at nucleotide 381 in exon 4 of TTR DNA (Ile107Met) was found. This mutation co-segregated with phenotype in the pedigree and was not detected in 200 controls. TTR Ile107Met mutation is associated with vitreous amyloidosis and FAP. OCT and red-free imaging are helpful in identifying amyloid deposits in the retina. 	Eye_(Lond)	D002363 D016428 D013485
26377914	20150918	Changes in transcription of cytokinin metabolism and signalling genes in grape (Vitis vinifera L.) berries are associated with the ripening-related increase in isopentenyladenine.	Cytokinins are known to play an important role in fruit set and early fruit growth, but their involvement in later stages of fruit development is less well understood. Recent reports of greatly increased cytokinin concentrations in the flesh of ripening kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa (A. Chev.) C.F. Liang &amp; A.R. Ferguson) and grapes (Vitis vinifera L.) have suggested that these hormones are implicated in the control of ripening-related processes. A similar pattern of isopentenyladenine (iP) accumulation was observed in the ripening fruit of several grapevine cultivars, strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum Mill.), suggesting a common, ripening-related role for this cytokinin. Significant differences in maximal iP concentrations between grapevine cultivars and between fruit species might reflect varying degrees of relevance or functional adaptations of this hormone in the ripening process. Grapevine orthologues of five Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana L.) gene families involved in cytokinin metabolism and signalling were identified and analysed for their expression in developing grape berries and a range of other grapevine tissues. Members of each gene family were characterised by distinct expression profiles during berry development and in different grapevine organs, suggesting a complex regulation of cellular cytokinin activities throughout the plant. The post-veraison-specific expression of a set of biosynthesis, activation, perception and signalling genes together with a lack of expression of degradation-related genes during the ripening phase were indicative of a local control of berry iP concentrations leading to the observed accumulation of iP in ripening grapes. The transcriptional analysis of grapevine genes involved in cytokinin production, degradation and response has provided a possible explanation for the ripening-associated accumulation of iP in grapes and other fruit. The pre- and post-veraison-specific expression of different members from each of five gene families suggests a highly complex and finely-tuned regulation of cytokinin concentrations and response to different cytokinin species at particular stages of fruit development. The same complexity and specialisation is also reflected in the distinct expression profiles of cytokinin-related genes in other grapevine organs. 	BMC_Plant_Biol.	D016428 D013485
21777591	20110723	Selection and expression of recombinant single domain antibodies from a hyper-immunized library against the hapten azoxystrobin.	Three V(H)Hs against the model hapten, azoxystrobin (MW 403), were isolated from a hyper-immunized phage-displayed V(H)H library. This library was constructed by isolating the V(H)H-coding genes from the lymphocytes collected from a Llama glama that was immunized with azoxystrobin conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA). Six rounds of panning were performed against azoxystrobin conjugated to either ovalbumin (OVA) or rabbit serum albumin (RSA) to enrich clones containing V(H)Hs specific to the hapten. After screening 95 clones, three V(H)Hs (A27, A72, and A85) with different amino acid sequences were identified, expressed in soluble format in Escherichia coli HB2151, and purified using nickel-immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CI-ELISA) showed that A27 and A85 were specific to azoxystrobin while A72 was not. The IC(50) values of A27 and A85 V(H)Hs were 7.2 and 2.0?M, respectively. To our knowledge A85 is one of the highest affinity V(H)Hs that has yet been isolated against a hydrophobic hapten such as azoxystrobin. 	J._Immunol._Methods	D016428 D013485
21697084	20110624	Crystal structure of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in an active conformation with normal thermodynamic stability.	The serpin plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a crucial regulator in fibrinolysis and tissue remodeling. PAI-1 has been associated with several pathological conditions and is a validated prognostic marker in human cancers. However, structural information about the native inhibitory form of PAI-1 has been elusive because of its inherent conformational instability and rapid conversion to a latent, inactive structure. Here we report the crystal structure of PAI-1 W175F at 2.3 ? resolution as the first model of the metastable native molecule. Structural comparison with a quadruple mutant (14-1B) previously used as representative of the active state uncovered key differences. The most striking differences occur near the region that houses three of the four mutations in the 14-1B PAI-1 structure. Prominent changes are localized within a loop connecting ?-strand 3A with the F helix, in which a previously observed 3(10)-helix is absent in the new structure. Notably these structural changes are found near the binding site for the cofactor vitronectin. Because vitronectin is the only known physiological regulator of PAI-1 that slows down the latency conversion, the structure of this region is important. Furthermore, the previously identified chloride-binding site close to the F-helix is absent from the present structure and likely to be artifactual, because of its dependence on the 14-1B mutations. Instead we found a different chlorine-binding site that is likely to be present in wild type PAI-1 and that more satisfactorily accounts for the chlorine stabilizing effect on PAI-1. 	J._Biol._Chem.

26838333	20160204	Physiological lipid composition is vital for homotypic ER membrane fusion mediated by the dynamin-related GTPase Sey1p.	Homotypic fusion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is required for generating and maintaining the characteristic reticular ER membrane structures. This organelle membrane fusion process depends on the ER-bound dynamin-related GTPases, such as atlastins in animals and Sey1p in yeast. Here, to investigate whether specific lipid molecules facilitate GTPase-dependent ER membrane fusion directly, we comprehensively evaluated membrane docking and lipid mixing of reconstituted proteoliposomes bearing purified Sey1p and a set of ER-mimicking lipids, including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid, and ergosterol. Remarkably, we revealed that each specific lipid species contributed little to membrane docking mediated by Sey1p. Nevertheless, Sey1p-dependent lipid mixing was strongly reduced by omitting three major acidic lipids from the ER-mimicking set and, moreover, was entirely abolished by omitting either phosphatidylethanolamine or ergosterol. Our reconstitution studies thus established that physiological lipid composition is vital for lipid bilayer rearrangements in GTPase-mediated homotypic ER membrane fusion. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D013485
27186175	20160518	Red cell distribution width and end-organ damage in patients with systo-diastolic hypertension.	Both end-organ damage and high red cell distribution width (RDW) values are associated with adverse cardiovascular events, inflammatory status, and neurohumoral activation in hypertensive disease and in the general population. In this study, we investigated the relationship between RDW and end-organ damage in hypertensive patients. The 446 systo-diastolic hypertensive patients included in the study received 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Left ventricular mass index, glomerular filtration rate, and microalbuminuria were measured to identify end-organ damage. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels of all patients were also examined. The mean age of the participants was 49.96 ?11.04 years. The mean RDW was 13.06 ?1.05%. Red cell distribution width was positively correlated with left ventricular myocardial index (LVMI), urinary albumin, hs-CRP, and NT-proBNP (r = 0.298, p &lt; 0.001; r = 0.228, p &lt; 0.001; r = 0.337, p &lt; 0.001; r = 0.277, p &lt; 0.001, respectively), while RDW was negatively correlated with eGFR (r = -0.153, p &lt; 0.001). Additionally, while there was a positive correlation between RDW and 24-h systolic blood pressure, no correlation was found between RDW and 24-h diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.132, p = 0.006 and r = 0.017, p = 0.725, respectively). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that RDW levels were independently associated with eGFR, LVMI, and severity of albuminuria (? = 0.126, p = 0.010; ? = -0.149, p = 0.002; ? = 0.114, p = 0.035). High RDW levels in systo-diastolic hypertensive patients were found to be an independent predictor of end-organ damage. 	Arch_Med_Sci	D016428
10860719	20000622	Interaction of translation initiation factor IF1 with the E. coli ribosomal A site.	Initiation Factor 1 (IF1) is required for the initiation of translation in Escherichia coli. However, the precise function of IF1 remains unknown. Current evidence suggests that IF1 is an RNA-binding protein that sits in the A site of the decoding region of 16 S rRNA. IF1 binding to 30 S subunits changes the reactivity of nucleotides in the A site to chemical probes. The N1 position of A1408 is enhanced, while the N1 positions of A1492 and A1493 are protected from reactivity with dimethyl sulfate (DMS). The N1-N2 positions of G530 are also protected from reactivity with kethoxal. Quantitative footprinting experiments show that the dissociation constant for IF1 binding to the 30 S subunit is 0.9 microM and that IF1 also alters the reactivity of a subset of Class III sites that are protected by tRNA, 50 S subunits, or aminoglycoside antibiotics. IF1 enhances the reactivity of the N1 position of A1413, A908, and A909 to DMS and the N1-N2 positions of G1487 to kethoxal. To characterize this RNA-protein interaction, several ribosomal mutants in the decoding region RNA were created, and IF1 binding to wild-type and mutant 30 S subunits was monitored by chemical modification and primer extension with allele-specific primers. The mutations C1407U, A1408G, A1492G, or A1493G disrupt IF1 binding to 30 S subunits, whereas the mutations G530A, U1406A, U1406G, G1491U, U1495A, U1495C, or U1495G had little effect on IF1 binding. Disruption of IF1 binding correlates with the deleterious phenotypic effects of certain mutations. IF1 binding to the A site of the 30 S subunit may modulate subunit association and the fidelity of tRNA selection in the P site through conformational changes in the 16 S rRNA. 	J._Mol._Biol.

17691429	20070819	[Human African trypanosomiasis: involvement of host genetics].	Two genetic epidemiological studies were carried out in the Ivory Coast and Democratic Republic of Congo to assess the role of human genetic diversity in susceptibility to human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). Findings showed that four single DNA polymorphisms located on genes coding for cytokines were correlated with a variable risk for development of the disease. Whereas presence of the rare A and T alleles for IL10 592 C/A and IL6 4339 C/T polymorphisms appeared to protect against HAT, presence of the T allele and AA genotype for IL1 5417 C/T and TNFalpha-308 G/A polymorphisms were correlated with an increase in HAT risk. These results will improve understanding of the host-parasite interaction and, ultimately, assist the development of new therapeutic and prophylactic tools. 	Med_Trop_(Mars)	D004740 D016428 D016454
11606828	20011019	An AQP1 null allele in an Indian woman with Co(a-b-) phenotype and high-titer anti-Co3 associated with mild HDN.	The Colton blood group system (CO, ISBT 015) is composed of three antigens, of which Co3 (ISBT 015.003) is carried by almost all persons, except those of the extremely rare Co(a-b-) phenotype. The Colton blood group antigens are expressed by the water channel aquaporin 1 (aqp1; also known as channel-forming integral protein, CHIP-28), which is a highly conserved RBC integral membrane protein. The two most frequent alleles, CO1 and CO2, encode the antigens Co(a) and Co(b), respectively. Four null alleles have been described for the AQP1 gene to date. An Indian woman had an alloimmune antibody to an high-frequency antigen associated with mild HDN. Her RBCs were typed Co(a--b-), and the antibody was an anti-Co3. She typed CO1-positive and CO2-negative in a new genotyping method, using PCR with sequence-specific priming, for CO1 and CO2. A method for nucleotide sequencing of the four AQP1 exons from genomic DNA was developed. The patient was shown to be homozygous for a nonfunctional allele AQP1(232delG) that also carried the CO1-specific polymorphism. The kindred presented a fifth example of an AQP1 null allele, which was caused by a single nucleotide deletion leading to a shift in the reading frame beyond codon 78. A method of genotyping CO for Co(a) and Co(b) antigen phenotype prediction was presented. 	Transfusion	D002363 D016428 D013485
27609304	20160910	Analyses of point mutation repair and allelic heterogeneity generated by CRISPR/Cas9 and single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides.	The repair of a point mutation can be facilitated by combined activity of a single-stranded oligonucleotide and a CRISPR/Cas9 system. While the mechanism of action of combinatorial gene editing remains to be elucidated, the regulatory circuitry of nucleotide exchange executed by oligonucleotides alone has been largely defined. The presence of the appropriate CRISPR/Cas9 system leads to an enhancement in the frequency of gene editing directed by single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides. While CRISPR/Cas9 executes double-stranded DNA cleavage efficiently, closure of the broken chromosomes is dynamic, as varying degrees of heterogeneity of the cleavage products appear to accompany the emergence of the corrected base pair. We provide a detailed analysis of allelic variance at and surrounding the target site. In one particular case, we report sequence alteration directed by a distinct member of the same gene family. Our data suggests that single-stranded DNA molecules may influence DNA junction heterogeneity created by CRISPR/Cas9. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
26421063	20151001	Transgelin gene is frequently downregulated by promoter DNA hypermethylation in breast cancer.	CpG hypermethylation in gene promoters is a frequent mechanism of tumor suppressor gene silencing in various types of cancers. It usually occurs at early steps of cancer progression and can be detected easily, giving rise to development of promising biomarkers for both detection and progression of cancer, including breast cancer. 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (AZA) is a DNA demethylating and anti-cancer agent resulting in induction of genes suppressed via DNA hypermethylation. Using microarray expression profiling of AZA- or DMSO-treated breast cancer and non-tumorigenic breast (NTB) cells, we identified for the first time TAGLN gene as a target of DNA hypermethylation in breast cancer. TAGLN expression was significantly and frequently downregulated via promoter DNA hypermethylation in breast cancer cells compared to NTB cells, and also in 13/21 (61.9?%) of breast tumors compared to matched normal tissues. Analyses of public microarray methylation data showed that TAGLN was also hypermethylated in 63.02?% of tumors compared to normal tissues; relapse-free survival of patients was worse with higher TAGLN methylation; and methylation levels could discriminate between tumors and healthy tissues with 83.14?% sensitivity and 100?% specificity. Additionally, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry experiments showed that TAGLN expression was significantly downregulated in two more independent sets of breast tumors compared to normal tissues and was lower in tumors with poor prognosis. Colony formation was increased in TAGLN silenced NTB cells, while decreased in overexpressing BC cells. TAGLN gene is frequently downregulated by DNA hypermethylation, and TAGLN promoter methylation profiles could serve as a future diagnostic biomarker, with possible clinical impact regarding the prognosis in breast cancer.

15962670	20050621	A germline mutation in a Thai family with familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.	Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, caused by the mutation in the MEN1 gene, is an autosomal dominant disorder with over 95% penetrance characterized by hyperparathyroidism, pancreatic endocrine tumor and pituitary tumor. The authors performed a molecular analysis to identify a mutation in a Thai man with MEN1. He was found to be heterozygous for IVS6 + 1G to A. Two of his three children were also found to carry this mutation. The newly available genetic test for patients with MEN1 in Thailand makes it possible to accurately DNA-based diagnose clinically suspected individuals and their presymptomatic members, which has important therapeutic impacts on them.

26904173	20160224	The Role of Hippocampal 5HT3 Receptors in Harmaline-Induced Memory Deficit.	The plethora of studies indicated that there is a cross talk relationship between harmaline and serotonergic (5-HT) system on cognitive and non-cognitive behaviors. Thus, the purpose of this study is to assess the effects of hippocampal 5-HT4 receptor on memory acquisition deficit induced by harmaline. Harmaline was injected peritoneally, while 5-HT4 receptor agonist (RS67333) and antagonist (RS23597-190) were injected intra-hippocampal. A single-trial step-down passive avoidance, open field and tail flick tasks were used for measurement of memory, locomotor activity and pain responses, respectively. The data revealed that pre-training injection of higher dose of harmaline (1 mg/kg), RS67333 (0.5 ng/mouse) and RS23597-190 (0.5 ng/mouse) decreased memory acquisition process in the adult mice. Moreover, concurrent pre-training administration of subthreshold dose of RS67333 (0.005 ng/mouse) or RS23597-190 (0.005 ng/mouse) with subthreshold dose of harmaline (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) intensify impairment of memory acquisition. All above interventions did not change locomotion and tail flick behaviors. The results demonstrated that the synergistic effect between both hippocampal 5-HT4 receptor agonist and antagonist with impairment of memory acquisition induced by harmaline, indicating a modulatory effect for hippocampal 5HT4 receptor on Harmaline induced amnesia.

26188903	20150720	HPV-type-specific response of cervical cancer cells to cisplatin after silencing replication licensing factor MCM4.	Minichoromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins play key role in cell cycle progression by licensing DNA replication only once per cell cycle. These proteins are found to be overexpressed in cervical cancer cells. In this study, we depleted MCM4, one of the MCM 2-7 complex components by RNA interference (RNAi) in four cervical cancer cell lines. The four cell lines were selected on the basis of their human papillomavirus (HPV) infection: HPV16-positive SiHa, HPV18-positive ME-180, HPV16- and HPV18-positive CaSki, and HPV-negative C-33A. The MCM4-deficient cells irrespective of their HPV status grow for several generations and maintain regular cell cycle. We did not find any evidence of augmented response to a short-term (48 h) cisplatin treatment in these MCM4-deficient cells. However, MCM4-/HPV16+ SiHa cells cannot withstand a prolonged treatment (up to 5 days) of even a sublethal dosage of cisplatin. They show increased chromosomal instability compared to their control counterparts. On the other hand, MCM4-deficient CaSki cells (both HPV16+ and 18+) remain resistant to a prolonged exposure to cisplatin. Our study indicates that cervical cancer cells may be using excess MCMs as a backup for replicative stress; however, its regulatory mechanism is dependent on the HPV status of the cells.

20421970	20100428	The enzyme and the cDNA sequence of a thermolabile and double-strand specific DNase from Northern shrimps (Pandalus borealis).	We have previously isolated a thermolabile nuclease specific for double-stranded DNA from industrial processing water of Northern shrimps (Pandalus borealis) and developed an application of the enzyme in removal of contaminating DNA in PCR-related technologies. A 43 kDa nuclease with a high specific activity of hydrolysing linear as well as circular forms of DNA was purified from hepatopancreas of Northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis). The enzyme displayed a substrate preference that was shifted from exclusively double-stranded DNA in the presence of magnesium to also encompass significant activity against single-stranded DNA when calcium was added. No activity against RNA was detected. Although originating from a cold-environment animal, the shrimp DNase has only minor low-temperature activity. Still, the enzyme was irreversibly inactivated by moderate heating with a half-life of 1 min at 65 degrees C. The purified protein was partly sequenced and derived oligonucleotides were used to prime amplification of the encoding cDNA. This cDNA sequence revealed an open reading frame encoding a 404 amino acid protein containing a signal peptide. By sequence similarity the enzyme is predicted to belong to a family of DNA/RNA non-specific nucleases even though this shrimp DNase lacks RNase activity and is highly double-strand specific in some respects. These features are in agreement with those previously established for endonucleases classified as similar to the Kamchatka crab duplex-specific nuclease (Par_DSN). Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses confirmed that the Northern shrimp nuclease resembles the Par_DSN-like nucleases and displays a more distant relationship to the Serratia family of nucleases. The shrimp nuclease contains enzyme activity that may be controlled by temperature or buffer compositions. The double-stranded DNA specificity, as well as the thermolabile feature, strengthens its potential for in vitro applications. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
23840803	20130711	Cyclotides Suppress Human T-Lymphocyte Proliferation by an Interleukin 2-Dependent Mechanism.	Cyclotides are a diverse and abundant group of ribosomally synthesized plant peptides containing a unique cyclic cystine-knotted topology that confers them with remarkable stability. Kalata B1, a representative member of this family of mini-proteins, has been found to inhibit the proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Analysis of T-cell proliferation upon treatment with chemically synthesized kalata B1 mutants revealed a region comprising inter-cysteine loops 1 and 2 of the cyclotide framework to be important for biological activity. Cytokine signaling analysis using an 'active' kalata B1 mutant [T20K], and the reference drug cyclosporin A (CsA) demonstrated that treatment of activated T-lymphocytes with these compounds decreased the expression of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) surface receptor as well as IL-2 cytokine secretion and IL-2 gene expression, whereas the 'inactive' kalata B1 mutant [V10K] did not cause any effects. The anti-proliferative activity of [T20K] kalata B1 was antagonized by addition of exogenous IL-2. Furthermore, treatment with [T20K] kalata B1 led to an initial reduction of the effector function, as indicated by the reduced IFN-? and TNF-? production, but the levels of both cytokines stabilized over time and returned to their normal levels. On the other hand, the degranulation activity remained reduced. This indicated that cyclotides interfere with T-cell polyfunctionality and arrest the proliferation of immune-competent cells through inhibiting IL-2 biology at more than one site. The results open new avenues to utilize native and synthetically-optimized cyclotides for applications in immune-related disorders and as immunosuppressant peptides. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428
24725463	20140415	Analysis of common and coding variants with cardiovascular disease in the Diabetes Heart Study.	Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor. Identification of genetic risk factors for CVD is important to understand disease risk. Two recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium detected CVD-associated loci. Variants identified in CHARGE were tested for association with CVD phenotypes, including vascular calcification, and conventional CVD risk factors, in the Diabetes Heart Study (DHS) (n?=?1208; &gt;80% T2DM affected). This included 36 genotyped or imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from DHS GWAS data. 28 coding SNPs from 14 top CHARGE genes were also identified from exome sequencing resources and genotyped, along with 209 coding variants from the Illumina HumanExome BeadChip genotype data in the DHS were also tested. Genetic risk scores (GRS) were calculated to evaluate the association of combinations of variants with CVD measures. After correction for multiple comparisons, none of the CHARGE SNPs were associated with vascular calcification (p?&lt;?0.0014). Multiple SNPs showed nominal significance with calcification, including rs599839 (PSRC1, p?=?0.008), rs646776 (CELSR2, p?=?0.01), and rs17398575 (PIK3CG, p?=?0.009). Additional COL4A2 and CXCL12 SNPs were nominally associated with all-cause or CVD-cause mortality. Three SNPs were significantly or nominally associated with serum lipids: rs3135506 (Ser19Trp, APOA5) with triglycerides (TG) (p?=?5?10(-5)), LDL (p?=?0.00070), and nominally with high density lipoprotein (HDL) (p?=?0.0054); rs651821 (5'UTR, APOA5) with increased TGs (p?=?0.0008); rs13832449 (splice donor, APOC3) associated with decreased TGs (p?=?0.0015). Rs45456595 (CDKN2A, Gly63Arg), rs5128 (APOC3, 3'UTR), and rs72650673 (SH2B3, Glu400Lys) were nominally associated with history of CVD, subclinical CVD, or CVD risk factors (p?&lt;?0.010). From the exome chip, rs3750103 (CHN2, His204Arg/His68Arg) with carotid intima-medial thickness (IMT) (p?=?3.9?10(-5)), and rs61937878 (HAL, Val549Met) with infra-renal abdominal aorta CP (AACP) (p?=?7.1?10(-5)). The unweighted GRS containing coronary artery calcified plaque (CAC) SNPs was nominally associated with history of prior CVD (p?=?0.033; OR?=?1.09). The weighted GRS containing SNPs was associated with CAC and myocardial infarction (MI) was associated with history of MI (p?=?0.026; OR?=?1.15). Genetic risk factors for subclinical CVD in the general population (CHARGE) were modestly associated with T2DM-related risk factors and CVD outcomes in the DHS. 	Cardiovasc_Diabetol	D016428 D052061

Two novel cell-wall-less, acidophilic, mesophilic, organotrophic and facultatively anaerobic archaeal strains were isolated from acidic streamers formed on the surfaces of copper-ore-containing sulfidic deposits in south-west Spain and North Wales, UK. Cells of the strains varied from 0.1 to 2??m in size and were pleomorphic, with a tendency to form filamentous structures. The optimal pH and temperature for growth for both strains were 1.0-1.2 and 37-40??C, with the optimal substrates for growth being beef extract (3?g l-?1) for strain S5T and beef extract with tryptone (3 and 1?g l-?1, respectively) for strain PM4. The lipid composition was dominated by intact polar lipids consisting of a glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) core attached to predominantly glycosidic polar headgroups. In addition, free GDGT and small relative amounts of intact and core diether lipids were present. Strains S5T and PM4 possessed mainly menaquinones with minor fractions of thermoplasmaquinones. The DNA G+C content was 37.3?mol% in strain S5T and 37.16?mol% for strain PM4. A similarity matrix of 16S rRNA gene sequences (identical for both strains) showed their affiliation to the order Thermoplasmatales, with 73.9-86.3?% identity with sequences from members of the order with validly published names. The average nucleotide identity between genomes of the strains determined in silico was 98.75?%, suggesting, together with the 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic analysis, that the strains belong to the same species. A novel family, Cuniculiplasmataceae fam. nov., genus Cuniculiplasma gen. nov. and species Cuniculiplasma divulgatum sp. nov. are proposed based on the phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic analyses and physiological properties of the two isolates, S5T and PM4 (?=?JCM 30641?=?VKM B-2940). The type strain of Cuniculiplasma divulgatum is S5T (?=?JCM 30642T?=?VKM B-2941T). 	Int._J._Syst._Evol._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485
24532968	20140218	Biomarkers in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: confusing or useful?	The field of biomarker research has almost reached unmanageable proportions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The developments of new technology platforms have generated a huge information data base, both cross sectionally and increasingly, longitudinally. The knowledge emerging provides an enormous potential for understanding the disease pathophysiology, for developing markers specific for long-term outcomes, and for developing new therapeutic strategies. However, the excitement must be tempered with an understanding of the limitations of the data collection techniques, and of the variations in disease state, activity, impact, and progression. Nevertheless, the most crucial aspect in interpreting the current literature is the recognition of the relatively superficial characterization of what is a complex group of pathological processes with a common end point of airflow limitation. The current review explores some of these issues together with those areas where real progress appears to have been made, and provides caution on interpretation.

18511044	20080531	Parkinson patient fibroblasts show increased alpha-synuclein expression.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder of advanced age with largely unknown etiology, but well documented tissue damage from oxidative stress. Increased alpha-synuclein (SNCA) expression is known to cause a rare form of PD, early-onset autosomal dominant PARK4. We have previously shown that loss-of-function mutations of the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 which cause the early-onset recessive PARK6 variant result in oxidative damage in patient fibroblasts. We now investigated the molecular chain of events from mitochondrial dysfunction to cell death which is largely unknown. Primary skin fibroblast cultures from patients were analysed for gene expression anomalies. In G309D-PINK1 patient fibroblasts, mainly genes regulated by oxidative stress, as well as genes encoding synaptic proteins such as SNCA showed altered expression. The induction of SNCA was also observed in control fibroblasts with knock-down of PINK1. The induction of SNCA expression was found to constitute a specific disease biomarker in sporadic PD patient fibroblasts. To understand the mechanism of this induction, we exposed control fibroblasts to oxidative, proteasomal and endoplasmic reticulum stress and were able to trigger the SNCA expression upregulation. Our data indicate that loss-of-function of PINK1 leads to enhanced alpha-synuclein expression and altered cell-cell contact. Alpha-synuclein induction might represent a common event for different variants of PD as well as a PD-specific trigger of neurodegeneration. We propose that the expression changes described might potentially serve as biomarkers that allow objective PD patient diagnosis in an accessible, peripheral tissue. 	Exp._Neurol.	D016428 D013485

The study included 245 women who comprised 110 surgically confirmed cases of endometriosis, 50 ultrasonographically confirmed cases of fibroid tumors, and 85 healthy female volunteers. Academic hospital. The cases were 245 women, 160 patients and 85 controls. None. Tumor necrosis factor alpha -C850T polymorphism may be used as a molecular marker for endometriosis in our population. In this study we have demonstrated an association between TNFA -C850T polymorphism and endometriosis. The T allele is significantly associated with endometriosis when compared to women with fibroids as well as healthy controls. Our data imply that the T allele is associated with endometriosis (OR = 1.9594: 95% CI, 1.3833-2.7753; in our population. The TT genotype increases the risk of endometriosis by fourfold (4.5542: 95% CI, 2.0388-10.1701. This study suggests that -C850T TNFA gene polymorphism could be used as a relevant molecular marker to identify women with risk of developing endometriosis in our population. 	Fertil._Steril.

20508832	20100529	Immunization with a Mixture of HIV Env DNA and VLP Vaccines Augments Induction of CD8 T Cell Responses.	The immune response induced by immunization with HIV Env DNA and virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines was investigated. Immunization with the HIV Env DNA vaccine induced a strong CD8 T cell response but relatively weak antibody response against the HIV Env whereas immunization with VLPs induced higher levels of antibody responses but little CD8 T cell response. Interestingly, immunization with a mixture the HIV Env DNA and VLP vaccines induced enhanced CD8 T cell and antibody responses. Further, it was observed that the mixing of DNA and VLP vaccines during immunization is necessary for augmenting induction of CD8 T cell responses and such augmentation of CD8 T cell responses was also observed by mixing the HIV Env DNA vaccine with control VLPs. These results show that immunization with a mixture of DNA and VLP vaccines combines advantages of both vaccine platforms for eliciting high levels of both antibody and CD8 T cell responses.

A rare polymorphism in the gene encoding 11B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD11B1: rs846911-C/A) has been associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. We tested the hypothesis that this and 2 other HSD11B1 polymorphisms (rs12086634-G/T and rs846910-A/G) were associated with lifetime cognitive change in humans. Subjects were 194 participants of the Scottish Mental Survey of 1932 who took the same well-validated mental test at age 11 and age 79. The subjects represented the highest and lowest quintiles with respect to cognitive decline between ages 11 and 79. Despite having non-significantly different IQs at age 11, by age 79 the groups had mean (S.D.) IQs of 80.3 (14.1) and 109.6 (9.1), respectively (p&lt;.001). The polymorphism rs846911-C/A was absent from both groups. There were no significant differences in the frequency of polymorphisms of rs12086634-G/T (p=.91) and rs846910-A/G (p=.90) between the groups. We conclude that these variants in HSD11B1 are not significant contributors to the range of cognitive ageing examined here. 	Neurosci._Lett.	D003160 D016428 D013485
21828074	20110811	'Progress' renders detrimental an ancient mitochondrial DNA genetic variant.	A human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transition, m.1555A&gt;G, in the 12S rRNA gene causes non-syndromic hearing loss. However, this pathological mutation is the wild-type allele in orangutan mtDNA. Here we rule out different genetic factors as the reason for its fixation in orangutans and show that aminoglycosides negatively affect the oxidative phosphorylation function by decreasing the synthesis of mtDNA-encoded proteins and the amount and activity of respiratory complex IV. These drugs also diminish the growth rate of orangutan cells. The m.1555G nucleotide is also the wild-type allele in other mammal species and they might be at risk of suffering a mitochondrial disorder if treated with aminoglycosides. Therefore, pharmacogenomic approaches should be used to confirm this possibility. These observations are important for human health. Due to the fact that old age and high frequency are criteria widely used in mitochondrial medicine to rule out a genetic change as being a pathological mutation, our results prevent against simplistic genetic approaches that do not consider the potential effect of environmental conditions. Hence, these results suggest that some ancient and highly frequent human population polymorphisms, such as those defining mtDNA haplogroups, in mitochondrial rRNA genes can be deleterious in association with new environmental conditions. Therefore, as the discovery of ribosomal antibiotics has allowed to fight infectious diseases and this breakthrough can be considered an important scientific advance or 'progress', our results suggest that 'progress' can also have a negative counterpart and render detrimental many of these mtDNA genotypes.

24205486	20131109	HbA1c: a review of analytical and clinical aspects.	After the relationship between glycemic control and the HbA1c concentration was demonstrated, many tests have been developed to determine the HbA1c concentration. The test results are standardized to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) Reference Measurement Procedure (RMP) in harmony with the efforts of the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The longitudinal use of the test requires strict quality management including accreditation of the laboratory, a dedicated internal control design, participation in an external quality assessment (EQA) program (proficiency test), and careful consideration of pre- and post-analytical aspects of the test. Performance goals for optimizing determination of the HbA1c concentration have been described. As an index of long-term glycemic control and a risk predictor, the HbA1c concentration is an indispensable part of routine management of diabetes. Because of the improving quality of the test, the HbA1c concentration is being increasingly applied in the diagnosis of diabetes. There are, however, concerns of this application in point-of-care settings. The HbA1c concentration is also used to achieve stringent control in pregnant diabetic patients. Strict standardization enables the definition of universal reference values and clinical decision limits. This review describes the present status of analytical and clinical aspects of determining the HbA1c concentration and highlights the challenges involved. 	Ann_Lab_Med	D016428 D016454
26043853	20150606	Enhanced Xylitol Production by Mutant Kluyveromyces marxianus 36907-FMEL1 Due to Improved Xylose Reductase Activity.	A directed evolution and random mutagenesis were carried out with thermotolerant yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus ATCC 36907 for efficient xylitol production. The final selected strain, K. marxianus 36907-FMEL1, exhibited 120 and 39 % improvements of xylitol concentration and xylitol yield, respectively, as compared to the parental strain, K. marxianus ATCC 36907. According to enzymatic assays for xylose reductase (XR) activities, XR activity from K. marxianus 36907-FMEL1 was around twofold higher than that from the parental strain. Interestingly, the ratios of NADH-linked and NADPH-linked XR activities were highly changed from 1.92 to 1.30 when K. marxianus ATCC 36907 and K. marxianus 36907-FMEL1 were compared. As results of KmXYL1 genes sequencing, it was found that cysteine was substituted to tyrosine at position 36 after strain development which might cause enhanced XR activity from K. marxianus 36907-FMEL1.

25790254	20150320	Deregulation of DNA double-strand break repair in multiple myeloma: implications for genome stability.	Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy characterized by frequent chromosome abnormalities. However, the molecular basis for this genome instability remains unknown. Since both impaired and hyperactive double strand break (DSB) repair pathways can result in DNA rearrangements, we investigated the functionality of DSB repair in MM cells. Repair kinetics of ionizing-radiation (IR)-induced DSBs was similar in MM and normal control lymphoblastoid cell lines, as revealed by the comet assay. However, four out of seven MM cell lines analyzed exhibited a subset of persistent DSBs, marked by ?-H2AX and Rad51 foci that elicited a prolonged G2/M DNA damage checkpoint activation and hypersensitivity to IR, especially in the presence of checkpoint inhibitors. An analysis of the proteins involved in DSB repair in MM cells revealed upregulation of DNA-PKcs, Artemis and XRCC4, that participate in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and Rad51, involved in homologous recombination (HR). Accordingly, activity of both NHEJ and HR were elevated in MM cells compared to controls, as determined by in vivo functional assays. Interestingly, levels of proteins involved in a highly mutagenic, translocation-promoting, alternative NHEJ subpathway (Alt-NHEJ) were also increased in all MM cell lines, with the Alt-NHEJ protein DNA ligase III?, also overexpressed in several plasma cell samples isolated from MM patients. Overactivation of the Alt-NHEJ pathway was revealed in MM cells by larger deletions and higher sequence microhomology at repair junctions, which were reduced by chemical inhibition of the pathway. Taken together, our results uncover a deregulated DSB repair in MM that might underlie the characteristic genome instability of the disease, and could be therapeutically exploited.

17505512	20070517	Investigation of pathogenic mechanisms in multiple colorectal adenoma patients without germline APC or MYH/MUTYH mutations.	Patients with multiple (5-100) colorectal adenomas (MCRAs) often have no germline mutation in known predisposition genes, but probably have a genetic origin. We collected a set of 25 MCRA patients with no detectable germline mutation in APC, MYH/MUTYH or the mismatch repair genes. Extracolonic tumours were absent in these cases. No vertical transmission of the MCRA phenotype was found. Based on the precedent of MYH-associated polyposis (MAP), we searched for a mutational signature in 241 adenomatous polyps from our MCRA cases. Somatic mutation frequencies and spectra at APC, K-ras and BRAF were, however, similar to those in sporadic colorectal adenomas. Our data suggest that the genetic pathway of tumorigenesis in the MCRA patients' tumours is very similar to the classical pathway in sporadic adenomas. In sharp contrast to MAP tumours, we did not find evidence of a specific mutational signature in any individual patient or in the overall set of MCRA cases. These results suggest that hypermutation of APC does not cause our patients' disease and strongly suggests that MAP is not a paradigm for the remaining MCRA patients. Our MCRA patients' colons showed no evidence of microadenomas, unlike in MAP and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). However, nuclear beta-catenin expression was significantly greater in MCRA patients' tumours than in sporadic adenomas. We suggest that, at least in some cases, the MCRA phenotype results from germline variation that acts subsequent to tumour initiation, perhaps by causing more rapid or more likely progression from microadenoma to macroadenoma.

26201355	20150724	Mutation analysis of BEST1 in Japanese patients with Best's vitelliform macular dystrophy.	To describe the clinical and genetic features of Japanese patients with Best's vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD). This study examined 22 patients, including 16 probands from 16 families with BVMD. Comprehensive ophthalmic examinations were performed, including dilated funduscopy, full-field electroretinography (ERG) and electro-oculography (EOG). BEST1 mutation analysis was performed by Sanger sequencing. All 16 probands exhibited characteristic BVMD fundus appearances, abnormal EOG, and normal ERG responses with the exception of one diabetic retinopathy proband. Genetic analysis identified 12 BEST1 variants in 13 probands (81%). Of these, 10 variants (p.T2A, p.R25W, p.F80L, p.V81M, p.A195V, p.R218H, p.G222E, p.V242M, p.D304del and p.E306D) have been previously reported in BVMD, while two variants (p.S7N and p.P346H) were novel, putative disease-causing variants. Single BEST1 variants were found in 12 probands. The one proband with compound heterozygous variants (p.S7N and p.R218H) exhibited typical BVMD phenotypes (pseudohypopyon stage and vitelliruptive stage in the right and left eyes, respectively). Twelve different variants, two of which (p.S7N and p.P346H) were novel, were identified in the 13 Japanese families with BVMD. Compound heterozygous variants were found in one proband exhibiting a typical BVMD phenotype. Our results suggest that BEST1 variants do play a large role in Japanese patients with BVMD.

22455393	20120330	A functional polymorphism in Pre-miR-146a is associated with susceptibility to gastric cancer in a Chinese population.	MicroRNAs play an important role in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and are involved in numerous physiological processes. Aberrant expression of MicroRNAs is considered to participate in occurrence and progression of human cancers. A G&gt;C polymorphism, rs2910164, which is located in the sequence of miR-146a precursor, could alter mature miR-146a expression and has been suggested to influence cancer risk. The present study was aimed to investigate whether this polymorphism has effects on susceptibility to gastric cancer in the Chinese population. We genotyped the miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism using the TaqMan method in a two-stage case-control study comprising a total of 1686 gastric cancer patients and 1895 cancer-free subjects. The logistic regression was used to assess the genetic associations with gastric cancer risk. We found a significant association between rs2910164 polymorphism and increased gastric cancer risk [p = 0.038, odds ratio (OR) = 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01-1.56; GG vs. CC/CG]. Similar results were observed in a follow-up replication study. Combined data from the two studies generated a more significant association [p = 0.001, OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.10-1.46; GG vs. CC/CG]. Besides, the increased risk associated with the rs2910164GG genotype was more evident in younger subjects (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.25-1.81) rather than in older subjects. Our results suggest that the rs2910164 polymorphism in the sequence of miR-146a precursor may influence the susceptibility to gastric cancer in our Chinese population. 	DNA_Cell_Biol.

25714598	20150226	First-in-Man Study With Inclacumab, a Human Monoclonal Antibody Against P-selectin.	Inclacumab, a novel monoclonal antibody against P-selectin in development for the treatment and prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, was administered in an ascending single-dose study as intravenous infusion to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Fifty-six healthy subjects were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study. Each dose level (0.03-20 mg/kg) was investigated in separate groups of 8 subjects (6 on inclacumab, 2 on placebo). Platelet-leukocyte aggregates, free/total soluble P-selectin concentration ratio, drug concentrations, bleeding time, platelet aggregation, antibody formation, and routine laboratory parameters were measured frequently until 32 weeks. Pharmacokinetic profiles were indicative of target-mediated drug disposition. Platelet-leukocyte aggregate inhibition and soluble P-selectin occupancy showed dose dependency and were strongly correlated to inclacumab plasma concentrations, with IC50 of 740 and 4600 ng/mL, respectively. Inclacumab was well tolerated by the majority of subjects and did neither affect bleeding time nor platelet aggregation. These findings allowed the investigation of the potential beneficial therapeutic use of inclacumab in patient study. 	J._Cardiovasc._Pharmacol.	D016428 D016449 D013485

25569695	20150109	Factors associated with daily consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages among adult patients at four federally qualified health centers, Bronx, New York, 2013.	Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) is associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors. This study examined the relationships between SSB consumption and demographic, health behavior, health service, and health condition characteristics of adult patients of a network of federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in a low-income, urban setting. Validated, standardized self-reported health behavior questions were incorporated into the electronic health record (EHR) and asked of patients yearly, at 4 FQHCs. We conducted cross-sectional analysis of EHR data collected in 2013 from 12,214 adult patients by using logistic regression. Forty percent of adult patients consumed 1 or more SSBs daily. The adjusted odds ratios indicated that patients who consumed more than 1 SSB daily were more likely to be aged 18 to 29 years versus age 70 or older, current smokers versus never smoking, eating no servings of fruits and/or vegetables daily or 1 to 4 servings daily versus 5 or more servings daily, and not walking or biking more than 10 blocks in the past 30 days. Patients consuming 1 or more servings of SSBs daily were less likely to speak Spanish than English, be women than men, be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes versus no diabetes, and be diagnosed with hypertension versus no hypertension. SSB consumption differed by certain demographic characteristics, health behaviors, and health conditions. Recording SSB intake and other health behaviors data in the EHR could help clinicians in identifying and counseling patients to promote health behavior changes. Future studies should investigate how EHR data on patient health behavior can be used to improve the health of patients and communities. 	Prev_Chronic_Dis	D016428 D016448
12668921	20030402	G-protein beta(3) subunit 825 C/T polymorphism is associated with weight gain during pregnancy.	A common polymorphism (C825T) of the gene encoding the G-protein beta(3) subunit has been associated with obesity. We examined the hypothesis that this polymorphism affected weight gain during pregnancy. Two hundred and ninety-four women with uncomplicated term deliveries of singleton pregnancies were genotyped. Women homozygous for the T allele (TT) gained significantly more weight than women carrying the C allele (CC and CT groups) (P = 0.006) and had a significantly higher pre-pregnancy body mass index (P = 0.02). The C825T polymorphism of the G-protein beta(3) subunit gene, known to be associated with obesity, is a determinant of weight gain during pregnancy. 	Pharmacogenetics	D016428 D013487
25517991	20141218	PiggyBac mediated multiplex gene transfer in mouse embryonic stem cell.	PiggyBac system has been shown to have a high efficiency to mediate gene transfer. However, there are no reports on its efficiency to mediate multiplex transgenes in mouse embryonic stem cells. Here we first established an immortalized feeder cell line by introducing four antibiotic resistance genes simultaneously into the original SNL 76/7 feeder cell line utilizing the PiggyBac system. This is the feeder cell line with the most diverse types of antibiotic resistance genes reported so far, which will enable researchers to perform simultaneous multiplex gene transfer or gene targeting experiments in ES cells. With such feeder cell line, we were able to quantitatively characterize the transposition efficiency of PiggyBac system in mouse ES cells using five transposons carrying different inducible fluorescence proteins and antibiotic resistance genes, and the efficiency ranged from about 2% for one transposon to 0.5% for five transposons. The highly efficient multiplex gene transfer mediated by PiggyBac will no doubt provide researchers with more choices in biomedical research and development. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
23698761	20130524	Ribonucleoprotein complexes that control circadian clocks.	Circadian clocks are internal molecular time-keeping mechanisms that enable organisms to adjust their physiology and behavior to the daily surroundings. Misalignment of circadian clocks leads to both physiological and health impairment. Post-transcriptional regulation and translational regulation of circadian clocks have been extensively investigated. In addition, accumulating evidence has shed new light on the involvement of ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) in the post-transcriptional regulation of circadian clocks. Numerous RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and RNPs have been implicated in the post-transcriptional modification of circadian clock proteins in different model organisms. Herein, we summarize the advances in the current knowledge on the role of RNP complexes in circadian clock regulation. 	Int_J_Mol_Sci	D016428 D013485 D016454
18997474	20081111	Promoter methylation and polymorphisms of the MGMT gene in glioblastomas: a population-based study.	O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a repair enzyme that removes promutagenic O(6)-methylguanine adducts in DNA, to protect cells from acquisition of G:C--&gt; A:T mutations. MGMT promoter methylation and polymorphisms may affect MGMT expression and activity. In the present study, we assessed MGMT promoter methylation and polymorphisms (Leu84Phe, Ile143Val, c.-56C&gt;T) in 371 glioblastomas diagnosed at the population level. MGMT methylation was observed in 165 (44%) glioblastomas, with a higher frequency in females than males (53 vs. 39%; p = 0.0106) and in secondary than primary glioblastomas (73 vs. 43%; p = 0.0074). The frequency of TP53 G:C--&gt;A:T mutations in glioblastomas with MGMT methylation was 25%, which was significantly higher than that in glioblastomas with MGMT methylation (16%; Fisher exact test; p = 0.0385). MGMT 143 Val allele in glioblastomas was significantly less frequent than in a healthy European Caucasian population, and was associated with longer survival than those with the MGMT 143 Ile allele (hazard ratio 0.70; 95% CI 0.48-1.01). These results suggest that MGMT methylation may be associated with susceptibility to acquire TP53 G:C--&gt;A:T mutations, and that MGMT polymorphisms may affect the risk and prognosis of glioblastomas.

25750636	20150310	Promoter methylation status of Ras-association domain family members in pheochromocytoma.	Pheochromocytomas (PCCs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors that arise from the medulla of the adrenal gland or the sympathetic ganglia and are characterized by the secretion of catecholamines. In 30-40% of patients, PCCs are genetically determined by susceptibility genes as various as RET, VHL, and NF1. We have analyzed the Ras-association domain family members (RASSFs) in PCCs regarding their inactivating promoter hypermethylation status. Previously, we reported a promoter methylation in PCC for the first family member RASSF1A. Promoter hypermethylation of CpG islands leads to the silencing of the according transcript and is a common mechanism for inactivation of tumor suppressors. In this study, we observed inactivating DNA modifications for the RASSF members RASSF2, RASSF5A, RASSF9, and RASSF10, but not for the members RASSF3, RASSF4, RASSF5C, RASSF6, RASSF7, and RASSF8. The degree of promoter methylation was 19% for RASSF2, 67% for RASSF5A, 18% for RASSF9, and 74% for RASSF10. Interestingly, the degree of hypermethylation for RASSF10 in hereditary PCCs was 89 vs. 60% in sporadic PCCs. A similar but less dramatic effect was observed in RASSF5A and RASSF9. Including all RASSF members, we found that of 25 PCCs, 92% show promoter methylation in at least in one RASSF member. In 75% of the hereditary PCC samples, we found two or more methylated RASSF promoters, whereas in sporadic PCCs only 46% were observed. In summary, we could show that in PCC several RASSF members are strongly hypermethylated in their promoter regions and methylation of more than one RASSF member occurs in the majority of PCCs. This adds the inactivation of genes of the RASSF tumor suppressor family to the already known deregulated genes of PCC. 	Front_Endocrinol_(Lausanne)	D016428
17640933	20070721	Low-affinity spermine block mediating outward currents through Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 inward rectifier potassium channels.	The outward component of the strong inward rectifier K(+) current (I(Kir)) plays a pivotal role in polarizing the membranes of excitable and non-excitable cells and is regulated by voltage-dependent channel block by internal cations. Using the Kir2.1 channel, we previously showed that a small fraction of the conductance susceptible only to a low-affinity mode of block likely carries a large portion of the outward current. To further examine the relevance of the low-affinity block to outward I(Kir) and to explore its molecular mechanism, we studied the block of the Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 channels by spermine, which is the principal Kir2 channel blocker. Current-voltage relations of outward Kir2.2 currents showed a peak, a plateau and two peaks in the presence of 10, 1 and 0.1 microm spermine, respectively, which was explained by the presence of two conductances that differ in their susceptibility to spermine block. When the current-voltage relations showed one peak, like those of native I(Kir), outward Kir2.2 currents were mediated mostly by the conductance susceptible to the low-affinity block. They also flowed in a narrower range than the corresponding Kir2.1 currents, because of 3- to 4-fold greater susceptibility to the low-affinity block than in Kir2.1. Reducing external [K(+)] shifted the voltage dependences of both the high- and low-affinity block of Kir2.1 in parallel with the shift in the reversal potential, confirming the importance of the low-affinity block in mediating outward I(Kir). When Kir2.1 mutants known to have reduced sensitivity to internal blockers were examined, the D172N mutation in the transmembrane pore region made almost all of the conductance susceptible only to low-affinity block, while the E224G mutation in the cytoplasmic pore region reduced the sensitivity to low-affinity block without markedly altering that to the high-affinity block or the high/low conductance ratio. The effects of these mutations support the hypothesis that Kir2 channels exist in two states having different susceptibilities to internal cationic blockers. 	J._Physiol._(Lond.)	D016428 D013485
25207269	20140911	Discovery of a novel iota carrageenan sulfatase isolated from the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas carrageenovora.	Carrageenans are sulfated polysaccharides extracted from the cell wall of some marine red algae. These polysaccharides are widely used as gelling, stabilizing, and viscosifying agents in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Since the rheological properties of these polysaccharides depend on their sulfate content, we screened several isolated marine bacteria for carrageenan specific sulfatase activity, in the aim of developing enzymatic bioconversion of carrageenans. As a result of the screening, an iota-carrageenan sulfatase was detected in the cell-free lysate of the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas carrageenovora strain Psc(T). It was purified through Phenyl Sepharose and Diethylaminoethyl Sepharose chromatography. The pure enzyme, Psc ?-CgsA, was characterized. It had a molecular weight of 115.9 kDaltons and exhibited an optimal activity/stability at pH ~8.3 and at 40 ? 5?C. It was inactivated by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride but not by ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid. Psc ?-CgsA specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of the 4-S sulfate of iota-carrageenan. The purified enzyme could transform iota-carrageenan into hybrid iota-/alpha- or pure alpha-carrageenan under controlled conditions. The gene encoding Psc ?-CgsA, a protein of 1038 amino acids, was cloned into Escherichia coli, and the sequence analysis revealed that Psc ?-CgsA has more than 90% sequence identity with a putative uncharacterized protein Q3IKL4 from the marine strain Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC 125, but besides this did not share any homology to characterized sulfatases. Phylogenetic studies show that P. carrageenovora sulfatase thus represents the first characterized member of a new sulfatase family, with a C-terminal domain having strong similarity with the superfamily of amidohydrolases, highlighting the still unexplored diversity of marine polysaccharide modifying enzymes.

7725307	19950101	HLA-B16 antigens: sequence of the ST-16 antigen, further definition of two B38 subtypes and evidence for convergent evolution of B*3902.	The ST-16 antigenic specificity of the HLA-B locus is defined as a B39 variant of Mexican-Americans. Nucleotide sequencing of cDNA shows the ST-16 allele (B*3905) differs from B*39011 by a single substitution that substitutes tyrosine for aspartic acid at position 74 of the mature class I heavy chain. The complete coding region sequence for the common caucasoid allele encoding the B38 antigen has been determined. This B*3801 allele differs from B*3802 at two nucleotide substitutions within the Bw4 sequence motif. B*3801 and B*3802 may have been derived independently from B*39011 by conversion events with B alleles donating distinctive Bw4 motifs. A novel allele B*39022 derived from a Colombian Indian differs from the B*39021 allele of Japanese origin at two widely separated silent substitutions. Comparison of sequences for the known B16 alleles suggest that B*39021 and B*39022 were independently derived by recombination from B*39013 and B*39011 respectively.

23224253	20121211	Profiling bacterial diversity and taxonomic composition on speleothem surfaces in Kartchner Caverns, AZ.	Caves are relatively accessible subterranean habitats ideal for the study of subsurface microbial dynamics and metabolisms under oligotrophic, non-photosynthetic conditions. A 454-pyrotag analysis of the V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene was used to systematically evaluate the bacterial diversity of ten cave surfaces within Kartchner Caverns, a limestone cave. Results showed an average of 1,994 operational taxonomic units (97 % cutoff) per speleothem and a broad taxonomic diversity that included 21 phyla and 12 candidate phyla. Comparative analysis of speleothems within a single room of the cave revealed three distinct bacterial taxonomic profiles dominated by either Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, or Acidobacteria. A gradient in observed species richness along the sampling transect revealed that the communities with lower diversity corresponded to those dominated by Actinobacteria while the more diverse communities were those dominated by Proteobacteria. A 16S rRNA gene clone library from one of the Actinobacteria-dominated speleothems identified clones with 99 % identity to chemoautotrophs and previously characterized oligotrophs, providing insights into potential energy dynamics supporting these communities. The robust analysis conducted for this study demonstrated a rich bacterial diversity on speleothem surfaces. Further, it was shown that seemingly comparable speleothems supported divergent phylogenetic profiles suggesting that these communities are very sensitive to subtle variations in nutritional inputs and environmental factors typifying speleothem surfaces in Kartchner Caverns.

Two mutations in the gene encoding alpha-synuclein have been linked to early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). alpha-Synuclein is a component of Lewy bodies, the fibrous cytoplasmic inclusions characteristic of nigral dopaminergic neurons in the PD brain. This connection between genetics and pathology suggests that the alpha-synuclein mutations may promote PD pathogenesis by accelerating Lewy body formation. To test this, we studied alpha-synuclein folding and aggregation in vitro, in the absence of other Lewy body-associated molecules. We demonstrate here that both mutant forms of alpha-synuclein (A53T and A30P) are, like wild-type alpha-synuclein (WT), disordered in dilute solution. However, at higher concentrations, Lewy body-like fibrils and discrete spherical assemblies are formed; most rapidly by A53T. Thus, mutation-induced acceleration of alpha-synuclein fibril formation may contribute to the early onset of familial PD. 	Nat._Med.	D016428 D013486
23618424	20130427	Clinical neuropathology practice guide 3-2013: levels of evidence and clinical utility of prognostic and predictive candidate brain tumor biomarkers.	A large number of potential tissue biomarkers has been proposed for brain tumors. However, hardly any have been adopted for routine clinical use, so far. For most candidate biomarkers substantial controversy exists with regard to their usefulness in clinical practice. The multidisciplinary neurooncology taskforce of the Vienna Comprehensive Cancer Center Central Nervous System Unit (CCC-CNS) addressed this issue and elaborated a four-tiered levels-of-evidence system for assessing analytical performance (reliability of test result) and clinical performance (prognostic or predictive) based on consensually defined criteria. The taskforce also consensually agreed that only biomarker candidates should be considered as ready for clinical use, which meet defined quality standards for both, analytical and clinical performance. Applying this levels-of-evidence system to MGMT, IDH1, 1p19q, Ki67, MYCC, MYCN and ?-catenin, only immunohistochemical IDH1 mutation testing in patients with diffuse gliomas is supported by sufficient evidence in order to be unequivocally qualified for clinical use. For the other candidate biomarkers lack of published evidence of sufficiently high analytical test performance and, in some cases, also of clinical performance limits evidence-based confirmation of their clinical utility. For most of the markers, no common standard of laboratory testing exists. We conclude that, at present, there is a strong need for studies that specifically address the analytical performance of candidate brain tumor biomarkers. In addition, standardization of laboratory testing is needed. We aim to regularly challenge and update the present classification in order to systematically clarify the current translational status of candidate brain tumor biomarkers and to identify specific research needs for accelerating the translational pace.

17239419	20070124	Changes in the V3 region of gp120 contribute to unusually broad coreceptor usage of an HIV-1 isolate from a CCR5 Delta32 heterozygote.	Heterozygosity for the CCR5 Delta32 allele is associated with delayed progression to AIDS in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Here we describe an unusual HIV-1 isolate from the blood of an asymptomatic individual who was heterozygous for the CCR5 Delta32 allele and had reduced levels of CCR5 expression. The primary virus used CCR5, CXCR4, and an unusually broad range of alternative coreceptors to enter transfected cells. However, only CXCR4 and CCR5 were used to enter primary T cells and monocyte-derived macrophages, respectively. Full-length Env clones had an unusually long V1/V2 region and rare amino acid variants in the V3 and C4 regions. Mutagenesis studies and structural models suggested that Y308, D321, and to a lesser extent K442 and E444, contribute to the broad coreceptor usage of these Envs, whereas I317 is likely to be a compensatory change. Furthermore, database analysis suggests that covariation can occur at positions 308/317 and 308/321 in vivo. Y308 and D321 reduced dependence on the extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) region of CCR5, while these residues along with Y330, K442, and E444 enhanced dependence on the CCR5 N-terminus compared to clade B consensus residues at these positions. These results suggest that expanded coreceptor usage of HIV-1 can occur in some individuals without rapid progression to AIDS as a consequence of changes in the V3 region that reduce dependence on the ECL2 region of CCR5 by enhancing interactions with conserved structural elements in G-protein-coupled receptors.

20090957	20100122	Enhanced binding of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 and Ku80/70 to the ITGA2 promoter via an extended cytosine-adenosine repeat.	We have identified a cytosine-adenosine (CA) repeat length polymorphism in the 5'-regulatory region of the human integrin alpha2 gene ITGA2 that begins at -605. Our objective was to establish the contribution of this polymorphism to the regulation of integrin alpha2beta1 expression, which is known to vary several-fold among normal individuals, and to investigate the underlying mechanism(s). In combination with the SNP C-52T, previously identified by us as a binding site for the transcription factor Sp1, four ITGA2 haplotypes can be distinguished, in the order in which they enhance ITGA2 transcription: (CA)(12)/-52C&gt;(CA)(11)/-52C&gt;(CA)(11)/-52T&gt;(CA)(10)/-52T. By DNA affinity chromatography and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we show that poly (ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and Ku80/70 bind specifically and with enhanced affinity to the longer (CA)(12) repeat alleles. The increased binding of PARP-1 and Ku80/70, known components of transcription co-activator complexes, to the longer (CA)(12) alleles of ITGA2 coincides with enhanced alpha2beta1 expression. The most likely explanation for these findings is that PARP-1 and Ku80/70 contribute to the transcriptional regulation of ITGA2. These observations provide new insight into the mechanisms(s) underlying haplotype-dependent variability in integrin alpha2beta1 expression in human platelets and other cells.

17273967	20070203	Autosomal recessive ichthyosis with hypotrichosis caused by a mutation in ST14, encoding type II transmembrane serine protease matriptase.	In this article, we describe a novel autosomal recessive ichthyosis with hypotrichosis syndrome, characterized by congenital ichthyosis associated with abnormal hair. Using homozygosity mapping, we mapped the disease locus to 11q24.3-q25. We screened the ST14 gene, which encodes matriptase, since transplantation of skin from matriptase(-/-)-knockout mice onto adult athymic nude mice has been shown elsewhere to result in an ichthyosislike phenotype associated with almost complete absence of erupted pelage hairs. Mutation analysis revealed a missense mutation, G827R, in the highly conserved peptidase S1-S6 domain. Marked skin hyperkeratosis due to impaired degradation of the stratum corneum corneodesmosomes was observed in the affected individuals, which suggests that matriptase plays a significant role in epidermal desquamation.

24236072	20131116	Single, double and quadruple alanine substitutions at oligomeric interfaces identify hydrophobicity as the key determinant of human neutrophil alpha defensin HNP1 function.	HNP1 is a human alpha defensin that forms dimers and multimers governed by hydrophobic residues, including Tyr??, Ile??, Leu??, and Phe??. Previously, alanine scanning mutagenesis identified each of these residues and other hydrophobic residues as important for function. Here we report further structural and functional studies of residues shown to interact with one another across oligomeric interfaces: I20A-HNP1 and L25A-HNP1, plus the double alanine mutants I20A/L25A-HNP1 and Y16A/F28A-HNP1, and the quadruple alanine mutant Y16A/I20A/L25A/F28A-HNP1. We tested binding to HIV-1 gp120 and HNP1 by surface plasmon resonance, binding to HIV-1 gp41 and HNP1 by fluorescence polarization, inhibition of anthrax lethal factor, and antibacterial activity using the virtual colony count assay. Similar to the previously described single mutant W26A-HNP1, the quadruple mutant displayed the least activity in all functional assays, followed by the double mutant Y16A/F28A-HNP1. The effects of the L25A and I20A single mutations were milder than the double mutant I20A/L25A-HNP1. Crystallographic studies confirmed the correct folding and disulfide pairing, and depicted an array of dimeric and tetrameric structures. These results indicate that side chain hydrophobicity is the critical factor that determines activity at these positions. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061 D013485 D013486
2540814	19890207	Effect of point mutations in the decoding site (C1400) region of 16S ribosomal RNA on the ability of ribosomes to carry out individual steps of protein synthesis.	In order to probe the relationship between structure and function of the ribosome, an in vitro system [Denman et al. (1988) Biochemistry (preceding paper in this issue)] was used to make a series of base changes around C1400, a residue known to be at the decoding site. Replacement of C1400 by U, A, or G, deletion of single bases at and to either side of C1400, and insertion of C or U next to C1400 were done. In a separate study, a mutant with seven extra nucleotides at the 3' end was constructed. The activity of these 11 mutants in A and P site binding and in initiation-dependent and initiation-independent peptide synthesis was analyzed. None of the base substitutions of C1400 were markedly inhibitory despite the almost complete conservation of this residue in ribosomal RNAs from a wide range of species. The insertions and deletions completely blocked initiation-dependent peptide synthesis but markedly stimulated the initiation-independent reaction. The effects on tRNA binding were variable. The extra stem and loop at the 3' end blocked initiation-dependent peptide synthesis but did not influence the other assays. The only modification to block all ribosomal function was the deletion of G1401. It appears that while the conserved and cross-linkable C1400 is not essential for function, the adjacent conserved G1401 is. 	Biochemistry	D016428
20157068	20100217	Association of IL1A, IL1B, and TNF gene polymorphisms with chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyposis: A replication study.	To replicate and extend recent findings in a Turkish population of associations between chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyposis and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL1A (rs17561 and Ser114Ala), IL1B (rs16944), and TNF (rs361525 and rs1800629) genes. In a case-control replication study, DNA samples were obtained from 206 patients with severe CRS (cases) and from 196 postal code-matched controls. For IL1A and TNF, the 3 reported SNPs were complemented with tagging SNPs using an International HapMap genotyping data set to ensure complete genetic coverage. For IL1B, only the single reported SNP was assessed. A total of 24 SNPs (7 in IL1A, 1 in IL1B, and 16 in TNF) were individually genotyped. The PLINK software package was used to perform genetic association tests. Academic research. Canadian population of individuals with severe CRS. Allelic differences between cases and controls. Significant allelic differences between cases and controls were obtained for IL1A rs17561 (odds ratio [OR], 1.48; P = .02). The following 3 additional SNPs in this gene were associated with CRS: rs2856838 (OR, 0.63; P = .003), rs2048874 (OR, 0.57; P = .01), and rs1800587 (OR, 1.49; P = .02). These 3 SNPs remained significant after correction for multiple testing. No association was found with IL1B or TNF. We replicated the previously reported association between the IL1A polymorphism and severe CRS and identified 3 potential new associations in the same gene. This further supports the potential contribution of IL1A to the development of CRS. We were unable to replicate previous reports of associations with IL1B or TNF. 	Arch._Otolaryngol._Head_Neck_Surg.

22498983	20120414	Antithrombin Krakow II (c.624+1 G &gt; T): a novel mutation leading to type 1 antithrombin deficiency.	Hereditary antithrombin (AT) deficiency is a rare autosomal disease. More than 200 mutations have been described in the AT gene leading to its deficiency. We describe here a case of type I AT deficiency in a 26-year-old Polish man who experienced proximal deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism associated with a transient thrombotic risk factor, the right ankle trauma, despite the use of low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis. The family history was negative for venous thromboembolism. The AT activity was initially 47% and on repeated analysis 53%, and the antigen level, 0.15 g/l. The analysis of AT gene revealed the presence at the heterozygous state of a substitution G more than T located at the first nucleotide 3' of exon 3a (c.624 + 1 G &gt; T, Human Genome Variation Society numbering system). The substitution might be detrimental taking account for its position in a donor splice site. To the best of our knowledge this mutation has not been previously described, so it was named antithrombin Krakow II. 	Blood_Coagul._Fibrinolysis	D002363 D016428 D013485
24711431	20140409	p53 constrains progression to anaplastic thyroid carcinoma in a Braf-mutant mouse model of papillary thyroid cancer.	Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) has among the worst prognoses of any solid malignancy. The low incidence of the disease has in part precluded systematic clinical trials and tissue collection, and there has been little progress in developing effective therapies. v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) and tumor protein p53 (TP53) mutations cooccur in a high proportion of ATCs, particularly those associated with a precursor papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). To develop an adult-onset model of BRAF-mutant ATC, we generated a thyroid-specific CreER transgenic mouse. We used a Cre-regulated Braf(V600E) mouse and a conditional Trp53 allelic series to demonstrate that p53 constrains progression from PTC to ATC. Gene expression and immunohistochemical analyses of murine tumors identified the cardinal features of human ATC including loss of differentiation, local invasion, distant metastasis, and rapid lethality. We used small-animal ultrasound imaging to monitor autochthonous tumors and showed that treatment with the selective BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 improved survival but did not lead to tumor regression or suppress signaling through the MAPK pathway. The combination of PLX4720 and the mapk/Erk kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD0325901 more completely suppressed MAPK pathway activation in mouse and human ATC cell lines and improved the structural response and survival of ATC-bearing animals. This model expands the limited repertoire of autochthonous models of clinically aggressive thyroid cancer, and these data suggest that small-molecule MAPK pathway inhibitors hold clinical promise in the treatment of advanced thyroid carcinoma.

24859502	20140527	Hereditary 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-resistant rickets with alopecia in four Egyptian families: report of three novel mutations in the vitamin D receptor gene.	To study the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene in five Egyptian patients with severe rickets and the clinical features of hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets, including hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, total alopecia, and elevated serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. We amplified and sequenced DNA samples from blood from the patients, their parents, and available family members. DNA sequence analyses of the VDR gene showed three novel mutations (p.Y295X, p.R343C, and p.R391H) and a previously reported one (p.R30X) in four patients, whereas no mutation was found in one patient. Mutations cosegregated perfectly with affected individuals in all families, and did not exist in unaffected family members or 200 ethnically matched chromosomes. Three novel deleterious mutations in the VDR ligand-binding domain were identified, which are expected to render the VDR nonfunctional. Successful treatment with frequent high doses of oral calcium and calcidol was evident in all patients; however, hair growth occurred only in one patient. 	J._Pediatr._Endocrinol._Metab.

10869547	20000628	The active-site residue Cys-29 is responsible for the neutral-pH inactivation and the refolding barrier of human cathepsin B.	Human cathepsin B, the most abundant lysosomal cysteine protease, has been implicated in a variety of important physiological and pathological processes. It has been known for a long time that like other lysosomal cysteine proteases, cathepsin B becomes inactivated and undergoes irreversible denaturation at neutral or alkaline pH. However, the mechanism of this denaturation process remains mostly unknown up to this day. In the present work, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to characterize the molecular origin of the neutral-pH inactivation and the refolding barrier of human cathepsin B. Two forms of human cathepsin B, the native form with Cys-29 at the active site and a mutant with Cys-29 replaced by Ala, were shown to have well-folded structures at the active and slightly acidic condition of pH 5. Surprisingly, while the native cathepsin B irreversibly unfolds at pH 7.5, the C29A mutant was found to maintain a stable three-dimensional structure at neutral pH conditions. In addition, replacement of Cys-29 by Ala renders the process of the urea denaturation of human cathepsin B completely reversible, in contrast to the opposite behavior of the wild-type cathepsin B. These results are very surprising in that replacement of one single residue, the active-site Cys-29, can eliminate the neutral-pH denaturation and the refolding barrier. We speculate that this finding may have important implications in understanding the process of pH-triggered inactivation commonly observed for most lysosomal cysteine proteases. 	FEBS_Lett.

23302520	20130111	Contribution of the PALB2 c.2323C&gt;T [p.Q775X] founder mutation in well-defined breast and/or ovarian cancer families and unselected ovarian cancer cases of French Canadian descent.	The PALB2 c.2323C&gt;T [p.Q775X] mutation has been reported in at least three breast cancer families and breast cancer cases of French Canadian descent and this has been attributed to common ancestors. The number of mutation-positive cases reported varied based on criteria of ascertainment of index cases tested. Although inherited PALB2 mutations are associated with increased risks of developing breast cancer, risk to ovarian cancer has not been fully explored in this demographically unique population. We screened the PALB2 p.Q775X variant in 71 families with at least three cases of breast cancer (n=48) or breast and ovarian cancers (n=23) that have previously been found negative for at least the most common BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations reported in the French Canadian population and in 491 women of French Canadian descent who had invasive ovarian cancer and/or low malignant potential tumors of the major histopathological subtypes. We identified a PALB2 p.Q775X carrier in a breast cancer family, who had invasive ductal breast carcinomas at 39 and 42 years of age. We also identified a PALB2 p.Q775X carrier who had papillary serous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma at age 58 among the 238 serous subtype ovarian cancer cases investigated, who also had breast cancer at age 52. Our findings, taken together with previous reports, support adding PALB2 c.2323C&gt;T p.Q775X to the list of cancer susceptibility genes for which founder mutations have been identified in the French Canadian population.

21413052	20110318	Electrostatic modifications of the human leukocyte antigen-DR P9 peptide-binding pocket and susceptibility to primary sclerosing cholangitis.	The strongest genetic risk factors for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are found in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex at chromosome 6p21. Genes in the HLA class II region encode molecules that present antigen to T lymphocytes. Polymorphisms in these genes are associated with most autoimmune diseases, most likely because they contribute to the specificity of immune responses. The aim of this study was to analyze the structure and electrostatic properties of the peptide-binding groove of HLA-DR in relation to PSC. Thus, four-digit resolution HLA-DRB1 genotyping was performed in 356 PSC patients and 366 healthy controls. Sequence information was used to assign which amino acids were encoded at all polymorphic positions. In stepwise logistic regressions, variations at residues 37 and 86 were independently associated with PSC (P = 1.2 ? 10(-32) and P = 1.8 ? 10(-22) in single-residue models, respectively). Three-dimensional modeling was performed to explore the effect of these key residues on the HLA-DR molecule. This analysis indicated that residue 37 was a major determinant of the electrostatic properties of pocket P9 of the peptide-binding groove. Asparagine at residue 37, which was associated with PSC, induced a positive charge in pocket P9. Tyrosine, which protected against PSC, induced a negative charge in this pocket. Consistent with the statistical observations, variation at residue 86 also indirectly influenced the electrostatic properties of this pocket. DRB1*13:01, which was PSC-associated, had a positive P9 pocket and DRB1*13:02, protective against PSC, had a negative P9 pocket. The results suggest that in patients with PSC, residues 37 and 86 of the HLA-DR? chain critically influence the electrostatic properties of pocket P9 and thereby the range of peptides presented.

8422377	19930119	Characterization of an intermediate in the folding pathway of phosphoglycerate kinase: chemical reactivity of genetically introduced cysteinyl residues during the folding process.	The unfolding-refolding kinetics of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase were studied using the chemical reactivity of genetically introduced cysteinyl residues as conformational probes and far-ultraviolet circular dichroism. A unique internal cysteinyl residue was introduced in several mutants at selected positions in the N- and C-domains. The cysteinyl residues were at positions 97 (the unique cysteinyl residue of the wild-type enzyme), 183 in the N-domain, 285 and 324 in the C-domain. A similar strategy has been used to study the unfolding-refolding transition under equilibrium conditions [Ballery et al. (1990) Protein Eng. 3, 199-204]. Except for the mutant C97A,A183C, whose cysteinyl residue is located at the domain interface, three labeling phases were observed during the refolding process, indicating the presence of three species, the unfolded, intermediate, and folded proteins. The comparison of the data obtained following the accessibility of the thiol group to 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) and ellipticity at 218 nm indicated that all mutants have the same folding pathway and allowed us to characterize the intermediate. In this species, each domain appeared to have a high content of secondary structure but a flexible tertiary structure; this intermediate, which had the characteristics of a molten globule, remained in fluctuating equilibrium with a widely unfolded form. The same folding intermediate was detected for mutant C97A,A183C; however, the cysteinyl residue being totally accessible to the reagent, it is likely that in this intermediate the interdomain interactions are not established. Domain pairing and formation of the native tertiary structure occur simultaneously in the slow phase of refolding. The validity and limitations of the methodology are discussed.

12565892	20030205	Functional characterization of two variant human GSTO 1-1s (Ala140Asp and Thr217Asn).	Glutathione-S-transferase class Omega (GSTO 1-1) belongs to a new subfamily of GSTs, which is identical with human monomethylarsonic acid (MMA(V)) reductase, the rate limiting enzyme for biotransformation of inorganic arsenic, environmental carcinogen. Recombinant GSTO 1-1 variants (Ala140Asp and Thr217Asn) were functionally characterized using representative substrates. No significant difference was observed in GST activity towards 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, whereas thioltransferase activity was decreased to 75% (Ala140Asp) and 40% (Thr217Asn) of the wild-type GSTO 1-1. For MMA(V) reductase activity, the Ala140Asp variant exhibited similar kinetics to wild type, while the Thr217Asn variant had lower V(max) (56%) and K(m) (64%) values than the wild-type enzyme. The different activities of the enzyme variants may influence both the intracellular thiol status and arsenic biotransformation. This can help explain the variation between individuals in their susceptibility to oxidative stress and inorganic arsenic. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.	D016428 D013485
20333879	20100326	Hypoketotic hypoglycemia with myolysis and hypoparathyroidism: an unusual association in medium chain acyl-CoA desydrogenase deficiency (MCADD).	Medium-chain acyl-CoA deshydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is the most frequent disorder of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (MFAO). We report a 3 year-old girl with enterovirus viremia who was referred after 36 hours of fasting with hypoketotic hypoglycemic coma and myolysis. Evolution was complicated by acute renal failure, increased serum levels of transaminases and hypoparathyroidism. Diagnosis of MCADD was supported by typical plasma acylcarnitine and urinary organic acid profiles, and confirmed by homozygosity for the common missense A985G mutation. Whereas myolysis is frequent in MFAO defects, it is rarely reported as a major accompanying sign in MCADD. Hypoparathyroidism has been previously reported in some MFAO deficiencies but has never been mentioned in association with MCADD. We review the possible mechanisms of hypoparathyroidism in MFAO deficiencies. Parathyroid glands and pancreas dysfunction should be screened in MFAO defects as these organs could be implicated in the clinical spectrum of the frequent A985G MCADD disease-causing mutation.

26880991	20160217	The Rise of CRISPR/Cas for Genome Editing in Stem Cells.	Genetic manipulation is a powerful tool to establish the causal relationship between a genetic lesion and a particular pathological phenotype. The rise of CRISPR/Cas9 genome-engineering tools overcame the traditional technical bottleneck for routine site-specific genetic manipulation in cells. To create the perfect in vitro cell model, there is significant interest from the stem cell research community to adopt this fast evolving technology. This review addresses this need directly by providing both the up-to-date biochemical rationale of CRISPR-mediated genome engineering and detailed practical guidelines for the design and execution of CRISPR experiments in cell models. Ultimately, this review will serve as a timely and comprehensive guide for this fast developing technology. 	Stem_Cells_Int	D016428 D016454
23146938	20121114	The gating mechanism of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL revealed by molecular dynamics simulations: from tension sensing to channel opening.	One of the ultimate goals of the study on mechanosensitive (MS) channels is to understand the biophysical mechanisms of how the MS channel protein senses forces and how the sensed force induces channel gating. The bacterial MS channel MscL is an ideal subject to reach this goal owing to its resolved 3D protein structure in the closed state on the atomic scale and large amounts of electrophysiological data on its gating kinetics. However, the structural basis of the dynamic process from the closed to open states in MscL is not fully understood. In this study, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the initial process of MscL opening in response to a tension increase in the lipid bilayer. To identify the tension-sensing site(s) in the channel protein, we calculated interaction energy between membrane lipids and candidate amino acids (AAs) facing the lipids. We found that Phe78 has a conspicuous interaction with the lipids, suggesting that Phe78 is the primary tension sensor of MscL. Increased membrane tension by membrane stretch dragged radially the inner (TM1) and outer (TM2) helices of MscL at Phe78, and the force was transmitted to the pentagon-shaped gate that is formed by the crossing of the neighboring TM1 helices in the inner leaflet of the bilayer. The radial dragging force induced radial sliding of the crossing portions, leading to a gate expansion. Calculated energy for this expansion is comparable to an experimentally estimated energy difference between the closed and the first subconductance state, suggesting that our model simulates the initial step toward the full opening of MscL. The model also successfully mimicked the behaviors of a gain of function mutant (G22N) and a loss of function mutant (F78N), strongly supporting that our MD model did simulate some essential biophysical aspects of the mechano-gating in MscL.

21483811	20110413	The SUMO isopeptidase Ulp2p is required to prevent recombination-induced chromosome segregation lethality following DNA replication stress.	SUMO conjugation is a key regulator of the cellular response to DNA replication stress, acting in part to control recombination at stalled DNA replication forks. Here we examine recombination-related phenotypes in yeast mutants defective for the SUMO de-conjugating/chain-editing enzyme Ulp2p. We find that spontaneous recombination is elevated in ulp2 strains and that recombination DNA repair is essential for ulp2 survival. In contrast to other SUMO pathway mutants, however, the frequency of spontaneous chromosome rearrangements is markedly reduced in ulp2 strains, and some types of rearrangements arising through recombination can apparently not be tolerated. In investigating the basis for this, we find DNA repair foci do not disassemble in ulp2 cells during recovery from the replication fork-blocking drug methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), corresponding with an accumulation of X-shaped recombination intermediates. ulp2 cells satisfy the DNA damage checkpoint during MMS recovery and commit to chromosome segregation with similar kinetics to wild-type cells. However, sister chromatids fail to disjoin, resulting in abortive chromosome segregation and cell lethality. This chromosome segregation defect can be rescued by overproducing the anti-recombinase Srs2p, indicating that recombination plays an underlying causal role in blocking chromatid separation. Overall, our results are consistent with a role for Ulp2p in preventing the formation of DNA lesions that must be repaired through recombination. At the same time, Ulp2p is also required to either suppress or resolve recombination-induced attachments between sister chromatids. These opposing defects may synergize to greatly increase the toxicity of DNA replication stress. 	PLoS_Genet.	D016428 D052061
19004828	20081114	Direct interaction of otoferlin with syntaxin 1A, SNAP-25, and the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel Cav1.3.	The molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic exocytosis in the hair cell, the auditory and vestibular receptor cell, are not well understood. Otoferlin, a C2 domain-containing Ca2+-binding protein, has been implicated as having a role in vesicular release. Mutations in the OTOF gene cause nonsyndromic deafness in humans, and OTOF knock-out mice are deaf. In the present study, we generated otoferlin fusion proteins containing two of the same amino acid substitutions detected in DFNB9 patients (P1825A in C2F and L1011P in C2D). The native otoferlin C2F domain bound syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 in a Ca2+-dependent manner (with optimal 61 microm free Ca2+ required for binding). These interactions were greatly diminished for C2F with the P1825A mutation, possibly because of a reduction in tertiary structural change, induced by Ca2+, for the mutated C2F compared with the native C2F. The otoferlin C2D domain also bound syntaxin 1A, but with weaker affinity (Kd = 1.7 x 10(-5) m) than for the C2F interaction (Kd = 2.6 x 10(-9) m). In contrast, it was the otoferlin C2D domain that bound the Cav1.3 II-III loop, in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The L1011P mutation in C2D rendered this binding insensitive to Ca2+ and considerably diminished. Overall, we demonstrated that otoferlin interacts with two main target-SNARE proteins of the hair-cell synaptic complex, syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25, as well as the calcium channel, with the otoferlin C2F and C2D domains of central importance for binding. Because mutations in the otoferlin C2 domains that cause deafness in humans impair the ability of otoferlin to bind syntaxin, SNAP-25, and the Cav1.3 calcium channel, it is these interactions that may mediate regulation by otoferlin of hair cell synaptic exocytosis critical to inner ear hair cell function.

25269805	20141002	Impact of G-quadruplex structures and intronic polymorphisms rs17878362 and rs1642785 on basal and ionizing radiation-induced expression of alternative p53 transcripts.	G-quadruplex (G4) structures in intron 3 of the p53 pre-mRNA modulate intron 2 splicing, altering the balance between the fully spliced p53 transcript (FSp53, encoding full-length p53) and an incompletely spliced transcript retaining intron 2 (p53I2 encoding the N-terminally truncated ?40p53 isoform). The nucleotides forming G4s overlap the polymorphism rs17878362 (A1 wild-type allele, A2 16-base pair insertion) which is in linkage disequilibrium with rs1642785 in intron 2 (c.74+38 G&gt;C). Biophysical and biochemical analyses show rs17878362 A2 alleles form similar G4 structures as A1 alleles although their position is shifted with respect to the intron 2 splice acceptor site. In addition basal FSp53 and p53I2 levels showed allele specific differences in both p53-null cells transfected with reporter constructs or lymphoblastoid cell lines. The highest FSp53 and p53I2 levels were associated with combined rs1642785-GG/rs17878362-A1A1 alleles, whereas the presence of rs1642785-C with either rs17878362 allele was associated with lower p53 pre-mRNA, total TP53, FSp53 and p53I2 levels, due to the lower stability of transcripts containing rs1642785-C. Treatment of lymphoblastoid cell with the G4 binding ligands 360A or PhenDC3 or with ionizing radiation increased FSp53 levels only in cells with rs17878362 A1 alleles, suggesting that under this G4 configuration full splicing is favoured. These results demonstrate the complex effects of intronic TP53 polymorphisms on G4 formation and identify a new role for rs1642785 on mRNA splicing and stability, and thus on the differential expression of isoform-specific transcripts of the TP53 gene.

12692209	20030415	Generation of novel syncytium-inducing and host range variants of ecotropic moloney murine leukemia virus in Mus spicilegus.	Mus spicilegus is an Eastern European wild mouse species that has previously been reported to harbor an unusual infectious ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV) and proviral envelope genes of a novel MLV subgroup. In the present study, M. spicilegus neonates were inoculated with Moloney ecotropic MLV (MoMLV). All 17 inoculated mice produced infectious ecotropic virus after 8 to 14 weeks, and two unusual phenotypes distinguished the isolates from MoMLV. First, most of the M. spicilegus isolates grew to equal titers on M. dunni and SC-1 cells, although MoMLV does not efficiently infect M. dunni cells. The deduced amino acid sequence of a representative clone differed from MoMLV by insertion of two serine residues within the VRA of SUenv. Modification of a molecular clone of MoMLV by the addition of these serines produced a virus that grows to high titer in M. dunni cells, establishing a role for these two serine residues in host range. A second unusual phenotype was found in only one of the M. spicilegus isolates, Spl574. Spl574 produces large syncytia of multinucleated giant cells in M. dunni cells, but its replication is restricted in other mouse cell lines. Sequencing and mutagenesis demonstrated that syncytium formation could be attributed to a single amino acid substitution within VRA, S82F. Thus, viruses with altered growth properties are selected during growth in M. spicilegus. The mutations associated with the host range and syncytium-inducing variants map to a key region of VRA known to govern interactions with the cell surface receptor, suggesting that the associated phenotypes may result from altered interactions with the unusual ecotropic virus mCAT1 receptor carried by M. dunni.

23815005	20130703	[A case of transient postoperative median nerve palsy due to the use of the wrist holder to stabilize an intra-arterial catheter].	We experienced a case of right median nerve palsy at the distal forearm following abdominal surgery. We postulate that the cause of the median nerve palsy is overextension of the wrist by the inappropriate fixation with a holder. The patient was a 46-year-old man with habit of smoking receiving low-anterior resection of the rectum under general and epidural anesthesia in lithotomy position. During surgery his upper limbs were placed on padded arm board abducted about 80 degrees and affixed with soft cotton. His forearms were slightly supinated, whereas his elbows were not over-extended. A 22 G cannula was inserted in the right radial artery and the right wrist was fixed with plastic-holder with soft pad. This position was maintained throughout the operation approximetly for 250 minutes. During anesthesia any special events regarding hemodynamic variables were not observed. He complained of numbness in the palmar side of the digits 1-3 on his right hand without motor disturbance 4 hours after the operation. Examination by the anesthesiologist revealed median nerve palsy. Fortunately, this symptom gradually but completely resolved over the next few days. The possible causes of this neuropathy include the overextension of the wrist or the unexpected extension of the elbow beyond the acceptable range by the supination of forearm, which was induced by the attachment used to stabilize an intra-arterial catheter. Therefore, in the current case we should have returned the wrists promptly to the neutral position following arterial catheter placement to prevent the median nerve palsy. This case suggests the importance of holding the proper position of the arm during surgery. 	Masui	D002363 D004740 D016428
18638397	20080722	Impaired nuclear import and viral incorporation of Vpr derived from a HIV long-term non-progressor.	We previously reported an epidemiologically linked HIV-1 infected patient cohort in which a long-term non-progressor (LTNP) infected two recipients who then exhibited normal disease progression. Expression of patient-derived vpr sequences from each of the three cohort members in mammalian cells tagged with GFP revealed a significant reduction in Vpr nuclear import and virion incorporation uniquely from the LTNP, whereas Vpr from the two progressing recipients displayed normal localisation and virion incorporation, implying a link between efficient Vpr nuclear import and HIV disease progression. Importantly, an F72L point mutation in the LTNP was identified for the first time as being uniquely responsible for decreased Vpr nuclear import. 	Retrovirology	D003160 D016428 D013485
11940571	20020410	The role of zinc ions in reverse transport mediated by monoamine transporters.	The human dopamine transporter (hDAT) contains an endogenous high affinity Zn2+ binding site with three coordinating residues on its extracellular face (His193, His375, and Glu396). Upon binding to this site, Zn2+ causes inhibition of [3H]1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ([3H]MPP+) uptake. We investigated the effect of Zn2+ on outward transport by superfusing hDAT-expressing HEK-293 cells preloaded with [3H]MPP+. Although Zn2+ inhibited uptake, Zn2+ facilitated [3H]MPP+ release induced by amphetamine, MPP+, or K+-induced depolarization specifically at hDAT but not at the human serotonin and the norepinephrine transporter (hNET). Mutation of the Zn2+ coordinating residue His(193) to Lys (the corresponding residue in hNET) eliminated the effect of Zn2+ on efflux. Conversely, the reciprocal mutation (K189H) conferred Zn2+ sensitivity to hNET. The intracellular [3H]MPP+ concentration was varied to generate saturation isotherms; these showed that Zn2+ increased V(max) for efflux (rather than K(M-Efflux-intracellular)). Thus, blockage of inward transport by Zn2+ is not due to a simple inhibition of the transporter turnover rate. The observations provide evidence against the model of facilitated exchange-diffusion and support the concept that inward and outward transport represent discrete operational modes of the transporter. In addition, they indicate a physiological role of Zn2+, because Zn2+ also facilitated transport reversal of DAT in rat striatal slices. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485 D013487
10791968	20000503	Epsin 1 undergoes nucleocytosolic shuttling and its eps15 interactor NH(2)-terminal homology (ENTH) domain, structurally similar to Armadillo and HEAT repeats, interacts with the transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia Zn(2)+ finger protein (PLZF).	Epsin (Eps15 interactor) is a cytosolic protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis via its direct interactions with clathrin, the clathrin adaptor AP-2, and Eps15. The NH(2)-terminal portion of epsin contains a phylogenetically conserved module of unknown function, known as the ENTH domain (epsin NH(2)-terminal homology domain). We have now solved the crystal structure of rat epsin 1 ENTH domain to 1.8 A resolution. This domain is structurally similar to armadillo and Heat repeats of beta-catenin and karyopherin-beta, respectively. We have also identified and characterized the interaction of epsin 1, via the ENTH domain, with the transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia Zn(2)+ finger protein (PLZF). Leptomycin B, an antifungal antibiotic, which inhibits the Crm1- dependent nuclear export pathway, induces an accumulation of epsin 1 in the nucleus. These findings suggest that epsin 1 may function in a signaling pathway connecting the endocytic machinery to the regulation of nuclear function. 	J._Cell_Biol.	D016428 D013485 D013487
15715950	20050218	Association analysis of monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP3) polymorphisms with asthmatic phenotypes.	The monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP3), on chromosome 17q11.2-q12, is a secreted chemokine, which attracts macrophages during inflammation and metastasis. In an effort to discover additional polymorphism(s) in genes whose variant(s) have been implicated in asthma, we scrutinized the genetic polymorphisms in MCP3 to evaluate it as a potential candidate gene for asthma host genetic study. By direct DNA sequencing in twenty-four individuals, we identified four sequence variants within the 3 kb full genome including 1,000bp promoter region of MCP3; one in promoter region (-420T&gt;C), three in intron (+136C&gt;G, +563C&gt;T, +984G&gt;A) respectively. The frequencies of those four SNPs were 0.020 (-420T&gt;C), 0.038 (+136C&gt;G), 0.080 (+563C&gt;T), 0.035 (+984G&gt;A), respectively, in Korean population (n = 598). Haplotypes, their frequencies and linkage disequilibrium coefficients (|D'|) between SNP pairs were estimated. The associations with the risk of asthma, skin-test reactivity and total serum IgE levels were analyzed. Using statistical analyses for association of MCP3 polymorphisms with asthma development and asthma-related phenotypes, no significant signals were detected. In conclusion, we identified four genetic polymorphisms in the important MCP3 gene, but no significant associations of MCP3 variants with asthma phenotypes were detected. MCP3 variation/haplotype information identified in this study will provide valuable information for future association studies of other allergic diseases. 	J._Biochem._Mol._Biol.

15710598	20050216	Haplotypes of G protein-coupled receptor 154 are associated with childhood allergy and asthma.	Allergic diseases are influenced by both genes and environment. A 70-kb haplotype block in the G protein-coupled receptor for asthma susceptibility gene (GPR154; alias GPRA) on chromosome 7p was recently identified to influence susceptibility to asthma and elevated total serum IgE levels in adults. To assess the impact of GPR154 on childhood allergic disease, including allergic sensitization, asthma, and rhinoconjunctivitis, in study populations with diverse environmental backgrounds. We studied farm children, Steiner school children, and two reference groups from five Western European countries in the cross-sectional PARSIFAL (Prevention of Allergy Risk factors for Sensitization In children related to Farming and Anthroposophic Lifestyle) study and a sample of children from the Swedish birth cohort study BAMSE. DNA samples from 3,113 PARSIFAL and 800 BAMSE children were genotyped for 7 GPR154 polymorphisms and haplotypes were inferred. The proportions of alleles and haplotypes (H1-H7) were compared in affected children with their healthy counterparts. Data indicate a global association of the haplotype block to sensitization (allergen-specific serum IgE &gt; or = 0.35 kU/L, p = 0.022), with significant haplotype-specific associations for H1, H5, and H6. Haplotypes H1 and H5 were also significantly associated with childhood allergic asthma (p = 0.045 and p = 0.023, respectively), and H5 to asthma regardless of sensitization. A broader involvement of GPR154 in allergic diseases was further supported in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (H3: p = 0.046). The associated haplotypes could be allocated into risk (H5/H6) and nonrisk (H1/H3) groups, a pattern supported by allelic association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs324384 and rs324396. Our results indicate that polymorphisms and haplotypes in the haplotype block of GPR154 are associated with asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, and sensitization in European children.

21408173	20110317	Optineurin is required for CYLD-dependent inhibition of TNF?-induced NF-?B activation.	The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B) regulates genes that function in diverse cellular processes like inflammation, immunity and cell survival. The activation of NF-?B is tightly controlled and the deubiquitinase CYLD has emerged as a key negative regulator of NF-?B signalling. Optineurin, mutated in certain glaucomas and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is also a negative regulator of NF-?B activation. It competes with NEMO (NF-?B essential modulator) for binding to ubiquitinated RIP (receptor interacting protein) to prevent NF-?B activation. Recently we identified CYLD as optineurin-interacting protein. Here we have analysed the functional significance of interaction of optineurin with CYLD. Our results show that a glaucoma-associated mutant of optineurin, H486R, is altered in its interaction with CYLD. Unlike wild-type optineurin, the H486R mutant did not inhibit tumour necrosis factor ? (TNF?)-induced NF-?B activation. CYLD mediated inhibition of TNF?-induced NF-?B activation was abrogated by expression of the H486R mutant. Upon knockdown of optineurin, CYLD was unable to inhibit TNF?-induced NF-?B activation and showed drastically reduced interaction with ubiquitinated RIP. The level of ubiquitinated RIP was increased in optineurin knockdown cells. Deubiquitination of RIP by over-expressed CYLD was abrogated in optineurin knockdown cells. These results suggest that optineurin regulates NF-?B activation by mediating interaction of CYLD with ubiquitinated RIP thus facilitating deubiquitination of RIP. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
20729722	20100824	+1040 C/T polymorphism in coding region of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor gene and the risk of idiopathic recurrent fetal loss.	Recurrent fetal loss (RFL) is common health problem affecting up to 5% of women of reproductive age. It has been shown that plasma thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) concentrations increase during pregnancy and return to baseline levels soon after delivery. The +1040C/T single nucleotide polymorphism in coding region of TAFI gene is associated with TAFI blood levels. The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between +1040C/T polymorphism in TAFI gene and idiopathic RFL. Study was carried out in a group of 120 women (61 controls and 59 women with idiopathic RFL). The +1040C/T polymorphism was detected by restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR. Increased frequency of +1040T/T genotype was observed in a study group, but without statistically significant difference. Carriers of T/T genotype have increased risk of fetal loss by 1.23-fold, compared with carriers of C/C (95% CI 0.462-3.277; P = 0.7) and 1.34-fold compared with carriers of C/T genotype (95% CI 0.501-3.601; P = 0.6). C allele is associated with reduced risk of recurrent fetal loss compared with T allele (OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.545-1.533; P = 0.7). In conclusion, we observed increased frequency of +1040T/T genotype in a patient group, suggesting that this genotype could be potential risk factor for idiopathic RFL. Further investigation should be carried out in order to establish the role of this polymorphism in the etiology of idiopathic recurrent miscarriages. 	Blood_Coagul._Fibrinolysis	D016428 D013485
10481044	19990911	Light-induced cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme in indole alkaloid biosynthesis: tabersonine 16-hydroxylase.	Vinblastine and vincristine are two medically important bisindole alkaloids from Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar periwinkle). Attempts at production in cell cultures failed because a part of the complex pathway was not active, i.e. from tabersonine to vindoline. It starts with tabersonine 16-hydroxylase (T16H), a cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme. We now show that T16H is induced in the suspension culture by light and we report the cloning of the cDNA. The enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli as translational fusion with the P450 reductase from C. roseus, and the reaction product was identified by mass spectrometry. The protein (CYP71D12) shares 47-52% identity with other members of the CYP71D subfamily with unknown function. The induction by light was strongly enhanced by a nutritional downshift (transfer into 8% aqueous sucrose). We discuss the possibility that the entire pathway to bisindoles can be expressed in suspension cultures. 	FEBS_Lett.	D016428 D013485
21991336	20111013	Macropinocytosis of extracellular glutathione ameliorates tumor necrosis factor ? release in activated macrophages.	A number of inflammatory lung diseases have abnormally low glutathione (GSH) levels in the airway fluids. Lung macrophages are common mediators of inflammation, make up the majority of cells that are found in the airway epithelial lining fluid (ELF), and are commonly elevated in many lung diseases. Several animal models with altered ELF GSH levels are associated with similar alterations in the intracellular GSH levels of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells. The possible mechanisms and outcomes for this association between ELF GSH levels and intracellular BAL cell GSH are unknown. To investigate these issues, macrophages were grown in media supplemented with 500 ?M GSH. GSH supplementation resulted in a 2-3 fold increase in macrophage intracellular GSH levels. The increase in macrophage intracellular GSH levels was associated with a significant reduction in NF-?B nuclear translocation and tumor necrosis factor ? (TNF?) release upon LPS stimulation. Furthermore, co-treatment of macrophages with GSH and inhibitors of GSH breakdown or synthesis did not block GSH accumulation. In contrast, treatment with cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin dependent endocytosis, and amiloride, an inhibitor of macropinocytosis blocked, at least in part, GSH uptake. Furthermore, using two cigarette smoke exposure paradigms that result in two different GSH levels in the ELF and thus in the BAL cells resulted in modulation of cytokine release when stimulated with LPS ex vivo. These data suggest that macrophages are able to utilize extracellular GSH which can then modulate inflammatory signaling in response to proinflammatory stimuli. This data also suggests the lung can modulate inflammatory responses triggered by proinflammatory stimuli by altering ELF GSH levels and may help explain the dysregulated inflammation associated with lung diseases that have low ELF GSH levels.

23303830	20130111	Correlation between nucleotide mutation and viral loads of human bocavirus 1 in hospitalized children with respiratory tract infection.	The human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) parvovirus causes respiratory disease and primarily affects children. Despite its worldwide prevalence, the mechanisms of HBoV1 replication and pathogenesis remain largely undefined. In this study of 846 children hospitalized at the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University in China for respiratory tract infection between June 2009 and May 2011, HBoV1 was detected in 112 (13.2%) by real-time quantitative PCR. The median age of HBoV1-positive patients was 10 months old. Forty-five (40.2%) of the HBoV1 cases were monoinfections, and 67 (59.8%) were viral co-infections. Genotyping of all 112 HBoV1-positive cases yielded 27 full HBoV1 sequences, as well as two NS1 gene sequences, 15 NP1 gene sequences and 10 VP1/VP2 gene sequences harbouring 24, 10 and 43 mutations, respectively. Statistical analysis revealed no relationship between genetic mutations and clinical manifestations of HBoV1-positive patients. However, the viral loads were significantly lower in samples with mutations G236A or A447G in NP1, or G1461A in VP1/VP2, than in samples with wild-type HBoV1. Future studies should investigate whether these mutations in the HBoV1 gene may represent useful markers of disease pathogenesis. 	J._Gen._Virol.	D016428 D013485
16102917	20050817	A functional SNP in the promoter region of TCOF1 is associated with reduced gene expression and YY1 DNA-protein interaction.	Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is an autosomal dominant craniofacial malformation caused by null mutations in the TCOF1 gene. High inter and intra familial clinical variability, ranging from mild malar hypoplasia to perinatal death due to airway collapse is observed, but, to date, no genotype-phenotype correlation has been reported. Considering haploinsufficiency as the molecular mechanism underlying the disease, we have hypothesized that mutations in the promoter region of the gene, which has never been previously characterized, in trans with a pathogenic mutation, could modulate the phenotype. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to determine the TCOF1 gene's core promoter and to identify mutations in this region that could contribute to the phenotypic variation observed in this syndrome. We have delimitated the minimal promoter to a region of less than 150 bp, with 63% of identity among 5 different species. We screened 1.2 kbp of the TCOF1 5' flanking sequence in the DNA obtained from 21 patients and 51 controls and identified four new single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), one of which (-346C&gt;T), was proved to be functional, as it decreased the promoter activity by 38%. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis demonstrated that the -346T allele impairs DNA-binding to the YY1 transcription factor. This promoter variant represents a candidate allele to explain the clinical variability in patients bearing TCS. 	Gene	D003160 D016428 D013485
24965597	20140627	Pain, not chronic disease, is associated with the recurrence of depressive and anxiety disorders.	Studies suggest that poor physical health might be associated with increased depression and anxiety recurrence. The objectives of this study were to determine whether specific chronic diseases and pain characteristics are associated with depression and anxiety recurrence and to examine whether such associations are mediated by subthreshold depressive or anxiety symptoms. 1122 individuals with remitted depressive or anxiety disorder (Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety) were followed up for a period of four years. The impact of specific chronic diseases and pain characteristics on recurrence was assessed using Cox regression and mediation analyses. Chronic diseases were not associated with recurrence. Neck (HR 1.45, p &lt; .01), chest (HR 1.65, p &lt;?.01), abdominal (HR 1.52, p &lt;?.01) pain, an increase in the number of pain locations (HR 1.10, p &lt;?.01) and pain severity (HR 1.18, p =?.01) were associated with an increased risk of depression recurrence but not anxiety. Subthreshold depressive symptoms mediated the associations between pain and depression recurrence. Pain, not chronic disease, increases the likelihood of depression recurrence, largely through its association with aggravated subthreshold depressive symptoms. These findings support the idea of the existence of a mutually reinforcing mechanism between pain and depression and are indicative of the importance of shedding light on neurobiological links in order to optimize pain and depression management.

26541316	20151107	New broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies against hepatitis B virus surface antigen.	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) is considered to be the most important target for the diagnosis and immune prophylaxis of HBV infection. HBsAg-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are extensively used for studying the complex structure of the HBsAg, mapping the neutralizing epitopes and development of HBV diagnostic tests. However, the efficiency of anti-HBV binding strongly depends on the epitope structure and MAb capability to recognize different HBV variants. In the current study, 9 MAbs against yeast-expressed HBsAg of ayw2 serotype were generated and 7 of them were shown to recognize a linear epitope comprising amino acid (aa) residues 119-GPCRTCT-125 within the main antigenic &quot;a&quot; determinant of HBsAg. One MAb of the highest affinity (clone HB1) was selected for detailed cross-reactivity studies, generation of recombinant single-chain antibody (scFv) and molecular modelling of antibody-epitope interaction. The importance of each aa residue within the identified MAb epitope was determined by alanine substitution study that revealed aa residues C(121), T(123), C(124) and T(125) as essential for binding. These aa residues are highly conserved among HBV variants. In contrast, alanine substitution of G119, P120 and R122 had no or minor influence on the reactivity with the MAb. Certain aa residues at position 122 (either R or K) define different HBV serotypes (either d or y), therefore, the affinity of the MAb HB1 for the epitope with R122K substitution was determined to evaluate its diagnostic potential. The MAb recognized both epitope variants with high affinity. Sequence alignment of the MAb epitope within different HBV strains demonstrated that the shortest peptide recognized by the MAb 121-CR(K)TCT-125 is identical among different human HBV genotypes (HBV A-F, H) and monkey HBV species (HBVCP, HBVGO, HBVGB, WMHBV). In line with these data, the MAb HB1 was cross-reactive in Western blot with a large panel of antigens derived from different HBV genotypes. Recombinant scFv consisting of immunoglobulin VH and VL regions joined by a 20 aa-long linker was generated by cloning the respective cDNA sequences from hybridoma HB1. The recombinant scFv generated in Escherichia coli recognized the same epitope as the parental MAb HB1. Cloning of HB1 VH and VL regions allowed determination of their primary structure and subsequent computer modeling of antibody-epitope interaction. The generated molecular models of HB1 variable region with its target peptides were in accordance with experimental data showing the importance of certain aa residues in antibody binding. In conclusion, the current study describes new HBsAg-specific antibodies with HBV-neutralizing potency and a broad cross-reactivity against different HBV strains. The generated MAb HB1 will be of great value in diagnostic and research settings, while the recombinant HB1-derived scFv represents a promising &quot;building block&quot; for producing anti-HBV tools with a potential biopharmaceutical application.

9931000	19990204	Modification of ribonuclease T1 specificity by random mutagenesis of the substrate binding segment.	Attempts to modify the guanine specificity of ribonuclease T1 (RNase T1) by rationally designed amino acid substitutions failed so far. Therefore, we applied a semirational approach by randomizing the guanine binding site. A combinatorial library of approximately 1.6 million RNase T1 variants containing permutations of 6 amino acid positions within the recognition loop was screened on RNase indicator plates. The specificity profiles of 180 individual clones showing RNase activity revealed that variant K41S/N43W/N44H/Y45A/E46D (RNaseT1-8/3) exhibits an altered preference toward purine nucleotides. The ApC/GpC preference in the cleavage reaction of this variant was increased 4000-fold compared to wild-type. Synthesis experiments of dinucleoside monophosphates from cytidine and the corresponding 2'3'-cyclic diesters using the reverse reaction of the transesterification step showed a 7-fold higher ApC synthesis rate of RNase 8/3 than wild-type, whereas the GpC synthesis rates for both enzymes were comparable. This study shows that site-directed random mutagenesis is a powerful additional tool in protein design in order to achieve new enzymatic specificities. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485
26707081	20151229	Inhibition of mTOR sensitizes breast cancer stem cells to radiation-induced repression of self-renewal through the regulation of MnSOD and Akt.	The sensitization of breast cancer stem cells (BrCSCs) to the inhibitive effects of radiotherapy through adjuvant therapy which targets oncogenic pathways represents a prospective strategy for improving the effect of radiation in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation is one of the most frequent events in human malignancies, and is critical for sustaining the self?renewing ability of cancer stem cells (CSCs); inhibition by rapamycin is an effective and promising strategy in anticancer treatments. In the present study, we found that mTOR activity was closely related to the self-renewal ability of BrCSCs, and in triple negative MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB?468 cells, rapamycin repression of mTOR phosphorylation decreased the number of mammospheres and helped to sensitize the resistant CSCs to low-dose radiation therapy. By inhibiting mTOR and mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), we confirmed that rapamycin functioned through the mTOR/MnSOD/reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathway, and the existence of Akt governed the rapamycin?induced asymmetric division (AD) of stem cells in cases of radiation?treated breast cancer. The synergic effects of rapamycin and low-dose radiation induced the AD of stem cells, which then resulted in a decrease in the number of mammospheres, and both were mediated by MnSOD. Governed by Akt, the consequent inhibition of ROS formation and oxidative stress preserved the AD mode of stem cells, which is critical for an improved radiotherapy response in clinical treatment, as the tumor group is thus easier to eliminate with radiation therapy. We posit that an in-depth understanding of the interaction of radiation with CSCs has enormous potential and will make radiation even better and more effective. 	Int._J._Mol._Med.	D016428
22489751	20120412	Contribution of human growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR) gene sequence variation to isolated severe growth hormone deficiency (ISGHD) and normal adult height.	Molecular causes of isolated severe growth hormone deficiency (ISGHD) in several genes have been established. The aim of this study was to analyse the contribution of growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR) gene sequence variation to GH deficiency in a series of prepubertal ISGHD patients and to normal adult height. A systematic GHRHR gene sequence analysis was performed in 69 ISGHD patients and 60 normal adult height controls (NAHC). Four GHRHR single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 248 additional NAHC. An analysis was performed on individual SNPs and combined genotype associations with diagnosis in ISGHD patients and with height-SDS in NAHC. Twenty-one SNPs were found. P3, P13, P15 and P20 had not been previously described. Patients and controls shared 12 SNPs (P1, P2, P4-P11, P16 and P21). Significantly different frequencies of the heterozygous genotype and alternate allele were detected in P9 (exon 4, rs4988498) and P12 (intron 6, rs35609199); P9 heterozygous genotype frequencies were similar in patients and the shortest control group (heights between -2 and -1 SDS) and significantly different in controls (heights between -1 and +2 SDS). GHRHR P9 together with 4 GH1 SNP genotypes contributed to 6?2% of height-SDS variation in the entire 308 NAHC. This study established the GHRHR gene sequence variation map in ISGHD patients and NAHC. No evidence of GHRHR mutation contribution to ISGHD was found in this population, although P9 and P12 SNP frequencies were significantly different between ISGHD and NAHC. Thus, the gene sequence may contribute to normal adult height, as demonstrated in NAHC. 	Clin._Endocrinol._(Oxf)	D016428 D013485
17652215	20070727	Intact kinase homology domain of natriuretic peptide receptor-B is essential for skeletal development.	Natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR-B, GC-B in rodents; gene name NPR2) is a guanylyl cyclase-coupled receptor that mediates the effect of C-type natriuretic peptide. Homozygous mutations in human NPR-B cause acromesomelic dysplasia, type Maroteaux (OMIM 602875), an autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia. NPR-B has an intracellular kinase homology domain (KHD), which has no kinase activity, and its functional significance in vivo is currently unknown. We examined the functional significance of a novel NPR-B KHD mutation in humans. A 28-yr-old Japanese male presented with marked short stature (118.5 cm, -9.3 sd). His limbs showed marked shortening in the middle and distal segments. His parents had relatively short stature with height z-scores of -2.75 and -0.98 (his father and mother, respectively). Direct sequencing of coding region of the NPR2 gene of the family was performed. The mutant receptor activity was investigated by saturation binding assay and cGMP measurement. Additionally, interaction between the mutant and wild type allele was investigated by the titration experiments. We identified a novel missense mutation L658F in KHD of NPR-B in homozygous and heterozygous states in the patient and his parents, respectively. The mutation conferred normal binding affinity for C-type natriuretic peptide but no discernible ligand-induced cGMP production. Furthermore, L658F mutant impaired wild-type NPR-B-mediated cGMP production in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that short stature found in L658F heterozygote can be caused by its dominant-negative effect. This study provides the first evidence that intact KHD of NPR-B is essential for skeletal development. 	J._Clin._Endocrinol._Metab.	D002363 D016428 D013485
23896569	20130731	Mechanical and biocompatible characterization of a cross-linked collagen-hyaluronic acid wound dressing.	Collagen scaffolds have been widely employed as a dermal equivalent to induce fibroblast infiltrations and dermal regeneration in the treatment of chronic wounds and diabetic foot ulcers. Cross-linking methods have been developed to address the disadvantages of the rapid degradation associated with collagen-based scaffolds. To eliminate the potential drawbacks associated with glutaraldehyde cross-linking, methods using a water soluble carbodiimide have been developed. In the present study, the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) hyaluronic acid (HA), was covalently attached to an equine tendon derived collagen scaffold using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) to create ntSPONGE The HA was shown to be homogeneously distributed throughout the collagen matrix. In vitro analyses of the scaffold indicated that the cross-linking enhanced the biological stability by decreasing the enzymatic degradation and increasing the thermal denaturation temperature. The material was shown to support the attachment and proliferation of mouse L929 fibroblast cells. In addition, the cross-linking decreased the resorption rate of the collagen as measured in an intramuscular implant model in rabbits. The material was also shown to be biocompatible in a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays. These results indicate that this cross-linked collagen-HA scaffold, ntSPONGE has the potential for use in chronic wound healing. 	Biomatter	D016428
17998247	20071114	KH-type splicing regulatory protein interacts with survival motor neuron protein and is misregulated in spinal muscular atrophy.	KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) is closely related to chick zipcode-binding protein 2 and rat MARTA1, which are involved in neuronal transport and localization of beta-actin and microtubule-associated protein 2 mRNAs, respectively. KSRP is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that has been implicated in transcriptional regulation, neuro-specific alternative splicing and mRNA decay. More specifically, KSRP is an essential factor for targeting AU-rich element-containing mRNAs to the exosome. We report here that KSRP is arginine methylated and interacts with the Tudor domain of SMN, the causative gene for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), in a CARM1 methylation-dependent fashion. These two proteins colocalize in granule-like foci in the neurites of differentiating neuronal cells and the CARM1 methyltransferase is required for normal localization of KSRP in neuronal cells. Strikingly, this interaction is abrogated by naturally-occurring Tudor domain mutations found in human patients affected with severe Type I SMA, a strong indication of its functional significance to the etiology of the disease. We also report for the first time that Q136E and I116F Tudor mutations behave similarly to the previously characterized E134K mutation, and cause loss of Tudor interactions with several cellular methylated proteins. Finally, we show that KSRP is misregulated in the absence of SMN, and this correlated with increased mRNA stability of its mRNA target, p21(cip1/waf1), in spinal cord of mild SMA model mice. Our results suggest SMN can act as a molecular chaperone for methylated proteins involved in RNA metabolism and provide new insights into the pathophysiology of SMA. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.

21575135	20110518	Characterization and regulation of a bacterial sugar phosphatase of the haloalkanoate dehalogenase superfamily, AraL, from Bacillus subtilis.	AraL from Bacillus subtilis is a member of the ubiquitous haloalkanoate dehalogenase superfamily. The araL gene has been cloned, over-expressed in Escherichia coli and its product purified to homogeneity. The enzyme displays phosphatase activity, which is optimal at neutral pH (7.0) and 65 ?C. Substrate screening and kinetic analysis showed AraL to have low specificity and catalytic activity towards several sugar phosphates, which are metabolic intermediates of the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways. On the basis of substrate specificity and gene context within the arabinose metabolic operon, a putative physiological role of AraL in the detoxification of accidental accumulation of phosphorylated metabolites has been proposed. The ability of AraL to catabolize several related secondary metabolites requires regulation at the genetic level. In the present study, using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that the production of AraL is regulated by a structure in the translation initiation region of the mRNA, which most probably blocks access to the ribosome-binding site, preventing protein synthesis. Members of haloalkanoate dehalogenase subfamily IIA and IIB are characterized by a broad-range and overlapping specificity anticipating the need for regulation at the genetic level. We provide evidence for the existence of a genetic regulatory mechanism controlling the production of AraL. 	FEBS_J.	D016428 D013485
11862322	20020228	Interaction effect between common polymorphisms in PPARgamma2 (Pro12Ala) and insulin receptor substrate 1 (Gly972Arg) on insulin sensitivity.	The Pro12Ala polymorphism in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma2 gene is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. A beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity is reported in some but not all populations. It is possible that this genetic variant produces a characteristic phenotype only against a certain genetic background. We therefore tested the hypothesis that carriers of the Ala allele of PPARgamma2 exhibit a different phenotype against the background of the Gly972Arg polymorphism in the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1. We determined insulin sensitivity in the four combinations defined by the absence or presence of the polymorphic allele (healthy, glucose tolerant subjects), by the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; using a validated index, n=318) and hyperinsulinemic clamp ( n=201). Insulin sensitivity was not or was only marginally different between Pro/Pro and X/Ala in the overall population. Interestingly, using the OGTT index, insulin sensitivity was significantly greater in X/Ala (PPARgamma2) + X/Arg (IRS-1) than in Pro/Pro (PPARgamma2) + X/Arg (IRS-1). On the other hand, insulin sensitivity was similar in the X/Ala (PPARgamma2) + Gly/Gly (IRS-1 972) and the Pro/Pro (PPARgamma2) + Gly/Gly (IRS-1). The results were practically identical using insulin sensitivity from the clamp. In conclusion, the Arg972 (IRS-1) background produced a marked difference in insulin sensitivity between X/Ala and Pro/Pro (PPARgamma) which was not present in the whole population or against the Gly972 (IRS-1) background. This suggests that the Ala allele of PPARgamma2 becomes particularly advantageous against the background of an additional, possibly disadvantageous genetic polymorphism. Allowing for gene-gene interaction effects may reveal novel information regarding metabolic effects of genetic variants. 	J._Mol._Med.	D016428 D013485
24863435	20140528	Tomato PYR/PYL/RCAR abscisic acid receptors show high expression in root, differential sensitivity to the abscisic acid agonist quinabactin, and the capability to enhance plant drought resistance.	Abscisic acid (ABA) plays a crucial role in the plant's response to both biotic and abiotic stress. Sustainable production of food faces several key challenges, particularly the generation of new varieties with improved water use efficiency and drought tolerance. Different studies have shown the potential applications of Arabidopsis PYR/PYL/RCAR ABA receptors to enhance plant drought resistance. Consequently the functional characterization of orthologous genes in crops holds promise for agriculture. The full set of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) PYR/PYL/RCAR ABA receptors have been identified here. From the 15 putative tomato ABA receptors, 14 of them could be grouped in three subfamilies that correlated well with corresponding Arabidopsis subfamilies. High levels of expression of PYR/PYL/RCAR genes was found in tomato root, and some genes showed predominant expression in leaf and fruit tissues. Functional characterization of tomato receptors was performed through interaction assays with Arabidopsis and tomato clade A protein phosphatase type 2Cs (PP2Cs) as well as phosphatase inhibition studies. Tomato receptors were able to inhibit the activity of clade A PP2Cs differentially in an ABA-dependent manner, and at least three receptors were sensitive to the ABA agonist quinabactin, which inhibited tomato seed germination. Indeed, the chemical activation of ABA signalling induced by quinabactin was able to activate stress-responsive genes. Both dimeric and monomeric tomato receptors were functional in Arabidopsis plant cells, but only overexpression of monomeric-type receptors conferred enhanced drought resistance. In summary, gene expression analyses, and chemical and transgenic approaches revealed distinct properties of tomato PYR/PYL/RCAR ABA receptors that might have biotechnological implications.

8124718	19940311	An IL-4 receptor region containing an insulin receptor motif is important for IL-4-mediated IRS-1 phosphorylation and cell growth.	Interleukin-4 (IL-4) treatment of 32D cells overexpressing insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) causes prompt tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Transfection of truncation mutants of the human IL-4 (huIL-4) receptor into 32D-IRS-1 cells demonstrated that the region from amino acid 437-557 is important for IL-4 signaling. This region of the IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) contains the motif 488PL-X4-NPXYXSXSD502 (insulin/IL-4R [I4R]) found in the insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors. Mutation of Y497 to F yielded receptors that caused little or no IRS-1 phosphorylation in response to huIL-4 when expressed in 32D-IRS-1 cells. Most cell lines expressing Y497F also failed to proliferate in response to huIL-4. Furthermore, a glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein containing the I4R motif-bound IRS-1, tyrosine kinase(s), and other unidentified phosphoproteins with molecular sizes of 140, 80, and 55 kd. Thus, the central tyrosine of the I4R motif has a major role in IL-4-mediated signal transduction in 32D cells. 	Cell	D003160 D016428 D013485
20478062	20100519	Endocytic pathways mediating oligomeric Abeta42 neurotoxicity.	One pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is amyloid plaques, composed primarily of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). Over-production or diminished clearance of the 42 amino acid form of Abeta (Abeta42) in the brain leads to accumulation of soluble Abeta and plaque formation. Soluble oligomeric Abeta (oAbeta) has recently emerged to be as a likely proximal cause of AD. Here we demonstrate that endocytosis is critical in mediating oAbeta42-induced neurotoxicity and intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta. Inhibition of clathrin function either with a pharmacological inhibitor, knock-down of clathrin heavy chain expression, or expression of the dominant-negative mutant of clathrin-assembly protein AP180 did not block oAbeta42-induced neurotoxicity or intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta. However, inhibition of dynamin and RhoA by expression of dominant negative mutants reduced neurotoxicity and intraneuronal Abeta accumulation. Pharmacologic inhibition of the dynamin-mediated endocytic pathway by genistein also reduced neurotoxicity. These data suggest that dynamin-mediated and RhoA-regulated endocytosis are integral steps for oligomeric Abeta42-induced neurotoxicity and intraneuronal Abeta accumulation.

17359525	20070316	Evaluation of the OPTC gene in primary open angle glaucoma: functional significance of a silent change.	We investigated the molecular basis of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) using Opticin (OPTC) as a candidate gene on the basis of its expression in the trabecular meshwork cells involved in the disease pathogenesis. Two hundred POAG patients and 100 controls were enrolled in this study. The coding sequence of OPTC was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of POAG patients, followed by SSCP, DHPLC and DNA sequencing. Subsequent bioinformatic analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, quantitative RT-PCR and western blot experiments were performed to address the functional significance of a 'silent' change in the OPTC coding region while screening for mutations in POAG patients. We detected two missense (p.Glu66Gly &amp; p.Ile89Thr) and one silent change (p.Phe162Phe; c.602 C&gt;T) that was present in 3 different patients but in none of the 100 controls screened. The mutant (c.602T) mRNA was predicted to have remarkably different secondary structure compared to the wild-type transcript by in silico approaches. Subsequent wet-lab experiments showed lower expression of the gene both at the mRNA and protein levels. Our study suggests OPTC as a candidate gene for POAG. Further, it highlights the importance of investigating the 'silent' variations for functional implication that might not be apparent from only in silico analysis. 	BMC_Mol._Biol.	D016428 D013485
25144687	20140822	Production of an attenuated phenol-soluble modulin variant unique to the MRSA clonal complex 30 increases severity of bloodstream infection.	Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a leading cause of morbidity and death. Phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) are recently-discovered toxins with a key impact on the development of Staphylococcus aureus infections. Allelic variants of PSMs and their potential impact on pathogen success during infection have not yet been described. Here we show that the clonal complex (CC) 30 lineage, a major cause of hospital-associated sepsis and hematogenous complications, expresses an allelic variant of the PSM?3 peptide. We found that this variant, PSM?3N22Y, is characteristic of CC30 strains and has significantly reduced cytolytic and pro-inflammatory potential. Notably, CC30 strains showed reduced cytolytic and chemotactic potential toward human neutrophils, and increased hematogenous seeding in a bacteremia model, compared to strains in which the genome was altered to express non-CC30 PSM?3. Our findings describe a molecular mechanism contributing to attenuated pro-inflammatory potential in a main MRSA lineage. They suggest that reduced pathogen recognition via PSMs allows the bacteria to evade elimination by innate host defenses during bloodstream infections. Furthermore, they underscore the role of point mutations in key S. aureus toxin genes in that adaptation and the pivotal importance PSMs have in defining key S. aureus immune evasion and virulence mechanisms.

27311576	20160618	Biophysical Studies on HCV 1a NS3/4A Protease and Its Catalytic Triad in Wild Type and Mutants by the In Silico Approach.	The hepatitis C virus (HCV), of the family flaviviridae, is one of the major causes of chronic liver diseases. Until the year 2012, HCV infections were treated using PEG-interferon and ribavirin combinations, which have a low cure rate and severe side effects. Currently, many direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are available, e.g. protease inhibitors, NS5A and polymerase inhibitors. These drugs have proven to be efficient in interferon-free treatment combinations and capable of enhancing the cure rate to above 90?%. Unlike PEG-interferon and ribavirin combinations, DAAs select for resistance in HCV. The R155K mutation in the HCV was found to resist all the currently available protease inhibitors. Here, we studied biophysical parameters like pocket (cavity) geometries and stabilizing residues of HCV 1a NS3/4A protease in wild type and mutants. We also studied HCV 1a NS3/4A protease's catalytic residues: their accessibility, energy, flexibility and binding to Phase II oral protease inhibitor vedroprevir (GS-9451), and compared these parameters between wild type and mutant(s). All these studies were performed using various bioinformatics tools (e.g. Swiss-PdbViewer and Schr?dinger's Maestro) and web servers (e.g. DoGSiteScorer, SRide, ASA-View, WHAT IF, elN?mo, CABS-flex, PatchDock and PLIP). From our study, we found that introduction of R155K, A156T or D168A mutation to wild-type NS3/4A protease increases the pocket's volume, surface (in the R155K mutant, surface decreases), lipo surface and depth and decreases the number of stabilizing residues. Additionally, differences in catalytic residues' solvent accessibility, energy, root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and flexibility between wild type and mutants?might explain changes in the protease activity and the resistance to protease inhibitors.

27098685	20160422	?-Synuclein Mutation Inhibits Endocytosis at Mammalian Central Nerve Terminals.	?-Synuclein (?-syn) missense and multiplication mutations have been suggested to cause neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies. Before causing the progressive neuronal loss, ?-syn mutations impair exocytosis, which may contribute to eventual neurodegeneration. To understand how ?-syn mutations impair exocytosis, we developed a mouse model that selectively expressed PD-related human ?-syn A53T (h-?-synA53T) mutation at the calyx of Held terminals, where release mechanisms can be dissected with a patch-clamping technique. With capacitance measurement of endocytosis, we reported that h-?-synA53T, either expressed transgenically or dialyzed in the short term in calyces, inhibited two of the most common forms of endocytosis, the slow and rapid vesicle endocytosis at mammalian central synapses. The expression of h-?-synA53Tin calyces also inhibited vesicle replenishment to the readily releasable pool. These findings may help to understand how ?-syn mutations impair neurotransmission before neurodegeneration. ?-Synuclein (?-syn) missense or multiplication mutations may cause neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. The initial impact of ?-syn mutations before neuronal loss is impairment of exocytosis, which may contribute to eventual neurodegeneration. The mechanism underlying impairment of exocytosis is poorly understood. Here we report that an ?-syn mutant, the human ?-syn A53T, inhibited two of the most commonly observed forms of endocytosis, slow and rapid endocytosis, at a mammalian central synapse. We also found that ?-syn A53T inhibited vesicle replenishment to the readily releasable pool. These results may contribute to accounting for the widely observed early synaptic impairment caused by ?-syn mutations in the progression toward neurodegeneration. 	J._Neurosci.

12888812	20030731	Neoadjuvant, adjuvant and palliative treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) with imatinib: a centre-based study of 17 patients.	Malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) have a poor prognosis. Since these tumours are resistant to conventional radiation and chemotherapy, surgery has been the mainstay of treatment. However, surgery is usually inadequate for the treatment of malignant GIST. Imatinib, a KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has recently been found to have a dramatic antitumour effect on GIST. In this centre-based study of 17 consecutive patients with high-risk or overtly malignant GIST, imatinib was used in three different settings - palliatively, adjuvantly, and neoadjuvantly. The treatment was found to be safe and particularly effective in tumours with activating mutations of exon 11 of the KIT gene. Clinical response to imatinib treatment correlated morphologically to tumour necrosis, hyalinisation, and reduced proliferative activity. The value of neoadjuvant imatinib treatment was illustrated in one case. 	Br._J._Cancer	D016430 D016428 D013485
25499008	20141216	Association between ACVR2A and early-onset preeclampsia: replication study in a Northeastern Brazilian population.	Preeclampsia is a complex and heterogeneous disease with increased risk of maternal mortality, especially for earlier gestational onset. There is a great inconsistency regarding the genetics of preeclampsia across the literature. The gene Activin A receptor, type IIA (ACVR2A), was reported as associated to preeclampsia in Australian/New Zealand and Norwegian populations. The goal of this study was to validate this genetic association in a Brazilian population. We performed a case-control study using 693 controls and 613 cases (443 preeclampsia, 64 eclampsia and 106 HELLP syndrome), from a Northeastern Brazilian population. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ACVR2A were tested for association through multiple logistic regression models. There was no statistical association with preeclampsia (per se), eclampsia or HELLP. However, by grouping preeclampsia in accordance to the gestational age at delivery, SNPs rs1424954 (OR = 1.86; 95% CI, 1.25-2.78; p = 0.002) and rs1014064 (OR = 1.77; 95% CI, 1.21-2.60; p = 0.004) were significantly associated with early onset preeclampsia (gestational age ? 34 weeks). The risk haplotype had a frequency of 0.468 in early preeclampsia compared to 0.316 in controls (p = 0.0008 and permuted p = 0.002). Activin A receptors are important in decidualization, trophoblast invasion and placentation processes during pregnancy. The gene ACVR2A was associated with the more severe early onset preeclampsia. This finding supports the hypothesis of different pathogenic mechanisms contributing to the early- and late-onset preeclampsia. 	Placenta	D016428 D013485 D023361
19125024	20090107	Prevalence of GJB2 (connexin-26) and GJB6 (connexin-30) mutations in a cohort of 300 Brazilian hearing-impaired individuals: implications for diagnosis and genetic counseling.	Hereditary nonsyndromic deafness is an autosomal recessive condition in about 80% of cases, and point mutations in the GJB2 gene (connexin 26) and two deletions in the GJB6 gene (connexin 30), del(GJB6-D13S1830) and del(GJB6-D13S1854), are reported to account for 50% of recessive deafness. Aiming at establishing the frequencies of GJB2 mutations and GJB6 deletions in the Brazilian population, we screened 300 unrelated individuals with hearing impairment, who were not affected by known deafness related syndromes. We firstly screened the most frequently reported mutations, c.35delG and c.167delT in the GJB2 gene, and del(GJB6-D13S1830) and del(GJB6-D13S1854) in the GJB6 gene, through specific techniques. The detected c.35delG and c.167delT mutations were validated by sequencing. Other mutations in the GJB2 gene were screened by single-strand conformation polymorphism and the coding region was sequenced when abnormal patterns were found. Pathogenic mutations in GJB2 and GJB6 genes were detected in 41 individuals (13.7%), and 80.5% (33/41) presented these mutations in homozygosis or compound heterozygosis, thus explaining their hearing defect. The c.35delG in the GJB2 gene was the most frequent mutation (37/300; 12.4%), detected in 23% familial and 6.2% the sporadic cases. The second most frequent mutation (1%; 3/300) was the del(GJB6-D13S1830), always found associated with the c.35delG mutation. Nineteen different sequence variations were found in the GJB2 gene. In addition to the c.35delG mutation, nine known pathogenic alterations were detected c.167delT, p.Trp24X, p.Val37Ile, c.176_191del16, c.235delC, p.Leu90Pro, p.Arg127His, c.509insA, and p.Arg184Pro. Five substitutions had been previously considered benign polymorphisms: c.-15C&gt;T, p.Val27Ile, p.Met34Thr, p.Ala40Ala, and p.Gly160Ser. Two previously reported mutations of unknown pathogenicity were found (p.Lys168Arg, and c.684C&gt;A), and two novel substitutions, p.Leu81Val (c.G241C) and p.Met195Val (c.A583G), both in heterozygosis without an accompanying mutation in the other allele. None of these latter four variants of undefined status was present in a sample of 100 hearing controls. The present study demonstrates that mutations in the GJB2 gene and del(GJB6 D13S1830) are important causes of hearing impairment in Brazil, thus justifying their screening in a routine basis. The diversity of variants in our sample reflects the ethnic heterogeneity of the Brazilian population. 	Ear_Hear	D016428 D013485
26589601	20151122	Genetic Factors Influencing B-type Natriuretic Peptide-Mediated Production of Cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate and Blood Pressure Effects in Heart Failure Patients.	Natriuretic peptides (NPs) represent a critical pathway in heart failure (HF). We explored genetic determinants of pharmacodynamic effects of B-type NP (BNP) and changes in plasma cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and blood pressure (BP). HF patients (n?=?135) received recombinant human BNP (nesiritide) at standard doses, and plasma cGMP levels were measured at baseline and during infusion. We tested the association of 119 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 4 candidate genes (NPR1, NPR2, NPR3, and membrane metallo-endopeptidase (MME)) with the change in cGMP and BP. Gene-based testing for association of genetic variation with endpoints was significant only for MME. Upon individual SNP testing, two loci in MME were associated with ?cGMP; another (rs16824656) showed association with BP change. In summary, the pharmacodynamic effects of BNP vary substantially in HF patients and are associated with genetic variation in MME. MME genetic variation may be an important determinant of NP-mediated effects in humans. 	J_Cardiovasc_Transl_Res	D016428 D016448 D052061
8713771	19960101	The 1691 G--&gt;A mutation in the factor V gene: relationship to activated protein C (APC) resistance and thrombosis in 65 patients.	Four hundred fifty subjects were screened for the 1691 G--&gt;A mutation in the factor V gene. Two hundred ninety-seven patients were referred to us for unexplained thrombosis, 133 were family members of these patients and 20 were normal subjects. We studied the relationships between the mutation, resistance to APC and thrombosis. Among the 450 subjects tested, 65 belonging to 42 families were found to have the 1691 G--&gt;A mutation in one (n = 61) or both alleles (n = 4). The prevalence of the mutation in the thrombotic patients was 13%. Resistance to APC was tested for in 247 subjects not on anticoagulant treatment (4 homozygous and 44 heterozygous for the mutation, and 199 individuals without the mutation). Incomplete cosegregation of heterozygosity for the 1691 G--&gt;A mutation with APC resistance (APC-SR &lt; 2.4 or n-APC-SR &lt; 0.75) was observed, showing that the functional assay alone is insufficient for a firm diagnosis. In patients carrying the mutation, elevated levels of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 and D-dimers pointed to increased thrombin generation in vivo. Clinical manifestations in the heterozygous subjects were very similar to those reported in heterozygous PC or PS deficiencies, but the first thrombotic event occurred later than in PC- or PS-deficient patients. Homozygosity for the factor V gene mutation appears to be a far more benign thrombotic disorder than homozygous PC and PS deficiencies. 	Thromb._Haemost.	D003160 D016428
12705832	20030423	A point mutation in ribosomal protein L7/L12 reduces its ability to form a compact dimer structure and to assemble into the GTPase center.	An Escherichia coli mutant, LL103, harboring a mutation (Ser15 to Phe) in ribosomal protein L7/L12 was isolated among revertants of a streptomycin-dependent strain. In the crystal structure of the L7/L12 dimer, residue 15 within the N-terminal domain contacts the C-terminal domain of the partner monomer. We tested effects of the mutation on molecular assembly by biochemical approaches. Gel electrophoretic analysis showed that the Phe15-L7/L12 variant had reduced ability in binding to L10, an effect enhanced in the presence of 0.05% of nonionic detergent. Mobility of Phe15-L7/L12 on gel containing the detergent was very low compared to the wild-type proteins, presumably because of an extended structural state of the mutant L7/L12. Ribosomes isolated from LL103 cells contained a reduced amount of L7/L12 and showed low levels (15-30% of wild-type ribosomes) of activities dependent on elongation factors and in translation of natural mRNA. The ribosomal activity was completely recovered by addition of an excess amount of Phe15-L7/L12 to the ribosomes, suggesting that the mutant L7/L12 exerts normal functions when bound on the ribosome. The interaction of Ser15 with the C-terminal domain of the partner molecule seems to contribute to formation of the compact dimer structure and its efficient assembly into the ribosomal GTPase center. We propose a model relating compact and elongated forms of L7/L12 dimers. Phe15-L7/L12 provides a new tool for studying the functional structure of the homodimer. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485
23819767	20130704	The type?2B p.R1306W natural mutation of von Willebrand factor dramatically enhances the multimer sensitivity to shear stress.	Shear stress triggers conformational stretching of von Willebrand factor (VWF), which is responsible for its self-association and binding to the platelet receptor glycoprotein (GP)Ib?. This phenomenon supports primary hemostasis under flow. Type?2B VWF natural mutants are considered to have increased affinity for platelet GPIb?. To assess the mechanism responsible for the enhanced interaction of the p.R1306W VWF mutant with the platelet receptor. The interaction of GPIb? with wild-type (WT) and p.R1306W VWF multimers and A1-A2-A3 constructs was investigated with surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. Analysis of the static VWF conformation in solution was performed with dynamic light scattering spectroscopy. The shear stress-induced self-association of VWF multimers was investigated with atomic force microscopy (AFM) over a 0-60?dyn?cm(-2) range. WT VWF did not interact with GPIb? under static conditions, whereas the mutant at ~?2??g?mL(-1) already bound to the receptor. By contrast, the WT and p.R1306W-A1-A2-A3 constructs showed comparable affinities for GPIb? (Kd ?~?20?nm). The hydrodynamic diameter of resting R1306W VWF multimers was significantly greater than that of the wild type (210???60?nm vs. 87???22?nm). At shear forces of &lt;?14?dyn?cm(-2) , the p.R1306W multimers rapidly changed conformation, entering a regime of self-aggregation, which, in contrast, was induced for WT VWF by shear forces of &gt;?30?dyn?cm(-2) . Mechanical stretching AFM experiments showed that p.R1306W multimers needed less energy per length unit (~?10?pN) to be stretched than the WT protein. The increased affinity of p.R1306W VWF for GPIb? arises mostly from higher sensitivity to shear stress, which facilitates exposure of GPIb? binding sites. 	J._Thromb._Haemost.	D016428 D013485
9608426	19980603	Study of the stability of erythromycin in a hydrophilic creme basis by liquid chromatography.	The stability of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin, incorporated at a 2% m/m concentration in a hydrophilic creme basis containing 2% m/m of chlorocresol, was monitored over a period of 2 months using liquid chromatography as the analytical method. Extracts of the creme were analysed using wide-pore poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) PLRP-S 1000 A as the stationary phase and a mixture of 2-methyl-2-propanol-acetonitrile-potassium phosphate buffer (pH 11.0; 0.02 M)-water (165:30:50:755, v/v/v/v) as the mobile phase. The method showed good selectivity towards chlorocresol, erythromycin A, its related substances and degradation products. As the pH of the creme containing erythromycin was 8.6, alkaline degradation products were expected to be formed. The presence of pseudoerythromycin A enol ether was observed after storage of the creme for 1 week at a temperature of 25 degrees C. After 1 month the content of erythromycin was still more than 95%. 	J_Pharm_Biomed_Anal	D016428
16301312	20051123	The first glycosynthase derived from an inverting glycoside hydrolase.	Reducing end xylose-releasing exooligoxylanase (Rex, EC 3.2.1.156) is an inverting GH that hydrolyzes xylooligosaccharides (&gt; or = X3) to release X1 at their reducing end. The wild-type enzyme exhibited the Hehre resynthesis hydrolysis mechanism, in which alpha-X2F was hydrolyzed to X2 and HF in the presence of X1 as an acceptor molecule. However, the transglycosidation product (X3) was not detectable in the reaction. To convert reducing end xylose-releasing exooligoxylanase to glycosynthase, derivatives with mutations in the catalytic base (Asp-263) were constructed by saturation random mutagenesis. Nine amino acid residue mutants (Asp-263 to Gly, Ala, Val, Thr, Leu, Asn, Cys, Pro, or Ser) were found to possess glycosynthase activity forming X3 from alpha-X2F and X1. Among them, D263C showed the highest level of X3 production, and D263N exhibited the fastest consumption of alpha-X2F. The D263C mutant showed 10-fold lower hydrolytic activity than D263N, resulting in the highest yield of X3. X2 was formed from the early stage of the reaction of the D263C mutant, indicating that a portion of the X3 formed by condensation was hydrolyzed before its release from the enzyme. To acquire glycosynthase activity from inverting enzymes, it is important to minimize the decrease in F(-)-releasing activity while maximizing the decrease in the hydrolytic activity. The present study expands the possibility of conversion of glycosynthases from inverting enzymes. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
15746059	20050305	HA22 (R490A) is a recombinant immunotoxin with increased antitumor activity without an increase in animal toxicity.	RFB4 (dsFv)-PE38 (BL22) is a recombinant immunotoxin containing an anti-CD22 (Fv) fused to truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin A, which induces a high complete remission rate in patients with purine analogue-resistant hairy cell leukemia. HA22 is a mutant of BL22 with mutations in heavy-chain CDR3 resulting in increased cytotoxic activity. Our goal was to improve the activity of HA22. Arg(490), which is located in the catalytic domain (III) of the immunotoxin HA22, was mutated to alanine. Purified immunotoxins were produced and tested for cytotoxic activity in cell culture and for antitumor activity and nonspecific toxicity in mice. ADP-ribosylation activity was also measured. HA22 (R490A) is approximately 2-fold more cytotoxic than HA22 on several CD22-positive cell lines. When injected i.v., HA22 (R490A) has more potent antitumor activity than HA22 against CA46 tumors in mice. HA22 and HA22 (R490A) have similar LD(50)s (approximately 1.3 mg/kg) and similar plasma half-lives. The R490A mutation also improved the cytotoxicity of the antimesothelin recombinant immunotoxin SS1 (dsFv)-PE38 (SS1P). In vitro ADP-ribosylation assays show that HA22 R490A has increased activity. Increased cytotoxic activity is probably related to this increase in ADP-ribosylation activity. Protein engineering can be used to increase the efficacy of recombinant immunotoxins. Because HA22 (R490A) has increased antitumor activity without increased animal toxicity, immunotoxins with this mutation are candidates for clinical development. 	Clin._Cancer_Res.	D016428
23476338	20130312	Bis(1,10-phenanthroline-?(2) N,N')(sulfato-O)copper(II) butane-2,3-diol monosolvate.	The title compound, [Cu(SO4)(C12H8N2)2]?C4H10O2, is comprised of neutral monomeric complex and butane-2,3-diol solvent mol-ecules. In the complex, the Cu(II) ion is in a distorted square-pyramidal coordination environment defined by four N atoms from two chelating 1,10-phenanthroline ligands and one O atom from a monodentate sulfate anion; the O atom is at the apex. The two chelating N2C2 groups subtend a dihedral angle of 85.8?(4)?. In the crystal, the neutral monomeric complex and butane-2,3-diol solvent mol-ecules are held together by O-H?O hydrogen bonding, which leads to additional stabilization of the structure. The presence of pseudosymmetry in the structure suggests the higher symmetry space group C2/c, but attempts to refine the structure in this space group resulted in an unsatisfactory model and high R and wR values. The sulfate anion is disordered over two sets of sites with occupancies of 0.55?(1) and 0.45?(1). 	Acta_Crystallogr_Sect_E_Struct_Rep_Online	D016428
19641926	20090731	L1CAM mutation in association with X-linked hydrocephalus and Hirschsprung's disease.	X-linked hydrocephalus (XLH) is characterized by increased intracranial ventricle size and head circumference secondary to aqueduct of Sylvius congenital stenosis. Exceedingly rare is the concurrence of XLH and Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) with a theoretical incidence of 1 in 125-250 million cases. Herein, we are describing a case of a patient with concurrent XLH and HSCR. The patient was delivered via cesarean section at 37 weeks gestation and underwent uneventful ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. As a part of a workup for constipation, we performed a rectal biopsy, which was consistent with HSCR. Genetics testing showed hemizygous for R558X hemizygous mutation in the L1CAM gene. A C --&gt; T nucleotide substitution in exon 13 resulted in replacement of an arginine codon with a stop codon, a nonsense mutation. Although it is widely accepted that HSCR represents the failure of early embryonic neural crest cells to migrate properly, the exact mechanism is not known. The association of HSCR with XLH in the presence of L1CAM mutations remains quite interesting because cell adhesion molecules are involved in the proper migration of neural components throughout the body. Additional studies are necessary to fully elucidate the relationship between XLH and HSCR in the presence of L1CAM mutations. 	Pediatr._Surg._Int.	D002363 D016428
26030070	20150602	Differentially Expressed Genes in Resistant and Susceptible Common Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) Genotypes in Response to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli.	Fusarium wilt of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), caused by Fusarium oxysporum Schlechtend.:Fr. f.sp. phaseoli (Fop), is one of the most important diseases of common beans worldwide. Few natural sources of resistance to Fop exist and provide only moderate or partial levels of protection. Despite the economic importance of the disease across multiple crops, only a few of Fop induced genes have been analyzed in legumes. Therefore, our goal was to identify transcriptionally regulated genes during an incompatible interaction between common bean and the Fop pathogen using the cDNA amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) technique. We generated a total of 8,730 transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) with 768 primer pairs based on the comparison of a moderately resistant and a susceptible genotype. In total, 423 TDFs (4.9%) displayed altered expression patterns after inoculation with Fop inoculum. We obtained full amplicon sequences for 122 selected TDFs, of which 98 were identified as annotated known genes in different functional categories based on their putative functions, 10 were predicted but non-annotated genes and 14 were not homologous to any known genes. The 98 TDFs encoding genes of known putative function were classified as related to metabolism (22), signal transduction (21), protein synthesis and processing (20), development and cytoskeletal organization (12), transport of proteins (7), gene expression and RNA metabolism (4), redox reactions (4), defense and stress responses (3), energy metabolism (3), and hormone responses (2). Based on the analyses of homology, 19 TDFs from different functional categories were chosen for expression analysis using quantitative RT-PCR. The genes found to be important here were implicated at various steps of pathogen infection and will allow a better understanding of the mechanisms of defense and resistance to Fop and similar pathogens. The differential response genes discovered here could also be used as molecular markers in association mapping or QTL analysis. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
2841677	19880101	Where is the radical in compound I of cytochrome c peroxidase? Clues from crystallography and mutagenesis.	A difference Fourier map shows small structural perturbations on oxidation of cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP) to its semi-stable intermediate, compound I. Least-squares refinement of both CCP and compound I quantifies these perturbations and suggests that the radical site may be on the distal side of the heme, since that is where most of the small movements occur. Several engineered mutants of CCP were created in an attempt to assess the function of various side chains, among them Trp-51----Phe, Trp-191----Phe and His-181----Gly. X-ray structures of the mutant CCP's confirm that only minimal changes are caused by these substitutions. Preliminary examination of the mutants' kinetic properties show that Trp-51 is not the radical site; that Trp-191 has an important enzymic function; and that His-181 is not essential for electron transfer, but probably has some more indirect role. The locus of the radical in compound I, however, remains to be established. 	Prog._Clin._Biol._Res.	D016428 D013486
27645386	20160921	Transcriptional Responses of Escherichia coli to a Small-Molecule Inhibitor of LolCDE, an Essential Component of the Lipoprotein Transport Pathway.	In Gram-negative bacteria, a dedicated machinery consisting of LolABCDE components targets lipoproteins to the outer membrane. We used a previously identified small-molecule inhibitor of the LolCDE complex of Escherichia coli to assess the global transcriptional consequences of interference with lipoprotein transport. Exposure of E. coli to the LolCDE inhibitor at concentrations leading to minimal and significant growth inhibition, followed by transcriptome sequencing, identified a small group of genes whose transcript levels were decreased and a larger group whose mRNA levels increased 10- to 100-fold compared to those of untreated cells. The majority of the genes whose mRNA concentrations were reduced were part of the flagellar assembly pathway, which contains an essential lipoprotein component. Most of the genes whose transcript levels were elevated encode proteins involved in selected cell stress pathways. Many of these genes are involved with envelope stress responses induced by the mislocalization of outer membrane lipoproteins. Although several of the genes whose RNAs were induced have previously been shown to be associated with the general perturbation of the cell envelope by antibiotics, a small subset was affected only by LolCDE inhibition. Findings from this work suggest that the efficiency of the Lol system function may be coupled to a specific monitoring system, which could be exploited in the development of reporter constructs suitable for use for screening for additional inhibitors of lipoprotein trafficking. Inhibition of the lipoprotein transport pathway leads to E. coli death and subsequent lysis. Early significant changes in the levels of RNA for a subset of genes identified to be associated with some periplasmic and envelope stress responses were observed. Together these findings suggest that disruption of this key pathway can have a severe impact on balanced outer membrane synthesis sufficient to affect viability. 	J._Bacteriol.	D016428
15304385	20040812	Synergistic effect of SU11248 with cytarabine or daunorubicin on FLT3 ITD-positive leukemic cells.	Fetal liver tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3 ITD) mutations are the most common molecular abnormality associated with adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To exploit this molecular target, a number of potent and specific FLT3 kinase inhibitors have been developed and are currently being tested in early phase clinical trials of patients with refractory AML. To explore the efficacy of combining a FLT3 inhibitor with standard AML chemotherapy drugs, we tested the effect of combining the FLT3 inhibitor SU11248 with cytarabine or daunorubicin on the proliferation and survival of cell lines expressing either mutant (FLT3 ITD or FLT3 D835V) or wild-type (WT) FLT3. SU11248 had additive-to-synergistic inhibitory effects on FLT3-dependent leukemic cell proliferation when combined with cytarabine or daunorubicin. The synergistic interaction of SU11248 and the traditional antileukemic agents was more pronounced for induction of apoptosis. SU11248 inhibited the proliferation of primary AML myeloblasts expressing mutant FLT3 ITD but not WT FLT3 protein. Combining SU11248 and cytarabine synergistically inhibited the proliferation of primary AML myeloblasts expressing FLT3 ITD but not WT FLT3 protein. These data suggest that the addition of potent FLT3 inhibitors such as SU11248 to AML chemotherapy regimens could result in improved treatment results. 	Blood	D016428 D013485 D013486 D013487
9442019	19980127	Smad5 and DPC4 are key molecules in mediating BMP-2-induced osteoblastic differentiation of the pluripotent mesenchymal precursor cell line C2C12.	Since the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily that induce the differentiation of mesenchymal precursor cells into the osteogenic cells, we identified the relevant signaling molecules responsible for mediating BMP-2 effects on mesenchymal precursor cells. BMP-2 induces osteoblastic differentiation of the pluripotent mesenchymal cell line C2C12 by increasing alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin production. As recent studies have demonstrated that cytoplasmic Smad proteins are involved in TGF-beta superfamily signaling, we plan to isolate the relevant Smad family members involved in osteoblastic differentiation. We identified human Smad5, which is highly homologous to Smad1. BMP-2 caused serine phosphorylation of Smad5 as well as Smad1. In contrast, TGF-beta failed to cause serine phosphorylation of Smad1 and Smad5. We found Smad5 is directly activated by BMP type Ia or Ib receptors through physical association with these receptors. Following phosphorylation, Smad5 bound to DPC4, another Smad family member, and the complex was translocated to the nucleus. Overexpression of point-mutated Smad5 (G419S) or a C-terminal deletion mutant DPC4 (DPC4 delta C) blocked the induction of alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin production, and Smad5-DPC4 signaling cascades upon BMP-2 treatment in C2C12 cells. These data suggest that activation of Smad5 and subsequent Smad5-DPC4 complex formation are key steps in the BMP signaling pathway, which mediates BMP-2-induced osteoblastic differentiation of the C2C12 mesenchymal cells.

25485544	20141209	Specificity rendering 'hot-spots' for aurora kinase inhibitor design: the role of non-covalent interactions and conformational transitions.	The present study examines the conformational transitions occurring among the major structural motifs of Aurora kinase (AK) concomitant with the DFG-flip and deciphers the role of non-covalent interactions in rendering specificity. Multiple sequence alignment, docking and structural analysis of a repertoire of 56 crystal structures of AK from Protein Data Bank (PDB) has been carried out. The crystal structures were systematically categorized based on the conformational disposition of the DFG-loop [in (DI) 42, out (DO) 5 and out-up (DOU) 9], G-loop [extended (GE) 53 and folded (GF) 3] and ?C-helix [in (CI) 42 and out (CO) 14]. The overlapping subsets on categorization show the inter-dependency among structural motifs. Therefore, the four distinct possibilities a) 2W1C (DI, CI, GE) b) 3E5A (DI, CI, GF) c) 3DJ6 (DI, CO, GF) d) 3UNZ (DOU, CO, GF) along with their co-crystals and apo-forms were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations of 40 ns each to evaluate the variations of individual residues and their impact on forming interactions. The non-covalent interactions formed by the 157 AK co-crystals with different regions of the binding site were initially studied with the docked complexes and structure interaction fingerprints. The frequency of the most prominent interactions was gauged in the AK inhibitors from PDB and the four representative conformations during 40 ns. Based on this study, seven major non-covalent interactions and their complementary sites in AK capable of rendering specificity have been prioritized for the design of different classes of inhibitors.

11921123	20020329	Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency: clinical manifestations of catecholamine insufficiency in infancy.	Inborn errors of catecholamine biosynthesis are rare but of great interest as they are genetic disorders, and in some, treatment may completely reverse severe neurological abnormalities. They also provide insights into the action of the biogenic amines in the developing brain. We describe the clinical course of an infant with tyrosine hydroxylase (TOH) deficiency over a 30-month period. The parents are consanguineous, and genetic analysis revealed the infant to be homozygous for the common G698A mutation in the TOH gene. TOH deficiency can be seen as a model of pure catecholamine deficiency. Experimental evidence, reports of other disorders of biogenic amines, and our experience with this infant suggest that the symptoms of catecholamine deficiency in infancy can be broadly subdivided. Signs of dopamine deficiency include tremor, hypersensitivity to levadopa (L-dopa) therapy, oculogyric crises, akinesia, rigidity, and dystonia. Manifestations of norepinephrine deficiency include ptosis, miosis, profuse oropharyngeal secretions, and postural hypotension. Hypersensitivity to L-dopa was a particular management problem in this infant. 	Mov._Disord.	D002363 D016428

26287674	20150820	Evaluation of Aminoglycoside and Non-Aminoglycoside Compounds for Stop-Codon Readthrough Therapy in Four Lysosomal Storage Diseases.	Nonsense mutations are quite prevalent in inherited diseases. Readthrough drugs could provide a therapeutic option for any disease caused by this type of mutation. Geneticin (G418) and gentamicin were among the first to be described. Novel compounds have been generated, but only a few have shown improved results. PTC124 is the only compound to have reached clinical trials. Here we first investigated the readthrough effects of gentamicin on fibroblasts from one patient with Sanfilippo B, one with Sanfilippo C, and one with Maroteaux-Lamy. We found that ARSB activity (Maroteaux-Lamy case) resulted in an increase of 2-3 folds and that the amount of this enzyme within the lysosomes was also increased, after treatment. Since the other two cases (Sanfilippo B and Sanfilippo C) did not respond to gentamicin, the treatments were extended with the use of geneticin and five non-aminoglycoside (PTC124, RTC13, RTC14, BZ6 and BZ16) readthrough compounds (RTCs). No recovery was observed at the enzyme activity level. However, mRNA recovery was observed in both cases, nearly a two-fold increase for Sanfilippo B fibroblasts with G418 and around 1.5 fold increase for Sanfilippo C cells with RTC14 and PTC124. Afterwards, some of the products were assessed through in vitro analyses for seven mutations in genes responsible for those diseases and, also, for Niemann-Pick A/B. Using the coupled transcription/translation system (TNT), the best results were obtained for SMPD1 mutations with G418, reaching a 35% recovery at 0.25 ?g/ml, for the p.W168X mutation. The use of COS cells transfected with mutant cDNAs gave positive results for most of the mutations with some of the drugs, although to a different extent. The higher enzyme activity recovery, of around two-fold increase, was found for gentamicin on the ARSB p.W146X mutation. Our results are promising and consistent with those of other groups. Further studies of novel compounds are necessary to find those with more consistent efficacy and fewer toxic effects. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
9480225	19980228	[A simple and rapid method for determining a 32-bp deletion in the gene for the chemokine receptor CCR5].	In recent studies, a 32-bp deletion in the coding region of the chemokine receptor gene CCP5 was reported, which completely blocked penetration of the HIV-I virus into lymphocytes and macrophages. We developed a simple and rapid method for determining this deletion. The use of this method can greatly accelerate the evaluation of the frequency of the deletion allele CCP5 delta 32 in various populations and the determination of genotypes for the locus CCP5 in HIV-infected individuals. CCP5 was genotyped in three populations from Eastern Europe (Russians, Belarussians, and Bashkirs). Frequencies of the allele CCP5 delta 32 in these populations did not significantly differ from those in white Americans and Europeans from the CEPH sample. Even in Bashkiria, with its clear Turkic contribution, the frequency of CCP5 delta 32 reaches 0.10. 	Genetika	D004740 D016428

The goal for this study was to evaluate safety regarding anticoagulant activity and platelet activation during daily consumption of an aqueous cyanophyta extract (ACE), containing a high dose of phycocyanin. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design, 24 men and women were enrolled after informed consent, and consumed either ACE (2.3?g/day) or placebo daily for 2 weeks. The ACE dose was equivalent to ?1?g phycocyanin per day, chosen based on the highest dose Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Consuming ACE did not alter markers for platelet activation (P-selectin expression) or serum P-selectin levels. No changes were seen for activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin clotting time, or fibrinogen activity. Serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST) showed a significant reduction after 2 weeks of ACE consumption (P?&lt;?.001), in contrast to placebo where no changes were seen; the difference in AST levels between the two groups was significant at 2 weeks (P?&lt;?.02). Reduced levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) were also seen in the group consuming ACE (P?&lt;?.08). Previous studies showed reduction of chronic pain when consuming 1?g ACE per day. The higher dose of 2.3?g/day in this study was associated with significant reduction of chronic pain at rest and when physically active (P?&lt;?.05).

18657969	20080729	Crystal structure of chemically synthesized HIV-1 protease and a ketomethylene isostere inhibitor based on the p2/NC cleavage site.	Here we report the X-ray structures of chemically synthesized HIV-1 protease and the inactive [D25N]HIV-1 protease complexed with the ketomethylene isostere inhibitor Ac-Thr-Ile-Nle psi[CO-CH(2)]Nle-Gln-Arg.amide at 1.4 and 1.8A resolution, respectively. In complex with the active enzyme, the keto-group was found to be converted into the hydrated gem-diol, while the structure of the complex with the inactive D25N enzyme revealed an intact keto-group. These data support the general acid-general base mechanism for HIV-1 protease catalysis. 	Bioorg._Med._Chem._Lett.	D016428 D052061 D013486
25590829	20150116	A highly sensitive and selective fluorescent chemosensor for detection of Zn2+ based on a Schiff base.	A Schiff-base fluorescent probe - 2-((E)-(quinolin-8-ylimino)methyl)quinolin-8-ol (H7L) was synthesized and evaluated as a chemoselective Zn2+ sensor. Upon treatment with Zn2+, the complexation of H7L with Zn2+ resulted in a red shift with a pronounced enhancement in the fluorescence emission intensity in ethanol solution. Moreover, other common alkali, alkaline earth and transition metal ions failed to induce response or minimal spectral changes. Notably, this chemosensor could distinguish clearly Zn2+ from Cd2+. Fluorescence studies on H7L and H7L-Zn2+ complex reveal that the quantum yield strongly increases upon coordination. The stoichiometric ratio and association constant were evaluated using Benesi-Hildebrand relation giving 1:1 stoichiometry. This further corroborated 1:1 complex formation based on Job's plot analyses. This chemosensor exhibits a very good fluorescence sensing ability to Zn2+ over a wide range of pH.

12594833	20030221	Severe Mycobacterium bovis BCG infections in a large series of novel IL-12 receptor beta1 deficient patients and evidence for the existence of partial IL-12 receptor beta1 deficiency.	Cell mediated immunity plays a critical role in human host defence against intracellular bacteria. In patients with unusual, severe infections caused by poorly pathogenic species of mycobacteria and salmonellae, genetic deficiencies have been identified in key genes in the type-1 cytokine pathway, especially in IFNGR1 and IL12RB1. Here, we analyzed 11 patients originating from Turkey and suffering from unusual Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guerin infections following vaccination, and found that most patients (n=8) are deficient in IL-12Rbeta1 expression and function. No defects were found in patients' IFN-gammaR or IL-18R. In addition, a first patient suffering from partial IL-12Rbeta1 deficiency is described. This patient presented with an intermediate cellular and immunological phenotype: a consistent, low response to IL-12 was found, which could be further augmented by IL-18. Despite a lack of cell surface IL-12Rbeta1 expression, normal levels of intracellular IL-12Rbeta1 protein were detectable, which was not seen in the other, completely IL-12Rbeta1 deficient patients examined. Moreover, this patient had a relatively mild clinical phenotype and was the only individual with a single homozygous amino acid substitution in IL-12Rbeta1 (C198R). Collectively, our findings indicate that idiopathic, unusually severe infections due to M. bovis BCG can be caused by complete as well as partial IL-12Rbeta1 deficiency. 	Eur._J._Immunol.

26457809	20151013	Subgroups of Paediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Might Differ Significantly in Genetic Predisposition to Asparaginase Hypersensitivity.	L-asparaginase (ASP) is a key element in the treatment of paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). However, hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) to ASP are major challenges in paediatric patients. Our aim was to investigate genetic variants that may influence the risk to Escherichia coli-derived ASP hypersensitivity. Sample and clinical data collection was carried out from 576 paediatric ALL patients who were treated according to protocols from the Berlin-Frankfurt-M?nster Study Group. A total of 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GRIA1 and GALNT10 genes were genotyped. Patients with GRIA1 rs4958351 AA/AG genotype showed significantly reduced risk to ASP hypersensitivity compared to patients with GG genotype in the T-cell ALL subgroup (OR = 0.05 (0.01-0.26); p = 4.70E-04), while no such association was found in pre-B-cell ALL. In the medium risk group two SNPs of GRIA1 (rs2055083 and rs707176) were associated significantly with the occurrence of ASP hypersensitivity (OR = 0.21 (0.09-0.53); p = 8.48E-04 and OR = 3.02 (1.36-6.73); p = 6.76E-03, respectively). Evaluating the genders separately, however, the association of rs707176 with ASP HSRs was confined only to females. Our results suggest that genetic variants of GRIA1 might influence the risk to ASP hypersensitivity, but subgroups of patients can differ significantly in this respect. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
25765448	20150314	[Turner syndrome and genetic polymorphism: a systematic review].	To present the main results of the literature on genetic polymorphisms in Turner Syndrome and their association with the clinical signs and the etiology of this chromosomal disorder. The review was conducted in the PubMed database without any time limit, using the terms Turner syndrome and genetic polymorphism. A total of 116 articles were found, and based on the established inclusion and exclusion criteria 17 were selected for the review. The polymorphisms investigated in patients with Turner Syndrome were associated with growth deficit, causing short stature, low bone mineral density, autoimmunity and cardiac abnormalities, which are frequently found in patients with Turner Syndrome. The role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the etiology of Turner syndrome, i.e., in chromosomal nondisjunction, was also confirmed. Genetic polymorphisms appear to be associated with Turner Syndrome. However, in view of the small number of published studies and their contradictory findings, further studies in different populations are needed in order to clarify the role of genetic variants in the clinical signs and etiology of the Turner Syndrome.

10690392	20000226	BRCA2 germ-line mutations in Spanish male breast cancer patients.	Mutations in the BRCA2 gene account for the majority of the families with male and female breast cancer cases, and a number of BRCA2 mutations have been reported in males with breast cancer. The aim of this study was to characterise BRCA2 germ-line mutations in Spanish male breast cancer patients. We screened DNA from 11 affected men and 6 women with breast cancer (BC) who had an affected male relative (father or brother). Exons 2-9 and 12-27 were screened by SSCP, and exons 10 and 11 were screened by PTT. PCR products with a variant band were sequenced. Three BRCA2 frameshift mutations were identified (17.6%): the 3374delA in codon 1049 (exon 11), 6857delAA in codon 2010 (exon 11), and 9254delATCAT in codon 3009 (exon 23). These mutations were present in patients with affected first-degree relatives (3 of 9, 33%). The proportion of male patients with a family history of BC in at least one first-degree relative was 53%. There is an association between BRCA2 mutations and male breast cancer, especially in those with a family history of BC. The high prevalence of BRCA2 mutations among males should be considered when estimating risk for female relatives. All new male cases of BC should be regarded as being possibly inherited and should be fully investigated. 	Ann._Oncol.	D016428 D013485
22003382	20111018	Adenovirus gene transfer to amelogenesis imperfecta ameloblast-like cells.	To explore gene therapy strategies for amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), a human ameloblast-like cell population was established from third molars of an AI-affected patient. These cells were characterized by expression of cytokeratin 14, major enamel proteins and alkaline phosphatase staining. Suboptimal transduction of the ameloblast-like cells by an adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vector was consistent with lower levels of the coxsackie-and-adenovirus receptor (CAR) on those cells relative to CAR-positive A549 cells. To overcome CAR -deficiency, we evaluated capsid-modified Ad5 vectors with various genetic capsid modifications including &quot;pK7&quot; and/or &quot;RGD&quot; motif-containing short peptides incorporated in the capsid protein fiber as well as fiber chimera with the Ad serotype 3 (Ad3) fiber &quot;knob&quot; domain. All fiber modifications provided an augmented transduction of AI-ameloblasts, revealed following vector dose normalization in A549 cells with a superior effect (up to 404-fold) of pK7/RGD double modification. This robust infectivity enhancement occurred through vector binding to both ?(v)?3/?(v)?5 integrins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) highly expressed by AI-ameloblasts as revealed by gene transfer blocking experiments. This work thus not only pioneers establishment of human AI ameloblast-like cell population as a model for in vitro studies but also reveals an optimal infectivity-enhancement strategy for a potential Ad5 vector-mediated gene therapy for AI.

25175365	20140902	Cell and matrix modulation in prenatal and postnatal equine growth cartilage, zones of Ranvier and articular cartilage.	Formation of synovial joints includes phenotypic changes of the chondrocytes and the organisation of their extracellular matrix is regulated by different factors and signalling pathways. Increased knowledge of the normal processes involved in joint development may be used to identify similar regulatory mechanisms during pathological conditions in the joint. Samples of the distal radius were collected from prenatal and postnatal equine growth plates, zones of Ranvier and articular cartilage with the aim of identifying Notch signalling components and cells with stem cell-like characteristics and to follow changes in matrix protein localisation during joint development. The localisation of the Notch signalling components Notch1, Delta4, Hes1, Notch dysregulating protein epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7), the stem cell-indicating factor Stro-1 and the matrix molecules cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), fibromodulin, matrilin-1 and chondroadherin were studied using immunohistochemistry. Spatial changes in protein localisations during cartilage maturation were observed for Notch signalling components and matrix molecules, with increased pericellular localisation indicating new synthesis and involvement of these proteins in the formation of the joint. However, it was not possible to characterise the phenotype of the chondrocytes based on their surrounding matrix during normal chondrogenesis. The zone of Ranvier was identified in all horses and characterised as an area expressing Stro-1, EGFL7 and chondroadherin with an absence of COMP and Notch signalling. Stro-1 was also present in cells close to the perichondrium, in the articular cartilage and in the fetal resting zone, indicating stem cell-like characteristics of these cells. The presence of stem cells in the articular cartilage will be of importance for the repair of damaged cartilage. Perivascular chondrocytes and hypertrophic cells of the cartilage bone interface displayed positive staining for EGFL7, which is a novel finding and suggests a role of EGFL7 in the vascular infiltration of growth cartilage.

26195629	20150722	A Role for Autoinhibition in Preventing Dimerization of the Transcription Factor ETS1.	ETS1 is the archetype of the ETS transcription factor (TF) family. ETS TFs share a DNA-binding domain, the ETS domain. All ETS TFs recognize a core GGA(A/T) binding site, and thus ETS TFs are found to redundantly regulate the same genes. However, each ETS TF has unique targets as well. One prevailing hypotheses explaining this duality is that protein-protein interactions, including homodimerization, allow each ETS TF to display distinct behavior. The behavior of ETS1 is further regulated by autoinhibition. Autoinhibition apparently modulates ETS1 DNA binding affinity, but the mechanism of this inhibition is not completely understood. We sought to characterize the relationship between DNA binding and ETS1 homodimer formation. We find that ETS1 interrogates DNA and forms dimers even when the DNA does not contain an ETS recognition sequence. Mutational studies also link nonspecific DNA backbone contacts with dimer formation, in addition to providing a new role for the recognition helix of ETS1 in maintaining the autoinhibited state. Finally, in showing that residues in the DNA recognition helix affect autoinhibition, we define a new function of ETS1 autoinhibition: maintenance of a monomeric state in the absence of DNA. The conservation of relevant amino acid residues across all ETS TFs indicates that the mechanisms of nonspecific DNA interrogation and protein oligomer formation elucidated here may be common to all ETS proteins that autoinhibit.

26209438	20150726	Elevated C1orf63 expression is correlated with CDK10 and predicts better outcome for advanced breast cancers: a retrospective study.	Chromosome 1 open reading frame 63 (C1orf63) is located on the distal short arm of chromosome 1, whose allelic loss has been observed in several human cancers. C1orf63 has been reported to be up-regulated in IL-2-starved T lymphocytes, which suggests it might be involved in cell cycle control, a common mechanism for carcinogenesis. Here we investigated the expression and clinical implication of C1orf63 in breast cancer. Paraffin-embedded specimens, clinicopathological features and follow-up data of the breast cancer patients were collected. Publicly available microarray and RNA-seq datasets used in this study were downloaded from ArrayExpress of EBI and GEO of NCBI. KM plotter tool was also adopted. The expression of C1orf63 and CDK10, one known cell cycle-dependent tumor suppressor in breast cancer, was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Western blotting was performed to detect C1orf63 protein in human breast cancer cell lines, purchased from the Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai. In a group of 12 human breast tumors and their matched adjacent non-cancerous tissues, C1orf63 expression was observed in 7 of the 12 breast tumors, but not in the 12 adjacent non-cancerous tissues (P &lt; 0.001). Similar results were observed of C1orf63 mRNA expression both in breast cancer and several other cancers, including lung cancer, prostate cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. In another group of 182 breast cancer patients, C1orf63 expression in tumors was not correlated with any clinicopathological features collected in this study. Survival analyses showed that there was no significant difference of overall survival (OS) rates between the C1orf63 (+) group and the C1orf63 (-) group (P = 0.145). However, the analyses of KM plotter displayed a valid relationship between C1orf63 and RFS (relapse free survival)/OS (P &lt; 0.001; P = 0.007). Notablely, in breast cancers with advanced TNM stages (III ~ IV) among these 182 patients, C1orf63 expression was an independent prognostic factor predicting better clinical outcome (HR: 0.41; 95 % CI: 0.17 ~ 0.97; P = 0.042). Additionally, we found that CDK10 mRNA expression was positively correlated with C1orf63, which was consistent with the relationship of protein expression between C1orf63 and CDK10 (r s = 0.391; P &lt; 0.001). Compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues, C1orf63 expression was elevated in tumor tissues. However, C1orf63 predicts better prognosis for breast cancers with advanced TNM stage, and the underlying mechanism is unknown. In addition, C1orf63 is correlated with the cell cycle related gene, CDK10. 	BMC_Cancer	D016428 D013485
28248218	20170302	Staphylococcus aureus</i>Proteome Overview: Shared and Specific Proteins and Protein Complexes from Representative Strains of All Three Clades.	 Staphylococcus aureus is an important model organism and pathogen. ThisS. aureusproteome overview details shared and specific proteins and selected virulence-relevant protein complexes from representative strains of all three major clades. To determine the strain distribution and major clades we used a refined strain comparison combining ribosomal RNA, MLST markers, and looking at highly-conserved regions shared between strains. This analysis shows three sub-clades (A-C) forS. aureus. As calculations are complex and strain annotation is quite time consuming we compare here key representatives of each clade with each other: model strains COL, USA300, Newman, and HG001 (clade A), model strain N315 and Mu50 (clade B) and ED133 and MRSA252 (clade C). We look at these individual proteomes and compare them to a background of 64S. aureusstrains. There are overall 13,284S. aureusproteins not part of the core proteome which are involved in different strain-specific or more general complexes requiring detailed annotation and new experimental data to be accurately delineated. By comparison of the eight representative strains, we identify strain-specific proteins (e.g., 18 in COL, 105 in N315 and 44 in Newman) that characterize each strain and analyze pathogenicity islands if they contain such strain-specific proteins. We identify strain-specific protein repertoires involved in virulence, in cell wall metabolism, and phosphorylation. Finally we compare and analyze protein complexes conserved and well-characterized amongS. aureus(a total of 103 complexes), as well as predict and analyze several individual protein complexes, including structure modeling in the three clades.

8326494	19930601	Frequency of delta F508 in a Mexican sample of cystic fibrosis patients.	This paper reports the frequency of the delta F508 mutation in a cohort of 50 Mexican patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The mutation was detected by PCR mediated site directed mutagenesis. delta F508 was found in 39% of CF chromosomes, a frequency lower than that reported in Argentina and Spain. The high rate of CF cases who die undiagnosed, the ethnic origin of Mexican populations, and the limited number of cases studied could account for the low frequency of the delta F508 mutation found in this preliminary report.

21103881	20101125	Intraventricular migration of the bone dust. Is a second operation for removal necessary? Case report and review of the literature.	As the number of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (E3V) operations increase, new rare complications are encountered. In this article, a complication caused by bone particles that migrated into the third ventricle will be described. Additionally, the methods of avoidance as well as the necessity of a new approach will be discussed. After the video images of the first and second operations of a patient who was subjected to E3V twice were compared, it was discovered that one of the bone particles within the ventricle had occluded the ostium after the second operation. Most of the bones were removed and their pathological investigations were performed. Video images of the patient, surgical observations of the second operation, emergence of the time of dysfunction, and other similar cases in the literature were assessed, and it was concluded that the bones that localized intraventricularly were living tissues. Abandoning usage of bone dust for sealing burr holes is a solution to avoid this complication. In addition, it should be kept in mind that intraventricular bone particles might grow and lead to obstructions. If such particles are detected, removal of the bones in certain locations before formation of neovascularization can be an option. 	Childs_Nerv_Syst	D002363 D016428 D016454
24223829	20131114	The role of individual domains and the significance of shedding of ATP6AP2/(pro)renin receptor in vacuolar H(+)-ATPase biogenesis.	The ATPase 6 accessory protein 2 (ATP6AP2)/(pro)renin receptor (PRR) is essential for the biogenesis of active vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase). Genetic deletion of ATP6AP2/PRR causes V-ATPase dysfunction and compromises vesicular acidification. Here, we characterized the domains of ATP6AP2/PRR involved in active V-ATPase biogenesis. Three forms of ATP6AP2/PRR were found intracellularly: full-length protein and the N- and C-terminal fragments of furin cleavage products, with the N-terminal fragment secreted extracellularly. Genetic deletion of ATP6AP2/PRR did not affect the protein stability of V-ATPase subunits. The extracellular domain (ECD) and transmembrane domain (TM) of ATP6AP2/PRR were indispensable for the biogenesis of active V-ATPase. A deletion mutant of ATP6AP2/PRR, which lacks exon 4-encoded amino acids inside the ECD (?4M) and causes X-linked mental retardation Hedera type (MRXSH) and X-linked parkinsonism with spasticity (XPDS) in humans, was defective as a V-ATPase-associated protein. Prorenin had no effect on the biogenesis of active V-ATPase. The cleavage of ATP6AP2/PRR by furin seemed also dispensable for the biogenesis of active V-ATPase. We conclude that the N-terminal ECD of ATP6AP2/PRR, which is also involved in binding to prorenin or renin, is required for the biogenesis of active V-ATPase. The V-ATPase assembly occurs prior to its delivery to the trans-Golgi network and hence shedding of ATP6AP2/PRR would not affect the biogenesis of active V-ATPase. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
21256059	20110125	Glucocerebrosidase gene has an alternative upstream promoter, which has features and expression characteristic of housekeeping genes.	Database searches have shown that a part of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) transcripts may originate at an alternative upstream promoter (P2) located 2.6 kb upstream of the known (P1) GBA promoter. The putative alternative transcripts contained one or two extra exons (exon -2 or exons -2, -1, respectively), but the first ATG codon and predicted amino-acid sequence are the same as in the transcript from P1. Luciferase assays confirmed promoter activity of both sites in HepG2 cells: the P1 construct exhibited the highest activity of luciferase (17.82?1.10 relative luciferase units), while the P2 construct reached 3.01?0.43 relative luciferase units. Serial 5' deletions of P2 led to changes in reporter activity, the most prominent decreases were observed in deletion constructs carrying bases -353 to -658, and -353 to -920 (numbered as in NM_001005750.1), respectively. This suggests that the P2 core promoter is contained within the region of -920bp to -1311bp. Three P2 transcription initiation sites were found by 5' RACE at positions 347, 380, and 413bp upstream of the +1 ATG. The expression stability of transcripts from P2, P1 was studied in 20 human tissues and was higher than that of GAPDH and ACTB, which are commonly used as reference housekeeping genes. The P2 contains an unmethylated CpG island, multiple Sp-1 consensus binding sites and, unlike P1, does not contain a TATA box, features all common to the majority of housekeeping gene promoters. We have examined DNA samples from a phenotypically diverse group of twenty Ashkenazi Jewish Gaucher patients homozygous for the common mild mutation N370S. Both P1 and P2, as well as exons -2 and -1, did not contain any sequence variations, with the exception of the known polymorphism rs10908459 found on one allele. The phenotypical differences in the patients were thus not explained by nucleotide variations in both promoters. 	Blood_Cells_Mol._Dis.	D016428 D013485
23754852	20130612	Structure-function analysis of the 5' end of yeast U1 snRNA highlights genetic interactions with the Msl5*Mud2 branchpoint-binding complex and other spliceosome assembly factors.	Yeast pre-mRNA splicing initiates via formation of a complex comprising U1 snRNP bound at the 5' splice site (5'SS) and the Msl5?Mud2 heterodimer engaged at the branchpoint (BP). Here, we present a mutational analysis of the U1 snRNA, which shows that although enlarging the 5' leader between the TMG cap and the (3)ACUUAC(8) motif that anneals to the 5'SS is tolerated, there are tight constraints on the downstream spacer between (3)ACUUAC(8) and helix 1 of the U1 fold. We exploit U1 alleles with 5' extensions, variations in the (3)ACUUAC(8) motif, downstream mutations and a longer helix 1 to discover new intra-snRNP synergies with U1 subunits Nam8 and Mud1 and the trimethylguanosine (TMG) cap. We describe novel mutations in U1 snRNA that bypass the essentiality of the DEAD-box protein Prp28. Structure-guided mutagenesis of Msl5 distinguished four essential amino acids that contact the BP sequence from nine other BP-binding residues that are inessential. We report new synthetic genetic interactions of the U1 snRNP with Msl5 and Mud2 and with the nuclear cap-binding subunit Cbc2. Our results fortify the idea that spliceosome assembly can occur via distinct genetically buffered microscopic pathways involving cross-intron-bridging interactions of the U1 snRNP?5'SS complex with the Mud2?Msl5?BP complex.

22786669	20120713	A novel ZRS mutation in a Balochi tribal family with triphalangeal thumb, pre-axial polydactyly, post-axial polydactyly, and syndactyly.	Limb malformations are one of the most common types of human congenital malformations. Mutations in the ZRS enhancer of Sonic Hedgehog are thought to be responsible for pre-axial polydactyly in multiple independent families. Here, we describe a large Balochi tribal family from Southern Punjab, Pakistan, with a variable set of limb malformations and a novel ZRS mutation. The family has a limb phenotype characterized by triphalangeal thumb, pre-axial polydactyly, and post-axial polydactyly. There is also a high degree of phenotypic heterogeneity with less common clinical findings in the affected family members that include osseous syndactyly of forth-fifth fingers, clinodactyly, hypoplasia of mesoaxial fingers, and bifid halluces. The presentation in most of the affected patients was bilateral and symmetrical. A heterozygous C&gt;A mutation at position 287 of the ZRS enhancer (chr7:156,584,283; hg19) was detected in all affected subjects and is absent from four unaffected family members, 42 unrelated samples, and multiple databases of human variation. Combined, these results identify a novel ZRS287 C&gt;A mutation which leads to a variable spectrum of limb phenotypes. 	Am._J._Med._Genet._A	D016428 D052061 D013485
2548486	19890615	Overexpression and site-directed mutagenesis of the succinyl-CoA synthetase of Escherichia coli and nucleotide sequence of a gene (g30) that is adjacent to the suc operon.	The succinyl-CoA synthetase of Escherichia coli is encoded by two genes, sucC (beta subunit) and sucD (alpha subunit), which are distal genes in the sucABCD operon. They are expressed from the suc promoter, which also expresses the dehydrogenase and dihydrolipoyl succinyl-transferase subunits of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. Strategies have now been devised for the site-directed mutagenesis and independent expression of the succinyl-CoA synthetase (alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer) and the individual subunits. These involve (1) subcloning a promoterless sucCD fragment downstream of the lac promoter in M13mp10, and (2) precise splicing of the suc coding regions with the efficient atpE ribosome-binding site and expression from the thermoinducible lambda promoters in the pJLA503 vector. Succinyl-CoA synthetase specific activities were amplified 40-60-fold within 5 h of thermoinduction of the lambda promoters, and the alpha and beta subunits accounted for almost 30% of the protein in supernatant fractions of the cell-free extracts. Site-directed mutagenesis of potential CoA binding-site residues indicated that Trp-43 beta and His-50 beta are essential residues in the beta-subunit, whereas Cys-47 beta could be replaced by serine without inactivating the enzyme. No activity was detected after the histidine residue at the phosphorylation site of the alpha-subunit was replaced by aspartate (His-246 alpha----Asp), but this alteration seemed to have a deleterious effect on the accumulation of the enzyme in cell-free supernatant extracts. The nucleotide sequence of an unidentified gene (g30) that is adjacent to the sucABCD operon was defined by extending the sequence of the citric acid cycle gene cluster by 818 bp to 13379 bp: gltA-sdhCDAB-sucABCD-g30. This gene converges on the suc operon and encodes a product (P30) that contains 230 amino acids (Mr 27,251). Highly significant similarities were detected between the N-terminal region of P30 and those of GENA [the product of another unidentified gene (geneA) located upstream of the aceEF-lpd operon], and GNTR (a putative transcriptional repressor of the gluconate operon of Bacillus subtilis). Possible roles for GENA and P30 as transcriptional regulators of the adjacent operons encoding the pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes are discussed. 	Biochem._J.	D016428 D013485
12678157	20030408	Mutation of the Notch 3 gene in a Thai cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy family.	The authors report the first Thai family with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) in which the family members had a classical history of progressive vascular dementia. The proband was a 31-year old Thai male who presented with an acute stroke in the subcortical region. His past history revealed mental disturbance, including poor judgement and regressive behavior as well as mood changes for 1 year. He did not have a history of migraine or any other vascular risk factors except for a strong family history of ischemic stroke and progressive dementia. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated multiple small infarctions in the subcortical white matter of the bilateral frontal, parietal and occipital lobes with another small lesion in the pons. Genetic study demonstrated a Notch 3 mutation consisting of the substitution of a nucleotide at position 406 in exon 3 leading to the replacement of an Arginine by Cysteine at position 110 in the 2nd EGF motif, which is compatable with CADASIL.

21187377	20101229	Vibrio cholerae anaerobic induction of virulence gene expression is controlled by thiol-based switches of virulence regulator AphB.	Bacterial pathogens have evolved sophisticated signal transduction systems to coordinately control the expression of virulence determinants. For example, the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae is able to respond to host environmental signals by activating transcriptional regulatory cascades. The host signals that stimulate V. cholerae virulence gene expression, however, are still poorly understood. Previous proteomic studies indicated that the ambient oxygen concentration plays a role in V. cholerae virulence gene expression. In this study, we found that under oxygen-limiting conditions, an environment similar to the intestines, V. cholerae virulence genes are highly expressed. We show that anaerobiosis enhances dimerization and activity of AphB, a transcriptional activator that is required for the expression of the key virulence regulator TcpP, which leads to the activation of virulence factor production. We further show that one of the three cysteine residues in AphB, C(235), is critical for oxygen responsiveness, as the AphB(C235S) mutant can activate virulence genes under aerobic conditions in vivo and can bind to tcpP promoters in the absence of reducing agents in vitro. Mass spectrometry analysis suggests that under aerobic conditions, AphB is modified at the C(235) residue. This modification is reversible between oxygen-rich aquatic environments and oxygen-limited human hosts, suggesting that V. cholerae may use a thiol-based switch mechanism to sense intestinal signals and activate virulence.

15167645	20040529	High occurrence of simultaneous mutations in target enzymes and MtrRCDE efflux system in quinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae.	Emergence of multidrug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae resulting from new genetic mutations is a serious threat to controlling gonorrhea. To determine 1) antimicrobial susceptibilities and the corresponding genetic mutations and 2) the role of MtrRCDE efflux system in gonococcal resistance to fluoroquinolones. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and sequence analysis of gyrA, parC, and mtrR loci of 131 N. gonorrhoeae isolates from Japan. The proportion of N. gonorrhoeae strains resistant and intermediate-resistant to antimicrobials was 25.2% and 48.9% for ciprofloxacin, 25.2% and 30.5% for ofloxacin, 12.2% and 53.4% for penicillin; and 17.6% and 51.1% for tetracycline, respectively. Strains were categorized into 22 mutation profiles, with GyrA-S91F/ParC-D86N/MtrR-G45D being the most predominant profile. The frequency of mutation in gyrA, parC, mtrR, and the mtrR promoter was 71%, 47.3%, 77.1%, and 23.7%, respectively. Seventy-one percent of strains carried mutations in both gyrA and mtrR. This study reports simultaneous mutations in fluoroquinolone target enzymes and the MtrRCDE efflux system as a fluoroquinolone-resistant mechanism in N. gonorrhoeae. 	Sex_Transm_Dis	D016428 D013485
18654629	20080726	The insulator binding protein CTCF positions 20 nucleosomes around its binding sites across the human genome.	Chromatin structure plays an important role in modulating the accessibility of genomic DNA to regulatory proteins in eukaryotic cells. We performed an integrative analysis on dozens of recent datasets generated by deep-sequencing and high-density tiling arrays, and we discovered an array of well-positioned nucleosomes flanking sites occupied by the insulator binding protein CTCF across the human genome. These nucleosomes are highly enriched for the histone variant H2A.Z and 11 histone modifications. The distances between the center positions of the neighboring nucleosomes are largely invariant, and we estimate them to be 185 bp on average. Surprisingly, subsets of nucleosomes that are enriched in different histone modifications vary greatly in the lengths of DNA protected from micrococcal nuclease cleavage (106-164 bp). The nucleosomes enriched in those histone modifications previously implicated to be correlated with active transcription tend to contain less protected DNA, indicating that these modifications are correlated with greater DNA accessibility. Another striking result obtained from our analysis is that nucleosomes flanking CTCF sites are much better positioned than those downstream of transcription start sites, the only genomic feature previously known to position nucleosomes genome-wide. This nucleosome-positioning phenomenon is not observed for other transcriptional factors for which we had genome-wide binding data. We suggest that binding of CTCF provides an anchor point for positioning nucleosomes, and chromatin remodeling is an important component of CTCF function. 	PLoS_Genet.	D016428 D052061
26704566	20151226	Decreased sensitivity to aspirin is associated with altered polyamine metabolism in human prostate cancer cells.	Aspirin is a well-known analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic drug and is recognised as a chemopreventative agent in cardiovascular disease and, more recently, in colorectal cancer. Although several studies indicate that aspirin is capable of reducing the risk of developing cancers, there is a lack of convincing evidence that aspirin can prevent prostate cancer in man. In this study, aspirin was shown to be an effective inhibitor of the growth of human prostate cancer cells. In order to investigate the link between polyamine catabolism and the effects of aspirin we used a &quot;Tet off&quot; system that induced the activity of spermidine/spermine N (1)-acetyltransferase (SSAT) in human prostate cancer cells (LNCap). Treatment with aspirin was found to decrease induced SSAT activity in these cells. A negative correlation was observed between increased polyamine catabolism via increased SSAT activity and the sensitivity to aspirin. In the presence of increased SSAT activity high amounts of N (1)-acetylspermidine and putrescine were observed. These cells were also found to grow more slowly than the non-induced cells. The results indicate that SSAT and its related polyamine metabolism may play a key role in sensitivity of cancer cells to aspirin and possibly other NSAIDs and this may have implications for the development of novel chemopreventative agents.

23909632	20130806	The spatial QRS-T angle: implications in clinical practice.	The ventricular gradient (VG) as a concept was conceived in the 1930s and its calculation yielded information that was not otherwise obtainable. The VG was not utilized by clinicians at large because it was not easy to understand and its computation time-consuming. The contemporary spatial QRS-T angle is based on the concept of the VG and defined as its mathematical and physiological integral. Its current major clinical use is to assess the cardiac primary repolarization abnormalities in 3-dimensional spatial vectorial plans which are normally untraced in the presence of secondary electrophysiological activity in a 2-dimensional routine electrocardiogram (ECG). Currently the calculation of the spatial QRS-T angle can be easily computed on the basis of a classical ECG and contributes to localization of arrhythmogenic areas in the heart by assessing overall and local heterogeneity of the myocardial ventricular action potention duration. Recent population-based studies suggest that the spatial QRS-T angle is a dominant ECG predictor of future cardiovascular events and death and it is superior to more conventional ECG parameters. Its assessment warrants consideration for intensified primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention efforts and should be included in everyday clinical practice. This review addresses the nature and diagnostic potential of the spatial QRS-T angle. The main focus is its role in ECG assessment of dispersion of repolarization, a key factor in arrythmogeneity.

22618666	20120524	Association between HRAS rs12628 and rs112587690 polymorphisms with the risk of melanoma in the North American population.	HRAS belongs to the RAS genes superfamily. RAS genes are important players in several human tumors and the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs12628 has been shown to contribute to the risk of bladder, colon, gastrointestinal, oral, and thyroid carcinoma. We hypothesized that this SNP may affect the risk of cutaneous melanoma as well. HRAS gene contains a polymorphic region (rs112587690), a repeated hexanucleotide -GGGCCT- located in intron 1. Three alleles of this region, P1, P2, and P3, have been identified that contain two, three, and four repeats of the hexanucleotide, respectively. We investigated the clinical impact of these polymorphisms in a case-control study. A total of 141 melanoma patients and 118 healthy donors from the North America Caucasian population were screened for rs12628 and rs112587690 polymorphisms. Genotypes were assessed by capillary sequencing or fragment analysis, respectively, and rs12628 CC and rs112587690 P1P1 genotypes significantly associated with increased melanoma risk (OR = 3.83, p = 0.003; OR = 11.3, p = 0.033, respectively), while rs112587690 P1P3 frequency resulted significantly higher in the control group (OR = 0.5, p = 0.017). These results suggest that rs12628 C homozygosis may be considered a potential risk factor for melanoma development in the North American population possibly through the linkage to rs112587690.

19396172	20090428	Structure of the RAG1 nonamer binding domain with DNA reveals a dimer that mediates DNA synapsis.	The products of recombination-activating genes RAG1 and RAG2 mediate the assembly of antigen receptor genes during lymphocyte development in a process known as V(D)J recombination. Lack of structural information for the RAG proteins has hindered mechanistic studies of this reaction. We report here the crystal structure of an essential DNA binding domain of the RAG1 catalytic core bound to its nonamer DNA recognition motif. The RAG1 nonamer binding domain (NBD) forms a tightly interwoven dimer that binds and synapses two nonamer elements, with each NBD making contact with both DNA molecules. Biochemical and biophysical experiments confirm that the two nonamers are in close proximity in the RAG1/2-DNA synaptic complex and demonstrate the functional importance of the protein-DNA contacts revealed in the structure. These findings reveal a previously unsuspected function for the NBD in DNA synapsis and have implications for the regulation of DNA binding and cleavage by RAG1 and RAG2. 	Nat._Struct._Mol._Biol.

23285234	20130104	Nuclear import of UBL-domain protein Mdy2 is required for heat-induced stress response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	Ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like (UBL) proteins regulate a diverse array of cellular pathways through covalent as well as non-covalent interactions with target proteins. Yeast protein Mdy2 (Get5) and its human homolog GdX (Ubl4a) belong to the class of UBL proteins which do not form conjugates with other proteins. Mdy2 is required for cell survival under heat stress and for efficient mating. As part of a complex with Sgt2 and Get4 it has been implicated in the biogenesis of tail-anchored proteins. Interestingly, in response to heat stress, Mdy2 protein that is predominantly localized in the nucleus co-localized with poly(A)-binding protein Pab1 to cytoplasmic stress granules suggesting that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is of functional importance. Here we investigate the nuclear import of Mdy2, a process that is independent of the Get4/Sgt2 complex but required for stress response. Nuclear import is mediated by an N-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS) and this process is essential for the heat stress response. In contrast, cells expressing Mdy2 lacking a nuclear export signal (NES) behave like wild type. Importantly, both Mdy2 and Mdy2-?NES, but not Mdy2-?NLS, physically interact with Pab1 and this interaction correlates with the accumulation in cytoplasmic stress granules. Thus, the nuclear history of the UBL Mdy2 appears to be essential for its function in cytoplasmic stress granules during the rapid cellular response to heat stress. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428
3032940	19870425	Crystal structure of a cyclic AMP-independent mutant of catabolite gene activator protein.	Escherichia coli NCR91 synthesizes a mutant form of catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) in which alanine 144 is replaced by threonine. This mutant, which also lacks adenylate cyclase activity, has a CAP phenotype; in the absence of cAMP it is able to express genes that normally require cAMP. CAP91 has been purified and crystallized with cAMP under the same conditions as used to crystallize the wild type CAP X cAMP complex. X-ray diffraction data were measured to 2.4-A resolution and the CAP91 structure was determined using initial model phases from the wild type structure. A difference Fourier map calculated between CAP91 and wild type showed the 2 alanine to threonine sequence changes in the dimer and also a change in orientation of cysteine 178 in one of the subunits. The CAP91 coordinates were refined by restrained least squares to an R factor of 0.186. Differences in the atomic positions of the wild type and mutant protein structures were analyzed by a vector averaging technique. There were small changes that included concerted motions in the small domains, in the hinge between the two domains and in an adjacent loop between beta-strands 4 and 5. The mutation at residue 144 apparently causes changes in the position of some protein atoms that are distal to the mutation site. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428
27429737	20160729	DOCLASP - Docking ligands to target proteins using spatial and electrostatic congruence extracted from a known holoenzyme and applying simple geometrical transformations.	The ability to accurately and effectively predict the interaction between proteins and small drug-like compounds has long intrigued researchers for pedagogic, humanitarian and economic reasons. Protein docking methods (AutoDock, GOLD, DOCK, FlexX and Glide to name a few) rank a large number of possible conformations of protein-ligand complexes using fast algorithms. Previously, it has been shown that structural congruence leading to the same enzymatic function necessitates the congruence of electrostatic properties (CLASP). The current work presents a methodology for docking a ligand into a target protein, provided that there is at least one known holoenzyme with ligand bound - DOCLASP (Docking using CLASP). The contact points of the ligand in the holoenzyme defines a motif, which is used to query the target enzyme using CLASP.?If there are significant matches, the holoenzyme?and the target protein are superimposed based on congruent atoms. The same linear and rotational transformations are also applied to the ligand, thus creating a unified coordinate framework having the holoenzyme, the ligand and the target enzyme. In the current work, the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitor vildagliptin was docked to the PI-PLC structure complexed with myo-inositol using DOCLASP. Also, corroboration of the docking of phenylthiourea to the modelled structure of polyphenol oxidase (JrPPO1) from walnut is provided based on the subsequently solved structure of JrPPO1 (PDBid:5CE9). Analysis of the binding of the antitrypanosomial drug suramin to nine non-homologous proteins in the PDB database shows a diverse set of binding motifs, and multiple binding sites in the phospholipase A2-likeproteins from the Bothrops genus of pitvipers. The conformational changes in the suramin molecule on binding highlights the challenges in docking flexible ligands into an already 'plastic' binding site. Thus, DOCLASP presents a method for 'soft docking' ligands to proteins with low computational requirements. 	F1000Res	D016428
23401703	20130213	Monocyte signal transduction receptors in active and latent tuberculosis.	The mechanisms that promote either resistance or susceptibility to TB disease remain insufficiently understood. Our aim was to compare the expression of cell signaling transduction receptors, CD14, TLR2, CD206, and ?2 integrin LFA-1 on monocytes from patients with active TB or nonmycobacterial lung disease and healthy individuals with M.tb latency and uninfected controls to explain the background of the differences between clinical and subclinical forms of M.tb infection. A simultaneous increase in the expression of the membrane bound mCD14 receptor and LFA-1 integrin in patients with active TB may be considered a prodrome of breaking immune control by M.tb bacilli in subjects with the latent TB and absence of clinical symptoms.

23269243	20121228	Identification of SERPINB1 as a physiological inhibitor of human granzyme H.	The granzyme/perforin pathway is a major mechanism for cytotoxic lymphocytes to eliminate virus-infected and tumor cells. The balance between activation and inhibition of the proteolytic cascade must be tightly controlled to avoid self damage. Granzyme H (GzmH) is constitutively expressed in NK cells and induces target cell death; however, how GzmH activity is regulated remains elusive. We reported earlier the crystal structures of inactive D102N-GzmH alone and in complex with its synthetic substrate and inhibitor, as well as defined the mechanisms of substrate recognition and enzymatic activation. In this study, we identified SERPINB1 as a potent intracellular inhibitor for GzmH. Upon cleavage of the reactive center loop at Phe(343), SERPINB1 forms an SDS-stable covalent complex with GzmH. SERPINB1 overexpression suppresses GzmH- or LAK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. We determined the crystal structures of active GzmH and SERPINB1 (LM-DD mutant) in the native conformation to 3.0- and 2.9-? resolution, respectively. Molecular modeling reveals the possible conformational changes in GzmH for the suicide inhibition. Our findings provide new insights into the inhibitory mechanism of SERPINB1 against human GzmH.

1698947	19901001	Projection subtypes of rat neostriatal matrix cells revealed by intracellular injection of biocytin.	Individual neostriatal-matrix spiny neurons were stained intracellularly with biocytin after intracellular recording in vivo, and their axons were traced into the globus pallidus (GP), entopeduncular nucleus (EP), and/or substantia nigra (SN). The locations of the neurons within the matrix compartment of the neostriatum (NS) were established by immunocytochemical counterstaining of sections containing the cell bodies using antibodies for calbindin-D28K. This allowed nearly complete visualization of the axonal projections of single NS neurons. On the basis of their intrastriatal axonal arborizations, matrix spiny neurons could be divided into 2 types. One type, which was the more common, had local axonal arborizations restricted to the region of the dendritic field, often with axon collaterals arborizing within the dendritic field of the cells of origin. A second, less common, cell type in the matrix had local axon collaterals distributed widely in the NS. Among matrix neurons with restricted local collateral fields, 3 subtypes could be distinguished on the basis of their efferent axonal projections. Type I cells projected only to the GP. Type IIa cells projected to the GP, EP, and SN pars reticulata. Type IIb cells projected to the GP and SN but not to the EP. The shapes and densities of the GP arborizations varied in the 3 cell types, with the cells projecting only to the GP (type I) projecting more heavily and filling a larger volume there than type II cells. The dendrites and intrastriatal axon collaterals of 3 subtypes were similar in morphology. The class of matrix spiny neurons with intrastriatal axon collaterals distributed widely in the NS were observed to project to the GP. Projections beyond the GP were not identified for this cell type, but could not be ruled out. Somatodendritic morphologies of neurons did not differ according to the projection site. These results demonstrate that NS matrix spiny cells are more heterogeneous in their efferent projection patterns than previously suspected on the basis of retrograde axonal tracing and immunocytochemical studies. As predicted by those previous studies, there is a class of matrix neurons that projects only to the GP. Presumably, these cells contain enkephalin. Cells projecting to the SN and EP, and so presumably containing substance P, give off a small projection to the GP, as well, and differ in their collateralization patterns within the 3 major target nuclei.

3561211	19870301	[Qualitative characteristics of Soviet kits for the radioimmunological determination of cortisol and progesterone in human blood serum].	Radioimmunoassays and kits of reagents based on them CORT-I-3H,STERON-K-125I, STERON-P-3H and STERON-P-125I intended for medical microanalysis, were studied. Their development and serial production were undertaken in the Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, AS BSSR. The data obtained characterized the quality of the radioimmunoassays under study, long-term stability and reliability of the kits of reagents. A high specificity of antisera and correlation between the results of measurements and a degree of native blood serum dilution as well as the accuracy of the results obtained and sensitivity of the assays as a whole were demonstrated. The above properties of the radioimmunoassays made it possible to develop serial kits of reagents for determination of cortisol and progesterone concentration in the human blood serum, employed effectively in medical diagnosis of endocrine and other diseases. A long-term control over the reproducibility of parameters of calibration charts and the results of determination of the level of cortisol and progesterone in the pool blood serum of women showed a high reliability of the kits of reagents of different production lots within the time of their application observing instructions for use.

18426977	20080423	eIF4GI links nutrient sensing by mTOR to cell proliferation and inhibition of autophagy.	Translation initiation factors have complex functions in cells that are not yet understood. We show that depletion of initiation factor eIF4GI only modestly reduces overall protein synthesis in cells, but phenocopies nutrient starvation or inhibition of protein kinase mTOR, a key nutrient sensor. eIF4GI depletion impairs cell proliferation, bioenergetics, and mitochondrial activity, thereby promoting autophagy. Translation of mRNAs involved in cell growth, proliferation, and bioenergetics were selectively inhibited by reduction of eIF4GI, as was the mRNA encoding Skp2 that inhibits p27, whereas catabolic pathway factors were increased. Depletion or overexpression of other eIF4G family members did not recapitulate these results. The majority of mRNAs that were translationally impaired with eIF4GI depletion were excluded from polyribosomes due to the presence of multiple upstream open reading frames and low mRNA abundance. These results suggest that the high levels of eIF4GI observed in many breast cancers might act to specifically increase proliferation, prevent autophagy, and release tumor cells from control by nutrient sensing.

23630274	20130501	Reorganization of an intersubunit bridge induced by disparate 16S ribosomal ambiguity mutations mimics an EF-Tu-bound state.	After four decades of research aimed at understanding tRNA selection on the ribosome, the mechanism by which ribosomal ambiguity (ram) mutations promote miscoding remains unclear. Here, we present two X-ray crystal structures of the Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome containing 16S rRNA ram mutations, G347U and G299A. Each of these mutations causes miscoding in vivo and stimulates elongation factor thermo unstable (EF-Tu)-dependent GTP hydrolysis in vitro. Mutation G299A is located near the interface of ribosomal proteins S4 and S5 on the solvent side of the subunit, whereas G347U is located 77 ? distant, at intersubunit bridge B8, close to where EF-Tu engages the ribosome. Despite these disparate locations, both mutations induce almost identical structural rearrangements that disrupt the B8 bridge--namely, the interaction of h8/h14 with L14 and L19. This conformation most closely resembles that seen upon EF-Tu-GTP-aminoacyl-tRNA binding to the 70S ribosome. These data provide evidence that disruption and/or distortion of B8 is an important aspect of GTPase activation. We propose that, by destabilizing B8, G299A and G347U reduce the energetic cost of attaining the GTPase-activated state and thereby decrease the stringency of decoding. This previously unappreciated role for B8 in controlling the decoding process may hold relevance for many other ribosomal mutations known to influence translational fidelity.

17662135	20070731	A model of evolution with constant selective pressure for regulatory DNA sites.	Molecular evolution is usually described assuming a neutral or weakly non-neutral substitution model. Recently, new data have become available on evolution of sequence regions under a selective pressure, e.g. transcription factor binding sites. To reconstruct the evolutionary history of such sequences, one needs evolutionary models that take into account a substantial constant selective pressure. We present a simple evolutionary model with a single preferred (consensus) nucleotide and the neutral substitution model adopted for all other nucleotides. This evolutionary model has a rate matrix in which all substitutions that do not involve the consensus nucleotide occur with the same rate. The model has two time scales for achieving a stationary distribution; in the general case only one of the two rate parameters can be evaluated from the stationary distribution. In the middle-time zone, a counterintuitive behavior was observed for some parameter values, with a probability of conservation for a non-consensus nucleotide greater than that for the consensus nucleotide. Such an effect can be observed only in the case of weak preference for the consensus nucleotide, when the probability to observe the consensus nucleotide in the stationary distribution is less than 1/2. If the substitution rate is represented as a product of mutation and fixation, only the fixation can be calculated from the stationary distribution. The exhibited conservation of non-consensus nucleotides does not take place if the elements of mutation matrix are identical, and can be related to the reduced mutation rate between the non-consensus nucleotides. This bias can have no effect on the stationary distribution of nucleotide frequencies calculated over the ensemble of multiple alignments, e.g. transcription factor binding sites upstream of different sets of co-regulated orthologous genes. The derived model can be used as a null model when analyzing the evolution of orthologous transcription factor binding sites. In particular, our findings show that a nucleotide preferred at some position of a multiple alignment of binding sites for some transcription factor in the same genome is not necessarily the most conserved nucleotide in an alignment of orthologous sites from different species. However, this effect can take place only in the case of a mutation matrix whose elements are not identical. 	BMC_Evol._Biol.	D016428 D013485
26018465	20150529	The presence of prolines in the flanking region of an immunodominant HIV-2 gag epitope influences the quality and quantity of the epitope generated.	Both the recognition of HIV-infected cells and the immunogenicity of candidate CTL vaccines depend on the presentation of a peptide epitope at the cell surface, which in turn depends on intracellular antigen processing. Differential antigen processing maybe responsible for the differences in both the quality and the quantity of epitopes produced, influencing the immunodominance hierarchy of viral epitopes. Previously, we showed that the magnitude of the HIV-2 gag-specific T-cell response is inversely correlated with plasma viral load, particularly when responses are directed against an epitope, 165 DRFYKSLRA173 , within the highly conserved Major Homology Region of gag-p26. We also showed that the presence of three proline residues, at positions 119, 159 and 178 of gag-p26, was significantly correlated with low viral load. Since this proline motif was also associated with stronger gag-specific CTL responses, we investigated the impact of these prolines on proteasomal processing of the protective 165 DRFYKSLRA173 epitope. Our data demonstrate that the 165 DRFYKSLRA173 epitope is most efficiently processed from precursors that contain two flanking proline residues, found naturally in low viral-load patients. Superior antigen processing and enhanced presentation may account for the link between infection with HIV-2 encoding the &quot;PPP-gag&quot; sequence and both strong gag-specific CTL responses as well as lower viral load.

23530816	20130328	Chemoprevention utility of silibinin and Cdk4 pathway inhibition in Apc(-/+) mice.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. Colorectal cancers have a prolonged latency following initiation that may span decades providing ample time for implementing a chemoprevention strategy that could block or reverse the progression to CRC. Cdk4 pathway alterations have been linked to a number of cancers including CRC. In these experiments we focused on the Cdk4 pathway and its role in intestinal tumorigenesis as a possible target in chemoprevention strategies. We evaluated the effect of Cdk4 blockade on the prevention of intestinal tumor formation by crossing Cdk4(-/-) mice to Apc(-/+) mice. In addition, we tested the effect of the dietary compound silibinin on the Cdk4 pathway in Apc(-/+) mice and HT-29 colon cancer cells in culture. Cdk4(-/-) mice backcrossed to Apc(-/+) mice reduced intestinal adenoma formation compared to Apc(-/+) controls. Silibinin effectively targeted the Cdk4 pathway causing hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, inhibited cell growth, and induced apoptosis. As a result silibinin blocked the development of intestinal adenomas by 52% in this genetic model (Apc(-/+) mice) of early events in colorectal cancer formation. No toxic abnormalities were detected in mice which received silibinin. Modification of the Cdk4 pathway using a natural plant-derived compound such as silibinin may be a useful chemopreventive strategy for colorectal carcinomas. 	BMC_Cancer	D016428 D052061
17631273	20070717	Analysis of pre-mRNA and pre-rRNA processing factor Snu13p structure and mutants.	Snu13p is a Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein essential for pre-messenger RNA splicing and pre-ribosomal RNA processing. Snu13p binds U4 snRNA of the spliceosome and box C/D snoRNAs of the pre-ribosomal RNA processing machinery to induce assembly of each ribonucleoprotein complex. Here, we present structural and biochemical analysis of Snu13p. The crystal structure of Snu13p reveals a region of the protein which could be important for protein interaction during ribonucleoprotein assembly. Using the structure of Snu13p we have designed the first temperature-sensitive mutants in Snu13p, L67W and I102A. Wild-type and mutant Snu13p proteins were assayed for binding to U4 snRNA and U3 snoRNA. Both temperature-sensitive mutants displayed significantly reduced RNA binding compared to wild-type protein. As the temperature-sensitive mutations are not in the known RNA binding region of Snu13p this indicates that these mutants indirectly influence the RNA binding properties of Snu13p. This work provides insight into Snu13p function during ribonucleoprotein assembly. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.	D016428 D013485

23966881	20130823	Characterization of the p53 cistrome--DNA binding cooperativity dissects p53's tumor suppressor functions.	p53 protects us from cancer by transcriptionally regulating tumor suppressive programs designed to either prevent the development or clonal expansion of malignant cells. How p53 selects target genes in the genome in a context- and tissue-specific manner remains largely obscure. There is growing evidence that the ability of p53 to bind DNA in a cooperative manner prominently influences target gene selection with activation of the apoptosis program being completely dependent on DNA binding cooperativity. Here, we used ChIP-seq to comprehensively profile the cistrome of p53 mutants with reduced or increased cooperativity. The analysis highlighted a particular relevance of cooperativity for extending the p53 cistrome to non-canonical binding sequences characterized by deletions, spacer insertions and base mismatches. Furthermore, it revealed a striking functional separation of the cistrome on the basis of cooperativity; with low cooperativity genes being significantly enriched for cell cycle and high cooperativity genes for apoptotic functions. Importantly, expression of high but not low cooperativity genes was correlated with superior survival in breast cancer patients. Interestingly, in contrast to most p53-activated genes, p53-repressed genes did not commonly contain p53 binding elements. Nevertheless, both the degree of gene activation and repression were cooperativity-dependent, suggesting that p53-mediated gene repression is largely indirect and mediated by cooperativity-dependently transactivated gene products such as CDKN1A, E2F7 and non-coding RNAs. Since both activation of apoptosis genes with non-canonical response elements and repression of pro-survival genes are crucial for p53's apoptotic activity, the cistrome analysis comprehensively explains why p53-induced apoptosis, but not cell cycle arrest, strongly depends on the intermolecular cooperation of p53 molecules as a possible safeguard mechanism protecting from accidental cell killing.

11439000	20010705	Pattern of connexin 26 (GJB2) mutations causing sensorineural hearing impairment in Ghana.	Mutations of the connexin 26 gene (GJB2) were studied in 365 apparently unrelated individuals with profound nonsyndromic, sensorineural hearing impairment from Ghana, West Africa. Among 121 mutated chromosomes found, 110 carried the previously described R143W mutation. A total of 6 novel mutations: L79P, V178A, R184Q, A197S, I203K, and L214P, were identified, whereby I203K was based on a dinucleotide exchange and R184Q appeared to be dominant. The GJB2 variants found in Ghana tend to comprise less nonsense and frameshift mutations and more mutations located in the C-terminal half of the molecule than the variants found in other parts of the world.

16835750	20060713	The prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in eastern Chinese women with breast cancer.	To investigate the prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations among Chinese patients, we studied 70 Shanghai cases with early onset breast cancer and affected relatives, and mutation screening was performed in the whole-gene sequence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 by polymerase chain reaction-based denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. Six disease-causing mutations in BRCA1 (8.6%) and two in BRCA2 (2.9%) were detected, including four novel mutations that were all in the BRCA1 gene (3449insA, IVS17-1G&gt;T, IVS21+1G&gt;C and 5587-1del8). Additional sequence variants identified included 30 polymorphisms (18 in BRCA1 and 12 in BRCA2) and a novel mis-sense mutation of unknown significance in BRCA2 (5911G&gt;C). The 9.5 and 2.4% patients with breast cancer diagnosed before the age of 35 were BRCA1- and BRCA2-mutation carriers, and the prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in the families with two or more affected individuals were 12.1 and 3.0%, respectively. In these families, all the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were detected in the families containing at least one case diagnosed under the age of 40, and in the families whose youngest patients were diagnosed before the age of 35, the prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were as high as 40 and 20%, respectively. Based on this information, we conclude that genetic testing should be performed among patients with early onset breast cancer (&lt;40 years), especially combined with family history.

22136288	20111206	Mutational complex genotype of the hepatitis B virus X?/precore regions as a novel predictive marker for hepatocellular carcinoma.	This study explored the combined effect of number and pattern of mutations in the X/precore regions of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome, mutational complex genotype (MCG), on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Sequence variations were determined by direct sequencing and multiplex restriction fragment mass polymorphism analysis in 150 age-, sex- and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status-matched patients with and without HCC. In addition, a longitudinal study and an external validation of MCG were conducted. All were HBV subgenotype C2. Eight high-frequency mutations (G1613A, C1653T, T1753V, A1762T, G1764A, A1846T, G1896A and G1899A) were significantly associated with HCC. Whereas C1653T, T1753V, G1764A and A1846T were independent mutational factors for HCC, the significance of these individual mutations was negligible when analyzed with all clinico-virological variables. The total number of mutations was the only independent viral factor for HCC, irrespective of HBeAg status. There was a significant dose-risk relationship between the number of mutations and HCC, in which high risks for HCC were associated with mutation numbers ? 6. Pattern analysis of the mutations revealed disparity in distribution among the top seven high-risk mutation combination patterns, which accounted for 40 and 2.7% of HCC and non-HCC cases, respectively. The predictive accuracy of the high-risk mutations for HCC was similar to that of ?-fetoprotein. Longitudinal and external validation studies also supported the association of mutation number with HCC development. MCG in the HBV X/precore regions is a risk indicator for HCC, and might serve as a new guide to the HCC screening scheme for chronic HBV carriers. 	Cancer_Sci.	D016428 D013485
21160750	20101217	RAAS and adrenergic genes in heart failure: Function, predisposition and survival implications.	It is well appreciated that several neurohormones and signaling cascades are activated that promote long-term deterioration of cardiac function and structure. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the adrenergic system is closely related to heart failure. Common gene variants that encode neurohormonal, adrenergic and intracellular proteins have been demonstrated to modulate the course and consequences of heart failure. However, the literature is replete with conflicting results and it remains uncertain as to whether particular gene variants predispose heart failure. Therefore, the main purpose of this review was to discuss the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are located in genes encoding elements of the RAAS and the adrenergic system on the predisposition to and survival from heart failure. Most studies indicate that common SNPs encoding elements of the RAAS and the adrenergic system do not predispose individuals to heart failure. Conversely, it has been demonstrated that ARB1 Arg389Gly, GRK5 Gln41Leu, ACE I/D, CYP11B2 C-344T and AGTR1 A+1166C modulate pharmacological responses and have a considerable impact on cardiac-related survival. It should not be expected, however, that a single polymorphism determines survival, given that multiple gene products and environmental factors contribute to the pathogenesis of heart failure. Therefore, future studies should consider the interaction effects of multiple genes in populations that are as homogeneous as possible with respect to environmental characteristics.

26983597	20160318	Identification of E-cadherin signature motifs functioning as cleavage sites for Helicobacter pylori HtrA.	The cell adhesion protein and tumour suppressor E-cadherin exhibits important functions in the prevention of gastric cancer. As a class-I carcinogen, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) has developed a unique strategy to interfere with E-cadherin functions. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that H. pylori secretes the protease high temperature requirement A (HtrA) which cleaves off the E-cadherin ectodomain (NTF) on epithelial cells. This opens cell-to-cell junctions, allowing bacterial transmigration across the polarised epithelium. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the HtrA-E-cadherin interaction and identified E-cadherin cleavage sites for HtrA. Mass-spectrometry-based proteomics and Edman degradation revealed three signature motifs containing the [VITA]-[VITA]-x-x-D-[DN] sequence pattern, which were preferentially cleaved by HtrA. Based on these sites, we developed a substrate-derived peptide inhibitor that selectively bound and inhibited HtrA, thereby blocking transmigration of H. pylori. The discovery of HtrA-targeted signature sites might further explain why we detected a stable 90 kDa NTF fragment during H. pylori infection, but also additional E-cadherin fragments ranging from 105?kDa to 48?kDa in in vitro cleavage experiments. In conclusion, HtrA targets E-cadherin signature sites that are accessible in in vitro reactions, but might be partially masked on epithelial cells through functional homophilic E-cadherin interactions.

1409444	19920101	Identification of mutations in the pigment cell-specific gene located at the brown locus in mouse.	The pigment cell-specific gene, located at the brown (b)-locus in mouse, encodes the protein that determines the type of melanin synthesized. This protein is known as tyrosinase-related protein, but here we tentatively term it b-locus protein to avoid confusions with the related sequence cross-hybridizing to the tyrosinase gene. In order to identify the mutation at the b-locus, we have cloned and characterized the b-locus protein gene of BALB/c mouse (b/b, c/c). The gene is about 18 kb long and organized into 8 exons and 7 introns. Sequence analysis of the b-locus protein gene reveals four base changes within the protein-coding regions: two missense mutations and two silent mutations. Two missense mutations result in the Cys to Tyr substitution at position 86 (codon 110) and the Arg to His substitution at position 302 (codon 326) of a b-locus protein molecule. Using allele-specific amplification, we confirmed that these missense mutations are actually present in the genomic DNA of two b-mutant strains examined, BALB/c and DBA/2 (b/b, C/C) mice, suggesting that these mutations are specific for the mutant mice at the b-locus. Moreover, we are able to show that the b-locus protein containing Tyr 86 is not reactive with the anti-b-locus protein monoclonal antibody, TMH-1, in transient expression assays. 	Pigment_Cell_Res.

26098837	20150623	Analysis of Multiple Brachyspira hyodysenteriae Genomes Confirms That the Species Is Relatively Conserved but Has Potentially Important Strain Variation.	The intestinal spirochete Brachyspira hyodysenteriae is an important pathogen in swine, causing mucohemorrhagic colitis in a disease known as swine dysentery. Based on the detection of significant linkage disequilibrium in multilocus sequence data, the species is considered to be clonal. An analysis of the genome sequence of Western Australian B. hyodysenteriae strain WA1 has been published, and in the current study 19 further strains from countries around the world were sequenced with Illumina technology. The genomes were assembled and aligned to over 97.5% of the reference WA1 genome at a percentage sequence identity better than 80%. Strain regions not aligned to the reference ranged between 0.2 and 2.5%. Clustering of the strain genes found on average 2,354 (88%) core genes, 255 (8.6%) ancillary genes and 77 (2.9%) unique genes per strain. Depending on the strain the proportion of genes with 100% sequence identity to WA1 ranged from 85% to 20%. The result is a global comparative genomic analysis of B. hyodysenteriae genomes revealing potential differential phenotypic markers for numerous strains. Despite the differences found, the genomes were less varied than those of the related pathogenic species Brachyspira pilosicoli, and the analysis supports the clonal nature of the species. From this study, a public genome resource has been created that will serve as a repository for further genetic and phenotypic studies of these important porcine bacteria. This is the first intra-species B. hyodysenteriae comparative genomic analysis. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
21331346	20110219	Long-term type 1 diabetes enhances in-stent restenosis after aortic stenting in diabetes-prone BB rats.	Type 1 diabetic patients have increased risk of developing in-stent restenosis following endovascular stenting. Underlying pathogenetic mechanisms are not fully understood partly due to the lack of a relevant animal model to study the effect(s) of long-term autoimmune diabetes on development of in-stent restenosis. We here describe the development of in-stent restenosis in long-term (~7 months) spontaneously diabetic and age-matched, thymectomized, nondiabetic Diabetes Prone BioBreeding (BBDP) rats (n = 6-7 in each group). Diabetes was suboptimally treated with insulin and was characterized by significant hyperglycaemia, polyuria, proteinuria, and increased HbA(1c) levels. Stented abdominal aortas were harvested 28 days after stenting. Computerized morphometric analysis revealed significantly increased neointima formation in long-term diabetic rats compared with nondiabetic controls. In conclusion, long-term autoimmune diabetes in BBDP rats enhances in-stent restenosis. This model can be used to study the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms of diabetes-enhanced in-stent restenosis as well as to test new therapeutic modalities. 	J._Biomed._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485
25890849	20150420	Generation of recombinant canine interleukin-15 and evaluation of its effects on the proliferation and function of canine NK cells.	Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a pivotal role in both innate and adaptive immunity. IL-15 is also a promising cytokine for treating cancer. Despite the growing importance of the clinical use of IL-15 for immunotherapy, no attempts have been made to generate a recombinant canine IL-15 (rcIL-15) and to examine its effects on the antitumor activities of immune effector cells in dogs. Here, we generated an rcIL-15 protein consisting of Asn-49-Ser-162 with a C-terminal His tag and examined its functions ex vivo in terms of the proliferation and antitumor effects on canine non-B, non-T, large granular natural killer (NK) cells. Non-B, non-T, large granular NK cells rapidly expanded in response to stimulation with rcIL-15 in the presence of IL-2, and a majority of the cells that selectively expanded over 21 days exhibited a CD3(-)CD5(-)CD4(-)CD8(+/-)CD21(-) phenotype. Purified rcIL-15 significantly enhanced the expansion rate of canine NK cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared to human IL-15, or culture in the absence of IL-15 for 21 days (p&lt;0.05). Purified rcIL-15 was superior at enhancing the effector function of NK cells compared to human IL-15. The cytotoxic activity against canine thyroid adenocarcinoma (CTAC) cells, interferon-? production, and the mRNA expression levels of perforin and granzyme B of expanded NK cells cultured with rcIL-15 were significantly elevated compared to those cultured with human IL-15 or without IL-15 (p&lt;0.05). Intravenous administration of rcIL-15 significantly increased the numbers of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of dogs on days 6, 8, and 11 after injection compared to numbers before administration (p&lt;0.05). The results of this study suggest that the rcIL-15 protein, consisting of Asn-49-Ser-162, enhanced the proliferation and antitumor effects of canine NK cells and promoted the generation of lymphocytes in dogs.

12697062	20030417	Characterization of rabbit myocilin: Implications for human myocilin glycosylation and signal peptide usage.	Mutations in the gene encoding human myocilin (MYOC) have been shown to cause juvenile- and adult-onset glaucoma. In addition, myocilin has been associated with glucocorticoid-induced ocular hypertension and steroid-induced glaucoma. To better understand the role myocilin plays in steroid-induced glaucoma and open-angle glaucoma, we examined rabbit myocilin for use in the rabbit animal model of steroid-induced glaucoma. We have cloned the rabbit ortholog of human MYOC. Rabbit MYOC consists of three exons and an open reading frame encoding a 490 amino acid, 54,882-Da protein, which is 14 amino acids shorter at the N-terminus than human myocilin but 84% identical overall. Rabbit myocilin migrates as a single electrophoretic band, vs. double-banded human myocilin, by SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis. We determined that the differential migration exhibited is due to an N-glycosylation site that is present in human (Asn57), monkey and mouse myocilin but absent in rabbit (Ser43), rat and bovine myocilin. Rabbit myocilin is secreted in vitro in trabecular meshwork cell culture and in vivo in aqueous humor. Secretion of human myocilin is shown to be dependent on the signal peptide and independent of the extra 14 amino acids not found in rabbit myocilin. Many of the amino acids in myocilin that are mutated in glaucoma patients are conserved across species. We have cloned the rabbit MYOC cDNA and determined that rabbit myocilin is secreted but not N-linked glycosylated. Knowledge of the rabbit MYOC cDNA sequence will facilitate future studies in the rabbit animal model examining the role of myocilin in steroid-induced glaucoma and the gain-of-function hypothesis in open-angle glaucoma.

15077197	20040413	Novel PMS2 pseudogenes can conceal recessive mutations causing a distinctive childhood cancer syndrome.	We investigated a family with an autosomal recessive syndrome of cafe-au-lait patches and childhood malignancy, notably supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor. There was no cancer predisposition in heterozygotes; nor was there bowel cancer in any individual. However, autozygosity mapping indicated linkage to a region of 7p22 surrounding the PMS2 mismatch-repair gene. Sequencing of genomic PCR products initially failed to identify a PMS2 mutation. Genome searches then revealed a previously unrecognized PMS2 pseudogene, corresponding to exons 9-15, within a 100-kb inverted duplication situated 600 kb centromeric from PMS2 itself. This information allowed a redesigned sequence analysis, identifying a homozygous mutation (R802X) in PMS2 exon 14. Furthermore, in the family with Turcot syndrome, in which the first inherited PMS2 mutation (R134X) was described, a further truncating mutation was identified on the other allele, in exon 13. Further whole-genome analysis shows that the complexity of PMS2 pseudogenes is greater than appreciated and may have hindered previous mutation studies. Several previously reported PMS2 polymorphisms are, in fact, pseudogene sequence variants. Although PMS2 mutations may be rare in colorectal cancer, they appear, for the most part, to behave as recessive traits. For technical reasons, their involvement in childhood cancer, particularly in primitive neuroectodermal tumor, may have been underestimated. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D002363 D016428 D013485
25705874	20150224	Requirement of cAMP signaling for Schwann cell differentiation restricts the onset of myelination.	Isolated Schwann cells (SCs) respond to cAMP elevation by adopting a differentiated post-mitotic state that exhibits high levels of Krox-20, a transcriptional enhancer of myelination, and mature SC markers such as the myelin lipid galactocerebroside (O1). To address how cAMP controls myelination, we performed a series of cell culture experiments which compared the differentiating responses of isolated and axon-related SCs to cAMP analogs and ascorbate, a known inducer of axon ensheathment, basal lamina formation and myelination. In axon-related SCs, cAMP induced the expression of Krox-20 and O1 without a concomitant increase in the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) and without promoting axon ensheathment, collagen synthesis or basal lamina assembly. When cAMP was provided together with ascorbate, a dramatic enhancement of MBP expression occurred, indicating that cAMP primes SCs to form myelin only under conditions supportive of basal lamina formation. Experiments using a combination of cell permeable cAMP analogs and type-selective adenylyl cyclase (AC) agonists and antagonists revealed that selective transmembrane AC (tmAC) activation with forskolin was not sufficient for full SC differentiation and that the attainment of an O1 positive state also relied on the activity of the soluble AC (sAC), a bicarbonate sensor that is insensitive to forskolin and GPCR activation. Pharmacological and immunological evidence indicated that SCs expressed sAC and that sAC activity was required for morphological differentiation and the expression of myelin markers such as O1 and protein zero. To conclude, our data indicates that cAMP did not directly drive myelination but rather the transition into an O1 positive state, which is perhaps the most critical cAMP-dependent rate limiting step for the onset of myelination. The temporally restricted role of cAMP in inducing differentiation independently of basal lamina formation provides a clear example of the uncoupling of signals controlling differentiation and myelination in SCs.

20525731	20100608	Design and directed evolution of a dideoxy purine nucleoside phosphorylase.	Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) catalyzes the synthesis and phosphorolysis of purine nucleosides, interconverting nucleosides with their corresponding purine base and ribose-1-phosphate. While PNP plays significant roles in human and pathogen physiology, we are interested in developing PNP as a catalyst for the formation of nucleoside analog drugs of clinical relevance. Towards this aim, we describe the engineering of human PNP to accept 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI, Videx((R))) as a substrate for phosphorolysis using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and directed evolution. In human PNP, we identified a single amino acid, Tyr-88, as a likely modulator of ribose selectivity. RosettaLigand was employed to calculate binding energies for substrate and substrate analog transition state complexes for single mutants of PNP where Tyr-88 was replaced with another amino acid. In parallel, these mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, expressed and purified. A tyrosine to phenylalanine mutant (Y88F) was predicted by Rosetta to improve PNP catalytic activity with respect to ddI. Kinetic characterization of this mutant determined a 9-fold improvement in k(cat) and greater than 2-fold reduction in K(M). Subsequently, we used directed evolution to select for improved variants of PNP-Y88F in Escherichia coli cell extracts resulting in an additional 3-fold improvement over the progenitor strain. The engineered PNP may form the basis for catalysts and pathways for the biosynthesis of ddI. 	Protein_Eng._Des._Sel.	D016428 D052061 D013485
20709461	20100817	Assessment of GH1, CAPN1 and CAST polymorphisms as markers of carcass and meat traits in Bos indicus and Bos taurus-Bos indicus cross beef cattle.	The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of bovine GH1, CAPN1 and CAST gene polymorphisms on carcass and meat traits in Nellore and Nellore x Bos taurus beef cattle. Three hundred animals were genotyped for GH1/MspI (TC/G in intron 3), CAPN316 (AF_252504.2:g.5709C&gt;G) and CAST/RsaI (AY_008267.1:g282C&gt;G) and phenotyped for rib eye area, backfat thickness, intramuscular fat, shear force (SF), and myofibrillar fragmentation index (MFI). No significant associations were observed between the GH1/MspI and CAST/RsaI polymorphisms and phenotypes, although the relation between the CAST/RsaI genotypes and meat tenderness evaluated by MFI approached significant. The fact that the CAPN316 polymorphism did not show adequate segregation in Nellore cattle confirms the difficulty of using this marker in breeding programs of different Bos indicus breeds. However, the positive results of the association analysis obtained for Nellore x B. taurus crosses contributed to the validation of previous findings. 	Meat_Sci.	D016428 D013485
12629136	20030312	UROMODULIN mutations cause familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy.	Gout, which is commonly associated with hyperuricemia, affects 0.2% of the population. Hyperuricemia has a heterogeneous etiology that may be due to either over production and/or reduced renal clearance, of urate. In order to identify the mechanisms underlying reduced excretion of urate, we undertook positional cloning studies of familial juvenile hyperuricaemic nephropathy (FJHN), which is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hyperuricaemia, a low fractional renal excretion of urate, and chronic renal failure that is associated with interstitial fibrosis. The FJHN locus has been previously localized to a 22 centiMorgan interval flanked centromerically by D16S401 and telomerically by D16S3069, on chromosome 16p11-p13. This interval contains over 120 genes and we selected 13 renal expressed sequences to search for mutations in 5 unrelated FJHN families that contained 21 affected and 24 unaffected members. This revealed 5 heterozygous missense mutations (Cys77Tyr, Cys126Arg, Asn128Ser, Cys255Tyr and Cys300Gly) that altered evolutionary conserved residues in the gene encoding UROMODULIN. UROMODULIN, which is an 85 Kda glycoprotein, has roles in renal stone formation, the modulation of immune responses, and urothelial cytoprotection. The results of our studies, which have identified the gene causing FJHN, now indicate a further, novel role for UROMODULIN in urate metabolism. 	J._Clin._Endocrinol._Metab.	D016428 D013485
22267327	20120124	Fibrinogen and factor XIII A-subunit genotypes interactively influence C-reactive protein levels during inflammation.	Fibrinogen is a target of autoimmune reactions in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Fibrin(ogen) derivatives are involved in inflammatory processes and the generation of a stable fibrin network is necessary for sufficient inflammation control. As the density and stability of fibrin networks depend on complex interactions between factor XIIIA (F13A) and fibrinogen genotypes, the authors studied whether these genotypes were related to C-reactive protein (CRP) levels during acute-phase reactions. Association between ?-fibrinogen (FGA), ?-fibrinogen (FGB) and F13A genotypes with CRP levels was tested in two cohorts with longitudinal CRP measurements. Discovery and replication cohorts consisted of 288 RA (913 observations) and 636 non-RA patients (2541 observations), respectively. Genotype FGB -455G&gt;A (rs1800790) was associated with CRP elevations (? 10 mg/l) in both cohorts (RA, OR per allele 0.69, p=0.0007/P(adj)&lt;0.015; non-RA, OR 0.70, p=0.0004/p(adj)&lt;0.02; combined, OR 0.69, p&lt;10(-5)/p(adj)=0.001). Genotype F13A 34VV (rs5985) was conditional for the association of FGB -455G&gt;A with CRP as indicated by a clear restriction on F13A 34VV individuals and a highly significant heterogeneity between F13A 34VV and F13A 34L genotypes (p&lt;10(-5), p(adj)=0.001). In both cohorts, mean CRP levels significantly declined with ascending numbers of FGB -455A alleles. Genotype FGA T312A (rs6050) exhibited opposite effects on CRP compared with FGB -455G&gt;A. Again, this relation was dependent on F13A V34L genotype. Novel genetic determinants of CRP completely unrelated to previously known CRP regulators were identified. Presumably, these haemostatic gene variants modulate inflammation by influencing fibrin crosslinking. These findings could give new perspectives on the genetic background of inflammation control.

15684409	20050203	An oligonucleotide microarray for microRNA expression analysis based on labeling RNA with quantum dot and nanogold probe.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important regulatory roles in animals and plants by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression. They have diverse expression patterns and might regulate various developmental and physiological processes. Profiling miRNA expression is very helpful for studying biological functions of miRNAs. We report a novel miRNA profiling microarray, in which miRNAs were directly labeled at the 3' terminus with biotin and hybridized with complementary oligo-DNA probes immobilized on glass slides, and subsequently detected by measuring fluorescence of quantum dots labeled with streptavidin bound to miRNAs through streptavidin-biotin interaction. The detection limit of this microarray for miRNA was approximately 0.4 fmol, and the detection dynamic range spanned about 2 orders of magnitude. We made a model microarray to profile 11 miRNAs from leaf and root of rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica) seedlings. The analysis results of the miRNAs had a good reproducibility and were consistent with the northern blot result. To avoid using high-cost detection equipment, colorimetric detection, a method based on nanogold probe coupled with silver enhancement, was also successfully introduced into miRNA profiling microarray detection.

14631112	20031125	Effect of the 807 c/t polymorphism in glycoprotein ia on blood platelet reactivity.	The 807 C/T dimorphism in the GPIa gene has been shown to affect GPIaIIa receptor density, which can affect platelet adhesiveness to collagens. In this work, we studied platelet function mediated by GPIaIIa. The 807 T/T genotype was associated with increased platelet adhesion to monomeric collagen after activation with ADP, but not following activation with thrombin and U46619. Adhesion to fibrillar collagen and PFA-100 closure time were not different between carriers of the C/C and T/T genotypes. Also, to monitor the role of the 807 C/T polymorphism in the sensitivity to platelet antagonists, anti-GPIaIIa monoclonal antibodies (Gi9) were used. Irrespective of the 807 C/T genotype, Gi9 inhibited the ADP-induced platelet adhesion to the monomeric collagen-coated surface stronger than adhesion evoked by thrombin. Moreover, Gi9 significantly inhibited platelet adhesion to both monomeric and fibrillar collagen in 807 T/T carriers, whereas in 807 C/C subjects, Gi9 blocked only adhesion to monomeric collagen. Our results indicate that the 807 T/T genotype is related to increased platelet activation induced by ADP and higher platelet sensitivity to GPIaIIa antagonists. 	J._Biomed._Sci.

23109111	20121031	Heterogeneous properties of central lateral and parafascicular thalamic synapses in the striatum.	To understand the principles of operation of the striatum it is critical to elucidate the properties of the main excitatory inputs from cortex and thalamus, as well as their ability to activate the main neurons of the striatum, the medium spiny neurons (MSNs). As the thalamostriatal projection is heterogeneous, we set out to isolate and study the thalamic afferent inputs to MSNs using small localized injections of adeno-associated virus carrying fusion genes for channelrhodopsin-2 and YFP, in either the rostral or caudal regions of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei (i.e. the central lateral or parafascicular nucleus). This enabled optical activation of specific thalamic afferents combined with whole-cell, patch-clamp recordings of MSNs and electrical stimulation of cortical afferents, in adult mice. We found that thalamostriatal synapses differ significantly in their peak amplitude responses, short-term dynamics and expression of ionotropic glutamate receptor subtypes. Our results suggest that central lateral synapses are most efficient in driving MSNs to depolarization, particularly those of the direct pathway, as they exhibit large amplitude responses, short-term facilitation and predominantly express postsynaptic AMPA receptors. In contrast, parafascicular synapses exhibit small amplitude responses, short-term depression and predominantly express postsynaptic NMDA receptors, suggesting a modulatory role, e.g. facilitating Ca(2+)-dependent processes. Indeed, pairing parafascicular, but not central lateral, presynaptic stimulation with action potentials in MSNs, leads to NMDA receptor- and Ca(2+)-dependent long-term depression at these synapses. We conclude that the main excitatory thalamostriatal afferents differ in many of their characteristics and suggest that they each contribute differentially to striatal information processing.

1325912	19920901	Structural requirements for glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchor attachment in the cellular receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator.	The urokinase-plasminogen-activator receptor (u-PAR) is a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol(glycosyl-PtdIns)-anchored membrane protein. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have studied features in the u-PAR sequence important for successful glycosyl-PtdIns attachment. Two critical sequence elements were identified. In the sequence Ser282-Gly283-Ala284, simultaneous substitution of all of these residues prevented membrane anchoring. Individual substitution of each of the residues indicated that Gly283 is the more critical residue and the likely attachment site. However, it was unexpectedly found that mutation of this residue gave rise only to a partial impairment of glycosyl-PtdIns attachment. We therefore propose that more than one residue within this sequence can be utilized as glycosyl-PtdIns-attachment site. In the last eight COOH-terminal amino acids encoded in u-PAR cDNA, deletion of this sequence (residues 306-313) completely prevented glycosyl-PtdIns attachment. However, the remaining COOH-terminal region proved still to possess a potential glycosyl-PtdIns signal activity; it could be converted to a new functional glycosyl-PtdIns signal by substitution of a single positively charged residue (Arg304). Substitution of Arg304 by Leu converted this truntaced u-PAR to a glycosyl-PtdIns-anchored protein, indistinguishable from the wild type. Substitution of Arg304 by a negatively charged residue (Glu) led to a partial acquisition of the glycosyl-PtdIns-anchoring ability. These findings show that charged amino acids placed in the COOH-terminus interfere negatively with glycosyl-PtdIns-anchoring, and, furthermore, that this effect is more pronounced for positively charged than for negatively charged amino acid residues.

19281173	20090314	Inequivalent contribution of the five tryptophan residues in the C-lobe of human serum transferrin to the fluorescence increase when iron is released.	Human serum transferrin (hTF), with two Fe3+ binding lobes, transports iron into cells. Diferric hTF preferentially binds to a specific receptor (TFR) on the surface of cells, and the complex undergoes clathrin dependent receptor-mediated endocytosis. The clathrin-coated vesicle fuses with an endosome where the pH is lowered, facilitating iron release from hTF. On a biologically relevant time scale (2-3 min), the factors critical to iron release include pH, anions, a chelator, and the interaction of hTF with the TFR. Previous work, in which the increase in the intrinsic fluorescence signal was used to monitor iron release from the hTF/TFR complex, established that the TFR significantly enhances the rate of iron release from the C-lobe of hTF. In the current study, the role of the five C-lobe Trp residues in reporting the fluorescence change has been evaluated (+/-sTFR). Only four of the five recombinant Trp --&gt; Phe mutants produced well. A single slow rate constant for iron release is found for the monoferric C-lobe (FeC hTF) and the four Trp mutants in the FeC hTF background. The three Trp residues equivalent to those in the N-lobe differed from the N-lobe and each other in their contributions to the fluorescent signal. Two rate constants are observed for the FeC hTF control and the four Trp mutants in complex with the TFR: k(obsC1) reports conformational changes in the C-lobe initiated by the TFR, and k(obsC2) is ascribed to iron release. Excitation at 295 nm (Trp only) and at 280 nm (Trp and Tyr) reveals interesting and significant differences in the rate constants for the complex. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D052061
26632398	20151204	Clinical and Pathological Heterogeneity of Korean Patients with CAPN3 Mutations.	This study was designed to investigate the characteristics of Korean patients with calpainopathy. Thirteen patients from ten unrelated families were diagnosed with calpainopathy via direct or targeted sequencing of the CAPN3 gene. Clinical, mutational, and pathological spectra were then analyzed. Nine different mutations, including four novel mutations (NM_000070: c.1524+1G&gt;T, c.1789_1790inA, c.2184+1G&gt;T, and c.2384C&gt;T) were identified. The median age at symptom onset was 22 (interquartile range: 15-28). Common clinical findings were joint contracture in nine patients, winged scapula in four, and lordosis in one. However, we also found highly variable clinical features including early onset joint contractures, asymptomatic hyperCKemia, and heterogeneous clinical severity in three members of the same family. Four of nine muscle specimens revealed lobulated fibers, but three showed normal skeletal muscle histology. We identified four novel CAPN3 mutations and demonstrated clinical and pathological heterogeneity in Korean patients with calpainopathy. 	Yonsei_Med._J.	D016428 D013485
18205229	20080122	The p53 R72P polymorphism does not influence cervical cancer development in a Portuguese population: a study in exfoliated cervical cells.	The interaction between the E6 protein of the high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) with p53 seems to be crucial in cervical carcinogenesis. The presence of Arg/Arg genotype at codon 72 of TP53 gene was characterized as a risk factor in development of cervical cancer. However, the role of this polymorphism remains controversial and some authors suggested that the origin of DNA (blood or exfoliated cervical cells) might influence these results. This study analyzed the effect of the p53 codon 72 polymorphism (R72P) in exfoliated cervical cells of women from the northern region of Portugal using two methodologies: allele-specific polymerase chain reaction and real-time polymerase chain reaction. We studied 700 cervical exfoliated cells which showed: 334 cases from women without cervical cancer or cervical lesion (N), 114 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 107 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), 20 invasive cervical cancers (ICC) and 125 atypical squamous cells of unknown significance (ASCUS). No statistically significant differences between cases and controls were found, regarding the influence of the R72P polymorphism with cytological classification, high risk-HPV infection and HPV16 presence (P = 0.336, P = 0.945, and P = 0.964, respectively). Also, the influence of this polymorphism in the median age of onset for LSIL, HSIL, and ICC was not statistically significant (P = 0.674, P = 0.810, and P = 0.928, respectively). Therefore, the hypothesis that women with Arg/Arg genotype have an increased risk of developing cervical cancer failed to be proven in this study. Moreover, our study reveals that results using exfoliated cervical cells are reliable as compared with studies on blood. 	J._Med._Virol.	D016428 D013485
23667506	20130514	Neutralizing antibodies in patients with chronic hepatitis C, genotype 1, against a panel of genotype 1 culture viruses: lack of correlation to treatment outcome.	The correlation of neutralizing antibodies to treatment outcome in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has not been established. The aim of this study was to determine whether neutralizing antibodies could be used as an outcome predictor in patients with chronic HCV, genotype 1, infection treated with pegylated interferon-? and ribavirin. Thirty-nine patients with chronic hepatitis C, genotype 1a or 1b, with either sustained virologic response (n?=?23) or non-sustained virologic response (n?=?16) were enrolled. Samples taken prior to treatment were tested for their ability to neutralize 6 different HCV genotype 1 cell culture recombinants (1a: H77/JFH1, TN/JFH1, DH6/JFH1; 1b: J4/JFH1, DH1/JFH1, DH5/JFH1). The results were expressed as the highest dilution yielding 50% neutralization (NAb50-titer). We observed no genotype or subtype specific differences in NAb50-titers between patients with chronic HCV infection with and without sustained virologic response when tested against any of the included culture viruses. However, NAb50-titers varied significantly with a mean reciprocal NAb50-titer of 800 (range: 100-6400) against DH6/JFH1 compared to a mean NAb50-titer of 50 (range: &lt;50-400) against all other included isolates. Subsequent studies demonstrated that the efficient neutralization of DH6/JFH1 could be linked to engineered adaptive mutations in the envelope-2 protein. In analysis of envelope 1 and 2 sequences of HCV, recovered from a subset of patients, we observed no apparent link between relatedness of patient sequences with culture viruses used and the corresponding neutralization results. In conclusion, pre-treatment levels of neutralizing antibodies against HCV genotype 1 isolates could not predict treatment outcome in patients with chronic HCV infection. High neutralization susceptibility of DH6/JFH1 could be correlated with adaptive envelope mutations previously highlighted as important for neutralization. Our study emphasizes the importance of using multiple culture viruses for neutralization studies and contributes to the current knowledge about neutralizing epitopes, important for future therapeutic- and vaccine-studies.

14642084	20031203	[Association between polymorphisms in the microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) gene and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].	To investigate the association between polymorphisms in the microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) gene and susceptibility to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a Chinese population. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were performed to genotype mEH polymorphisms in exon3 (Tyr113--&gt;His) and exon4 (His139--&gt;Arg) in 100 COPD patients and 100 age and sex matched healthy controls. (1) The proportion of mEH heterozygotes in exon3 was significantly higher in the patients with COPD than that in the control subjects (42% vs 32%). The odds ratio (OR) adjusted by age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and cigarettes years was 2.96 (95% CI 1.24 - 7.09). (2) There was no marked difference in very slow activity genotype versus other genotypes between COPD patients and controls. (3) When COPD patients were nonsmokers, the OR of very slow activity genotype versus other genotypes was more than 1.00, and when COPD patients were smokers (Current smokers and ex-smokers), the OR was less than 1.00. (1) mEH heterozygotes in exon3 might be associated with the susceptibility to COPD in China. (2) The interaction might be existed between mEH genotype and smoke.

23261545	20121225	Clinical and familial characteristics of eight Chinese patients with T188K genetic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.	Eight cases of rare genetic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (gCJD) with a mutation T188K in PRNP have been identified and diagnosed genetically in China since 2006. Among the eight cases, the median age of disease onset was 58years old (ranging from 39 to 76years old). Progressive dementia and pyramidal or extrapyramidal dysfunction appeared in all cases and lasted during the entire clinical course. Myoclonus and visual or cerebellar disturbances were also frequently observed. The median duration of disease was 3months. Cerebral MRI findings revealed high caudate and putamen signals in four out of eight cases. CSF in six out of eight patients tested positive for the 14-3-3 protein. Only one case showed periodic sharp-waves (PSW) in EEG. Most cases lacked a family history of associated diseases, though one patient's mother died of a neurologic disorder without a definite diagnosis. Our data reveal that Chinese T188K gCJD cases have clinical characteristics similar to that of sporadic CJD (sCJD). Compared with other inherited prion disease-associated mutations in China, the genetic frequencies of T188K in PRNP of Han-Chinese are relatively high. 	Infect._Genet._Evol.	D016428 D013485
11864707	20020228	Recurrent pulmonary embolism in a 13-year-old male homozygous for the prothrombin G20210A mutation combined with protein S deficiency and increased lipoprotein (a).	We report the case of a 13-year-old male presenting with recurrent symptoms of respiratory distress after a trauma of the lower limb. Pulmonary symptoms had been misinterpreted for several weeks and only marked symptoms of deep venous (DVT) and caval vein thrombosis later prompted the correct diagnosis of DVT and embolic events and subsequently a successful thrombolytic therapy. The case reported here shows a diagnostic pitfall of pulmonary embolism in an adolescent. It emphasizes the need to consider the possibility of thromboembolic events also in young children and adolescents presenting with atypical pulmonary symptoms and suffering from pulmonary diseases not responding to antibiotic therapy. In addition, although the homozygous PT A20210A gene mutation is a rare defect and its relevance as a risk factor on its own remains to be elucidated, this case suggests that a complete thrombophilia laboratory workup should be performed in young patients with a first symptomatic thromboembolic onset.

10441343	19990811	French Machado-Joseph disease patients do not exhibit gametic segregation distortion: a sperm typing analysis.	Segregation distortion has been reported to occur in a number of the trinucleotide repeat disorders. On the basis of a sperm typing study performed in patients of Japanese descent with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), it was reported that disease alleles are preferentially transmitted during meiosis. We performed a sperm typing study of five MJD patients of French descent and analysis of the pooled data shows a ratio of mutant to normal alleles of 379:436 (46.5:53.5%), which does not support meiotic segregation distortion. To confirm these results, sperm typing analysis was also performed using a polymorphic marker, D14S1050, closely linked to the MJD1 gene. Among 910 sperm analyzed, the allele linked to the disease chromosome was detected in 50.3% of the samples and the allele linked to the normal chromosome was found in 49.6% of the sperm. The difference in frequency of these two alleles is not significant ( P = 0.8423). Likelihood-based analysis of segregation distortion in the single sperm data using the SPERMSEG program also showed no support for segregation distortion at the gamete level in this patient population. The previous report on the Japanese patients also suggested that disease allele stability may be influenced by a trans effect of an intragenic polymorphism (987 G/C) in the wild-type allele. All of the French patients were heterozygous for this polymorphism. However, analysis of the variance in repeat number in sperm from the French MJD patients overlapped significantly with the variance in repeat number observed in the C/C homozygous Japanese patients.

21765802	20110719	Generation of healthy mice from gene-corrected disease-specific induced pluripotent stem cells.	Using the murine model of tyrosinemia type 1 (fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase [FAH] deficiency; FAH?/? mice) as a paradigm for orphan disorders, such as hereditary metabolic liver diseases, we evaluated fibroblast-derived FAH?/?-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) as targets for gene correction in combination with the tetraploid embryo complementation method. First, after characterizing the FAH?/? iPS cell lines, we aggregated FAH?/?-iPS cells with tetraploid embryos and obtained entirely FAH?/?-iPS cell-derived mice that were viable and exhibited the phenotype of the founding FAH?/? mice. Then, we transduced FAH cDNA into the FAH?/?-iPS cells using a third-generation lentiviral vector to generate gene-corrected iPS cells. We could not detect any chromosomal alterations in these cells by high-resolution array CGH analysis, and after their aggregation with tetraploid embryos, we obtained fully iPS cell-derived healthy mice with an astonishing high efficiency for full-term development of up to 63.3%. The gene correction was validated functionally by the long-term survival and expansion of FAH-positive cells of these mice after withdrawal of the rescuing drug NTBC (2-(2-nitro-4-fluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione). Furthermore, our results demonstrate that both a liver-specific promoter (transthyretin, TTR)-driven FAH transgene and a strong viral promoter (from spleen focus-forming virus, SFFV)-driven FAH transgene rescued the FAH-deficiency phenotypes in the mice derived from the respective gene-corrected iPS cells. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that a lentiviral gene repair strategy does not abrogate the full pluripotent potential of fibroblast-derived iPS cells, and genetic manipulation of iPS cells in combination with tetraploid embryo aggregation provides a practical and rapid approach to evaluate the efficacy of gene correction of human diseases in mouse models.

19380287	20090422	Proinflammatory and prothrombotic effects on human vascular endothelial cells of immune-cell-derived LIGHT.	LIGHT (TNFSF 14) belongs to the tumor necrosis factor superfamily and is expressed by activated T cells as well as various types of antigen presenting cells. LIGHT binds to its cellular receptors TR2 and LTbetaR and has a co-stimulatory role in T cell activation. Here, we compared the relative expression of LIGHT in different immune cells and the biological activity of immune cell-derived LIGHT on endothelial cells. Surface expression of LIGHT and mRNA production by PBMC and isolated T cells (CD4+ or CD8+) significantly increased after stimulation with PMA (Phorbolester-12- Myristat-13-Acetat)+ionomycin. No LIGHT expression on PMA stimulated monocytes or monocytic-like THP-1 cells could be detected; differentiation of monocytes and THP-1 cells into macrophages, however, resulted in up-regulation of LIGHT. Supernatants of stimulated T cells contained higher concentrations of soluble LIGHT than macrophage supernatants normalized to cell numbers; release of soluble LIGHT was found to be dependent on metalloproteinase activity. Size determination of released soluble LIGHT by size exclusion chromatography revealed a molecular mass of approximately 60 kDa, suggesting a trimeric form. Released soluble LIGHT induced expression of proinflammatory antigens ICAM-1, tissue factor and IL-8 in human endothelial cells and caused apoptosis of IFN-g pretreated endothelial cells. Soluble LIGHT was detected at low levels in sera of healthy controls and was significantly enhanced in sera of patients with chronic hepatitis C and rheumatoid arthritis (24.93+/-9.41 vs. 129.53+/-49.14 and 172.13+/-77.64; p&lt;0.0005). These findings suggest that among immune cells activated T lymphocytes are the main source of soluble LIGHT with released amounts of soluble LIGHT markedly higher compared to platelets. Immune cell-derived membrane-bound and soluble trimeric LIGHT is biologically active, inducing proinflammatory changes in endothelial cells. Enhanced plasma levels of soluble LIGHT in patients with chronic infections suggest a role of LIGHT in systemic inflammatory activation. 	Eur._J._Med._Res.	D016428
16460650	20060208	Mitochondrial DNA as a potential tool for early cancer detection.	The recent surge in mitochondrial research has been driven by the identification of mitochondria-associated diseases and the role of mitochondria in apoptosis. Both of these aspects have identified mitochondrial analysis as a vital component of medical research. Moreover, mitochondria have been implicated in the process of carcinogenesis because of their vital role in energy production, nuclear-cytoplasmic signal integration and control of metabolic pathways. Interestingly, at some point during neoplastic transformation, there is an increase in reactive oxygen species, which damage the mitochondrial genome. This accelerates the somatic mutation rate of mitochondrial DNA. It has been proposed that these mutations may serve as an early indication of potential cancer development and may represent a means for tracking tumour progression. The purpose of this review is to explore the potential utility that these mutations may afford for the identification and monitoring of neoplasia and malignant transformation where appropriate body fluids or non-invasive tissue access is available for mitochondrial DNA recovery. Specifically, prostate, breast, colorectal, skin and lung cancers are discussed. 	Hum._Genomics	D016428 D013485
26510961	20151030	5-Azacytidine modulates interferon regulatory factor 1 in macrophages to exert a cardioprotective effect.	Macrophages are actively involved in inflammatory responses during the progression of cardiac injury, including myocardial infarction (MI). A previous study showed that 5-azacytidine (5AZ), a DNA methylation inhibitor, can ameliorate cardiac injury by shifting macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype via iNOS inhibition. Here, we show that the beneficial effect of 5AZ is associated with sumoylation of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1) in macrophages. IRF1 is a critical transcription factor for iNOS induction and is antagonized by IRF2. In the stimulated macrophages, IRF1 accumulated in the nucleus without degradation by 5AZ treatment. In animal study, 5AZ administration resulted in significant improvements in cardiac function and fibrosis. IRF1-expressing macrophages were more abundant in the 5AZ-treated MI group than in the PBS-treated MI group. Because sumoylated IRF1 is known to mimic IRF2, we examined the IRF1 sumoylation. Sumoylated IRF1 was resistant to degradation and significantly increased in the 5AZ-treated MI group. Collectively, 5AZ had a protective effect after MI by potentiation of IRF1 sumoylation and is suggested as a novel therapeutic intervention for cardiac repair. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D013485
23175443	20121124	Oncogenic FGFR3 gene fusions in bladder cancer.	FGF receptor 3 (FGFR3) is activated by mutation or over-expression in many bladder cancers. Here, we identify an additional mechanism of activation via chromosomal re-arrangement to generate constitutively activated fusion genes. FGFR3-transforming acid coiled coil 3 (TACC3) fusions resulting from 4p16.3 re-arrangements and a t(4;7) that generates a FGFR3-BAI1-associated protein 2-like 1 (BAIAP2L1) fusion were identified in 4 of 43 bladder tumour cell lines and 2 of 32 selected tissue samples including the tumour from which one of the cell lines was derived. These are highly activated and transform NIH-3T3 cells. The FGFR3 component is identical in all cases and lacks the final exon that includes the phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC?1) binding site. Expression of the fusions in immortalized normal human urothelial cells (NHUC) induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway but not PLC?1. A protein with loss of the terminal region alone was not as highly activated as the fusion proteins, indicating that the fusion partners are essential. The TACC3 fusions retain the TACC domain that mediates microtubule binding and the BAIAP2L1 fusion retains the IRSp53/MIM domain (IMD) that mediates actin binding and Rac interaction. As urothelial cell lines with FGFR3 fusions are extremely sensitive to FGFR-selective agents, the presence of a fusion gene may aid in selection of patients for FGFR-targeted therapy.

22644997	20120531	XPD Asp312Asn polymorphism is a risk factor for prostate cancer.	The association between Asp312Asn and Lys751Gln polymorphisms of Xeroderma pigmentosum Group D (XPD) and prostate cancer risk are still inconclusive. For better understanding of the effects of these two polymorphisms on prostate cancer risk, a meta-analysis was performed. An extensive search was performed to identify all case-control studies investigating such association. The strength of association between these two polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk was assessed by odds ratio (OR) with the corresponding 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI). A total of seven case-control studies were identified, among which five studies (1,257 cases and 1,956 controls) were eligible for Asp312Asn polymorphism and six studies (1,451 cases and 2,375 controls) were eligible for Lys751Gln polymorphism. Asp312Asn polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer in additive and recessive genetic models (additive model: OR = 1.68, 95 % CI = 1.28-2.22, P = 0.00; recessive model: OR = 1.65, 95 % CI = 1.27-2.15, P = 0.00). In the subgroup analysis, Asp312Asn polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer among Asians in all three genetic models (additive model: OR = 2.09, 95 % CI = 1.39-3.14, P = 0.00; dominant model: OR = 1.49, 95 % CI = 1.12-1.98, P = 0.01; recessive model: OR = 1.93, 95 % CI = 1.31-2.83, P = 0.00). However, no significant associations were found between Lys751Gln polymorphism and prostate cancer risk in the overall analyses or the subgroup analyses by ethnicity. The results of this meta-analysis indicate that the XPD Asp312Asn polymorphism is a risk factor for prostate cancer development. 	J._Cancer_Res._Clin._Oncol.	D016428 D017418
26994442	20160320	A polymorphism in the MSH3 mismatch repair gene is associated with the levels of somatic instability of the expanded CTG repeat in the blood DNA of myotonic dystrophy type 1 patients.	Somatic mosaicism of the expanded CTG repeat in myotonic dystrophy type 1 is age-dependent, tissue-specific and expansion-biased, contributing toward the tissue-specificity and progressive nature of the symptoms. Previously, using regression modelling of repeat instability we showed that variation in the rate of somatic expansion in blood DNA contributes toward variation in age of onset, directly implicating somatic expansion in the disease pathway. Here, we confirm these results using a larger more genetically homogenous Costa Rican DM1 cohort (p&lt;0.001). Interestingly, we also provide evidence that supports subtle sex-dependent differences in repeat length-dependent age at onset and somatic mutational dynamics. Previously, we demonstrated that variation in the rate of somatic expansion was a heritable quantitative trait. Given the important role that DNA mismatch repair genes play in mediating expansions in mouse models, we tested for modifier gene effects with 13 DNA mismatch gene polymorphisms (one each in MSH2, PMS2, MSH6 and MLH1; and nine in MSH3). After correcting for allele length and age effects, we identified three polymorphisms in MSH3 that were associated with variation in somatic instability: Rs26279 (p=0.003); Rs1677658 (p=0.009); and Rs10168 (p=0.031). However, only the association with Rs26279 remained significant after multiple testing correction. Although we revealed a statistically significant association between Rs26279 and somatic instability, we did not detect an association with the age at onset. Individuals with the A/A genotype for Rs26279 tended to show a greater propensity to expand the CTG repeat than other genotypes. Interestingly, this SNP results in an amino acid change in the critical ATPase domain of MSH3 and is potentially functionally dimorphic. These data suggest that MSH3 is a key player in generating somatic variation in DM1 patients and further highlight MSH3 as a potential therapeutic target. 	DNA_Repair_(Amst.)	D016428 D013485

Sixteen patients from 4 families were detected with GJB2 mutations, 8 patients from 2 families were found with SLC26A4 mutations, and 4 patients from 2 families were found with mutations in mtDNA. For 2 patients from one remaining family, no mutations were found with above genes. A diagnostic system for NSHL has been established, which may provide a basis for prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling to NSHL families. 	Zhonghua_Yi_Xue_Yi_Chuan_Xue_Za_Zhi	D016428
26029667	20150602	Downregulation of MYCN through PI3K Inhibition in Mouse Models of Pediatric Neural Cancer.	The MYCN proto-oncogene is associated with poor outcome across a broad range of pediatric tumors. While amplification of MYCN drives subsets of high-risk neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma, dysregulation of MYCN in medulloblastoma (in the absence of amplification) also contributes to pathogenesis. Since PI3K stabilizes MYCN, we have used inhibitors of PI3K to drive degradation. In this study, we show PI3K inhibitors by themselves induce cell cycle arrest, with modest induction of apoptosis. In screening inhibitors of PI3K against MYCN, we identified PIK-75 and its derivative, PW-12, inhibitors of both PI3K and of protein kinases, to be highly effective in destabilizing MYCN. To determine the effects of PW-12 treatment in vivo, we analyzed a genetically engineered mouse model for MYCN-driven neuroblastoma and a model of MYCN-driven medulloblastoma. PW-12 showed significant activity in both models, inducing vascular collapse and regression of medulloblastoma with prominent apoptosis in both models. These results demonstrate that inhibitors of lipid and protein kinases can drive apoptosis in MYCN-driven cancers and support the importance of MYCN as a therapeutic target. 	Front_Oncol	D016428
19891862	20091107	Epidemic of Plasmodium falciparum malaria involving substandard antimalarial drugs, Pakistan, 2003.	Because of instability in eastern Afghanistan, new refugees crossed into the federally administered tribal areas of northwestern Pakistan in 2002. In 2003, we investigated an epidemic of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in 1 of the camps. Incidence was 100.4 cases/1,000 person-years; in other nearby camps it was only 2.1/1,000 person-years. Anopheline mosquitoes were found despite an earlier spray campaign. Documented clinical failures at the basic health unit prompted a drug resistance survey of locally manufactured sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine used for routine treatment. The in vivo failure rate was 28.5%. PCR analysis of the P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase and dihyropteroate synthase genes showed no mutations associated with clinical failure. However, chemical analysis of the drug showed that it was substandard. As global incidence decreases and epidemics become more of a threat, enhanced quality assurance of control interventions is essential. 	Emerging_Infect._Dis.	D016428 D013485

A functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the group-specific component (GC) gene (T &gt; G, rs2282679) has been associated with 25-hydroxy (25-OH) vitamin D and 1.25 dihydroxy (1.25-OH2) vitamin D levels. To examine the hypothesized inverse relationship between vitamin D status and prostate cancer, we studied the association between this SNP and prostate cancer outcome in the prospective PROCAGENE study comprising 702 prostate cancer patients with a median follow-up of 82 months. GC rs2282679 genotypes were not associated with biochemical recurrence [hazard ratios (HR) 0.91, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.73-1.12; p = 0.36], development of metastases (HR 1.20, 95 % CI 0.88-1.63; p = 0.25) or overall survival (HR 1.10; 95 % CI 0.84-1.43; p = 0.50). A causal role of vitamin D status, as reflected by GC rs2282679 genotype, in disease progression and mortality in prostate cancer patients is unlikely. 	World_J_Urol	D016428 D016449 D013485
15805151	20050405	No MSH6 germline mutations in breast cancer families with colorectal and/or endometrial cancer.	The genetic background in breast cancer families with colorectal and/or endometrial cancer is mostly unknown. The functional connection between MSH6 and the known breast cancer predisposition gene product BRCA1 suggests that the MSH6 gene may also play a role in breast cancer predisposition. We analysed 38 breast cancer families with colorectal and/or endometrial cancer for germline mutations in MSH6. No disease associated mutations were detected among the breast cancer families. However, mutation analysis revealed a Glu995STOP mutation in an atypical HNPCC family. The same mutation was found in a patient with both breast and colorectal carcinoma in our previous study, and haplotype analysis confirmed a common ancestral origin. The Glu995STOP mutation was further examined in an extensive series of 245 colorectal and 142 breast carcinoma patients with a family history of breast, colorectal, and/or endometrial carcinoma, and in 268 healthy population controls, but none was found to carry the mutation. Our results suggest that MSH6 may not be the underlying gene in breast cancer families with a history of colorectal and/or endometrial cancer. The Glu995STOP founder mutation is not a familial breast cancer predisposition allele and makes only a limited contribution to colorectal cancer burden in Finland. 	J._Med._Genet.

23429074	20130223	A mutation in the HFE gene is associated with altered brain iron profiles and increased oxidative stress in mice.	Because of the increasing evidence that H63D HFE polymorphism appears in higher frequency in neurodegenerative diseases, we evaluated the neurological consequences of H63D HFE in vivo using mice that carry H67D HFE (homologous to human H63D). Although total brain iron concentration did not change significantly in the H67D mice, brain iron management proteins expressions were altered significantly. The 6-month-old H67D mice had increased HFE and H-ferritin expression. At 12 months, H67D mice had increased H- and L-ferritin but decreased transferrin expression suggesting increased iron storage and decreased iron mobilization. Increased L-ferritin positive microglia in H67D mice suggests that microglia increase iron storage to maintain brain iron homeostasis. The 6-month-old H67D mice had increased levels of GFAP, increased oxidatively modified protein levels, and increased cystine/glutamate antiporter (xCT) and hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression indicating increased metabolic and oxidative stress. By 12 months, there was no longer increased astrogliosis or oxidative stress. The decrease in oxidative stress at 12 months could be related to an adaptive response by nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) that regulates antioxidant enzymes expression and is increased in the H67D mice. These findings demonstrate that the H63D HFE impacts brain iron homeostasis, and promotes an environment of oxidative stress and induction of adaptive mechanisms. These data, along with literature reports on humans with HFE mutations provide the evidence to overturn the traditional paradigm that the brain is protected from HFE mutations. The H67D knock-in mouse can be used as a model to evaluate how the H63D HFE mutation contributes to neurodegenerative diseases. 	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D013485
25093132	20140806	Late-Onset Glycogen Storage Disease Type II (Pompe's Disease) with a Novel Mutation: A Malaysian Experience.	Pompe's disease (acid maltase deficiency, glycogen storage disease type II) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of lysosomal acid ?-1,4-glucosidase, resulting in excessive accumulation of glycogen in the lysosomes and cytoplasm of all tissues, most notably in skeletal muscles. We present a case of adult-onset Pompe's disease with progressive proximal muscles weakness over 5 years and respiratory failure on admission, requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Electromyography showed evidence of myopathic process with small amplitudes, polyphasic motor unit action potentials, and presence of pseudomyotonic discharges. Muscle biopsy showed glycogen-containing vacuoles in the muscle fibers consistent with glycogen storage disease. Genetic analysis revealed two compound heterozygous mutations at c.444C&gt;G (p.Tyr148?) in exon 2 and c.2238G&gt;C (p.Trp746Cys) in exon 16, with the former being a novel mutation. This mutation has not been reported before, to our knowledge. The patient was treated with high protein diet during the admission and subsequently showed good clinical response to enzyme replacement therapy with survival now to the eighth year. Conclusion. In patients with late-onset adult Pompe's disease, careful evaluation and early identification of the disease and its treatment with high protein diet and enzyme replacement therapy improve muscle function and have beneficial impact on long term survival.

21766012	20110719	Alzheimer's disease genes are associated with measures of cognitive ageing in the lothian birth cohorts of 1921 and 1936.	Alzheimer's disease patients have deficits in specific cognitive domains, and susceptibility genes for this disease may influence human cognition in nondemented individuals. To evaluate the role of Alzheimer's disease-linked genetic variation on cognition and normal cognitive ageing, we investigated two Scottish cohorts for which assessments in major cognitive domains are available: the Lothian Birth Cohort of 1921 and the Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936, consisting of 505 and 998 individuals, respectively. 158 SNPs from eleven genes were evaluated. Single SNP analyses did not reveal any statistical association after correction for multiple testing. One haplotype from TRAPPC6A was associated with nonverbal reasoning in both cohorts and combined data sets. This haplotype explains a small proportion of the phenotypic variability (1.8%). These findings warrant further investigation as biological modifiers of cognitive ageing. 	Int_J_Alzheimers_Dis	D016428

The asymmetric unit of the title salt, (C(16)H(20)N(3)S)(2)[Co(NCS)(4)], comprises one monovalent isothio-pendylium cation and one-half of a divalent thio-cyanatocobaltate(II) anion (2 symmetry).

The mol-ecular structure of the cation is stabilized by an intra-molecular N-H?N hydrogen bond. Within the complex anion, the Co(II) atom is tetra-hedrally surrounded by four N atoms of the thio-cyanate ligands. ?-? stacking, with a distance of 3.7615?(10)?? between the centroids of benzene and pyridine rings, helps to consolidate the packing.

24393486	20140108	RNase-mediated protein footprint sequencing reveals protein-binding sites throughout the human transcriptome.	Although numerous approaches have been developed to map RNA-binding sites of individual RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), few methods exist that allow assessment of global RBP-RNA interactions. Here, we describe PIP-seq, a universal, high-throughput, ribonuclease-mediated protein footprint sequencing approach that reveals RNA-protein interaction sites throughout a transcriptome of interest. We apply PIP-seq to the HeLa transcriptome and compare binding sites found using different cross-linkers and ribonucleases. From this analysis, we identify numerous putative RBP-binding motifs, reveal novel insights into co-binding by RBPs, and uncover a significant enrichment for disease-associated polymorphisms within RBP interaction sites.

17705858	20070821	CHEK2 1100delC is prevalent in Swedish early onset familial breast cancer.	A truncating variant, 1100delC, in check point-kinase CHEK2, has been identified as a risk factor for familial and sporadic breast cancer. The prevalence in healthy non-breast cancer cases is low and varies between populations. We analyzed the prevalence of CHEK2 1100delC in 763 breast cancer patients with a defined family history and 760 controls from the Stockholm region. The breast cancer patients originated from; a population-based cohort (n = 452) and from a familial cancer clinic (n = 311), the detailed family history was known in both groups. The variant was found in 2.9% of the familial cases from the population-based cohort and in 1.9% from the familial cancer clinic. In total 2.2% of the patients with a family history of breast cancer carried the variant compared to 0.7% of the controls (p = 0.03). There was no increased prevalence in sporadic patients (0.3%). The variant was most frequent in young familial patients (5.1% of cases &lt;or=45 years, p = 0.003). The mean age at diagnosis of variant carriers was 12 years lower than in non-carriers (p = 0.001). In conclusion, CHEK2 1100delC exists in the Swedish population. The prevalence is increased in familial breast cancer and the variant seems to influence age at onset. 	BMC_Cancer	D016428 D013485
18981341	20081105	Association of serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms with poststroke depression.	Polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter gene (SERT) have been associated with mental illness. In people with long-term medical conditions, variants of the 5-HTTLPR and STin2 VNTR polymorphisms of SERT have been shown to confer a heightened vulnerability to comorbid depression. To determine whether the 5-HTTLPR, STin2 VNTR, and rs25531 polymorphisms of SERT are associated with poststroke depression (PSD) in stroke survivors. A case-control study in which stroke survivors were screened for depressive symptoms and assigned to either a depressed group or a nondepressed group. Outpatient clinic. Seventy-five stroke survivors with PSD and 75 nondepressed stroke survivors. Blood or saliva samples were collected from each participant for DNA extraction and genotyping. The associations between the 5-HTTLPR, STin2 VNTR, and rs25531 polymorphisms and PSD. Individuals with the 5-HTTLPR s/s genotype had 3-fold higher odds of PSD compared with l/l or l/xl genotype carriers (odds ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-8.3). Participants with the STin2 9/12 or 12/12 genotype had 4-fold higher odds of PSD compared with STin2 10/10 genotype carriers (odds ratio, 4.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-13.6). An association of rs25531 with PSD was not shown. The 5-HTTLPR and the STin2 VNTR, but not the rs25531, polymorphisms of SERT are associated with PSD in stroke survivors. This gives further evidence of a role of SERT polymorphisms in mediating resilience to biopsychosocial stress. 	Arch._Gen._Psychiatry	D016428 D052061 D013486
18944551	20081024	A Point Mutation in the FRNK Motif of the Potyvirus Helper Component-Protease Gene Alters Symptom Expression in Cucurbits and Elicits Protection Against the Severe Homologous Virus.	Sequence comparison had previously shown three amino acid changes in conserved motifs in the 455-amino acid sequence of the helper component-protease (HC-Pro) between a severe field strain of Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV-NAT) and a mild field strain of ZYMV (ZYMV-WK). In this study, exchange of fragments and site-directed mutagenesis within the HC-Pro gene in an infectious clone of ZYMV enabled the effects of the mutations on symptom expression to be mapped. The substitution of Ile for Arg at position 180 in the conserved motif Phe-Arg-Asn-Lys (FRNK) of potyviruses was found to affect symptom expression. Infection of cucurbits with the engineered ZYMV (ZYMV-AG) that contained this mutation caused a dramatic symptom change from severe to mild in squash and to a symptom-free appearance in cucumber, melon, and watermelon. The Ile to Arg mutation was found to be stable, and no revertant virus was found after several passages through plants after long incubation periods. The AG strain was detected 4 days postinoculation and accumulated in cucurbits to a level and with kinetics similar to that of the wild-type ZYMV-AT strain. Cucurbit plants infected with the AG strain were protected against infection by the severe strain. 	Phytopathology	D016428
21205307	20110106	Time-series clustering of gene expression in irradiated and bystander fibroblasts: an application of FBPA clustering.	The radiation bystander effect is an important component of the overall biological response of tissues and organisms to ionizing radiation, but the signaling mechanisms between irradiated and non-irradiated bystander cells are not fully understood. In this study, we measured a time-series of gene expression after ?-particle irradiation and applied the Feature Based Partitioning around medoids Algorithm (FBPA), a new clustering method suitable for sparse time series, to identify signaling modules that act in concert in the response to direct irradiation and bystander signaling. We compared our results with those of an alternate clustering method, Short Time series Expression Miner (STEM). While computational evaluations of both clustering results were similar, FBPA provided more biological insight. After irradiation, gene clusters were enriched for signal transduction, cell cycle/cell death and inflammation/immunity processes; but only FBPA separated clusters by function. In bystanders, gene clusters were enriched for cell communication/motility, signal transduction and inflammation processes; but biological functions did not separate as clearly with either clustering method as they did in irradiated samples. Network analysis confirmed p53 and NF-?B transcription factor-regulated gene clusters in irradiated and bystander cells and suggested novel regulators, such as KDM5B/JARID1B (lysine (K)-specific demethylase 5B) and HDACs (histone deacetylases), which could epigenetically coordinate gene expression after irradiation. In this study, we have shown that a new time series clustering method, FBPA, can provide new leads to the mechanisms regulating the dynamic cellular response to radiation. The findings implicate epigenetic control of gene expression in addition to transcription factor networks. 	BMC_Genomics	D016428 D052061 D013487
25136511	20140820	Highly conserved salt bridge stabilizes a proteinase K subfamily enzyme, Aqualysin I, from Thermus aquaticus YT-1.	The proteinase K subfamily enzymes, thermophilic Aqualysin I (AQN) from Thermus aquaticus YT-1 and psychrophilic serine protease (VPR) from Vibrio sp. PA-44, have six and seven salt bridges, respectively. To understand the possible significance of salt bridges in the thermal stability of AQN, we prepared mutant proteins in which amino acid residues participating in salt bridges common to proteinase K subfamily members and intrinsic to AQN were replaced to disrupt the bridges one at a time. Disruption of a salt bridge common to proteinase K subfamily enzymes in the D183N mutant resulted in a significant reduction in thermal stability, and a massive change in the content of the secondary structure was observed, even at 70?C, in the circular dichroism (CD) analysis. These results indicate that the common salt bridge Asp183-Arg12 is important in maintaining the conformation of proteinase K subfamily enzymes and suggest the importance of proximity between the regions around Asp183 and the N-terminal region around Arg12. Of the three mutants that lack an AQN intrinsic salt bridge, D212N was more prone to unfolding at 80?C than the wild-type enzyme. Similarly, D17N and E237Q were less thermostable than the wild-type enzyme, although this may be partially due to increased autolysis. The AQN intrinsic salt bridges appear to confer additional thermal stability to this enzyme. These findings will further our understanding of the factors involved in stabilizing protein structure.

23348041	20130126	Discovery of MicroRNA169 gene copies in genomes of flowering plants through positional information.	Expansion and contraction of microRNA (miRNA) families can be studied in sequenced plant genomes through sequence alignments. Here, we focused on miR169 in sorghum because of its implications in drought tolerance and stem-sugar content. We were able to discover many miR169 copies that have escaped standard genome annotation methods. A new miR169 cluster was found on sorghum chromosome 1. This cluster is composed of the previously annotated sbi-MIR169o together with two newly found MIR169 copies, named sbi-MIR169t and sbi-MIR169u. We also found that a miR169 cluster on sorghum chr7 consisting of sbi-MIR169l, sbi-MIR169m, and sbi-MIR169n is contained within a chromosomal inversion of at least 500 kb that occurred in sorghum relative to Brachypodium, rice, foxtail millet, and maize. Surprisingly, synteny of chromosomal segments containing MIR169 copies with linked bHLH and CONSTANS-LIKE genes extended from Brachypodium to dictotyledonous species such as grapevine, soybean, and cassava, indicating a strong conservation of linkages of certain flowering and/or plant height genes and microRNAs, which may explain linkage drag of drought and flowering traits and would have consequences for breeding new varieties. Furthermore, alignment of rice and sorghum orthologous regions revealed the presence of two additional miR169 gene copies (miR169r and miR169s) on sorghum chr7 that formed an antisense miRNA gene pair. Both copies are expressed and target different set of genes. Synteny-based analysis of microRNAs among different plant species should lead to the discovery of new microRNAs in general and contribute to our understanding of their evolution.

20857128	20100922	A novel splice-site mutation of ATP2A2 gene in a Chinese family with Darier disease.	Darier disease (DD; OMIM 124200) is a rare, autosomal dominant hereditary skin disorder characterized by abnormal keratinization and acantholysis. The causes of DD are defects in the ATP2A2 gene, which encodes the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase isoform 2 (SERCA2). The aim of this study was to report a novel splice-site mutation and to examine the relative quantity expression of ATP2A2 gene in a Chinese family with DD. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out to amplify the exons and flanking intron boundaries of the ATP2A2 gene followed by direct sequencing. A novel splice-site mutation (IVS20-6T&gt;A) was found in the family, which was confirmed by creating a novel HinfI (NEB Inc) recognition site and RT-PCR. Real-time quantitative PCR showed approximately 53 and 52% reduction of ATP2A2 expression of the proband and his father, respectively. The results support the proposition that haploinsufficiency is a common mechanism for the dominant inheritance of DD. 	Arch._Dermatol._Res.	D002363 D016428 D013485
24326380	20131212	Novel PHKG2 mutation causing GSD IX with prominent liver disease: report of three cases and review of literature.	Glycogen storage disease type IX (GSD IX) is a common form of glycogenosis due to mutations in PHKA1, PHKA2, or PHKB and PHKG2 genes resulting in the deficiency of phosphorylase kinase. The first two genes are X-linked while the latter two follow an autosomal recessive inheritance. The majority of cases of GSD IX are attributed to defects in PHKA2 which usually cause a mild disease. We report three patients with PHKG2-related GSD IX presenting with significant hepatic involvement, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Interestingly, the homozygosity mapping resolved a dilemma about an erroneously normal phosphorylase kinase activity in patient 1. The novel mutation found in all the three patients (p.G220E) affects the catalytic subunit of the phosphorylase kinase. Increasing evidence shows that patients with PHKG2 mutations have a severe hepatic phenotype within the heterogeneous GSD IX disorder. Therefore, defect in PHKG2 should be considered in patients with suspected glycogenosis associated with significant liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. 	Eur._J._Pediatr.	D002363 D016428 D016454
10570052	19991126	Site-directed mutagenesis reveals two epitopes involved in the subtype selectivity of the allosteric interactions of gallamine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.	Gallamine allosterically modulates the binding of classical muscarinic ligands with a potency order of M(2) &gt; M(1),M(4) &gt; M(3), M(5). We have suggested previously that the M(2)/M(5) and M(2)/M(3) selectivities are attributable to an epitope in the sixth transmembrane region or third outer loop (o3) region of the receptor. In this study, analysis of numerous point mutations in this region of the M(5) receptor found that a mutation of V --&gt; N resulted in an increased affinity toward gallamine, suggesting that the asparagine residue at M(2)(419) is responsible for gallamine's M(2)/M(5) selectivity. Mutations in the other subtypes indicated that the acidic residues found at this position in M(1) and M(4) are associated with slightly higher affinity toward gallamine, whereas the valine and lysine residues of M(5) and M(3), respectively, are associated with significantly lower affinity. In the o2 region, replacement of an acidic sequence of M(2) (EDGE) by the corresponding neutral sequence of M(1) (LAGQ) reduced the affinity toward gallamine, as reported previously by others; the converse substitution of the acidic sequence into M(1) significantly increased affinity for gallamine. Substitution of the M(1) sequence into this region of M(5) markedly reduced affinity toward gallamine, whereas substitution into M(4) had no effect. All of the above mutations are consistent with gallamine binding with a similar orientation at each subtype, such that it interacts with acidic residues in the o2 region of M(3) and M(5) and with acidic residues in the o3 region of M(1) and M(4); gallamine appears to interact with both regions of the M(2) subtype.

16348734	19920701	Production of Dihomo-gamma-Linolenic Acid by a Delta5-Desaturase-Defective Mutant of Mortierella alpina 1S-4.	A mutant, which has low Delta5-desaturase activity, of an arachidonic acid-producing fungus, Mortierella alpina 1S-4, was shown to be a novel potent producer of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DHGA). On submerged culture under optimal conditions for 6 days at 28 degrees C in a 10-liter fermentor, the mutant produced 3.2 g of DHGA per liter of culture broth (123 mg/g of dry mycelia), which accounted for 23.4% of the total mycelial fatty acids. Mycelial arachidonic acid amounted to only 19 mg/g of dry mycelia (0.5 g/liter of culture broth), which accounted for 3.7% of the total mycelial fatty acids. The other major mycelial fatty acids were palmitic acid (11.0%), stearic acid (12.8%), oleic acid (22.7%), linoleic acid (8.9%), gamma-linolenic acid (6.5%), and lignoceric acid (7.8%). More than 97 mol% of the DHGA produced was found in the triglyceride fraction irrespective of the growth temperature employed (12 to 28 degrees C). 	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428
20876362	20100930	An improved open-channel structure of MscL determined from FRET confocal microscopy and simulation.	Mechanosensitive channels act as molecular transducers of mechanical force exerted on the membrane of living cells by opening in response to membrane bilayer deformations occurring in physiological processes such as touch, hearing, blood pressure regulation, and osmoregulation. Here, we determine the likely structure of the open state of the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance using a combination of patch clamp, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectroscopy, data from previous electron paramagnetic resonance experiments, and molecular and Brownian dynamics simulations. We show that structural rearrangements of the protein can be measured in similar conditions as patch clamp recordings while controlling the state of the pore in its natural lipid environment by modifying the lateral pressure distribution via the lipid bilayer. Transition to the open state is less dramatic than previously proposed, while the N terminus remains anchored at the surface of the membrane where it can either guide the tilt of or directly translate membrane tension to the conformation of the pore-lining helix. Combining FRET data obtained in physiological conditions with simulations is likely to be of great value for studying conformational changes in a range of multimeric membrane proteins.

20445432	20100507	A case of paramyotonia congenita without periodic paralysis: electrophysiological and molecular genetic studies.	Paramyotonia congenita (PC), first described in 1886 by Eulenberg, is characterized by cold and exercise-induced muscle stiffness and intermittent flaccid paresis not necessarily related to cold or myotonia. Several authors segregated a pure form of PC, which has no periodic paralysis, even after cold exposure. The existence of this phenotype has been debated in the literature. We describe electrophysiological and molecular genetic features of a patient with PC who had no history of periodic paralysis. Immersion in cold water or potassium load could not induce clinical paralysis. However, repetitive nerve stimulation and exercise test demonstrated a drop in compound muscle action potential amplitude. Genetic analysis revealed the substitution of valine for glycine on the human skeletal muscle sodium channel (SCN4A) gene. The G1306V mutation is rare in the classic form of PC, and moreover might be the first in pure paramyotonia. 	Neurologist	D002363 D016428
10455106	19990824	Characterization of the product-inhibited complex in catalysis by human manganese superoxide dismutase.	The reduction with excess H(2)O(2) of human Mn(III) superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the active-site mutant Y34F Mn(III)SOD was measured by scanning stopped-flow spectrophotometry and revealed the presence of an intermediate in the reduction of the manganese. The visible absorption spectrum of this intermediate closely resembled that of the enzyme in the inhibited, zero-order phase of the catalyzed disproportionation of superoxide. The decay of the visible spectrum of this intermediate was 2-fold faster for the wild-type compared with the mutant Y34F Mn-SOD. This correlates with the enhanced product inhibition of Y34F during the catalysis of O-(2) dismutation. The visible spectrum of the product-inhibited complex resembles that of the azide-Mn-SOD complex, suggesting that the inhibited complex has expanded geometry about the metal to octahedral. This study shows that the inhibited complex responsible for the zero-order phase in the catalysis by Mn-SOD of superoxide dismutation can be reached through both the forward (O-(2)) and reverse (H(2)O(2)) reactions, supporting a mechanism in which the zero-order phase results from product inhibition.

27101285	20160422	Circulating Tumor Cell Composition in Renal Cell Carcinoma.	Due to their minimal-invasive yet potentially current character circulating tumor cells (CTC) might be useful as a &quot;liquid biopsy&quot; in solid tumors. However, successful application in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has been very limited so far. High plasticity and heterogeneity of CTC morphology challenges currently available enrichment and detection techniques with EpCAM as the usual surface marker being underrepresented in mRCC. We recently described a method that enables us to identify and characterize non-hematopoietic cells in the peripheral blood stream with varying characteristics and define CTC subgroups that distinctly associate to clinical parameters. With this pilot study we wanted to scrutinize feasibility of this approach and its potential usage in clinical studies. Peripheral blood was drawn from 14 consecutive mRCC patients at the West German Cancer Center and CTC profiles were analyzed by Multi-Parameter Immunofluorescence Microscopy (MPIM). Additionally angiogenesis-related genes were measured by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. We detected CTC with epithelial, mesenchymal, stem cell-like or mixed-cell characteristics at different time-points during anti-angiogenic therapy. The presence and quantity of N-cadherin-positive or CD133-positive CTC was associated with inferior PFS. There was an inverse correlation between high expression of HIF1A, VEGFA, VEGFR and FGFR and the presence of N-cadherin-positive and CD133-positive CTC. Patients with mRCC exhibit distinct CTC profiles that may implicate differences in therapeutic outcome. Prospective evaluation of phenotypic and genetic CTC profiling as prognostic and predictive biomarker in mRCC is warranted. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
24867629	20140529	Enhancing the thermostability of a cold-active lipase from Penicillium cyclopium by in silico design of a disulfide bridge.	Cysteine mutants of a cold-active lipase (PcLipI) from Penicillium cyclopium were designed by the software Disulfide by Design Ver. 1.20 in an effort to improve enzyme thermostability by addition of a disulfide bridge. Those mutants predicted by molecular dynamics simulation to have better thermostability than the wild type were first expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and then, for further investigation, in Pichia pastoris GS115. By replacing Val248 and Thr251 with cysteines to create a disulfide bridge, the recombinant lipases reE-PcLipV248C-T251C (expressed in E. coli) and reP-PcLipV248C-T251C (expressed in P. pastoris) were obtained. Both had enhanced thermostability with half-lives at 35 ?C about 4.5- and 12.8-fold longer than that of the parent PcLipI expressed in E. coli and P. pastoris, respectively. The temperature optima of reE-PcLipV248C-T251C and reP-PcLipV248C-T251C were 35 and 30 ?C, which were each 5 ?C higher than those of the parent PcLipI expressed in E. coli and P. pastoris.

21650463	20110610	Self-assembly of polyion-surfactant ion complex salts in mixtures with water and n-alcohols.	Phase behavior and structural features were investigated for &quot;complex salts&quot;, consisting of the cationic hexadecyltrimethylammonium (CTA) surfactant with polyacrylate (PA(n), n = 30 or 6000) counterions, mixed with water and different n-alcohols (ethanol, butanol, hexanol, octanol, and decanol). The liquid crystalline structures formed were identified by small-angle X-ray scattering measurements, which provided information about the changes in the geometry of the aggregates as functions of the concentration and chain length of the added n-alcohol. The obtained results were compared with a previous work on similar ternary mixtures of the same cationic surfactant but with the monomeric bromide counterion, CTABr (Fontell, K.; Khan, A.; Lindstr?m, B.; Maciejewska, D.; Puang-Ngern, S. Colloid Polym. Sci., 1991, 269, 727). In general, the same phases were detected in systems with the complex salts CTAPA(n) as in systems with CTABr, but the swelling of the various liquid crystalline phases by water was much more limited in the complex salt systems. An isotropic alcoholic phase was observed with all alcohols and the size of this region of the phase diagram increased for the shorter alcohols, except for ethanol. For mixtures with octanol and ethanol, in particular, the extensions of the disordered isotropic phases were larger for the complex salt with the shorter polyacrylate ions. 	J_Phys_Chem_B	D016428
25713336	20150226	Associations of non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) risk with autoimmune conditions according to putative NHL loci.	Autoimmune conditions and immune system-related genetic variations are associated with risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In a pooled analysis of 8,692 NHL cases and 9,260 controls from 14 studies (1988-2007) within the International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium, we evaluated the interaction between immune system genetic variants and autoimmune conditions in NHL risk. We evaluated the immunity-related single nucleotide polymorphisms rs1800629 (tumor necrosis factor gene (TNF) G308A), rs1800890 (interleukin-10 gene (IL10) T3575A), rs6457327 (human leukocyte antigen gene (HLA) class I), rs10484561 (HLA class II), and rs2647012 (HLA class II)) and categorized autoimmune conditions as primarily mediated by B-cell or T-cell responses. We constructed unconditional logistic regression models to measure associations between autoimmune conditions and NHL with stratification by genotype. Autoimmune conditions mediated by B-cell responses were associated with increased NHL risk, specifically diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (odds ratio (OR) = 3.11, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.25, 4.30) and marginal zone lymphoma (OR = 5.80, 95% CI: 3.82, 8.80); those mediated by T-cell responses were associated with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (OR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.35, 3.38). In the presence of the rs1800629 AG/AA genotype, B-cell-mediated autoimmune conditions increased NHL risk (OR = 3.27, 95% CI: 2.07, 5.16; P-interaction = 0.03) in comparison with the GG genotype (OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.31, 2.53). This interaction was consistent across major B-cell NHL subtypes, including marginal zone lymphoma (P-interaction = 0.02) and follicular lymphoma (P-interaction = 0.04). 	Am._J._Epidemiol.

21468304	20110407	HIV-1 drug resistance emergence among breastfeeding infants born to HIV-infected mothers during a single-arm trial of triple-antiretroviral prophylaxis for prevention of mother-to-child transmission: a secondary analysis.	Nevirapine and lamivudine given to mothers are transmitted to infants via breastfeeding in quantities sufficient to have biologic effects on the virus; this may lead to an increased risk of a breastfed infant's development of resistance to maternal antiretrovirals. The Kisumu Breastfeeding Study (KiBS), a single-arm open-label prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) trial, assessed the safety and efficacy of zidovudine, lamivudine, and either nevirapine or nelfinavir given to HIV-infected women from 34 wk gestation through 6 mo of breastfeeding. Here, we present findings from a KiBS trial secondary analysis that evaluated the emergence of maternal ARV-associated resistance among 32 HIV-infected breastfed infants. All infants in the cohort were tested for HIV infection using DNA PCR at multiple study visits during the 24 mo of the study, and plasma RNA viral load for all HIV-PCR-positive infants was evaluated retrospectively. Specimens from mothers and infants with viral load &gt;1,000 copies/ml were tested for HIV drug resistance mutations. Overall, 32 infants were HIV infected by 24 mo of age, and of this group, 24 (75%) infants were HIV infected by 6 mo of age. Of the 24 infants infected by 6 mo, nine were born to mothers on a nelfinavir-based regimen, whereas the remaining 15 were born to mothers on a nevirapine-based regimen. All infants were also given single-dose nevirapine within 48 hours of birth. We detected genotypic resistance mutations in none of eight infants who were HIV-PCR positive by 2 wk of age (specimens from six infants were not amplifiable), for 30% (6/20) at 6 wk, 63% (14/22) positive at 14 wk, and 67% (16/24) at 6 mo post partum. Among the 16 infants with resistance mutations by 6 mo post partum, the common mutations were M184V and K103N, conferring resistance to lamivudine and nevirapine, respectively. Genotypic resistance was detected among 9/9 (100%) and 7/15 (47%) infected infants whose mothers were on nelfinavir and nevirapine, respectively. No mutations were detected among the eight infants infected after the breastfeeding period (age 6 mo). Emergence of HIV drug resistance mutations in HIV-infected infants occurred between 2 wk and 6 mo post partum, most likely because of exposure to maternal ARV drugs through breast milk. Our findings may impact the choice of regimen for ARV treatment of HIV-infected breastfeeding mothers and their infected infants. 	PLoS_Med.	D016430 D016428 D013487
27196483	20160520	Evaluation of an Association of Blood Homocysteine Levels With Gastric Cancer Risk From 27 Case-Control Studies.	High blood homocysteine levels may risk gastric cancer. However, observational studies have been plagued by chance, bias, confounding, or reverse causality. In this study, we assessed the relationship between blood homocysteine levels and gastric cancer by using a Mendelian randomization method, which is independent of nongenetic confounding.We took 2 steps to perform Mendelian randomization analysis. First, we evaluated the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T association with gastric cancer by a meta-analysis of case-control studies including 7566 patients with gastric cancer and 10 640 control subjects from 27 Case-Control studies. Second, MTHFR C677T polymorphism, which affects the blood homocysteine levels, was used as an instrumental variable to calculate the risk and estimate the association of gastric cancer with this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). We obtained an estimate to the association of blood total homocysteine levels with this SNP from a meta-analysis of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), which comprises a total of 44 147 individuals.In our Mendelian randomization analysis, we demonstrated a significant effect of the blood homocysteine levels on gastric cancer risk, representing an OR of 2.56 (95% CI?=?2.41-2.72; P?=?5.0?10) for gastric cancer per 1-SD increase in the natural log-transformed blood total homocysteine levels.We proved that there is a causal relationship between blood total homocysteine and risk of gastric cancer, and this study will add insight into the treatment and pathology research of gastric cancer.

20880831	20101001	Structural and functional studies on the extracellular domain of BST2/tetherin in reduced and oxidized conformations.	HIV-1 and other enveloped viruses can be restricted by a host cellular protein called BST2/tetherin that prevents release of budded viruses from the cell surface. Mature BST2 contains a small cytosolic region, a predicted transmembrane helix, and an extracellular domain with a C-terminal GPI anchor. To advance understanding of BST2 function, we have determined a 2.6 ? crystal structure of the extracellular domain of the bacterially expressed recombinant human protein, residues 47-152, under reducing conditions. The structure forms a single long helix that associates as a parallel dimeric coiled coil over its C-terminal two-thirds, while the N-terminal third forms an antiparallel four-helix bundle with another dimer, creating a global tetramer. We also report the 3.45 ? resolution structure of BST2(51-151) prepared by expression as a secreted protein in HEK293T cells. This oxidized construct forms a dimer in the crystal that is superimposable with the reduced protein over the C-terminal two-thirds of the molecule, and its N terminus suggests pronounced flexibility. Hydrodynamic data demonstrated that BST2 formed a stable tetramer under reducing conditions and a dimer when oxidized to form disulfide bonds. A mutation that selectively disrupted the tetramer (L70D) increased protein expression modestly but only reduced antiviral activity by approximately threefold. Our data raise the possibility that BST2 may function as a tetramer at some stage, such as during trafficking, and strongly support a model in which the primary functional state of BST2 is a parallel disulfide-bound coiled coil that displays flexibility toward its N terminus.

7558035	19950610	Human fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene (FBP1): exon-intron organization, localization to chromosome bands 9q22.2-q22.3, and mutation screening in subjects with fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase deficiency.	Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) is a key regulatory enzyme of gluconeogenesis that catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to generate fructose-6-phosphate and inorganic phosphate. Deficiency of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is associated with fasting hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis because of impaired gluconeogenesis. We have cloned and characterized the human liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene (FBP1). FBP1, localized to chromosome bands 9q22.2-q22.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization, consists of seven exons that span &gt; 31 kb, and the six introns are in the same position as in the rat gene. FBP1 was screened for mutations in two subjects with fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase deficiency. Four nucleotide substitutions were identified, two of which were silent mutations in the codons for Ala-216 (GCT--&gt;GCC) and Gly-319 (GGG--&gt;GGA). The other substitutions were in intron 3, a C--&gt;T substitution 7 nucleotides downstream from the splice donor site, and in the promoter region, an A--&gt;T substitution 188 nucleotides upstream from the start of transcription. These nucleotide substitutions were also found in normal unaffected subjects and thus are not the cause of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase deficiency in the two subjects studied. The molecular basis of hepatic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase deficiency in these subjects remains undetermined but could result from unidentified mutations in the promoter that decrease expression or from mutations in another gene that indirectly lead to decreased fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity.

26313611	20150828	Identification of amino acid residues of AcMNPV P143 protein involved in rRNA degradation and restricted viral replication in BM-N cells from the silkworm Bombyx mori.	We previously demonstrated that rRNA undergoes rapid and extensive degradation in Bombyx mori BM-N cells upon infection with AcMNPV, which is triggered by AcMNPV P143 (Ac-P143) protein. Here, we showed that six amino acid residues of Ac-P143 protein, distributing between positions 514 and 599, are involved in rRNA degradation in BM-N cells. The six residues are highly conserved among P143 proteins from AcMNPV, HycuMNPV, SeMNPV and SpltMNPV, which trigger rRNA degradation in BM-N cells upon infection, but are only partially conserved in Bm-P143 protein, which does not induce rRNA degradation in BM-N cells. We also demonstrated that substitution of only two selected residues (N565S/L578F) of Bm-P143 protein with the corresponding Ac-P143 protein residues generates a mutant Bm-P143 protein that is capable of triggering rRNA degradation in BM-N cells. These results indicate that BmNPV evolved a unique P143 protein to evade the antiviral response and allow replication in B. mori cells. 	Virology	D016428 D013485
26395405	20150924	Group-based variant calling leveraging next-generation supercomputing for large-scale whole-genome sequencing studies.	Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have become much more efficient, allowing whole human genomes to be sequenced faster and cheaper than ever before. However, processing the raw sequence reads associated with NGS technologies requires care and sophistication in order to draw compelling inferences about phenotypic consequences of variation in human genomes. It has been shown that different approaches to variant calling from NGS data can lead to different conclusions. Ensuring appropriate accuracy and quality in variant calling can come at a computational cost. We describe our experience implementing and evaluating a group-based approach to calling variants on large numbers of whole human genomes. We explore the influence of many factors that may impact the accuracy and efficiency of group-based variant calling, including group size, the biogeographical backgrounds of the individuals who have been sequenced, and the computing environment used. We make efficient use of the Gordon supercomputer cluster at the San Diego Supercomputer Center by incorporating job-packing and parallelization considerations into our workflow while calling variants on 437 whole human genomes generated as part of large association study. We ultimately find that our workflow resulted in high-quality variant calls in a computationally efficient manner. We argue that studies like ours should motivate further investigations combining hardware-oriented advances in computing systems with algorithmic developments to tackle emerging 'big data' problems in biomedical research brought on by the expansion of NGS technologies.

20536985	20100612	HLA-DR-restricted T-cell responses to factor VIII epitopes in a mild haemophilia A family with missense substitution A2201P.	An HLA-DRA-DRB1*0101-restricted T-cell epitope in the factor VIII (FVIII) C2 domain occurred in a mild haemophilia A patient with missense substitution FVIII-A2201P. His T cells responded to synthetic peptides FVIII(2186-2205) and FVIII(2194-2213) (J Thromb Haemost 2007; 5: 2399). T cells from family members with genotype FVIII-A2201P were analysed to determine if FVIII-specific T cells occur in individuals with a haemophilic mutation but no clinically significant inhibitor response. Fluorescent MHC class II tetramers corresponding to subjects'HLA-DRB1 types were loaded with 20-mer peptides and utilized to label antigen-specific CD4+ T cells. T-cell responses to peptides spanning the FVIII-C2 sequence were evaluated. T cells recognizing specific peptides were cloned, and antigen specificity was verified by proliferation assays. Plasma and/or purified IgG samples were tested for FVIII inhibitory activity. CD4+ T cells and T-cell clones from two brothers who shared the DRB1*0101 allele responded to FVIII(2194-2213). A haemophilic cousin's HLA-DRA-DRB1*1104-restricted response to FVIII(2202-2221) was detected only when CD4+CD25+ cells were depleted. A great uncle and two obligate carriers had no detectable FVIII-C2-specific T cells. Concentrated IgG from the brother without a clinical inhibitor response showed a low-titre FVIII inhibitor. FVIII-specific T cells and inhibitory IgG were found in a previously infused, haemophilic subject who had a sub-clinical FVIII inhibitor. CD4+CD25+ depleted T cells from a non-infused haemophilic cousin recognized an overlapping FVIII epitope, indicating a latent HLA-DRA-DRB1*1104-restricted T-cell response to FVIII. Specific T-cell responses to FVIII can occur without clinically significant inhibitors. 	Haemophilia	D016428 D052061 D013485
11590151	20011009	Residual structure and dynamics in Parkinson's disease-associated mutants of alpha-synuclein.	alpha-Synuclein (alpha S) is a pre-synaptic protein that has been implicated as a possible causative agent in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Two autosomal dominant missense mutations in the alpha S gene are associated with early onset PD. Because alpha S is found in an aggregated fibrillar form in the Lewy body deposits characteristic of Parkinson's patients, aggregation of the protein is believed to be related to its involvement in the disease process. The wild type (WT) and early onset mutants A30P and A53T display diverse in vitro aggregation kinetics even though the gross physicochemical and morphological properties of the mutants are highly similar. We used high resolution solution NMR spectroscopy to compare the structural and dynamic properties of the A53T and A30P mutants with those of WT alpha S in the free state. We found that the A30P mutation disrupts a region of residual helical structure that exists in the WT protein, whereas the A53T mutation results in a slight enhancement of a small region around the site of mutation with a preference for extended conformations. Based on these results and on the anticipated effects of these mutations on elements of secondary structure, we proposed a model of how these two PD-linked mutations influence alpha S fibril formation that is consistent with the documented differences in the fibrillization kinetics of the two mutants.

24832020	20140517	Mutation screening of the neurexin 1 gene in thai patients with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder.	Neurexin 1 has two major protein isoforms using alternative promoters, coding for the alpha-neurexin 1 (?-NRXN1) and beta-neurexin 1 (?-NRXN1) genes. This study is to explore the possibility that variants of the NRXN1 gene predispose to intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The coding regions in 24 exons and exon-intron boundaries of the NRXN1 gene were investigated in 115 Thai patients with ID and ASD by direct DNA sequencing. Nine novel variants of the NRXN1 gene were identified. Four novel variants were found in the ?-NRXN1 gene, one variant of six GGC repeats in exon 1, and three variants at the 5'UTR. Five novel variants were identified in the ?-NRXN1 gene, four intronic variants and one missense variant in exon 14 (c.2713T&gt;A or p.F905I). Mutation screening of the NRXN1gene in patients with ID and ASD may be useful to identify potential variants predisposing to ID and ASD. However, further studies utilizing protein functional analysis of the novel variants are required for a more definite conclusion. 	Genet_Test_Mol_Biomarkers	D016428 D013485
8399358	19931020	Pedigree analysis of alpha-L-fucosidase gene mutations in a fucosidosis family.	Fucosidosis is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease resulting from absence of alpha-L-fucosidase activity. Lymphoid cell lines from two siblings with fucosidosis and a healthy individual (control) had alpha-L-fucosidase mRNA of normal size (2.3 kb) but the level of alpha-L-fucosidase mRNA in the patients' cells was reduced. cDNA was prepared and amplified from alpha-L-fucosidase mRNA of lymphoid cells of the patients, their carrier parents, and the control. Direct DNA sequencing demonstrated three mutations in the fucosidosis family. One mutation, C1282--&gt;T, changed the codon (CAA) for Gln-422 to a stop codon (UAA). This mutation was heterozygous (C and T) in the patients and their father and independently confirms an earlier report (J. Mol. Neurosci. (1989) 1, 177). Another mutation, C247--&gt;T, changed the codon (CAG) for Gln-77 to a stop codon (UAG) and was heterozygous (C and T) in the patients and their mother. The third mutation, A860--&gt;G, changed the codon CAG for Gln-281 to the codon (CGG) for Arg and was heterozygous (A and G) in the patients but homozygous in their father. alpha-L-Fucosidase activity in cells of the father was 37% of controls indicating that homozygosity of the A860--&gt;G mutation did not cause an absence of alpha-L-fucosidase activity and fucosidosis. This mutation probably results in a normal polymorphic variant of alpha-L-fucosidase. It is proposed that the combination of the C247--&gt;T mutation on the maternal allele of the alpha-L-fucosidase gene and the C1282--&gt;T mutation on the paternal allele caused fucosidosis in the patients.

10964697	20000831	Functional analysis of five endothelin-B receptor mutations found in human Hirschsprung disease patients.	Several missense mutations of the endothelin-B receptor (EDNRB) associated with Hirschsprung disease have recently been identified. Five mutated EDNRB (A183G, W276C, R319W, M374I and P383L) cDNAs were transiently expressed in several cell lines to examine the effects of these mutations. Ligand-receptor binding experiments demonstrated that all mutants examined here accept endothelins with a high affinity. Especially, the affinity of endothelins to P383L was increased. However, the number of binding sites of A183G, W276C and P383L was markedly decreased. The subcellular localization of these mutant receptors was the same as that of wild-type EDNRB, whereas the amount of protein of each mutant receptor was decreased. All mutant receptors were impaired in intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization. These findings indicate that these missense mutations result in loss of function of EDNRB, and may provide the molecular pathological basis of Hirschsprung disease in some individuals.

19849829	20091024	Identification and analysis of serpin-family genes by homology and synteny across the 12 sequenced Drosophilid genomes.	The Drosophila melanogaster genome contains 29 serpin genes, 12 as single transcripts and 17 within 6 gene clusters. Many of these serpins have a conserved &quot;hinge&quot; motif characteristic of active proteinase inhibitors. However, a substantial proportion (42%) lacks this motif and represents non-inhibitory serpin-fold proteins of unknown function. Currently, it is not known whether orthologous, inhibitory serpin genes retain the same target proteinase specificity within the Drosophilid lineage, nor whether they give rise to non-inhibitory serpin-fold proteins or other, more diverged, proteins. We collated 188 orthologues to the D. melanogaster serpins from the other 11 Drosophilid genomes and used synteny to find further family members, raising the total to 226, or 71% of the number of orthologues expected assuming complete conservation across all 12 Drosophilid species. In general the sequence constraints on the serpin-fold itself are loose. The critical Reactive Centre Loop (RCL) sequence, including the target proteinase cleavage site, is strongly conserved in inhibitory serpins, although there are 3 exceptional sets of orthologues in which the evolutionary constraints are looser. Conversely, the RCL of non-inhibitory serpin orthologues is less conserved, with 3 exceptions that presumably bind to conserved partner molecules. We derive a consensus hinge motif, for Drosophilid inhibitory serpins, which differs somewhat from that of the vertebrate consensus. Three gene clusters appear to have originated in the melanogaster subgroup, Spn28D, Spn77B and Spn88E, each containing one inhibitory serpin orthologue that is present in all Drosophilids. In addition, the Spn100A transcript appears to represent a novel serpin-derived fold. In general, inhibitory serpins rarely change their range of proteinase targets, except by a duplication/divergence mechanism. Non-inhibitory serpins appear to derive from inhibitory serpins, but not the reverse. The conservation of different family members varied widely across the 12 sequenced Drosophilid genomes. An approach considering synteny as well as homology was important to find the largest set of orthologues. 	BMC_Genomics	D016428 D013485
23997099	20130903	LQT2 nonsense mutations generate trafficking defective NH2-terminally truncated channels by the reinitiation of translation.	The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) encodes a voltage-activated K(+) channel that contributes to the repolarization of the cardiac action potential. Long QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in hERG, and patients with LQT2 are susceptible to severe ventricular arrhythmias. We have previously shown that nonsense and frameshift LQT2 mutations caused a decrease in mutant mRNA by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. The Q81X nonsense mutation was recently found to be resistant to NMD. Translation of Q81X is reinitiated at Met(124), resulting in the generation of NH2-terminally truncated hERG channels with altered gating properties. In the present study, we identified two additional NMD-resistant LQT2 nonsense mutations, C39X and C44X, in which translation is reinitiated at Met(60). Deletion of the first 59 residues of the channel truncated nearly one-third of the highly structured Per-Arnt-Sim domain and resulted in the generation of trafficking-defective proteins and a complete loss of hERG current. Partial deletion of the Per-Arnt-Sim domain also resulted in the accelerated degradation of the mutant channel proteins. The coexpression of mutant and wild-type channels did not significantly disrupt the function and trafficking properties of wild-type hERG. Our present findings indicate that translation reinitiation may generate trafficking-defective as well as dysfunctional channels in patients with LQT2 premature termination codon mutations that occur early in the coding sequence.

19146710	20090117	Characterization and comparative profiling of the small RNA transcriptomes in two phases of locust.	All the reports on insect small RNAs come from holometabolous insects whose genome sequence data are available. Therefore, study of hemimetabolous insect small RNAs could provide more insights into evolution and function of small RNAs in insects. The locust is an important, economically harmful hemimetabolous insect. Its phase changes, as a phenotypic plasticity, result from differential gene expression potentially regulated at both the post-transcriptional level, mediated by small RNAs, and the transcriptional level. Here, using high-throughput sequencing, we characterize the small RNA transcriptome in the locust. We identified 50 conserved microRNA families by similarity searching against miRBase, and a maximum of 185 potential locust-specific microRNA family candidates were identified using our newly developed method independent of locust genome sequence. We also demonstrate conservation of microRNA*, and evolutionary analysis of locust microRNAs indicates that the generation of miRNAs in locusts is concentrated along three phylogenetic tree branches: bilaterians, coelomates, and insects. Our study identified thousands of endogenous small interfering RNAs, some of which were of transposon origin, and also detected many Piwi-interacting RNA-like small RNAs. Comparison of small RNA expression patterns of the two phases showed that longer small RNAs were expressed more abundantly in the solitary phase and that each category of small RNAs exhibited different expression profiles between the two phases. The abundance of small RNAs in the locust might indicate a long evolutionary history of post-transcriptional gene expression regulation, and differential expression of small RNAs between the two phases might further disclose the molecular mechanism of phase changes.

25037211	20140720	Functional evidence for the critical amino-terminal conserved domain and key amino acids of Arabidopsis 4-HYDROXY-3-METHYLBUT-2-ENYL DIPHOSPHATE REDUCTASE.	The plant 4-HYDROXY-3-METHYLBUT-2-ENYL DIPHOSPHATE REDUCTASE (HDR) catalyzes the last step of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway to synthesize isopentenyl diphosphate and its allyl isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate, which are common precursors for the synthesis of plastid isoprenoids. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genomic HDR transgene-induced gene-silencing lines are albino, variegated, or pale green, confirming that HDR is essential for plants. We used Escherichia coli isoprenoid synthesis H (Protein Data Bank code 3F7T) as a template for homology modeling to identify key amino acids of Arabidopsis HDR. The predicted model reveals that cysteine (Cys)-122, Cys-213, and Cys-350 are involved in iron-sulfur cluster formation and that histidine (His)-152, His-241, glutamate (Glu)-242, Glu-243, threonine (Thr)-244, Thr-312, serine-379, and asparagine-381 are related to substrate binding or catalysis. Glu-242 and Thr-244 are conserved only in cyanobacteria, green algae, and land plants, whereas the other key amino acids are absolutely conserved from bacteria to plants. We used site-directed mutagenesis and complementation assay to confirm that these amino acids, except His-152 and His-241, were critical for Arabidopsis HDR function. Furthermore, the Arabidopsis HDR contains an extra amino-terminal domain following the transit peptide that is highly conserved from cyanobacteria, and green algae to land plants but not existing in the other bacteria. We demonstrated that the amino-terminal conserved domain was essential for Arabidopsis and cyanobacterial HDR function. Further analysis of conserved amino acids in the amino-terminal conserved domain revealed that the tyrosine-72 residue was critical for Arabidopsis HDR. These results suggest that the structure and reaction mechanism of HDR evolution have become specific for oxygen-evolving photosynthesis organisms and that HDR probably evolved independently in cyanobacteria versus other prokaryotes.

25821965	20150331	Pre-existing mutations in reverse transcriptase of hepatitis B virus in treatment-naive Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B.	High rate of viral replication and lacking of proofreading activity in hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase lead to the generation of mutations in HBV virus. Mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) region of HBV polymerase are demonstrated to be strongly associated with drug resistance during antiviral treatment. However, the presence of mutations as well as its clinical significance in treatment-na?ve hepatitis patients (defined as pre-existing mutations) need to be further investigated. In the present study, a total of 168 serum samples from treatment-naive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients were collected, and the RT region of HBV polymerase was sequenced. The results showed that pre-existing mutations in the RT region of HBV polymerase were detected in 43 of 168 (25.6%) treatment-naive CHB patients within which there were no well-characterized primary nucleotide analogs (NAs) resistance sites. Three dominant sites at rt191, rt207 and rt226 were found mutant in 7(16.28%), 8(18.60%), and 14(32.56%) samples respectively among these 43 patients. No significant correlation was found between pre-existing mutations and gender, age, HBV genotype, ALT, HBeAg or HBV DNA loads. However, patients with pre-existing RT mutations under HBeAg sero-negative status exhibited decreased HBV DNA loads, which contributed to the decreased HBV DNA loads in the total HBeAg sero-negative patients. The above investigation indicated that there was a prevalence of pre-existing mutations in RT region of HBV polymerase which might affect the serum HBV DNA level in treatment-naive CHB patients. Its effects on the occurrence of NAs resistance and the prognosis after treatment need to be further investigated. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
16881803	20060803	Endothelial nitric oxide synthase Glu298Asp gene polymorphism in periodontal diseases.	Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is involved in key steps of immune response. The aim of the present study was to evaluate genotype distribution and genotype-phenotype association in periodontal disease regarding Glu298Asp polymorphism of the eNOS gene. A total of 272 subjects were included into the study. Genomic DNA was obtained from the peripheral blood of 51 chronic periodontitis (CP) patients, 48 generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP), and 173 reference controls. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and subsequent BanII restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis were used to detect eNOS Glu298Asp polymorphism. Probing depth, clinical attachment loss, plaque accumulation, and bleeding on probing (BOP) were recorded. The data were analyzed by the chi2 test, logistic regression, and Mann-Whitney U test. The distributions of eNOS Glu298Asp genotypes and alleles were similar among study groups. Subjects with the Asp allele (Asp+) were statistically higher in the CP group compared to the control group (odds ratio [OR] = 1.957; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.038 to 3.689). In the GAgP group, BOP (%) was significantly higher in patients with the 298Asp allele (Asp+) compared to patients without the Asp allele (Asp-) (P = 0.015). The present study showed that eNOS Glu298Asp polymorphism is associated with BOP in GAgP patients. Moreover, the 298Asp allele of the eNOS gene might be related to CP in the Turkish population.

25389632	20141113	Penetrance and clinical features of pheochromocytoma in a six-generation family carrying a germline TMEM127 mutation.	The phenotype of familial pheochromocytoma (PHEO) associated with germline TMEM127 mutations (TMEM127-related PHEO) has not been clearly defined. This study aimed to investigate the penetrance, full phenotypic spectrum and effectiveness of clinical/genetic screening in TMEM127-related PHEO. Clinical and genetic screening, and genetic counseling were offered to 151 individuals from a six-generation family carrying a TMEM127 germline mutation in a referral center. TMEM127 genetic testing was offered to at-risk relatives and clinical surveillance for pheochromocytoma was performed in mutation-positive carriers. Forty seven individuals carried the c.410-2A&gt;C TMEM127 mutation. Clinical data were obtained from 34 TMEM127-mutation carriers followed up for 8.7 ? 8.1 years (range, 1-20 y). Pheochromocytoma was diagnosed in 11 carriers (32%) at a median age of 43 years. In nine patients, symptoms started at 29 years (range, 10-55 y) and two cases were asymptomatic. Tumors were multicentric in five (45%) and bilateral in five (45%) patients. Six patients (54%) had at least one adrenomedullary nodule less than 10 mm. No paragangliomas, distant metastases, or other manifestations were detected. Cumulative penetrance of pheochromocytoma was 0% at 0-20 years, 3% at 21-30 years, 15% at 31-40 years, 24% at 41-50 years, and 32% at 51-65 years. The youngest case was diagnosed at 22 years and the earliest symptoms were reported at age 10. Tumor multicentricity, nodular adrenomedullary hyperplasia, and the occurrence of symptoms more than a decade earlier than the age at diagnosis are novel findings in TMEM127-related PHEO. The high penetrance of pheochromocytoma in this condition validates the benefits of genetic testing of at-risk relatives. We thus recommend that TMEM127 genetic testing should be offered to at-risk individuals at age 22 years and mutation carriers should undergo clinical surveillance annually.

24771278	20140429	Switching a newly discovered lactonase into an efficient and thermostable phosphotriesterase by simple double mutations His250Ile/Ile263Trp.	OPHC2 is a thermostable organophosphate (OP) hydrolase in the ?-lactamase superfamily. OPs are highly toxic synthetic chemicals with no natural analogs. How did OPHC2 acquire phosphotriesterase (PTE) activity remained unclear. In this study, an OPHC2 analogue, PoOPH was discovered from Pseudomonas oleovorans exhibiting high lactonase and esterase activities and latent PTE activity. Sequence analysis revealed conserved His250 and Ile263 and site-directed mutagenesis at these crucial residues enhanced PTE activity. The best variant PoOPHM2 carrying H250I/I263W mutations displayed 6,962- and 106-fold improvements in catalytic efficiency for methyl-parathion and ethyl-paraoxon degradation, whereas the original lactonase and esterase activities decreased dramatically. A 1.4???10(7) -fold of specificity inversion was achieved by only two residue substitutions. Significantly, thermostability of the variants was not compromised. Crystal structure of PoOPHM2 was determined at 2.25?? resolution and docking studies suggested that the two residues in the binding pocket determine substrate recognition. Lastly, new organophosphorus hydrolases (OPHs) were discovered using simple double mutations. Among them, PpOPHM2 from Pseudomonas putida emerged as a new promising OPH with very high activity (41.0?U?mg(-1) ) toward methyl-parathion. Our results offer a first scrutiny to PTE activity evolution of OPHs in ?-lactamase superfamily and provide efficient and robust enzymes for OP detoxification. 	Biotechnol._Bioeng.	D016428 D013485
18672539	20080805	Prevalence and risk factors for etravirine resistance among patients failing on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.	Prevalence and factors associated with etravirine (EW) resistance mutations among patients failing on first-generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) merit investigation. The study comprised an analysis of all sequential patients attending the Institute of Infectious Diseases (Brescia, northern Italy) who performed a genotypic resistance testing (GRT) after &gt; or =3 months of a stable NNRTI-based regimen between 2001 and 2006. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis was performed to assess predictors of ETV resistance mutations. Out of 248 strains, 153 (61.7%) harboured &gt; or =1 ETV resistance mutations. In particular, 88 (35.5%), 53 (21.4%) and 12 (4.8%) harboured one, two and three mutations, respectively. The most frequent mutations were G190A (230%), Y181C (23%) and K101E (14.1%). Use of nevirapine (odds ratio [OR] 2.73; 95% confidence level [CI] 1.62-4.62; P&lt;0.001) and a longer time frame between first HIV RNA &gt;500 copies/ml and GRT (per month, OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.01-1.09; P=0.012) were associated with a greater number of ETV resistance mutations. Conversely, higher CD4+ T-cell counts at nadir (per 100 cells/mm3, OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.67-0.98; P=0.029) and use of lamivudine/emtricitabine (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.37-0.87; P=0.009) were protective. Accumulation of ETV resistance-associated mutations was demonstrated by sequential GRT in 4/35 patients (all treated with nevirapine). Mutations associated with ETW resistance were common among patients failing on NNRTI, but prevalence of viral strains harbouring three mutations was low. Use of efavirenz and co-administration of lamivudine reduced the risk of ETW resistance. The continued use of the current NNRTI in a failing regimen may select for additional resistant variants.

21791072	20110728	Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locoregionally advanced and high-risk salivary gland malignancies.	To report the outcomes of patients with locoregionally advanced and high- risk salivary gland malignancies treated with surgery followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. From 09/1991 - 06/2007, 24 high-risk salivary gland cancer patients were treated with surgery, followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for high-risk pathologic features including, perineural involvement, nodal involvement, positive margins, or T3/T4 tumors. Chemoradiotherapy was delivered for 4-6 alternating week cycles: the most common regimen, TFHX, consisted of 5 days paclitaxel (100 mg/m? on d1), infusional 5-fluorouracil (600 mg/m?/d ? 5d), hydroxyurea (500 mg PO BID), and 1.5 Gy twice daily irradiation followed by a 9-day break without treatment. Median follow-up was 42 months. The parotid gland was more frequently involved (n = 17) than minor (n = 4) or submandibular (n = 3) glands. The median radiation dose was 65 Gy (range 55-68 Gy). Acute treatment related toxicity included 46% grade 3 mucositis and 33% grade 3 hematologic toxicity. Six patients required feeding tubes during treatment. One patient progressed locally, 8 patients progressed distantly, and none progressed regionally. Five-year locoregional progression free survival was 96%. The 3 and 5 year overall survival was 79% and 59%, respectively. Long-term complications included persistent xerostomia (n = 5), esophageal stricture requiring dilatation (n = 1), and tempromandibular joint syndrome (n = 1). Surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy results in promising locoregional control for high-risk salivary malignancy patients. 	Head_Neck_Oncol	D016428 D013485
26578678	20151119	Lineage-Specific Methyltransferases Define the Methylome of the Globally Disseminated Escherichia coli ST131 Clone.	Escherichia coli sequence type 131 (ST131) is a clone of uropathogenic E.?coli that has emerged rapidly and disseminated globally in both clinical and community settings. Members of the ST131 lineage from across the globe have been comprehensively characterized in terms of antibiotic resistance, virulence potential, and pathogenicity, but to date nothing is known about the methylome of these important human pathogens. Here we used single-molecule real-time (SMRT) PacBio sequencing to determine the methylome of E.?coli EC958, the most-well-characterized completely sequenced ST131 strain. Our analysis of 52,081 methylated adenines in the genome of EC958 discovered three (m6)A methylation motifs that have not been described previously. Subsequent SMRT sequencing of isogenic knockout mutants identified the two type I methyltransferases (MTases) and one type IIG MTase responsible for (m6)A methylation of novel recognition sites. Although both type I sites were rare, the type IIG sites accounted for more than 12% of all methylated adenines in EC958. Analysis of the distribution of MTase genes across 95 ST131 genomes revealed their prevalence is highly conserved within the ST131 lineage, with most variation due to the presence or absence of mobile genetic elements on which individual MTase genes are located. DNA modification plays a crucial role in bacterial regulation. Despite several examples demonstrating the role of methyltransferase (MTase) enzymes in bacterial virulence, investigation of this phenomenon on a whole-genome scale has remained elusive until now. Here we used single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing to determine the first complete methylome of a strain from the multidrug-resistant E.?coli sequence type 131 (ST131) lineage. By interrogating the methylome computationally and with further SMRT sequencing of isogenic mutants representing previously uncharacterized MTase genes, we defined the target sequences of three novel ST131-specific MTases and determined the genomic distribution of all MTase target sequences. Using a large collection of 95 previously sequenced ST131 genomes, we identified mobile genetic elements as a major factor driving diversity in DNA methylation patterns. Overall, our analysis highlights the potential for DNA methylation to dramatically influence gene regulation at the transcriptional level within a well-defined E.?coli clone. 	MBio	D016428 D013485
14686879	20031223	Augmented intrinsic activity of Factor VIIa by replacement of residues 305, 314, 337 and 374: evidence of two unique mutational mechanisms of activity enhancement.	Coagulation Factor VIIa (FVIIa) lacks the ability to spontaneously complete the conversion to a fully active enzyme after specific cleavage of an internal peptide bond (Arg152-Ile153) in the zymogen. Recently, several variants of FVIIa with enhanced intrinsic activity have been constructed. The in vitro characterization of these variants has shed light on molecular determinants that put restrictions on FVIIa in favour of a zymogen-like conformation and warrants continued efforts. Here we describe a new FVIIa variant with high intrinsic activity containing the mutations Leu305--&gt;Val, Ser314--&gt;Glu, Lys337--&gt;Ala, and Phe374--&gt;Tyr. The variant, called FVIIa(VEAY), processes a tripeptidyl substrate very efficiently because of an unprecedented, 5.5-fold lowering of the K(m) value. Together with a 4-fold higher substrate turnover rate this gives the variant a catalytic efficiency 22 times that of wild-type FVIIa, which is reflected in a considerably enhanced susceptibility to inhibition by antithrombin and other inhibitors. For instance, the affinity of FVIIa(VEAY) for the S1 probe and inhibitor p -aminobenzamidine is represented by an 8-fold lower K(i) value compared with that of FVIIa. Activation of Factor X in solution occurs about 10 times faster with FVIIa(VEAY) than with FVIIa, due virtually exclusively to an increased kcat value. The high activity of FVIIa(VEAY) is not accompanied by an increased burial of the N-terminus of the protease domain. A comparison of the kinetic parameters and molecular properties of FVIIa(VEAY) with those of the previously described mutant V158D/E296V/M298Q-FVIIa (FVIIa(IIa)), and the locations of the substitutions in the two variants, reveals what appear to be two profoundly different structural mechanisms dictating improvements in enzymic performance.

25799414	20150324	Mycobacterial dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors identified using chemogenomic methods and in vitro validation.	The lack of success in target-based screening approaches to the discovery of antibacterial agents has led to reemergence of phenotypic screening as a successful approach of identifying bioactive, antibacterial compounds. A challenge though with this route is then to identify the molecular target(s) and mechanism of action of the hits. This target identification, or deorphanization step, is often essential in further optimization and validation studies. Direct experimental identification of the molecular target of a screening hit is often complex, precisely because the properties and specificity of the hit are not yet optimized against that target, and so many false positives are often obtained. An alternative is to use computational, predictive, approaches to hypothesize a mechanism of action, which can then be validated in a more directed and efficient manner. Specifically here we present experimental validation of an in silico prediction from a large-scale screen performed against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis. The two potent anti-tubercular compounds studied in this case, belonging to the tetrahydro-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine (THT) family, were predicted and confirmed to be an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a known essential Mtb gene, and already clinically validated as a drug target. Given the large number of similar screening data sets shared amongst the community, this in vitro validation of these target predictions gives weight to computational approaches to establish the mechanism of action (MoA) of novel screening hit.

27215212	20160525	Association of common genetic variation in the protein C pathway genes with clinical outcomes in acute respiratory distress syndrome.	Altered plasma levels of protein C, thrombomodulin, and the endothelial protein C receptor are associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We hypothesized that common variants in these genes would be associated with mortality as well as ventilator-free and organ failure-free days in patients with ARDS. We genotyped linkage disequilibrium-based tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the ProteinC, Thrombomodulin and Endothelial Protein C Reptor Genes among 320 self-identified white patients of European ancestry from the ARDS Network Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial. We then tested their association with mortality as well as ventilator-free and organ-failure free days. The GG genotype of rs1042580 (p = 0.02) and CC genotype of rs3716123 (p = 0.002), both in the thrombomodulin gene, and GC/CC genotypes of rs9574 (p = 0.04) in the endothelial protein C receptor gene were independently associated with increased mortality. An additive effect on mortality (p &lt; 0.001), ventilator-free days (p = 0.01), and organ failure-free days was observed with combinations of these high-risk genotypes. This association was independent of age, severity of illness, presence or absence of sepsis, and treatment allocation. Genetic variants in thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor genes are additively associated with mortality in ARDS. These findings suggest that genetic differences may be at least partially responsible for the observed associations between dysregulated coagulation and poor outcomes in ARDS.

18728522	20080830	Frequencies of genetic polymorphisms of TLR4 and CD14 and of HLA-DQ genotypes in children with celiac disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, or both.	Besides the central role of the adaptive immune system, a disturbance of innate immunity is also involved in the pathogenesis of celiac disease (CD). Inasmuch as CD and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) frequently coexist because of a common genetic predisposition, our aim was to study the frequency of CD14 C-260T and TLR4 A+896G single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the distribution of HLA-DQ genotypes in children affected by CD, T1DM, or both. TLR4 and CD14 SNPs were tested by polymerase chain reaction, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 80 children with T1DM, 100 children with CD, and 47 children with both CD and T1DM. Determination of HLA-DQ alleles was done by sequence-specific polymerase chain reaction. Frequencies were compared with those of healthy control children. The prevalence of the homozygous CD14 C-260TT genotype was significantly (P = 0.0081) lower in children with T1DM but not in those with CD and T1DM, compared with control children. No difference was found in the genotype and allele frequencies of TLR4 between the studied groups. In patients with T1DM, the frequency of the homozygous HLA-DQ8 genotype was significantly higher than in CD, whereas the frequency of homozygous or heterozygous HLA-DQ2 genotypes did not differ from that in control children. In patients with CD, both homozygous and heterozygous HLA-DQ2 genotypes were significantly more frequent than in the control and T1DM groups, and no elevation in the frequency of the HLA-DQ8 genotypes was observed. In patients with T1DM and those with CD and T1DM, the occurrence of HLA-DQ2/8 heterozygosity was significantly higher than in children with CD only and in control children. Our results suggest that in patients with T1DM, the CD14 C-260TT homozygous genotype increases the risk for the development of CD. The distribution of HLA-DQ genotype is different in children with CD and T1DM than in children with CD or T1DM only. Determination of the HLA-DQ genotype in children with T1DM may help in estimating the risk for the development of CD. 	J._Pediatr._Gastroenterol._Nutr.	D016428 D013485
17568416	20070615	Pelizaeus-Merzbacher syndrome: neurocognitive function in a family with carrier manifestations.	A Cajun kindred with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease was found to have a p.Q128X mutation in exon 3B of proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1). The affected males were globally delayed in development, nonambulatory, and severely dysarthric. The heterozygous females developed progressive gait disturbances and cognitive deterioration starting in the fourth decade of life. The average IQ (Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale: 4th Edition (SBFE)) of the carrier females was 54.2, compared to the average IQ of 97.5 in nonaffected relatives. The X-inactivation ratios in the three carrier females were not markedly skewed (55:45, 70:30, and 85:15). The presence of neurological and cognitive deterioration in the three carriers deviates from the usual expectation that carrier expression only occurs in families when males are mildly affected.

6348039	19830810	The membrane-embedded segment of cytochrome b5 as studied by cross-linking with photoactivatable phospholipids.	Vesicles were prepared from a 9:1 (mole/mol) mixture of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine and the radioactively labeled phospholipids, 1-palmitoyl-2-omega-(m-diazirinophenoxy)undecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC-I) or 1-palmitoyl-2-omega-(2-diazo-3,3,3-trifluropropionyloxy)lauroyl-sn- glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC-II). Rabbit liver cytochrome b5 was inserted into these vesicles spontaneously and the resulting vesicles containing the cytochrome b5 in the transferable form were photolyzed. Cytochrome b5 containing covalently cross-linked phospholipids was isolated by Sephadex LH-60 column chromatography using ethanol/formic acid as the solvent. Of the total radioactivity, 4.6% (PC-I) or 11.3% (PC-II) was linked to the protein; of the former, up to 51% was base-labile, while in the latter, 22% was base-labile. The sites of cross-linking of PC-I to the protein were investigated by fragmentation with trypsin, Staphylococcus aureas V8 protease, CNBr, and o-iodosobenzoic acid followed by Sephadex LH-60 chromatography and Edman sequencing (solid phase) of the appropriate fragments. The distribution of cross-linking was broad (Ser-104 to Met-130), showing a bell-shaped pattern with a significant peak at Ser-118. The labeling pattern is consistent with the previously proposed loop-back model for the membranous segment in the transferable form of cytochrome b5. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013486 D013487
23824587	20130705	Computational screening of disease-associated mutations in OCA2 gene.	Oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2), caused by mutations of OCA2 gene, is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by reduced biosynthesis of melanin pigment in the skin, hair, and eyes. The OCA2 gene encodes instructions for making a protein called the P protein. This protein plays a crucial role in melanosome biogenesis, and controls the eumelanin content in melanocytes in part via the processing and trafficking of tyrosinase which is the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin synthesis. In this study we analyzed the pathogenic effect of 95 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms reported in OCA2 gene using computational methods. We found R305W mutation as most deleterious and disease associated using SIFT, PolyPhen, PANTHER, PhD-SNP, Pmut, and MutPred tools. To understand the atomic arrangement in 3D space, the native and mutant (R305W) structures were modeled. Molecular dynamics simulation was conducted to observe the structural significance of computationally prioritized disease-associated mutation (R305W). Root-mean-square deviation, root-mean-square fluctuation, radius of gyration, solvent accessibility surface area, hydrogen bond (NH bond), trace of covariance matrix, eigenvector projection analysis, and density analysis results showed prominent loss of stability and rise in mutant flexibility values in 3D space. This study presents a well designed computational methodology to examine the albinism-associated SNPs. 	Cell_Biochem._Biophys.	D016428
18336068	20080314	Creatine kinase-mediated ATP supply fuels actin-based events in phagocytosis.	Phagocytosis requires locally coordinated cytoskeletal rearrangements driven by actin polymerization and myosin motor activity. How this actomyosin dynamics is dependent upon systems that provide access to ATP at phagosome microdomains has not been determined. We analyzed the role of brain-type creatine kinase (CK-B), an enzyme involved in high-energy phosphoryl transfer. We demonstrate that endogenous CK-B in macrophages is mobilized from the cytosolic pool and coaccumulates with F-actin at nascent phagosomes. Live cell imaging with XFP-tagged CK-B and beta-actin revealed the transient and specific nature of this partitioning process. Overexpression of a catalytic dead CK-B or CK-specific cyclocreatine inhibition caused a significant reduction of actin accumulation in the phagocytic cup area, and reduced complement receptor-mediated, but not Fc-gammaR-mediated, ingestion capacity of macrophages. Finally, we found that inhibition of CK-B affected phagocytosis already at the stage of particle adhesion, most likely via effects on actin polymerization behavior. We propose that CK-B activity in macrophages contributes to complement-induced F-actin assembly events in early phagocytosis by providing local ATP supply. 	PLoS_Biol.	D016428 D013485
19477263	20090530	Evidence for potential functionality of nuclearly-encoded humanin isoforms.	Humanin (HN) is a recently identified neuroprotective and antiapoptotic peptide derived from a portion of the mitochondrial MT-RNR2 gene. We provide bioinformatic and expression data suggesting the existence of 13 MT-RNR2-like nuclear loci predicted to maintain the open reading frames of 15 distinct full-length HN-like peptides. At least ten of these nuclear genes are expressed in human tissues, and respond to staurosporine (STS) and beta-carotene. Sequence comparisons of the nuclear HN isoforms and their homologues in other species reveal two consensus motifs, encompassing residues 5-11 (GFS/NCLLL), and 14-19 (SEIDLP/S). Proline vs serine in position 19 may determine whether the peptide is secreted or not, while threonine in position 13 may be important for cell surface receptor binding. Cytoprotection against the STS-induced apoptosis conferred by the polymorphic HN5 variant, in which threonine in position 13 is replaced with isoleucine, is reduced compared to the wild type HN5 peptide.

25861244	20150411	Interferon gamma polymorphisms and hepatitis B virus-related liver cirrhosis risk in a Chinese population.	Previous studies proved that interferon gamma (IFN-?) gene polymorphisms were associated with the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, the association between IFN-? polymorphisms and HBV-related liver cirrhosis (HBV-LC) risk is still unclear. IFN-? +874?T/A and +2109G/A genotypes were determined in 126 HBV-LC patients, 129 chronic hepatitis B(CHB) patients, and 173 early HBV infection controls using a sequence-specific primer-polymerase chain reaction and a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, respectively. Significant associations were observed between +2109A/G polymorphisms and HBV-LC risk in the co-dominant model (GG vs. AA: OR?=?0.321, 95% CI?=?0.130-0.793, P?=?0.014), the allelic model (OR?=?0.565, 95% CI?=?0.388-0.825, P?=?0.003), the dominant model (OR?=?0.551, 95% CI?=?0.344-0.883, P?=?0.013), and the recessive model (OR?=?0.385, 95% CI?=?0.159-0.930, P?=?0.034). In addition, haplotype analysis indicated that the T(+874)G(+2109) haplotype significantly decreased the HBV-LC risk (OR?=?0.106, 95% CI?=?0.022-0.502, P?=?0.000), and A(+874)A(+2109) haplotype significantly increased the LC risk (OR?=?1.485, 95% CI?=?1.065-2.070, P?=?0.019). No significant associations were observed between IFN-? +874?T/A polymorphisms and HBV-LC risk, as well as the two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and CHB risk (P?&gt;?0.05). Our observations suggested a significant association of IFN-? polymorphisms with HBV-LC risk in the Chinese population. 	Cancer_Cell_Int.	D016428
11829507	20020207	Effects of the N2144S mutation on backbone dynamics of a TB-cbEGF domain pair from human fibrillin-1.	The calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like (cbEGF) module and the transforming growth factor beta-binding protein-like (TB) module are the two major structural motifs found in fibrillin-1, the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein defective in the Marfan syndrome (MFS). An MFS-causing mutation, N2144S, which removes a calcium ligand in cbEGF32, does not detectably affect fibrillin-1 biosynthesis, rate of secretion, processing, or deposition of reducible fibrillin-1 into the ECM. Since the residue at position 2144 is normally engaged in calcium ligation, it is unable to mediate intermolecular interactions. We have shown previously that this mutation does not affect the folding properties of the TB or cbEGF domains in vitro, but does decrease calcium-binding in cbEGF and TB-cbEGF domain constructs. Here, we use NMR spectroscopy to probe the effects of the N2144S mutation on backbone dynamic properties of TB6-cbEGF32. Analysis of the backbone (15)N relaxation data of wild-type TB6-cbEGF32 has revealed a flexible inter-domain linkage. Parallel dynamics analysis of the N2144S mutant has shown increased flexibility in the region joining the two domains as well as in the calcium-binding site at the N terminus of cbEGF32. This research demonstrates that a small change in peptide backbone flexibility, which does not enhance proteolytic susceptibility of the domain pair, is associated with an MFS phenotype. Flexibility of the TB-cbEGF linkage is likely to contribute to the biomechanical properties of fibrillin-rich connective tissue microfibrils, and may play a role in the microfibril assembly process.

19091000	20081219	NAP and D-SAL: neuroprotection against the beta amyloid peptide (1-42).	NAP (Asn-Ala-Pro-Val-Ser-Ile-Pro-Gln, single amino acid letter code, NAPVSIPQ), an eight amino acid neuroprotective peptide derived from activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), exhibits some structural similarity to activity-dependent neurotropic factor-9 (ADNF-9; Ser-Alal-Leu-Leu-Arg-Ser-Ile-Pro-Ala, SALLRSIPA). Both peptides are also active in the all D-amino acid conformation, termed D-NAP and D-SAL. Original results utilizing affinity chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry identified tubulin, the subunit protein of microtubules, as the major NAP-associating protein in brain. The NAP-tubulin association was found to be diminished in the presence of ADNF-9, D-NAP, and D-SAL, suggesting a common target of neuroprotection. The beta amyloid peptide interacts with microtubules, and previous studies have demonstrated protection against beta amyloid (25-35) toxicity by NAP and ADNF-9. NAP also inhibits beta amyloid (25-35 and 1-40) aggregation. Cerebral cortical cultures derived from newborn rats were used in neuronal survival assays to test the activity of both NAP and D-SAL against the major Alzheimer's disease toxic peptide beta amyloid (1-42). NAP and D-SAL protected cerebral cortical neurons against the major Alzheimer's disease toxic peptide beta amyloid (1-42). Maximal protection of both peptides was observed at concentrations of 10-15 to 10-10 mol/l. These findings, together with those of previous in vivo studies conducted in relevant Alzheimer's disease models, pave the path to drug development. Bioavailability studies indicated that NAP penetrates cells and crosses the blood-brain barrier after nasal or systemic administration. Phase II clinical trials of NAP are currently in progress by Allon Therapeutics Inc. 	BMC_Neurosci	D016428 D052061 D013485
18702516	20080816	Strategic roles of axial histidines in structure formation and redox regulation of tetraheme cytochrome c3.	Tetraheme cytochrome c 3 (cyt c 3) exhibits extremely low reduction potentials and unique properties. Since axial ligands should be the most important factors for this protein, every axial histidine of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki F cyt c 3 was replaced with methionine, one by one. On mutation at the fifth ligand, the relevant heme could not be linked to the polypeptide, revealing the essential role of the fifth histidine in heme linking. The fifth histidine is the key residue in the structure formation and redox regulation of a c-type cytochrome. A crystal structure has been obtained for only H25M cyt c 3. The overall structure was not affected by the mutation except for the sixth methionine coordination at heme 3. NMR spectra revealed that each mutated methionine is coordinated to the sixth site of the relevant heme in the reduced state, while ligand conversion takes place at hemes 1 and 4 during oxidation at pH 7. The replacement of the sixth ligand with methionine caused an increase in the reduction potential of the mutated heme of 222-244 mV. The midpoint potential of a triheme H52M cyt c 3 is higher than that of the wild type by approximately 50 mV, suggesting a contribution of the tetraheme architecture to the lowering of the reduction potentials. The hydrogen bonding of Thr24 with an axial ligand induces a decrease in reduction potential of approximately 50 mV. In conclusion, the bis-histidine coordination is strategically essential for the structure formation and the extremely low reduction potential of cyt c 3. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485
8639610	19960528	Contributions of asparagine at alpha 97 to the cooperative oxygenation process of hemoglobin.	According to the X-ray crystallographic results from human deoxyhemoglobin, beta 99Asp at the alpha 1 Beta 2 interface forms hydrogen bonds with alpha 42Tyr and alpha 97Asn. To clarify the structural and functional roles of the hydrogen bond between alpha 97Asn and beta 99Asp, we have engineered a recombinant hemoglobin in which alpha 97Asn is replaced by Ala, and have investigated its oxygen-binding properties, and have used proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to determine the structural consequences of the mutation. Recombinant Hb (alpha 97Asn--&gt;Ala) shows a milder alteration of functional properties compared to the severely impaired beta 99 mutants of the human abnormal hemoglobins. The addition of inositol hexaphosphate, an allosteric effector, causes recovery of the functional properties of recombinant Hb (alpha 97 Asn--&gt;Ala) almost to the level of human normal adult hemoglobin without this allosteric effector. r Hb (alpha 97 Asn--&gt;Ala) shows very similar tertiary structure around the heme pockets and quaternary structure in the alpha 1 beta 2 interface compared to those of human normal adult hemoglobin. The proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of the deoxy form of this recombinant hemoglobin shows the existence of an altered hydrogen bond which is believed to be between alpha 42Tyr and beta 99Asp at the alpha 1 beta 2 interface. Thus, the present results suggest that the intersubunit hydrogen bond between alpha 97 Asn and beta 99Asp at the alpha 1 beta 2 interface is not as crucial as the one between alpha 42Tyr and beta 99Asp in the deoxy quaternary structure. Preliminary molecular dynamics simulations have been used to calculate the contributions of specific interactions of several amino acid residues in r Hb (alpha 97Asn--&gt;Ala) to the free energy of cooperativity of this recombinant hemoglobin. The results of these calculations are consistent with the experimental results. 	Biochemistry	D003160 D016428 D013487
17117186	20061123	Impact of beta2-adrenoreceptor gene variants on cardiac cavity size and systolic function in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.	In heart failure, the Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu polymorphisms of the beta2-adrenoreceptor (beta2-AR) gene are associated with exercise-capacity, clinical outcomes and response to beta-AR blocker therapy. Whether beta2-AR gene variants mediate these effects in-part through an impact on cardiac structural remodeling and pump function independent of the effects of beta-blockers is uncertain. We evaluated whether the Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu variants of the beta2-AR gene predict left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and LV end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) before and 6 months after receiving standard medical therapy other than beta-AR blockers. In all, 394 patients with IDC and 393 age and gender-matched controls were genotyped for the beta2-AR gene variants using restriction-fragment length polymorphism-based techniques. LVEF and dimensions were determined in 132 patients (of whom 71 were newly diagnosed) both at baseline and after 6 months. Genotype of neither variant was associated with the presence of IDC. Moreover, beta2-AR genotype did not determine LVEF or LV dimensions prior to initiating therapy. After 6 months of therapy, LVEF increased by 7.1+/-1.0 absolute units (P&lt;0.0001) and LVEDD decreased by 0.27+/-0.06 cm (P&lt;0.02). Adjusting for baseline values as well as gender, age, and type of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy received, genotype was associated with neither final LVEF and LVEDD, nor change in LVEF and LVEDD. In conclusion, these data suggest that in heart failure, the functional Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu variants of the beta2-AR gene have no independent effect on adverse structural remodeling and pump function.

27155338	20160508	Renalase gene polymorphism is associated with increased blood pressure in preeclampsia.	Renalase is a novel enzyme that degrades circulating catecholamines. We aimed to investigate the role of rs2576178 and rs10887800 polymorphisms of the renalase gene in preeclampsia (PE) patients This case-control study consisted of 110 women with PE and 102 normotensive controls. PCR-RFLP method was used for determination of renalase gene polymorphisms. Allele frequency and genotype distribution of rs10887800 polymorphism were found statistically significantly higher in women with PE (p&lt;0.05). Also G allele and GG genotype of rs10887800 polymorphism were found higher in women with severe PE than that of mild PE (p&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference for rs2576178 polymorphism in terms of allele frequency and genotype distribution (p&gt;0.05). In PE patients, systolic blood pressure (SBP) means according to rs10887800 genotypes were found statistically significantly higher (GG vs AA; p=0.001) and (GG vs GA; p=0.001). Similarly, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) means were found statistically significantly higher in PE patients (GG vs GA: p=0.001); (GG vs AA: p=0.004). For rs2576178 polymorphism, SBP means were found as (GG vs AA; p=0.012, GG vs GA; p&gt;0.05) in PE patients. DBP means were not significant according to rs2576178 genotypes in PE patients (p&gt;0.05). The findings of the present study suggest that blood pressure may be increased by GG genotype and G allele of rs10887800 polymorphism and the polymorphism may increase the susceptibility to PE.

18073196	20071213	Structure-function analysis of the RNA polymerase cleft loops elucidates initial transcription, DNA unwinding and RNA displacement.	The active center clefts of RNA polymerase (RNAP) from the archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (Pfu) and of yeast RNAP II are nearly identical, including four protruding loops, the lid, rudder, fork 1 and fork 2. Here we present a structure-function analysis of recombinant Pfu RNAP variants lacking these cleft loops, and analyze the function of each loop at different stages of the transcription cycle. All cleft loops except fork 1 were required for promoter-directed transcription and efficient elongation. Unprimed de novo transcription required fork 2, the lid was necessary for primed initial transcription. Analysis of templates containing a pre-melted bubble showed that rewinding of upstream DNA drives RNA separation from the template. During elongation, downstream DNA strand separation required template strand binding to an invariant arginine in switch 2, and apparently interaction of an invariant arginine in fork 2 with the non-template strand.

24969885	20140628	Cyclooxygenase-2 promoter 765C increase of digestive tract cancer risk in the Chinese population: a meta-analysis.	To evaluate relationship between the cyclooxygenase-2 promoter 765G/C polymorphism and digestive cancer risk in China. A literature search through February 2014 was performed using PubMed, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases, and a meta-analysis was performed with RevMan 5.2 software for odds ratios and 95%CIs. In total, 9 articles with 3,263 cases and 4,858 controls were included in this meta-analysis.The pooled OR (95%CIs) in the co-dominant model (GC vs GG) was 1.56 [1.19, 2.06], and in the dominant model ((CC+GC) vs GG), the pooled OR was 1.59 [1.21, 2.09] in overall cancers. In the subgroup analysis, stratified by cancer type, significant associations were found that the-765C allele had increased pancreatic cancer and gastric risk. No significant liver cancer and colorectal cancer risk of COX-2 -765G/C polymorphism was found. These findings suggest that COX-2-765*C is related to cancer susceptibility and may increase gastric and pancreatic cancer risk. 	Asian_Pac._J._Cancer_Prev.	D016428 D017418
26991780	20160319	A Predictive Model for Selecting Patients with HCV Genotype 3 Chronic Infection with a High Probability of Sustained Virological Response to Peginterferon Alfa-2a/Ribavirin.	Access to direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) is restricted in some settings; thus, the European Association for the Study of the Liver recommends dual peginterferon/ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV) therapy wherever DAAs are unavailable. HCV genotype (GT) 3 infection is now the most difficult genotype to eradicate and PegIFN/RBV remains an effective option. The goal of this study was to devise a simple predictive score to identify GT3 patients with a high probability of achieving a sustained virologic response (SVR) with PegIFN alfa-2a/RBV therapy. Relationships between baseline characteristics and SVR were explored by multiple logistic regression models and used to develop a simple scoring system to predict SVR using data from 1239 treatment-naive GT3 patients who received PegIFN alfa-2a/RBV for 24 weeks in two large observational cohort studies. The score was validated using a database of 473 patients. Scores were assigned for six factors as follows: age (years) (?40: 2 points; &gt;40 but ?55: 1); bodyweight (kg) (&lt;70: 2; ?70 but &lt;90: 1); no cirrhosis/transition to cirrhosis (2); ALT ?2.5 x ULN (1); platelets (109/L) (&gt;200: 2; ?100 but &lt;200: 1); HCV RNA (&lt;400,000 IU/mL: 1). The points are summed to arrive at a score ranging from 0?10 where higher scores indicate higher chances of SVR; 141, 123, 203, 249, 232, and 218 patients had total scores of 0?4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9-10, respectively, among whom SVR rates were 45%, 62%, 72%, 76%, 84%, and 89%. Among 622 patients who had scores of 6?10 and HCV RNA &lt;50 IU/mL by treatment week 4 the SVR rate was 86% (532/622). A simple baseline scoring system involving age, bodyweight, cirrhosis status, ALT level, platelet count and HCV RNA level can be used to identify treatment-naive Caucasian patients with HCV GT3 infection with a high probability of SVR with PegIFN alfa-2a/RBV therapy.

21249183	20110121	Proteins encoded in genomic regions associated with immune-mediated disease physically interact and suggest underlying biology.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have defined over 150 genomic regions unequivocally containing variation predisposing to immune-mediated disease. Inferring disease biology from these observations, however, hinges on our ability to discover the molecular processes being perturbed by these risk variants. It has previously been observed that different genes harboring causal mutations for the same Mendelian disease often physically interact. We sought to evaluate the degree to which this is true of genes within strongly associated loci in complex disease. Using sets of loci defined in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Crohn's disease (CD) GWAS, we build protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for genes within associated loci and find abundant physical interactions between protein products of associated genes. We apply multiple permutation approaches to show that these networks are more densely connected than chance expectation. To confirm biological relevance, we show that the components of the networks tend to be expressed in similar tissues relevant to the phenotypes in question, suggesting the network indicates common underlying processes perturbed by risk loci. Furthermore, we show that the RA and CD networks have predictive power by demonstrating that proteins in these networks, not encoded in the confirmed list of disease associated loci, are significantly enriched for association to the phenotypes in question in extended GWAS analysis. Finally, we test our method in 3 non-immune traits to assess its applicability to complex traits in general. We find that genes in loci associated to height and lipid levels assemble into significantly connected networks but did not detect excess connectivity among Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) loci beyond chance. Taken together, our results constitute evidence that, for many of the complex diseases studied here, common genetic associations implicate regions encoding proteins that physically interact in a preferential manner, in line with observations in Mendelian disease.

23744071	20130608	?-Synuclein oligomers impair neuronal microtubule-kinesin interplay.	Early ?-synuclein (?-Syn)-induced alterations are neurite pathologies resulting in Lewy neurites. ?-Syn oligomers are a toxic species in synucleinopathies and are suspected to cause neuritic pathology. To investigate how ?-Syn oligomers may be linked to aberrant neurite pathology, we modeled different stages of ?-Syn aggregation in vitro and investigated the interplay of ?-Syn aggregates with proteins involved in axonal transport. The interaction of wild type ?-Syn (WTS) and ?-Syn variants (E57K, A30P, and aSyn(30-110)) with kinesin, tubulin, and the microtubule (MT)-associated proteins, MAP2 and Tau, is stronger for multimers than for monomers. WTS seeds but not ?-Syn oligomers significantly and dose-dependently reduced Tau-promoted MT assembly in vitro. In contrast, MT gliding velocity across kinesin-coated surfaces was significantly decreased in the presence of ?-Syn oligomers but not WTS seeds or fibrils (aSyn(30-110) multimers). In a human dopaminergic neuronal cell line, mild overexpression of the oligomerizing E57K ?-Syn variant significantly impaired neurite network morphology without causing profound cell death. In accordance with these findings, MT stability, neuritic kinesin, and neuritic kinesin-dependent cargoes were significantly reduced by the presence of ?-Syn oligomers. In summary, different ?-Syn species act divergently on the axonal transport machinery. These findings provide new insights into ?-Syn oligomer-driven neuritic pathology as one of the earliest events in synucleinopathies. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
27447358	20160723	A single mutation converts bacterial Na(+) -transporting rhodopsin into an H(+) transporter.	Na(+) -rhodopsins are light-driven pumps used by marine bacteria to extrude Na(+) ions from the cytoplasm. We show here that replacement of Gln123 on the cytoplasmic side of the ion-conductance channel with aspartate or glutamate confers H(+) transport activity to the Na(+) -rhodopsin from Dokdonia sp. PRO95. The Q123E variant could transport H(+) out of Escherichia coli cells in a medium containing 100 mm Na(+) and SCN(-) as the penetrating anion. The rates of the photocycle steps of this variant were only marginally dependent on Na(+) , and the major electrogenic steps were the decays of the K and O intermediates. 	FEBS_Lett.	D016422 D013485
12384340	20021018	Cloning and characterization of SmeT, a repressor of the Stenotrophomonas maltophilia multidrug efflux pump SmeDEF.	We report on the cloning of the gene smeT, which encodes the transcriptional regulator of the Stenotrophomonas maltophilia efflux pump SmeDEF. SmeT belongs to the TetR and AcrR family of transcriptional regulators. The smeT gene is located upstream from the structural operon of the pump genes smeDEF and is divergently transcribed from those genes. Experiments with S. maltophilia and the heterologous host Escherichia coli have demonstrated that SmeT is a transcriptional repressor. S1 nuclease mapping has demonstrated that expression of smeT is driven by a single promoter lying close to the 5' end of the gene and that expression of smeDEF is driven by an unique promoter that overlaps with promoter PSMET: The level of expression of smeT is higher in smeDEF-overproducing S. maltophilia strain D457R, which suggests that SmeT represses its own expression. Band-shifting assays have shown that wild-type strain S. maltophilia D457 contains a cellular factor(s) capable of binding to the intergenic smeT-smeD region. That cellular factor(s) was absent from smeDEF-overproducing S. maltophilia strain D457R. The sequence of smeT from D457R showed a point mutation that led to a Leu166Gln change within the SmeT protein. This change allowed overexpression of both smeDEF and smeT in D457R. It was noteworthy that expression of wild-type SmeT did not fully complement the smeT mutation in D457R. This suggests that the wild-type protein is not dominant over the mutant SmeT.

19619005	20090722	Candidate gene analysis of femoral neck trabecular and cortical volumetric bone mineral density in older men.	In contrast to conventional dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, quantitative computed tomography separately measures trabecular and cortical volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD). Little is known about the genetic variants associated with trabecular and cortical vBMD in humans, although both may be important for determining bone strength and osteoporotic risk. In the current analysis, we tested the hypothesis that there are genetic variants associated with trabecular and cortical vBMD at the femoral neck by genotyping 4608 tagging and potentially functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 383 bone metabolism candidate genes in 822 Caucasian men aged 65 years or older from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS). Promising SNP associations then were tested for replication in an additional 1155 men from the same study. We identified SNPs in five genes (IFNAR2, NFATC1, SMAD1, HOXA, and KLF10) that were robustly associated with cortical vBMD and SNPs in nine genes (APC, ATF2, BMP3, BMP7, FGF18, FLT1, TGFB3, THRB, and RUNX1) that were robustly associated with trabecular vBMD. There was no overlap between genes associated with cortical vBMD and trabecular vBMD. These findings identify novel genetic variants for cortical and trabecular vBMD and raise the possibility that some genetic loci may be unique for each bone compartment. 	J._Bone_Miner._Res.

11043984	20001024	Influence of pathogenicity islands and the minor leuX-encoded tRNA5Leu on the proteome pattern of the uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain 536.	The uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain 536 (O6:K15:H31) carries four distinct DNA regions in its chromosome, termed pathogenicity islands (PAIs I536 to IV536). Each of these PAIs encodes at least one virulence factor. All four PAIs are associated with tRNA genes. PAI I536 and PAI II536 can be spontaneously deleted from the chromosome by homologous recombination between flanking direct repeats. The deletion of PAI II536 results in the truncation of the associated gene leuX encoding the tRNALeu. This tRNA influences the expression of various virulence traits. In order to get a deeper insight into the role of PAI I536/II536 and of the tRNA5LeU for the protein expression, the protein expression patterns of Escherichia coli 536 and different derivatives were studied. Differences in the protein expression patterns of the wild-type strain Escherichia coli 536, its mutants 536-21 (PAI I536-, PAI II536-, leuX-), 536delta102 (PAI I536+, PAI II536+, leuX-) as well as of the strain 536R3 (PAI I536-, PAI II536-, leuX+) were analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. We identified about 39 different intracellular proteins whose expression is markedly altered in the different strain backgrounds. These differences can be linked either to the presence or absence of the PAI I536 and PAI II536 or to that of the tRNA gene leuX. The identities of 34 proteins have been determined by MALDI-TOF-MS. The identification of five proteins was not possible. The results suggest that proteome analysis is an efficient approach to study differences in global gene expression. The comparison of protein expression patterns of the uropathogenic E. coli strain 536 and different derivatives revealed that in this strain the expression of various proteins including those encoded by many housekeeping genes is affected by the presence of PAI I536 and Pai II536 or by that of the tRNA5Leu.

8955162	19961220	Biochemical studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae myristoyl-coenzyme A:protein N-myristoyltransferase mutants.	Saccharomyces cerevisiae myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (Nmt1p) is an essential 455-residue, monomeric enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of myristate from myristoyl-CoA to the NH2-terminal Gly residue of cellular proteins. Nmt1p has an ordered Bi Bi reaction mechanism with binding of myristoyl-CoA occurring before binding of peptide substrates. To define residues important for function, the polymerase chain reaction was used to generate random mutations in the NMT1 gene. A colony color sectoring assay was used to screen a library of 52,000 transformants for nmt1 alleles encoding enzymes with reduced activity. nmt1 alleles were identified that produced temperature-sensitive (ts) growth arrest due to substitutions affecting eight residues conserved in orthologous Nmts: Asn102, Ala202, Cys217, Ser328, Val395, Asn404, Leu420, and Asn426. Ala202 --&gt; Thr, Cys217 --&gt; Arg, Ser328 --&gt; Pro, Asn404 --&gt; Tyr, and Asn426 --&gt; Ile produced the most severe ts phenotype. Their effects on the functional properties of the enzyme's myristoyl-CoA and peptide binding sites were defined by purifying each mutant from Escherichia coli and conducting in vitro kinetic analyses with acyl-CoA and peptide substrates and with two competitive inhibitors: S-(2-oxo)pentadecyl-CoA, a nonhydrolyzable myristoyl-CoA analog, and SC-58272, a peptidomimetic derived from the NH2-terminal sequence of an Nmt1p substrate (ADP-ribosylation factor-2, Arf2p). None of the substitutions affect the enzyme's acyl chain length selectivity. When compared with wild type Nmt1p, Cys217 --&gt; Arg produces 3- and 6-fold increases in Ki for SC-58272 at 24 and 37 degrees C but no change in Ki for S-(2-oxo)pentadecyl-CoA, indicating that the substitution selectively affects Nmt1p's peptide binding site. Asn426 --&gt; Ile selectively perturbs the myristoyl-CoA binding site, resulting in the most pronounced reduction in affinity for S-(2-oxo)pentadecyl-CoA (12- and 20-fold). Ala202 --&gt; Thr, which confers the most severe ts phenotype, provides an example of a substitution that affects both sites, producing 3- and 6-fold increases in the Ki for S-(2-oxo)pentadecyl-CoA and 6- and 9-fold increases in the Ki for SC-58272 at 24 and 37 degrees C. An N-myristoylation-dependent change in the electrophoretic mobility of Arf1p was used to assay the effects of the mutants on cellular levels of protein N-myristoylation under a variety of growth conditions. The ts growth arrest produced by nmt1 alleles correlates with a reduction in myristoyl-Arf1p to &lt;/=50% of total cellular Arf1p. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013487
24134222	20131019	Combined linkage and association mapping reveals candidates for Scmv1, a major locus involved in resistance to sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) in maize.	Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) disease causes substantial losses of grain yield and forage biomass in susceptible maize cultivars. Maize resistance to SCMV is associated with two dominant genes, Scmv1 and Scmv2, which are located on the short arm of chromosome 6 and near the centromere region of chromosome 3, respectively. We combined both linkage and association mapping to identify positional candidate genes for Scmv1. Scmv1 was fine-mapped in a segregating population derived from near-isogenic lines and further validated and fine-mapped using two recombinant inbred line populations. The combined results assigned the Scmv1 locus to a 59.21-kb interval, and candidate genes within this region were predicted based on the publicly available B73 sequence. None of three predicted genes that are possibly involved in the disease resistance response are similar to receptor-like resistance genes. Candidate gene-based association mapping was conducted using a panel of 94 inbred lines with variable resistance to SCMV. A presence/absence variation (PAV) in the Scmv1 region and two polymorphic sites around the Zmtrx-h gene were significantly associated with SCMV resistance. Combined linkage and association mapping pinpoints Zmtrx-h as the most likely positional candidate gene for Scmv1. These results pave the way towards cloning of Scmv1 and facilitate marker-assisted selection for potyvirus resistance in maize. 	BMC_Plant_Biol.	D016428 D013485
25215305	20140913	Subjects with impaired fasting glucose: evolution in a period of 6 years.	To study the evolution of impaired fasting glucose (IFG), considering glucose and HbA1c levels and risk factors associated, in a period of 6 years. We studied 94 subjects with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) that were diagnosed in 2005 and followed up to 2012. Glucose and HbA1c levels were determined. A descriptive analysis of contingence charts was performed in order to study the evolution in the development of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Twenty-eight of ninety-four subjects became T2DM; 51/94 remained with IFG; and 20/94 presented normal fasting glucose. From the 28 diabetic subjects, 9 had already developed diabetes and were under treatment with oral hypoglycemic agents; 5 were diagnosed with plasma glucose &lt; 126?mg/dL, but with HbA1c over 6.5%. In those who developed diabetes, 15/28 had a family history of T2DM in first relative degree. Also, diabetic subjects had a BMI significantly higher than nodiabetics (t test: P &lt; 0.01). The individuals that in 2005 had the highest BMI are those who currently have diabetes. The IFG constitutes a condition of high risk of developing T2DM in a few years, especially over 110?mg/dL and in obesity patients. 	J_Diabetes_Res	D016428
26878846	20160217	The mechanism of high contents of oil and oleic acid revealed by transcriptomic and lipidomic analysis during embryogenesis in Carya cathayensis Sarg.	Hickory (Carya cathayensis Sarg.) accumulates more than 70% oil and 90% unsaturated fatty acids with considerably high oleic acid in its mature embryo. The concurrent global trancriptomic and lipidomic analyses provided a framework for better understanding of glycerolipid biosynthesis and metabolism in the hickory nut. The synthetical regulation of numerous leading lipid-related genes harmonized with the oil accumulation and fatty acid conversion in embryo development. The high level of ACCase correlated positively with fatty acids de novo synthesis, and the synergy of DGAT2 and PDAT promoted the TAG assembly, and oleosins, caleosins and steroleosins were transcribed considerably high for timely energy reserve in oil body. Glycolysis possibly provided sufficient precursors and energy for lipid synthesis. The perfect harmonization of the high level of SAD with low level of FAD2 facilitated the oleic acid accumulation. And the ratio of FATA/FATB or SAD/FATB was proposed for determining the saturated degree of oil. The gene multi-copy event was generated probably for accommodating various survival environments. A thermotolerant defense system including TAG hydrolysis determinants, heat shock proteins, and high ratio of MUFA to PUFA constrained the lipid degradation and provided a guarantee for high lipid content. A batch of potential genes recruited from the co-expression network helps us to understand the lipid synthesis and the response to high temperature better. The high transcriptional levels of key genes in lipid synthesis promoted the oil accumulation, and the harmonious expression of key ones for unsaturated fatty acids led oleic acid to high levels.

15728514	20050225	Identification of a peptide derived from vaccinia virus A52R protein that inhibits cytokine secretion in response to TLR-dependent signaling and reduces in vivo bacterial-induced inflammation.	TLRs recognize and respond to conserved motifs termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns. TLRs are characterized by an extracellular leucine-rich repeat motif and an intracellular Toll/IL-1R domain. Triggering of TLRs by pathogen-associated molecular patterns initiates a series of intracellular signaling events resulting in an inflammatory immune response designed to contain and eliminate the pathogen. Vaccinia virus encodes immunoregulatory proteins, such as A52R, that can effectively inhibit intracellular Toll/IL-1R signaling, resulting in a diminished host immune response and enhancing viral survival. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a peptide derived from the A52R protein (sequence DIVKLTVYDCI) that, when linked to the nine-arginine cell transduction sequence, effectively inhibits cytokine secretion in response to TLR activation. The peptide had no effect on cytokine secretion resulting from cell activation that was initiated independent of TLR stimulation. Using a mouse model of otitis media with effusion, administration of heat-inactivated Streptococcus pneumoniae into the middle ears of BALB/c mice resulted in a significant inflammatory response that was dramatically reduced with peptide treatment. The identification of this peptide that selectively targets TLR-dependent signaling may have application in the treatment of chronic inflammation initiated by bacterial or viral infections.

16740995	20060603	Endothelin 1 stimulates beta1Pix-dependent activation of Cdc42 through the G(salpha) pathway.	Beta1Pix (PAK-interacting exchange factor) is a recently identified guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Rho family small G protein Cdc42/Rac. On stimulation with extracellular signals, GEFs induce the exchange of guanosine diphosphate to guanosine triphosphate, resulting in the activation of the small guanosine 5C-triphosphatases. This activation enables the signal to propagate to downstream effectors. Herein, we show that G(salpha) stimulation by cholera toxin increased Cdc42 activation by endothelin-1 (ET-1), whereas pertussis toxin had no effect. H-89, a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, strongly inhibited Cdc42 activation by ET-1. Moreover, the overexpression of beta1Pix enhanced ET-1-induced Cdc42 activation. The essential role of beta1Pix in ET-1-induced Cdc42 activation was evidenced by the blocking of Cdc42 activation in cells expressing beta1Pix mutant lacking the ability to bind PAK (beta1Pix SH3m[W43K]) or mutant lacking GEF activity (beta1PixdeltaDH). The overexpression of mutant lacking the pleckstrin homology domain beta1PixdeltaPH, which is unable to bind phospholipids, had no effect on Cdc42 activation. These results demonstrate that beta1Pix, along with PKA, plays a crucial role in the regulation of Cdc42 activation by ET-1. 	Exp._Biol._Med._(Maywood)	D016428 D052061 D013485
27121124	20160429	A CD13 inhibitor, ubenimex, synergistically enhances the effects of anticancer drugs in hepatocellular carcinoma.	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) were reported to be involved in resistance to chemo/radiation therapy. We previously reported that CD13 was both a marker of CSCs and a candidate therapeutic target in HCC. In the present study, we explored the antitumor effect of a combined therapy, where ubenimex, a CD13 inhibitor, was combined with conventional anticancer drugs, fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin (CDDP), doxorubicin (DXR) and sorafenib (SOR), and we elucidated the mechanism of these combination therapies. We evaluated changes in the expression of CD13 before and after treatment with anticancer drugs and with or without ubenimex in the human HCC cell lines HuH7 and PLC/PRF/5. The interactions between the anticancer drugs and ubenimex were determined with isobologram analyses. We analyzed cell cycle, apoptosis, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels to explore the mechanisms of the combination therapies. In both cell lines, the expression of CD13 increased after a 72-h exposure to each anticancer drug alone (p&lt;0.05), and the expression of CD13 decreased with ubenimex administration (p&lt;0.05). Isobologram analyses indicated that ubenimex had synergistic effects with 5-FU, CDDP and DXR, and an additive effect with SOR. Cell cycle analyses showed that ubenimex decreased the proportion of cells in G0/G1. Ubenimex enhanced the effects of 5-FU, CDDP and DXR by increasing apoptosis and intracellular ROS levels. In combination therapies, ubenimex synergistically enhanced the antitumor effects of 5-FU, CDDP and DXR on cell cycle regulation and apoptosis induction in HCC cell lines. The effects of ubenimex were due to increased intracellular ROS levels. 	Int._J._Oncol.	D016428
24337193	20131217	Surfactant protein B gene polymorphism is associated with severe influenza.	Surfactant proteins play a key role in alveolar stability. We examined whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to the surfactant protein genes are associated with severe influenza. In the first cohort, 12 SNPs related to surfactant protein genes were compared between Chinese patients with severe and mild pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) (A[H1N1]pdm09) infection who were matched for age, sex, and underlying risk conditions. The SNP rs1130866, which was significantly different between the two groups, was further genotyped in a second cohort of patients. Multivariate analysis was performed to control for confounding factors. The genotype frequencies were also compared with those of the general Han Chinese population. This study consisted of 380 patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. In the first cohort of 84 patients, the C allele of rs1130866, an SNP in the surfactant protein B gene (SFTPB), was significantly associated with severe disease (OR = 3.37, P = .0048), although the P value was .057 after Bonferroni correction. In the second cohort of 296 patients, the C/C genotype was confirmed in the univariate analysis to be associated with severe disease. Multivariate analysis of the second cohort showed that genotype C/C was an independent risk factor for severe A(H1N1)pdm09 infection (second cohort: OR = 2.087, P = .023). Compared to the general Han Chinese population, the C/C genotype was overrepresented in patients with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 infection (OR = 3.232, P = .00000056). SFTPB polymorphism is associated with severe influenza. The role of SFTPB in influenza warrants further studies. 	Chest	D016428
27048938	20160407	SCF(SAP) controls organ size by targeting PPD proteins for degradation in Arabidopsis thaliana.	Control of organ size by cell proliferation and growth is a fundamental process, but the mechanisms that determine the final size of organs are largely elusive in plants. We have previously revealed that the ubiquitin receptor DA1 regulates organ size by repressing cell proliferation in Arabidopsis. Here we report that a mutant allele of STERILE APETALA (SAP) suppresses the da1-1 mutant phenotype. We show that SAP is an F-box protein that forms part of a SKP1/Cullin/F-box E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and controls organ size by promoting the proliferation of meristemoid cells. Genetic analyses suggest that SAP may act in the same pathway with PEAPOD1 and PEAPOD2, which are negative regulators of meristemoid proliferation, to control organ size, but does so independently of DA1. Further results reveal that SAP physically associates with PEAPOD1 and PEAPOD2, and targets them for degradation. These findings define a molecular mechanism by which SAP and PEAPOD control organ size. 	Nat_Commun	D016428 D013485
17848557	20070913	Selective restoration of the selenoprotein population in a mouse hepatocyte selenoproteinless background with different mutant selenocysteine tRNAs lacking Um34.	Novel mouse models were developed in which the hepatic selenoprotein population was targeted for removal by disrupting the selenocysteine (Sec) tRNA([Ser]Sec) gene (trsp), and selenoprotein expression was then restored by introducing wild type or mutant trsp transgenes. The selenoprotein population was partially replaced in liver with mutant transgenes encoding mutations at either position 34 (34T--&gt;A) or 37 (37A--&gt;G) in tRNA([Ser]Sec). The A34 transgene product lacked the highly modified 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2'-O-methyluridine, and its mutant base A was converted to I34. The G37 transgene product lacked the highly modified N(6)-isopentenyladenosine. Both mutant tRNAs lacked the 2'-methylribose at position 34 (Um34), and both supported expression of housekeeping selenoproteins (e.g. thioredoxin reductase 1) in liver but not stress-related proteins (e.g. glutathione peroxidase 1). Thus, Um34 is responsible for synthesis of a select group of selenoproteins rather than the entire selenoprotein population. The ICA anticodon in the A34 mutant tRNA decoded Cys codons, UGU and UGC, as well as the Sec codon, UGA. However, metabolic labeling of A34 transgenic mice with (75)Se revealed that selenoproteins incorporated the label from the A34 mutant tRNA, whereas other proteins did not. These results suggest that the A34 mutant tRNA did not randomly insert Sec in place of Cys, but specifically targeted selected selenoproteins. High copy numbers of A34 transgene, but not G37 transgene, were not tolerated in the absence of wild type trsp, further suggesting insertion of Sec in place of Cys in selenoproteins. 	J._Biol._Chem.

22585858	20120516	Inherited variation at chromosome 12p13.33, including RAD52, influences the risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma.	Although lung cancer is largely caused by tobacco smoking, inherited genetic factors play a role in its etiology. Genome-wide association studies in Europeans have only robustly demonstrated 3 polymorphic variations that influence the risk of lung cancer. Tumor heterogeneity may have hampered the detection of association signal when all lung cancer subtypes were analyzed together. In a genome-wide association study of 5,355 European ever-smoker lung cancer patients and 4,344 smoking control subjects, we conducted a pathway-based analysis in lung cancer histologic subtypes with 19,082 single-nucleotide polymorphisms mapping to 917 genes in the HuGE-defined &quot;inflammation&quot; pathway. We identified a susceptibility locus for squamous cell lung carcinoma at 12p13.33 (RAD52, rs6489769) and replicated the association in 3 independent studies totaling 3,359 squamous cell lung carcinoma cases and 9,100 controls (OR = 1.20, P(combined) = 2.3 ? 10(-8)). The combination of pathway-based approaches and information on disease-specific subtypes can improve the identification of cancer susceptibility loci in heterogeneous diseases.

26261231	20150812	Analysis of human cytomegalovirus replication in primary cultured human corneal endothelial cells.	Since the first case of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-induced corneal endotheliitis in which HCMV DNA was detected from the patient's aqueous humour using PCR, the clinical evidence for HCMV endotheliitis has been accumulating. However, it remains to be confirmed whether HCMV can efficiently replicate in corneal endothelial cells. We, therefore, sought to determine whether primary cultured human corneal endothelial cells (HCECs) could support HCMV replication. Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) have been shown to be fully permissive for HCMV replication, and are commonly used as an in vitro model for HCMV lytic replication. Therefore, primary cultured HCECs or HFFs were infected with the vascular endotheliotropic HCMV strain TB40/E or laboratory strain Towne. We then compared viral mRNA and protein expression, genome replication and growth between the TB40/E-infected and Towne-infected HCECs and HFFs. When HCECs were infected with TB40/E or Towne, rounded cells resembling owl's eyes as well as viral antigens were detected. Viral mRNA synthesis and protein expression proceeded efficiently in the HCECs and HFFs infected with TB40/E or Towne at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI). Similarly, the viral genome was also effectively replicated, with UL44--a viral DNA polymerase processivity factor--foci observed in the nuclei of HCECs. HCECs produced a substantial number of infectious virions after infection with TB40/E at both a high and low MOI. Primary cultured HCECs could efficiently support HCMV replication after infection at both a high and low MOI. 	Br_J_Ophthalmol	D016428 D013485
20671926	20100731	Promoter variant of PIK3C3 is associated with autoimmunity against Ro and Sm epitopes in African-American lupus patients.	The PIK3C3 locus was implicated in case-case genome-wide association study of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) which we had performed to detect genes associated with autoantibodies and serum interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). Herein, we examine a PIK3C3 promoter variant (rs3813065/-442 C/T) in an independent multiancestral cohort of 478 SLE cases and 522 controls. rs3813065 C was strongly associated with the simultaneous presence of both anti-Ro and anti-Sm antibodies in African-American patients [OR = 2.24 (1.34-3.73), P = 2.0 x 10(-3)]. This autoantibody profile was associated with higher serum IFN-alpha (P = 7.6 x 10(-6)). In the HapMap Yoruba population, rs3813065 was associated with differential expression of ERAP2 (P = 2.0 x 10(-5)), which encodes an enzyme involved in MHC class I peptide processing. Thus, rs3813065 C is associated with a particular autoantibody profile and altered expression of an MHC peptide processing enzyme, suggesting that this variant modulates serologic autoimmunity in African-American SLE patients.

26848768	20160206	Detection rate of actionable mutations in diverse cancers using a biopsy-free (blood) circulating tumor cell DNA assay.	Analysis of cell-free DNA using next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool for the detection/monitoring of alterations present in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Plasma extracted from 171 patients with a variety of cancers was analyzed for ctDNA (54 genes and copy number variants (CNVs) in three genes (EGFR, ERBB2 and MET)). The most represented cancers were lung (23%), breast (23%), and glioblastoma (19%). Ninety-nine patients (58%) had at least one detectable alteration. The most frequent alterations were TP53 (29.8%), followed by EGFR (17.5%), MET (10.5%), PIK3CA (7%), and NOTCH1 (5.8%). In contrast, of 222 healthy volunteers, only one had an aberration (TP53). Ninety patients with non-brain tumors had a discernible aberration (65% of 138 patients; in 70% of non-brain tumor patients with an alteration, the anomaly was potentially actionable). Interestingly, nine of 33 patients (27%) with glioblastoma had an alteration (6/33 (18%) potentially actionable). Overall, sixty-nine patients had potentially actionable alterations (40% of total; 69.7% of patients (69/99) with alterations); 68 patients (40% of total; 69% of patients with alterations), by a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug. In summary, 65% of diverse cancers (as well as 27% of glioblastomas) had detectable ctDNA aberration(s), with the majority theoretically actionable by an approved agent. 	Oncotarget	D016428 D013485
28139534	20170201	Effect of p53 codon 72 polymorphism on the survival outcome in advanced stage cervical cancer patients in India.	The Arg&gt;Pro polymorphism in codon 72 of p53 gene is known to affect the susceptibility of cervical cancer differently in different population worldwide although information regarding its role in determining survival status and disease outcome in patients is lacking. The present study was conducted to determine the genotype frequency and prognostic role of p53 codon 72 Arg&gt;Pro polymorphism in patients with advanced stage cervical cancer in India. The p53 codon 72 polymorphism was determined in tumour biopsies (n = 107) and matched blood samples (n = 19) in cervical cancer patients using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method (PCR-RFLP). Effect of p53 genotype on the overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) was analyzed. Individual Arg or Pro alleles were studied for their significance on survival as Pro carriers (Pro/Pro + Arg/Pro) versus Arg/Arg individuals or Arg carriers (Arg/Arg + Arg/Pro) versus Pro/Pro individuals. The frequencies for Arg/Arg, Arg/Pro and Pro/Pro genotypes were 27.2, 49.5 and 23.3 per cent, respectively. There was no significant difference in the genotypes with respect to patients' OS or RFS. The findings of our study indicated that p53 codon 72 polymorphism might not be an independent marker in predicting clinical outcome in advanced stage cervical cancer patients. Further studies need to be done in larger samples to confirm these findings. 	Indian_J._Med._Res.	D016428
26322225	20150901	Characterization of novel carcinoma cell lines for the analysis of therapeutical strategies fighting pancreatic cancer.	Preclinical evaluations of chemotherapies depend on clinically relevant animal models for pancreatic cancer. The injection of syngeneic murine adenocarcinoma cells is one efficient option to generate carcinomas in mice with an intact immune system. However, this option is constrained by the paucity of appropriate cell lines. The murine pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines 6606PDA and 7265PDA were compared to the 6606l cell line isolated from a liver metastasis from mice suffering from pancreatic cancer. In tissue culture 6606PDA and 6606l proliferated faster than 7265PDA. 7265PDA cells were, however, significantly more sensitive to gemcitabine as assessed by BrdU-incorporation and trypan blue exclusion assays in vitro. Within 1?week after injection of either one of these three cell lines into the pancreas of C57BL/6J mice, carcinomas were observed by T2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging and histology. Three weeks after injecting 6606PDA or 6606l cells large carcinomas could be characterized, which were surrounded by extensive desmoplastic reaction. After injection of 7265PDA cells, however, remission of cancer was observed between the first and the third week. Compared to 6606PDA cell derived carcinomas a higher apparent diffusion coefficient was quantified by diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging in these tumors. This correlated with reduced cancer cell density observed on histological sections. All three cell lines can be used in vitro for testing combinatorial therapies with gemcitabine. The 6606PDA and 6606l cell lines but not the 7265PDA cell line can be used for evaluating distinct therapies in a syngeneic carcinoma model using C57BL/6J mice. Diffusion-weighted MRI proved to be an appropriate method to predict tumor remission. 	Cell_Biosci	D016428
17404685	20070404	Single amino acid substitutions in the HSV-1 helicase protein that confer resistance to the helicase-primase inhibitor BAY 57-1293 are associated with increased or decreased virus growth characteristics in tissue culture.	Two mutants (BAYr1 and BAYr2) that are 100-fold and &gt;3000-fold resistant, respectively, to the helicase-primase inhibitor (HPI) BAY 57-1293 were derived from a plaque-pure parental strain, HSV-1 SC16 cl-2. BAYr1 has two substitutions in the HSV-1 helicase (UL5) protein (A4 to V; K356 to Q) and BAYr2 has one (G352 to R). It was shown reproducibly that BAYr1 grows to higher titres in tissue culture while BAYr2 grows more slowly than wild-type. Marker transfer experiments confirmed that K356Q and G352R are the drug-resistance mutations and that they are directly associated with differences in virus growth in tissue culture. When BAYr1 was tested in a murine infection model, this virus was shown to be fully pathogenic. We present evidence that single mutations close to a predicted functional domain of an essential HSV-1 replication enzyme (helicase) are associated with drug resistance and virus growth characteristics.

23434401	20130226	[Left hemiparesis as a sign of onset of vanishing white matter disease. Identification of a new mutation].	Vanishing white matter disease is a genetic disorder of autosomal recessive inheritance that affects the brain white matter There are various phenotypes that differ in severity and age at onset. Usually, it is characterized by ataxia, spasticity and a progressive motor decline with exacerbations triggered by fever and mild head traumas. The patient was a 2.5 year-old girl who developed unstable gait, left hemiparesis and increased tendon reflexes following a mild head trauma. Brain MRI showed diffuse and symmetric white matter abnormalities with decreased signal on T1 and increased signal on T2 and FLAIR sequences. Vanishing White Matter disease was suspected. The diagnosis was confirmed by genetic molecular testing that showed 2 mutations in EIF2B5 gene. Both mutations were considered pathogenic, although one had not been previously described. Hemiparesis must be included among clinical features of vanishing white matter disease. Early diagnosis can help to avoid infections and traumas and allows families to be genetically counselled. Our case contributes with the identification of a new mutation in EIF2B5 gene (p.Gly132Ala in position 395), not previously described. Its characteristics suggest a high probability of being pathogenic. We believe that it should be considered among the complex EIF2B mutations responsible for the disease.

15201231	20040618	Expression of the efflux pump genes cmeB, cmeF and the porin gene porA in multiple-antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter jejuni.	In Escherichia coli, increased expression of efflux pumps and/or decreased expression of porins can confer multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR), causing resistance to at least three unrelated classes of antibiotics, detergents and dyes. It was hypothesized that in Campylobacter jejuni, the efflux systems CmeABC, CmeDEF and the major outer membrane porin protein, MOMP (encoded by porA) could confer MAR. The expression of cmeB, cmeF and porA in 32 MAR C. jejuni isolated from humans or poultry was determined by comparative (C)-reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and denaturing DHPLC. A further 13 ethidium bromide-resistant isolates and three control strains were also investigated. Accumulation of ciprofloxacin+/-carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) was also determined for all strains. Although resistance to ethidium bromide has been associated with MAR, expression of all three genes was similar in the ethidium bromide-resistant isolates. These data indicate that CmeB, CmeF and MOMP play no role in resistance to this agent in C. jejuni. Six MAR isolates over-expressed cmeB, 3/32 over-expressed cmeB and cmeF. No isolates over-expressed cmeF alone. Expression of porA was similar in all isolates. All nine isolates that over-expressed cmeB contained a mutation in cmeR, substituting glycine 86 with alanine. All cmeB over-expressing isolates also accumulated low concentrations of ciprofloxacin, which were restored to wild-type levels in the presence of CCCP. These data indicate that over-expression of cmeB is associated with MAR in isolates of C. jejuni. However, as cmeB was over-expressed by only one-third (9/32) of MAR isolates, these data also indicate other mechanisms of MAR in C. jejuni. 	J._Antimicrob._Chemother.	D016428 D013485

We provide data that establish a phosphorylation independent role of AKT1 in affecting MPM cell shape and anchorage independent cell growth in vitro and highlight the AKT1 isoform-specific nature of these effects.We describe that AKT1 activity is inhibited by the loss of SIRT1-mediated deacetylation and identify, by mass spectrometry, 11 unique proteins that interact with acetylated AKT1.Our data demonstrate a role of the AKT1/SIRT1/FOXM1 axis in the expression of the tumor suppressor ER?. We further demonstrate an inhibitory feedback loop by ER?, activated by the selective agonist KB9520, on this axis both in vitro and in vivo.Our data broaden the current knowledge of ER? and AKT isoform-specific functions that could be valuable in the design of novel and effective therapeutic strategies for MPM.

20829795	20100911	MEC-17 is an alpha-tubulin acetyltransferase.	In most eukaryotic cells, subsets of microtubules are adapted for specific functions by post-translational modifications (PTMs) of tubulin subunits. Acetylation of the epsilon-amino group of K40 on alpha-tubulin is a conserved PTM on the luminal side of microtubules that was discovered in the flagella of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Studies on the significance of microtubule acetylation have been limited by the undefined status of the alpha-tubulin acetyltransferase. Here we show that MEC-17, a protein related to the Gcn5 histone acetyltransferases and required for the function of touch receptor neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans, acts as a K40-specific acetyltransferase for alpha-tubulin. In vitro, MEC-17 exclusively acetylates K40 of alpha-tubulin. Disruption of the Tetrahymena MEC-17 gene phenocopies the K40R alpha-tubulin mutation and makes microtubules more labile. Depletion of MEC-17 in zebrafish produces phenotypes consistent with neuromuscular defects. In C. elegans, MEC-17 and its paralogue W06B11.1 are redundantly required for acetylation of MEC-12 alpha-tubulin, and contribute to the function of touch receptor neurons partly via MEC-12 acetylation and partly via another function, possibly by acetylating another protein. In summary, we identify MEC-17 as an enzyme that acetylates the K40 residue of alpha-tubulin, the only PTM known to occur on the luminal surface of microtubules.

The lack of an adequate therapy for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) contributes greatly to the continuous growing amount of papers and reviews, reflecting the important efforts made by scientists in this field. It is well known that AD is the most common cause of dementia, and up-to-date there is no prevention therapy and no cure for the disease, which contrasts with the enormous efforts put on the task. On the other hand many aspects of AD are currently debated or even unknown. This review offers a view of the current state of knowledge about AD which includes more relevant findings and processes that take part in the disease; it also shows more relevant past, present and future research on therapeutic drugs taking into account the new paradigm &quot;Multi-Target-Directed Ligands&quot; (MTDLs). In our opinion, this paradigm will lead from now on the research toward the discovery of better therapeutic solutions, not only in the case of AD but also in other complex diseases. This review highlights the strategies followed by now, and focuses other emerging targets that should be taken into account for the future development of new MTDLs. Thus, the path followed in this review goes from the pathology and the processes involved in AD to the strategies to consider in on-going and future researches. 	Curr_Neuropharmacol	D016428
21478399	20110412	Catellibacterium nanjingense sp. nov., a propanil-degrading bacterium isolated from activated sludge, and emended description of the genus Catellibacterium.	A novel facultatively anaerobic, non-spore-forming, non-motile, catalase- and oxidase-positive, Gram-negative and rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated Y12(T), was isolated from activated sludge of a wastewater bio-treatment facility. The strain was able to degrade about 90% of added propanil (100 mg l(-1)) within 3 days of incubation. Growth occurred in the presence of 0-4.5% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 0.5%), at 10-40 ?C (optimum 28 ?C) and at pH 5.5-10.0 (optimum pH 7.0). Vesicular internal membrane structures and photoheterotrophic growth were not observed. The major respiratory quinone was ubiquinone-10 and the major cellular fatty acid was summed feature 8 (C(18:1)?6c and/or C(18:1)?7c). The genomic DNA G+C content of strain Y12(T) was 63.7 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison revealed that strain Y12(T) was a member of the genus Catellibacterium, as it showed highest sequence similarities to Catellibacterium caeni DCA-1(T) (99.1%) and &lt;96.0% similarities with other species of the genus Catellibacterium. Strain Y12(T) showed low DNA-DNA relatedness values with C. caeni DCA-1(T). Based on phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic properties, strain Y12(T) represents a novel species of the genus Catellibacterium, for which the name Catellibacterium nanjingense sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is Y12(T) (=CCTCC AB 2010218(T) =KCTC 23298(T)). An emended description of the genus Catellibacterium is also presented. 	Int._J._Syst._Evol._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485
8526502	19951101	Isolation and characterization of genetically engineered gallidermin and epidermin analogs.	Gallidermin (Gdm) and epidermin (Epi) are highly homologous tetracyclic polypeptide antibiotics that are ribosomally synthesized by a Staphylococcus gallinarum strain and a Staphylococcus epidermidis strain, respectively. These antibiotics are secreted into media and are distinguished by the presence of the unusual amino acids lanthionine, 3-methyllanthionine, didehydrobutyrine, and S-(2-aminovinyl)-D-cysteine, which are formed by posttranslational modification. To study the substrate specificities of the modifying enzymes and to obtain variants that exhibit altered or new biological activities, we changed certain amino acids by performing site-specific mutagenesis with the Gdm and Epi structural genes (gdmA and epiA, respectively). S. epidermidis T?3298/EMS6, an epiA mutant of the Epi-producing strain, was used as the expression host. This mutant synthesized Epi, Gdm, or analogs of these antibiotics when the appropriate genes were introduced on a plasmid. No Epi or Gdm analogs were isolated from the supernatant when (i) hydroxyamino acids involved in thioether amino acid formation were replaced by nonhydroxyamino acids (S3N and S19A); (ii) C residues involved in thioether bridging were deleted (delta C21, C22 and delta C22); or (iii) a ring amino acid was replaced by an amino acid having a completely different character (G10E and Y20G). A strong decrease in production was observed when S residues involved in thioether amino acid formation were replaced by T residues (S16T and S19T). A number of conservative changes at positions 6, 12, and 14 on the Gdm backbone were tolerated and led to analogs that had altered biological properties, such as enhanced antimicrobial activity (L6V) or a remarkable resistance to proteolytic degradation (A12L and Dhb14P). The T14S substitution led to simultaneous production of two Gdm species formed by incomplete posttranslational modification (dehydration) of the S-14 residue. The fully modified Dhb14Dha analog exhibited antimicrobial activity similar to that of Gdm, whereas the Dhb14S analog was less active. Both peptides were more sensitive to tryptic cleavage than Gdm was. 	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485
12963677	20030910	Endothelin-1 gene Lys198Asn polymorphism and blood pressure reactivity.	The Lys198Asn polymorphism of the endothelin-1 gene has been associated with increased blood pressure levels in several studies involving European and Australian adults. The purpose of the present study was to examine the potential moderating influence of ethnicity, obesity, and socioeconomic status on associations between the ET-1/Lys198Asn polymorphism and hemodynamic function at rest and during two laboratory stressors (video game, forehead cold) in a sample of 161 black and 213 white American normotensive young adults (mean age, 18.5+/-2.7 years). Carrier status of the T allele was not associated with resting blood pressure or total peripheral resistance index. However, carriers of the T allele showed greater diastolic blood pressure increases to the video game (P&lt;0.04), particularly among those who were obese (P&lt;0.02). Carrier status also interacted with socioeconomic status such that T allele carriers who came from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds exhibited the greatest increases in systolic blood pressure to the video game challenge (P&lt;0.05). In conclusion, the findings point out the importance of examining the impact of genetic polymorphisms on blood pressure control phenotypes within the context of potentiating environmental factors.

27030108	20160401	Phosphorylation of EB2 by Aurora B and CDK1 ensures mitotic progression and genome stability.	Temporal regulation of microtubule dynamics is essential for proper progression of mitosis and control of microtubule plus-end tracking proteins by phosphorylation is an essential component of this regulation. Here we show that Aurora B and CDK1 phosphorylate microtubule end-binding protein 2 (EB2) at multiple sites within the amino terminus and a cluster of serine/threonine residues in the linker connecting the calponin homology and end-binding homology domains. EB2 phosphorylation, which is strictly associated with mitotic entry and progression, reduces the binding affinity of EB2 for microtubules. Expression of non-phosphorylatable EB2 induces stable kinetochore microtubule dynamics and delays formation of bipolar metaphase plates in a microtubule binding-dependent manner, and leads to aneuploidy even in unperturbed mitosis. We propose that Aurora B and CDK1 temporally regulate the binding affinity of EB2 for microtubules, thereby ensuring kinetochore microtubule dynamics, proper mitotic progression and genome stability.

9546354	19980418	Compound heterozygosity for missense (L156P) and nonsense (R554X) mutations in the beta4 integrin gene (ITGB4) underlies mild, nonlethal phenotype of epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia.	Mutations in the genes encoding the subunit polypeptides of the alpha6beta4 integrin (ITGA6 and ITGB4, respectively) have been previously demonstrated in patients with a lethal form of epidermolysis bullosa with congenital pyloric atresia (OMIM #226730). In this study, we demonstrate for the first time ITGB4 mutations in nonlethal phenotype of epidermolysis bullosa with congenital pyloric atresia. Specifically, the proband was shown to be a compound heterozygote for a missense mutation (L156P) and a nonsense mutation (R554X). The leucine substitution by proline was shown to affect a residue, which was precisely conserved in different human, rodent, and drosophila integrin-beta polypeptides, and consequently disrupts the alpha-helix formation of the polypeptide segment as determined by Garnier alpha-helicity plot. The nonsense mutation in another allele was accompanied by undetectable levels of the corresponding mRNA transcript, as determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The presence of a missense mutation, when combined with a premature termination codon mutation, may explain the milder blistering tendency of the skin in this patient. 	Am._J._Pathol.

18337304	20080314	Different cellular and molecular mechanisms for early and late-onset myelin protein zero mutations.	Mutations in the gene MPZ, encoding myelin protein zero (MPZ), cause inherited neuropathies collectively called Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1B (CMT1B). Based on the age of onset, clinical and pathological features, most MPZ mutations are separable into two groups: one causing a severe, early-onset, demyelinating neuropathy and a second, causing a late-onset neuropathy with prominent axonal loss. To investigate potential pathomechanisms underlying the two phenotypes, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with two late-onset (T95M, H10P) and two early-onset (H52R, S22_W28 deletion) mutations and analyzed their effects on intracellular protein trafficking, glycosylation, cell viability and intercellular adhesion. We found that the two late-onset mutations were both transported to the cell membrane and moderately reduced MPZ-mediated intercellular adhesion. The two early-onset mutations caused two distinct abnormalities. H52R was correctly glycosylated and trafficked to the plasma membrane, but strongly affected intercellular adhesion. When co-expressed with wild-type MPZ (wtMPZ), a functional dominant negative effect was observed. Alternatively, S22_W28 deletion was retained within the cytoplasm and reduced both adhesion caused by wtMPZ and cellular viability. Since the same trafficking patterns were observed in transfected murine Schwann cells, they are not an artifact of heterologous cell expression. Our results suggest that at least some late-onset mutations cause a partial loss of function in the transfected cells, whereas multiple abnormal gain of function pathways can result in early-onset neuropathy. Further characterization of these pathways will lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of CMT1B and a rational basis for treating these debilitating inherited neuropathies.

18782457	20080911	Selection of internal reference genes for SYBR green qRT-PCR studies of rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) tissues.	The rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) is a valuable and widely used model animal for biomedical research. However, quantitative analyses of rhesus gene expression profiles under diverse experimental conditions are limited by a shortage of suitable internal controls for the normalization of mRNA levels. In this study, we used a systematic approach for the selection of potential reference genes in the rhesus monkey and compared their suitability to that of the corresponding genes in humans. Eight housekeeping genes (HKGs) (GAPDH, SDHA, ACTB, RPL13A, RPL32, UBA52, PGK1Y, and YWHAZ) from rhesus monkeys and humans were selected to test for normalization of expression levels in six different tissue types (brain, colon, kidney, liver, lung, and stomach). Their stability and suitability as reference genes were validated by geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper programs. Intriguingly, RPL13A and RPL32 were selected as ideal reference genes only in rhesus monkeys. The results clearly indicated the necessity of using different reference genes for normalization of expression levels between rhesus monkeys and humans in various tissues. 	BMC_Mol._Biol.

11940329	20020410	Genetic variation of mannose-binding protein associated with glomerular immune deposition in IgA nephropathy.	To investigate the relationship between codon 54 gene polymorphism of the host defense molecule, mannose-binding protein (MBP), and the patterns of glomerular immune deposition in IgA nephropathy (IgAN). IgAN patients with different patterns of glomerular immune deposition were selected and divided into two groups. Group A consisted of 77 patients with glomerular IgA and C3 deposits, and Group AGM consisted of 70 patients with glomerular IgA, IgG, IgM, C3 and Clq deposits. Clinical features and laboratory relevant data of all patients were collected. One-hundred and forty healthy adults were recruited as normal controls. The MBP gene codon 54 GGC/GAC polymorphism was investigated by using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. The genotype frequency of GGC/GAC heterozygotes was significantly higher in Group AGM as compared with that of Group A (41.4% vs 19.5%, P &lt; 0.01) or normal subjects (41.4% vs. 26.4%, P &lt; 0.05), while no difference was found in the distribution of MBP genotypes between Group A and normal subjects. GAC allele frequency was also higher in Group AGM than that in Group A (0.24 vs. 0.14, P &lt; 0.05) or normal subjects (0.24 vs. 0.15, P &lt; 0.05). The variant allele (GAC) was markedly associated with Group AGM (OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.06 - 3.58). In both Group A and Group AGM, more patients carrying the variant allele had episodes of upper respiratory or gastrointestinal infections prior to the onset of IgAN than those with wild homozygotes (GGC/GGC). Genetic variation of the host defense molecule, MBP, may be involved in the formation of the diverse patterns of glomerular immune deposition in IgAN. The variant allele of the MBP gene may partially account for abundant immune deposits in some IgAN patients. 	Chin._Med._J.	D016428 D013485
19255246	20090304	Requirements for NuMA in maintenance and establishment of mammalian spindle poles.	Microtubules of the mitotic spindle in mammalian somatic cells are focused at spindle poles, a process thought to include direct capture by astral microtubules of kinetochores and/or noncentrosomally nucleated microtubule bundles. By construction and analysis of a conditional loss of mitotic function allele of the nuclear mitotic apparatus (NuMA) protein in mice and cultured primary cells, we demonstrate that NuMA is an essential mitotic component with distinct contributions to the establishment and maintenance of focused spindle poles. When mitotic NuMA function is disrupted, centrosomes provide initial focusing activity, but continued centrosome attachment to spindle fibers under tension is defective, and the maintenance of focused kinetochore fibers at spindle poles throughout mitosis is prevented. Without centrosomes and NuMA, initial establishment of spindle microtubule focusing completely fails. Thus, NuMA is a defining feature of the mammalian spindle pole and functions as an essential tether linking bulk microtubules of the spindle to centrosomes. 	J._Cell_Biol.	D016428 D052061 D013485
24140056	20131022	Evolutionary aspects of the synuclein super-family and sub-families based on large-scale phylogenetic and group-discrimination analysis.	Over the last decade, many genetic studies have suggested that the synucleins, which are small, natively unfolded proteins, are closely related to Parkinson's disease and cancer. Less is known about the molecular basis of this role. A comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary path of the synuclein protein family may reveal the relationship between evolutionarily conserved residues and protein function or structure. The phylogeny of 252 unique synuclein sequences from 73 organisms suggests that gamma-synuclein is the common ancestor of alpha- and beta-synuclein. Although all three sub-families remain highly conserved, especially at the N-terminal, nearly 15% of the residues in each sub family clearly diverged during evolution, providing crucial guidance for investigations of the different properties of the members of the superfamily. His50 is found to be an alpha-specific conserved residue (91%) and, based on mutagenesis, evolutionarily developed a secondary copper binding site in the alpha synuclein family. Surprisingly, this site is located between two well-known polymorphisms of alpha-synuclein, E46K and A53T, which are linked to early-onset Parkinson's disease, suggesting that the mutation-induced impairment of copper binding could be a mechanism responsible for alpha-synuclein aggregation.

15785027	20050324	Lack of association between common polymorphisms in genes of the renin-angiotensin system and mortality after myocardial infarction.	The insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in the ACE gene and the A1166C polymorphism in the AT1R gene have been associated with left ventricular remodelling and prognosis after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We investigated whether these genetic variants associate with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and increased risk for in-hospital mortality after AMI. Consecutive AMI patients were recruited on admission and were genotyped for the above-mentioned polymorphisms. The frequency of the studied genotypes did not differ significantly between deceased patients and those who survived. The LVEF did not differ among patients with or without the DD genotype (45 +/- 10 vs. 45 +/- 10%, p = 0.892) or the CC genotype (45 +/- 10 vs. 46 +/- 10%, p = 0.859). These data question the role of the studied genotypes in the pathogenesis of AMI and do not support the previously supported hypothesis that these genotypes influence prognosis after AMI.

25741874	20150306	Medicare Star excludes diabetes patients with poor CVD risk factor control.	CMS recently added medication adherence to antihypertensives, antihyperlipidemics, and oral antihyperglycemics to its Medicare Star quality measures. These CMS metrics exclude patients with &lt;2 medication fills (ie, &quot;early nonadherence&quot;) and patients concurrently taking insulin. This study examined the proportion of patients with diabetes prescribed cardiovascular disease (CVD) medications excluded from Star adherence metrics and assessed the relationship of both Star-defined adherence and exclusion from Star metrics with CVD risk factor control. Cross-sectional, population-based analysis of 129,040 patients with diabetes aged ?65 years in 2010 from 3 Kaiser Permanente regions. We estimated adjusted risk ratios to assess the relationship between achieving Star adherence and being excluded from Star adherence metrics, with CVD risk factor control (glycated hemoglobin [A1C]&lt;8.0%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]&lt;100 mg/dL, and systolic blood pressure [SBP]&lt;130 mm Hg) in patients with diabetes. Star metrics excluded 27% of patients with diabetes prescribed oral medications. Star-defined nonadherence was negatively associated with CVD risk factor control (risk ratio [RR], 0.95, 0.84, 0.96 for A1C, LDL-C, and SBP control, respectively; P&lt;.001). Exclusion from Star metrics due to early nonadherence was also strongly associated with poor control (RR, 0.83, 0.56, 0.87 for A1C, LDL-C, and SBP control, respectively; P&lt;.001). Exclusion for insulin use was negatively associated with A1C control (RR, 0.78; P&lt;.0001). Medicare Star adherence measures underestimate the prevalence of medication nonadherence in diabetes and exclude patients at high risk for poor CVD outcomes. Up to 3 million elderly patients with diabetes may be excluded from these measures nationally. Quality measures designed to encourage effective medication use should focus on all patients treated for CVD risk. 	Am_J_Manag_Care	D016428 D052061 D013485 D013487
20736309	20100826	The myotubularin phosphatase MTMR4 regulates sorting from early endosomes.	Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] regulates endocytic trafficking and the sorting of receptors through early endosomes, including the rapid recycling of transferrin (Tfn). However, the phosphoinositide phosphatase that selectively opposes this function is unknown. The myotubularins are a family of eight catalytically active and six inactive enzymes that hydrolyse PtdIns(3)P to form PtdIns. However, the role each myotubularin family member plays in regulating endosomal PtdIns(3)P and thereby endocytic trafficking is not well established. Here, we identify the myotubularin family member MTMR4, which localizes to early endosomes and also to Rab11- and Sec15-positive recycling endosomes. In cells with MTMR4 knockdown, or following expression of the catalytically inactive MTMR4, MTMR4(C407A), the number of PtdIns(3)P-decorated endosomes significantly increased. MTMR4 overexpression delayed the exit of Tfn from early endosomes and its recycling to the plasma membrane. By contrast, expression of MTMR4(C407A), which acts as a dominant-negative construct, significantly accelerated Tfn recycling. However, in MTMR4 knockdown cells Tfn recycling was unchanged, suggesting that other MTMs might also contribute to recycling. MTMR4 regulated the subcellular distribution of Rab11 and, in cells with RNAi-mediated knockdown of MTMR4, Rab11 was directed away from the pericentriolar recycling compartment. The subcellular distribution of VAMP3, a v-SNARE protein that resides in recycling endosomes and endosome-derived transport vesicles, was also regulated by MTMR4. Therefore, MTMR4 localizes at the interface of early and recycling endosomes to regulate trafficking through this pathway. 	J._Cell._Sci.	D016428 D013485
25835984	20150404	Catalytic Soman Scavenging by the Y337A/F338A Acetylcholinesterase Mutant Assisted with Novel Site-Directed Aldoximes.	Exposure to the nerve agent soman is difficult to treat due to the rapid dealkylation of the soman-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) conjugate known as aging. Oxime antidotes commonly used to reactivate organophosphate inhibited AChE are ineffective against soman, while the efficacy of the recommended nerve agent bioscavenger butyrylcholinesterase is limited by strictly stoichiometric scavenging. To overcome this limitation, we tested ex vivo, in human blood, and in vivo, in soman exposed mice, the capacity of aging-resistant human AChE mutant Y337A/F338A in combination with oxime HI-6 to act as a catalytic bioscavenger of soman. HI-6 was previously shown in vitro to efficiently reactivate this mutant upon soman, as well as VX, cyclosarin, sarin, and paraoxon, inhibition. We here demonstrate that ex vivo, in whole human blood, 1 ?M soman was detoxified within 30 min when supplemented with 0.5 ?M Y337A/F338A AChE and 100 ?M HI-6. This combination was further tested in vivo. Catalytic scavenging of soman in mice improved the therapeutic outcome and resulted in the delayed onset of toxicity symptoms. Furthermore, in a preliminary in vitro screen we identified an even more efficacious oxime than HI-6, in a series of 42 pyridinium aldoximes, and 5 imidazole 2-aldoxime N-propylpyridinium derivatives. One of the later imidazole aldoximes, RS-170B, was a 2-3-fold more effective reactivator of Y337A/F338A AChE than HI-6 due to the smaller imidazole ring, as indicated by computational molecular models, that affords a more productive angle of nucleophilic attack.

21652626	20110610	Involvement of afadin in barrier function and homeostasis of mouse intestinal epithelia.	Afadin interacts with the cytoplasmic region of nectins, which are immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecules at adherens junctions, and links them to the actin cytoskeleton. Afadin regulates activities of cells in culture such as directional motility, proliferation and survival. We used Cre-loxP technology to generate mice conditionally lacking afadin specifically in the intestinal epithelia after birth. The loss of afadin caused increased paracellular permeability in the intestinal mucosa and enhanced susceptibility to the tissue destruction induced by dextran sulfate sodium. The junctional architecture of the intestinal epithelia appeared to be preserved, whereas the deficiency of afadin caused the mislocalization of nectin-2 and nectin-3 from adherens junctions to basolateral membrane domains but not that of other components of apical junctions. By contrast, such phenotypic changes were undetected in mice lacking nectin-2, nectin-3 or both. These findings suggest that afadin plays crucial roles, independently of the role as the nectin-afadin module, in barrier function and homeostasis of the intestinal epithelia once the epithelial structure has been established.

25460916	20141203	The N-terminal fragment of a PB2 subunit from the influenza A virus (A/Hong Kong/156/1997 H5N1) effectively inhibits RNP activity and viral replication.	Influenza A virus has a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that is composed of three subunits (PB1, PB2 and PA subunit), which assemble with nucleoproteins (NP) and a viral RNA (vRNA) to form a RNP complex in the host nucleus. Recently, we demonstrated that the combination of influenza ribonucleoprotein (RNP) components is important for both its assembly and activity. Therefore, we questioned whether the inhibition of the RNP combination via an incompatible component in the RNP complex could become a methodology for an anti-influenza drug. We found that a H5N1 PB2 subunit efficiently inhibits H1N1 RNP assembly and activity. Moreover, we determined the domains and important amino acids on the N-terminus of the PB2 subunit that are required for a strong inhibitory effect. The NP binding site of the PB2 subunit is important for the inhibition of RNP activity by another strain. A plaque assay also confirmed that a fragment of the PB2 subunit could inhibit viral replication. Our results suggest that the N-terminal fragment of a PB2 subunit becomes an inhibitor that targets influenza RNP activity that is different from that targeted by current drugs such as M2 and NA inhibitors.

18157528	20071225	Characterisation of mutagenised acid-resistant alpha-amylase expressed in Bacillus subtilis WB600.	Based on the original thermostable alpha-amylase gene from Bacillus licheniformis, two amino acids were site-directed mutagenised by polymerase chain reaction to obtain a new gene. This gene, with Leu134--&gt;Arg and Ser320--&gt;Ala, was substituted for acid-resistant capability previously. To favor purification of the product, high-level expression and secretion of mature, authentic and stable recombinant mutagenised alpha-amylase were achieved with protease-deficient strain Bacillus subtilis WB600 as the host. The recombinant mutagenised alpha-amylase with the activity of 4,700 U/mL was then purified by ammonium sulphate fractionation, anion exchange and gel filtration, consecutively. By multi-step purification, the specific activity of the recombinant protein was up to 916.7 U/mg with a 187.1-fold purification. The mutagenised protein was found to be more acid resistant than the native protein. The optimum pH and stable range of pH with the mutagenised protein was 4.5 and 4.0 to 6.5, respectively, compared with pH 6.5 and 5.5 to 7.0 as the favorite pH and pH stability range of the native protein.

During the reaction catalyzed by enolase, a mobile loop, residues 36-45, closes over the active site. In order to probe the role of this loop movement in catalysis, the glycines at positions 37 and 41 of rabbit muscle enolase (beta beta) have been mutated to alanines. The mutant forms-G37A and G41A-of enolase are both active, but have altered selectivity for divalent cations. G37A, when assayed with Mg(2+), has 12% the activity of the wild type. However, it is twice as active as wild type when assayed with Mn(2+), Zn(2+), or Co(2+). G41A has 4% the activity of the wild type with Mg(2+), is more active than wild type with Co(2+), and slightly less active than wild type with Mn(2+) and Zn(2+). The kinetic isotope effect for both mutants is greater than that of the wild type with all 4 divalent cations. These results indicate that the flexibility of this loop has subtle effects on catalytic activity. 	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D013485
27187211	20160518	Revisiting spin-lattice relaxation time measurements for dilute spins in high-resolution solid-state NMR spectroscopy.	Numerous nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of spin-lattice relaxation times (T1S) for dilute spins such as (13)C have led to investigations of the motional dynamics of individual functional groups in solid materials. In this work, we revisit the Solomon equations and analyze how the heteronuclear cross relaxation between the dilute S (e.g. (13)C) and abundant I (e.g. (1)H) spins affects the measured T1S values in solid-state NMR in the absence of (1)H saturation during the recovery time. It is found theoretically that at the beginning of the S spin magnetization recovery, the existence of non-equilibrium I magnetization introduces the heteronuclear cross relaxation effect onto the recovery of the S spin magnetization and confirmed experimentally that such a heteronuclear cross relaxation effect results in the recovery overshoot phenomena for the dilute spins when T1S is on the same order of T1H, leading to inaccurate measurements of the T1S values. Even when T1S is ten times larger than T1H, the heteronuclear cross relaxation effect on the measured T1S values is still noticeable. Furthermore, this cross relaxation effect on recovery trajectory of the S spins can be manipulated and even suppressed by preparing the initial I and S magnetization, so as to obtain the accurate T1S values. A sample of natural abundance l-isoleucine powder has been used to demonstrate the T1S measurements and their corresponding measured T1C values under various experimental conditions. 	J._Magn._Reson.

27897178	20161130	Functional exploration of colorectal cancer genomes using Drosophila.	The multigenic nature of human tumours presents a fundamental challenge for cancer drug discovery. Here we use Drosophila to generate 32 multigenic models of colon cancer using patient data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. These models recapitulate key features of human cancer, often as emergent properties of multigenic combinations. Multigenic models such as ras p53 pten apc exhibit emergent resistance to a panel of cancer-relevant drugs. Exploring one drug in detail, we identify a mechanism of resistance for the PI3K pathway inhibitor BEZ235. We use this data to identify a combinatorial therapy that circumvents this resistance through a two-step process of emergent pathway dependence and sensitivity we term 'induced dependence'. This approach is effective in cultured human tumour cells, xenografts and mouse models of colorectal cancer. These data demonstrate how multigenic animal models that reference cancer genomes can provide an effective approach for developing novel targeted therapies. 	Nat_Commun	D016428

The utilisation of the Na/I symporter (NIS) and associated radiotracers as a reporter system for imaging gene expression is now reaching the clinical setting in cancer gene therapy applications. However, a formal assessment of the methodology in terms of normalisation of the data still remains to be performed, particularly in the context of the assessment of activities in individual subjects in longitudinal studies. In this context, we administered to mice a recombinant, replication-incompetent adenovirus encoding rat NIS, or a human colorectal carcinoma cell line (HT29) encoding mouse NIS. We used (99m)Tc pertechnetate as a radiotracer for SPECT/CT imaging to determine the pattern of ectopic NIS expression in longitudinal kinetic studies. Some animals of the cohort were culled and NIS expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The radioactive content of some liver biopsies was also measured ex vivo. Our results show that in longitudinal studies involving datasets taken from individual mice, the presentation of non-normalised data (activity expressed as %ID/g or %ID/cc) leads to 'noisy', and sometimes incoherent, results. This variability is due to the fact that the blood pertechnetate concentration can vary up to three-fold from day to day. Normalisation of these data with blood activities corrects for these inconsistencies. We advocate that, blood pertechnetate activity should be determined and used to normalise the activity measured in the organ/region of interest that expresses NIS ectopically. Considering that NIS imaging has already reached the clinical setting in the context of cancer gene therapy, this normalisation may be essential in order to obtain accurate and predictive information in future longitudinal clinical studies in biotherapy.

10680978	20000219	Characterization of norfloxacine release from tablet coated with a new pH-sensitive polymer, P-4135F.	A new pH-sensitive polymer, P-4135F, was evaluated as a colon delivery device for norfloxacine (NFLX) which is used for the therapy of patients with Vero toxin-producing Escherichia coli gastroenteritis. P-4135F has a dissolution threshold pH of 7.2 which is higher than the conventional pH-sensitive polymers, Eudragit S100 and L100. To compare the dissolution site of P-4135F coated tablets with other enteric polymer coatings, mini-tablets containing sodium fluorescein (FL) as a model drug were prepared by coating them with the three polymers. After oral administration of FL mini-tablets to rats, the first-appearance time, Ti, of FL into the systemic circulation was measured. The Tis were 0.7+/-0.2 h for Eudragit L100, 1.8+/-0.4 h for S100 and 2.0+/-0.3 h for P-4135F. Direct inspection of the dissolution process of the FL mini-tablets after oral administration to rats was performed by abdominal incision studies. All of the coated FL mini-tablets started to dissolve in the rat ileum. The dissolution sites were identified to be proximal to the ileocecal junction for P-4135F, at the middle part of the ileum for Eudragit S100 and at the proximal part of the ileum for Eudragit L100. NFLX tablets with different membrane thicknesses of P-4135F were prepared and were orally administered to beagle dogs. The colon delivery efficiency was evaluated by measuring the Ti of NFLX into the systemic circulation. The mean Tis were 1.33+/-0.33 h for 56.8+/-0.5 microm membranes, 3.75+/-0.25 h for 64.6+/-0.7 microm membranes, 4.00+/-1.00 h for 70.5+/-0.5 microm membranes and 3.00+/-1.00 h for 74.9+/-0.4 microm membranes. By comparing the Ti, 4.33+/-0.33 h, obtained after oral administration of NFLX in a pressure-controlled colon delivery capsule, and the colon arrival time, 3.5+/-0.3 h, determined by a sulfasalazine test in beagle dogs. P-4135F coated NFLX tablets appeared to dissolve and disintegrate before reaching the colon. Studies using rats and beagle dogs have suggested that P-4135F dissolves in the lower part of the small intestine, i.e., the ileum. These studies also suggest that this new polymer will be useful for the delivery of NFLX to the lower part of the small intestine. 	J_Drug_Target	D016428
18928532	20081022	Ploidy status and copy number aberrations in primary glioblastomas defined by integrated analysis of allelic ratios, signal ratios and loss of heterozygosity using 500K SNP Mapping Arrays.	Genomic hybridization platforms, including BAC-CGH and genotyping arrays, have been used to estimate chromosome copy number (CN) in tumor samples by detecting the relative strength of genomic signal. The methods rely on the assumption that the predominant chromosomal background of the samples is diploid, an assumption that is frequently incorrect for tumor samples. In addition to generally greater resolution, an advantage of genotyping arrays over CGH arrays is the ability to detect signals from individual alleles, allowing estimation of loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) and allelic ratios to enhance the interpretation of copy number alterations. Copy number events associated with LOH potentially have the same genetic consequences as deletions. We have utilized allelic ratios to detect patterns that are indicative of higher ploidy levels. An integrated analysis using allelic ratios, total signal and LOH indicates that many or most of the chromosomes from 24 glioblastoma tumors are in fact aneuploid. Some putative whole-chromosome losses actually represent trisomy, and many apparent sub-chromosomal losses are in fact relative losses against a triploid or tetraploid background. These results suggest a re-interpretation of previous findings based only on total signal ratios. One interesting observation is that many single or multiple-copy deletions occur at common putative tumor suppressor sites subsequent to chromosomal duplication; these losses do not necessarily result in LOH, but nonetheless occur in conspicuous patterns. The 500 K Mapping array was also capable of detecting many sub-mega base losses and gains that were overlooked by CGH-BAC arrays, and was superior to CGH-BAC arrays in resolving regions of complex CN variation.

26783747	20160120	Inhibition of Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase p110delta Does Not Affect T Cell Driven Development of Type 1 Diabetes Despite Significant Effects on Cytokine Production.	Type 1 diabetes is caused by the destruction of insulin producing beta cells by the immune system. The p110? isoform of PI3K is expressed primarily in cells of haematopoietic origin and the catalytic activity of p110? is important for the activation of these cells. Targeting of this pathway offers an opportunity to reduce immune cell activity without unwanted side effects. We have explored the effects of a specific p110? isoform inhibitor, IC87114, on diabetogenic T cells both in vitro and in vivo, and find that although pharmacological inhibition of p110? has a considerable impact on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, it does not delay the onset of diabetes after adoptive transfer of diabetogenic cells. Further, we demonstrate that combination treatment with CTLA4-Ig does not improve the efficacy of treatment, but instead attenuates the protective effects seen with CTLA4-Ig treatment alone. Our results suggest that decreased IL-10 production by Foxp3+ CD4+ T cells in the presence of IC87114 negates individual anti-inflammatory effects of IC8114 and CTLA4-Ig. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
27786189	20161028	CRISPR RNA-guided FokI nucleases repair a PAH variant in a phenylketonuria model.	The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a recently developed genome editing technique. In this study, we used a modified CRISPR system, which employs the fusion of inactive Cas9 (dCas9) and the FokI endonuclease (FokI-dCas9) to correct the most common variant (allele frequency 21.4%) in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene - c.1222C&gt;T (p.Arg408Trp) - as an approach toward curing phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is the most common inherited diseases in amino acid metabolism. It leads to severe neurological and neuropsychological symptoms if untreated or late diagnosed. Correction of the disease-causing variants could rescue residual PAH activity and restore normal function. Co-expression of a single guide RNA plasmid, a FokI-dCas9-zsGreen1 plasmid, and the presence of a single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide in PAH_c.1222C&gt;T COS-7 cells - an in vitro model for PKU - corrected the PAH variant and restored PAH activity. Also in this system, the HDR enhancer RS-1 improved correction efficiency. This proof-of-concept indicates the potential of the FokI-dCas9 system for precision medicine, in particular for targeting PKU and other monogenic metabolic diseases. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
27313571	20160618	On the Kinetic and Allosteric Regulatory Properties of the ADP-Glucose Pyrophosphorylase from Rhodococcus jostii: An Approach to Evaluate Glycogen Metabolism in Oleaginous Bacteria.	Rhodococcus spp. are oleaginous bacteria that accumulate glycogen during exponential growth. Despite the importance of these microorganisms in biotechnology, little is known about the regulation of carbon and energy storage, mainly the relationship between glycogen and triacylglycerols metabolisms. Herein, we report the molecular cloning and heterologous expression of the gene coding for ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.27) of Rhodococcus jostii, strain RHA1. The recombinant enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity to accurately characterize its oligomeric, kinetic, and regulatory properties. The R. jostii ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is a homotetramer of 190 kDa exhibiting low basal activity to catalyze synthesis of ADP-glucose, which is markedly influenced by different allosteric effectors. Glucose-6P, mannose-6P, fructose-6P, ribose-5P, and phosphoenolpyruvate were major activators; whereas, NADPH and 6P-gluconate behaved as main inhibitors of the enzyme. The combination of glucose-6P and other effectors (activators or inhibitors) showed a cross-talk effect suggesting that the different metabolites could orchestrate a fine regulation of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase in R. jostii. The enzyme exhibited some degree of affinity toward ATP, GTP, CTP, and other sugar-1P substrates. Remarkably, the use of glucosamine-1P was sensitive to allosteric activation. The relevance of the fine regulation of R. jostii ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is further analyzed in the framework of proteomic studies already determined for the bacterium. Results support a critical role for glycogen as a temporal reserve that provides a pool of carbon able of be re-routed to produce long-term storage of lipids under certain conditions.

7937743	19940927	Molecular cloning of a potential proteinase activated receptor.	A DNA sequence encoding a G-protein-coupled receptor was isolated from a mouse genomic library. The predicted protein is similar in structure to the thrombin receptor and has a similar activation mechanism. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, the receptor was activated by low concentrations of trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) and by a peptide (SLIGRL) derived from the receptor sequence, but was not activated by thrombin (EC 3.4.21.5). Trypsin failed to activate a mutant receptor in which the presumed cleavage site Arg-34-Ser-35 was changed to an Arg-Pro sequence. The agonist peptide (SLIGRL) activated equally well mutant and wild-type receptors. Northern blot analysis demonstrated receptor transcripts in highly vascularized tissues such as kidney, small intestine, and stomach. Because this, to our knowledge, is the second example, besides the thrombin receptor, of a proteolytically activated seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor, we have provisionally named it proteinase activated receptor 2.

26912996	20160226	SYNGAP1: Mind the Gap.	A cardinal feature of early stages of human brain development centers on the sensory, cognitive, and emotional experiences that shape neuronal-circuit formation and refinement. Consequently, alterations in these processes account for many psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Neurodevelopment disorders affect 3-4% of the world population. The impact of these disorders presents a major challenge to clinicians, geneticists, and neuroscientists. Mutations that cause neurodevelopmental disorders are commonly found in genes encoding proteins that regulate synaptic function. Investigation of the underlying mechanisms using gain or loss of function approaches has revealed alterations in dendritic spine structure, function, and plasticity, consequently modulating the neuronal circuit formation and thereby raising the possibility of neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from synaptopathies. One such gene, SYNGAP1 (Synaptic Ras-GTPase-activating protein) has been shown to cause Intellectual Disability (ID) with comorbid Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and epilepsy in children. SYNGAP1 is a negative regulator of Ras, Rap and of AMPA receptor trafficking to the postsynaptic membrane, thereby regulating not only synaptic plasticity, but also neuronal homeostasis. Recent studies on the neurophysiology of SYNGAP1, using Syngap1 mouse models, have provided deeper insights into how downstream signaling proteins and synaptic plasticity are regulated by SYNGAP1. This knowledge has led to a better understanding of the function of SYNGAP1 and suggests a potential target during critical period of development when the brain is more susceptible to therapeutic intervention.

23396137	20130212	Identification of multiple independent susceptibility loci in the HLA region in Beh?et's disease.	Beh?et's disease is an inflammatory disease characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers and significant organ involvement. Localizing the genetic association between HLA-B*51 and Beh?et's disease and exploring additional susceptibility loci in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region are complicated by the strong linkage disequilibrium in this region. We genotyped 8,572 variants in the extended HLA locus and carried out imputation and meta-analysis of 24,834 variants in 2 independent Beh?et's disease cohorts from 2 ancestry groups. Genotyped SNPs were used to infer classical HLA alleles in the HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1 loci. Our data suggest that the robust HLA-B*51 association in Beh?et's disease is explained by a variant located between the HLA-B and MICA genes (rs116799036: odds ratio (OR) = 3.88, P = 9.42 ? 10(-50)). Three additional independent genetic associations within PSORS1C1 (rs12525170: OR = 3.01, P = 3.01 ? 10(-26)), upstream of HLA-F-AS1 (rs114854070: OR = 1.95, P = 7.84 ? 10(-14)) and with HLA-Cw*1602 (OR = 5.38, P = 6.07 ? 10(-18)) were also identified and replicated.

26215728	20150729	Hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) protein of influenza C virus.	Influenza C virus, a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, causes flu-like disease but typically only with mild symptoms. Humans are the main reservoir of the virus, but it also infects pigs and dogs. Very recently, influenza C-like viruses were isolated from pigs and cattle that differ from classical influenza C virus and might constitute a new influenza virus genus. Influenza C virus is unique since it contains only one spike protein, the hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion glycoprotein HEF that possesses receptor binding, receptor destroying and membrane fusion activities, thus combining the functions of Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) of influenza A and B viruses. Here we briefly review the epidemiology and pathology of the virus and the morphology of virus particles and their genome. The main focus is on the structure of the HEF protein as well as on its co- and post-translational modification, such as N-glycosylation, disulfide bond formation, S-acylation and proteolytic cleavage into HEF1 and HEF2 subunits. Finally, we describe the functions of HEF: receptor binding, esterase activity and membrane fusion. 	Protein_Cell	D016428 D016454
23794271	20130625	Identification of residues essential for the activity and substrate affinity of L-carnitine dehydrogenase.	Recently, two L-carnitine dehydrogenases from soil isolates Rhizobium sp. (Rs-CDH) and Xanthomonas translucens (Xt-CDH) have demonstrated to exhibit mutually differing affinities toward L-carnitine. To identify residues important for affinity to the substrate, we compared the primary structure of Xt-CDH and Rs-CDH with the recognized 3D structure of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (PDB code: 1F0Y). Then, six residues of Xt-CDH (Phe143, Gly188, Ile190, Ala191, Gly223, and Ala224) and the corresponding residues of Rs-CDH (Tyr140, Ala185, Val187, Gly188, Ser220, and Phe221) were selected for further mutagenesis. The residues of Xt-CDH were replaced with that of Rs-CDH at the corresponding position and vice versa. All Rs-CDH mutants exhibited slight effects on substrate affinity, except for the double mutants Rs-V187I/G188A, which was devoid of enzyme activity. All Xt-CDH mutants showed different K m values. Xt-F143Y caused a higher increase in the K m value. Furthermore, the kinetic parameters of 10 mutants at Xt-F143 and Rs-Y140 were investigated. All Rs-Y140 mutants, except aromatic residues (Phe, Trp), produced proteins that were almost entirely devoid of enzyme activity and with disrupted affinity to L-carnitine. All Xt-F143 variants showed a marked reduction (P???0.05) in enzyme activity. Overall, our results suggest that the aromatic rings of Tyr140 in Rs-CDH and Phe143 of Xt-CDH are essential for substrate recognition. 	Mol._Biotechnol.	D016428
22307500	20120207	Impact of each individual component of the mutated PTS(Nag) on glucose uptake and phosphorylation in Ralstonia eutropha G?1.	A recent study of the UV-generated glucose-utilizing mutant Ralstonia eutropha G?1 comprising transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed clear evidence that glucose is transported by the N-acetylglucosamine-specific phosphotransferase system (PTS(Nag)), which is overexpressed in this mutant due to a derepression of the encoding nag operon by an identified insertion mutation in nagR (Raberg et al., Appl Environ Microbiol 77:2058-2070, 2011). The inability of the defined deletion mutant R. eutropha G?1?nagFEC to utilize glucose confirms this finding. Furthermore, a missense mutation in nagE (membrane component comprising the cell membrane spanning EIIC(Nag) and the cytosolic domain EIIB(Nag)) was identified, which yields a substitution of an alanine by threonine at aa 153 of NagE and may affect glucose specificity of the mutated PTS(Nag) in R. eutropha G?1. The investigation of various generated deletion and substitution mutants of R. eutropha H16 and G?1 in this study was able to elucidate these phenomena. It could be shown that the porin NagC, encoded by nagC being part of the nag operon, is not necessary, while NagE is required and is probably responsible for glucose transport through the cell membrane. The intracellular phosphorylation of glucose is obviously mediated by the glucokinase GLK and not by NagF (cytosolic component comprising the three soluble domains EIIA(Nag), HPr(Nag), and EI(Nag)). Our data clearly indicate that the derepression of the nag operon is essential for glucose uptake. The point mutation in NagE is not an essential prerequisite for glucose transport although it increased glucose transport as observed in this study. 	Appl._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485
19555743	20090627	The presenilin-1 familial Alzheimer's disease mutation P117L decreases neuronal differentiation of embryonic murine neural progenitor cells.	The presenilin-1 gene is mutated in early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease. The mutation Pro117Leu is implicated in a very severe form of the disease, with an onset of less than 30 years. The consequences of this mutation on neurogenesis in the hippocampus of adult transgenic mice have already been studied in situ. The survival of neural progenitor cells was impaired resulting in decreased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. Our intention was to verify if similar alterations could occur in vitro in progenitor cells from the murine ganglionic eminences isolated from embryos of this same transgenic mouse model. These cells were grown in culture as neurospheres and after differentiation the percentage of neurons generated as well as their morphology were analysed. The mutation results in a significant decrease in neurogenesis compared to the wild type mice and the neurons grow longer and more ramified neurites. A shift of differentiation towards gliogenesis was observed that could explain decreased neurogenesis despite increased proliferation of neural precursors in transgenic neurospheres. A diminished survival of the newly generated mutant neurons is also proposed. Our data raise the possibility that these alterations in embryonic development might contribute to increase the severity of the Alzheimer's disease phenotype later in adulthood. 	Brain_Res._Bull.

25319874	20141017	A newly identified missense mutation in RET codon 666 is associated with the development of medullary thyroid carcinoma.	A 38-year-old woman with a thyroid nodule measuring approximately 2 cm was suspected to have medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) because of markedly elevated serum calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen levels. There were no signs of pheochromocytoma, whereas primary hyperparathyroidism was suspected based on the findings of inappropriate hypersecretion of parathyroid hormone although no parathyroid tumor was detected with imaging studies. RET mutation analysis revealed a novel germline missense mutation in codon 666, c.1997A&gt;G (p.K666R). She underwent total thyroidectomy with lymphadenectomy and simultaneous total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue. She was given calcium lactate and alfacalcidol to prevent postoperative hypocalcemia. Pathological findings of the thyroid tumor were compatible with MTC, but the resected parathyroid glands were intact. To our knowledge, c.1997A&gt;G (p.K666R) is a new RET mutation. This is a minor variant, but it is significant because of the possible pathogenicity in tumor formation. It is often difficult to determine whether MTC is generated as part of MEN2-related disease or familial MTC when it is a unique manifestation. In addition, it is still unclear whether all missense mutations in this codon reported previously will lead to the same clinical course and prognosis. Further careful observations of clinical presentation are required to determine the clinical features associated with this variant. 	Endocr._J.	D002363 D016428
21940633	20110924	Procollagen C-proteinase enhancer stimulates procollagen processing by binding to the C-propeptide region only.	Bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP-1) and the tolloid-like metalloproteinases control several aspects of embryonic development and tissue repair. Unlike other proteinases whose activities are regulated mainly by endogenous inhibitors, regulation of BMP-1/tolloid-like proteinases relies mostly on proteins that stimulate activity. Among these, procollagen C-proteinase enhancers (PCPEs) markedly increase BMP-1/tolloid-like proteinase activity on fibrillar procollagens, in a substrate-specific manner. Here, we performed a detailed quantitative study of the binding of PCPE-1 and of its minimal active fragment (CUB1-CUB2) to three regions of the procollagen III molecule: the triple helix, the C-telopeptide, and the C-propeptide. Contrary to results described elsewhere, we found the PCPE-1-binding sites to be located exclusively in the C-propeptide region. In addition, binding and enhancing activities were found to be independent of the glycosylation state of the C-propeptide. These data exclude previously proposed mechanisms for the action of PCPEs and also suggest new mechanisms to explain how these proteins can stimulate BMP-1/tolloid-like proteinases by up to 20-fold.

24333122	20131217	Modification of recombinant elastase expressed in Pichia pastoris by introduction of N-glycosylation sites.	A novel N-glycosylation site was introduced into recombinant elastase (rPAE) at N36, N67, or N264 through the site-directed mutagenesis of I38T, A69T, or N266T, respectively. The A69T mutation completely inhibited the expression of rPAE. As expected, the I38T and N266T mutant proteins exhibited higher degrees of N-glycosylation compared with the wild type rPAE. The I38T mutant was more efficient in the hydrolysis of casein in aqueous medium and exhibited higher specific activity and k(cat) values and a lower K(m) value. In contrast, the N266T mutant and the wild type displayed similar values. Importantly, the I38T mutant achieved in higher rates and yields of peptide synthesis in 50% (v/v) dimethylsulfoxide, whereas the N266T mutant was similar to the wild type rPAE. Furthermore, the maximum yield of Z-Ala-Phe-NH2 synthesis catalyzed by the I38T mutant protein (87%) was higher than those achieved by the wild type (78%) and N266T mutant (78%) proteins. Neither the I38T nor the N266T mutation exerted significant effects on the rPAE solvent stability. In aqueous medium, the I38T mutation decreased the rPAE thermostability, and the N266T mutation slightly improved that. In conclusion, the I38T mutation improved the potential of rPAE in industrial applications. 	J._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485
2986112	19850401	Identification of cDNA clones encoding a precursor of rat liver cathepsin B.	Recent studies have suggested that many lysosomal enzymes, including cathepsin B (EC 3.4.22.1), may be synthesized as larger precursors and proteolytically processed to their mature forms. To determine the structure of the primary translation product of cathepsin B, we have screened a phage cDNA library for clones encoding rat liver cathepsin B. We synthesized two extended DNA oligonucleotides to use as hybridization probes: a 50-mer corresponding to the coding segment for residues 215-231 of mature cathepsin B and a 54-mer corresponding to residues 117-134. After screening 600,000 plaques, five clones were obtained that hybridized to the 32P-labeled 50-mer; of these, two (lambda rCB3 and lambda rCB5) also reacted with the 54-mer. DNA sequence analysis confirmed that lambda rCB3 and lambda rCB5 both encoded rat liver cathepsin B, and the translated sequence is in agreement with the sequence determined [Takio, K., Towatari, T., Katunuma, N., Teller, D. C. &amp; Titani, K. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80, 3666-3670], except for a tryptophan for glycine substitution at residue 78 and the presence of two amino acids at the junction site of the light and heavy chains. Moreover, the DNA sequence reveals an open reading frame extending beyond the 5' (NH2 terminus), and the predicted COOH terminus of the coding sequence for the mature protein is extended by six amino acids. These results confirm that the biosynthesis of cathepsin B involves a larger precursor form and demonstrate the effectiveness of long oligonucleotide probes for screening to detect rare cloned mRNAs.

20581821	20100629	Iron traffics in circulation bound to a siderocalin (Ngal)-catechol complex.	The lipocalins are secreted proteins that bind small organic molecules. Scn-Ngal (also known as neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin, siderocalin, lipocalin 2) sequesters bacterial iron chelators, called siderophores, and consequently blocks bacterial growth. However, Scn-Ngal is also prominently expressed in aseptic diseases, implying that it binds additional ligands and serves additional functions. Using chemical screens, crystallography and fluorescence methods, we report that Scn-Ngal binds iron together with a small metabolic product called catechol. The formation of the complex blocked the reactivity of iron and permitted its transport once introduced into circulation in vivo. Scn-Ngal then recycled its iron in endosomes by a pH-sensitive mechanism. As catechols derive from bacterial and mammalian metabolism of dietary compounds, the Scn-Ngal-catechol-Fe(III) complex represents an unforeseen microbial-host interaction, which mimics Scn-Ngal-siderophore interactions but instead traffics iron in aseptic tissues. These results identify an endogenous siderophore, which may link the disparate roles of Scn-Ngal in different diseases. 	Nat._Chem._Biol.	D016428 D052061 D013485

24127209	20131016	Clinical pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and its metabolites in patients with cardiovascular diseases.	Approximately 5-40?% of patients treated with clopidogrel do not display an adequate antiplatelet response. Clopidogrel resistance may be caused by insufficient drug absorption or impaired metabolic activation of the drug. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and its metabolites in plasma samples from patients treated with high and low doses of clopidogrel, to obtain a possible explanation for antiplatelet resistance. The study included patients receiving either a single 300?mg loading dose of clopidogrel (n?=?17) or a 75?mg dose (n?=?45) for at least 7?days before sample collection. The concentrations of clopidogrel and its metabolites-the inactive H3 and the pharmacologically active H4 isomers of the thiol metabolite and the inactive carboxylic acid metabolite-in plasma samples (stabilized with 2-bromo-3'-methoxyacetophenone) from three patients after 300?mg and from 41 patients after 75?mg of the drug were determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method with tandem mass spectrometry. The non-stabilized samples from the remaining patients were analysed using a validated capillary electrophoresis method. The calculated concentrations were used to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of the analytes. The pharmacodynamic response to clopidogrel treatment, expressed as adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation, was measured using a Multiplate analyser. The pharmacokinetic parameter values for the H3 and H4 isomers determined in the studied group of patients treated with clopidogrel 75?mg (maximum plasma concentration [C max] 5.29???5.54 and 7.13???6.32?ng/mL for H3 and H4, respectively; area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to time?t [AUC t ] 7.37???6.71 and 11.30???9.58?ng?h/mL for H3 and H4, respectively) were lower than those reported in healthy volunteers, according to the literature data. Platelet aggregation measured with a Multiplate analyser ranged between 37 and 747?AU?min. A significant correlation was found between the C max of the active H4 isomer and platelet aggregation (p?=?0.025). The C max of the active H4 isomer and platelet aggregation measured by the Multiplate analyser may serve as markers of the patient response to clopidogrel therapy.

8873609	19961015	Electron transfer in tetrahemic cytochromes c3: spectroelectrochemical evidence for a conformational change triggered by heme IV reduction.	Electron transfer in tetrahemic cytochromes c3 from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (D.v.H.) and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Norway (D.d.N.) strains has been investigated by thin layer spectroelectrochemistry with visible absorption, CD, and resonance Raman (RR) monitoring. The observed splitting of the isosbestic point in the Soret absorption band indicates that the electron transfer from the (FeIII)4 state to the (FeII)4 state proceeds via an intermediate species, which corresponds to 25 and 50% reduction for the D.v.H. cyt.c3 and the D.d.N. cyt.c3, respectively. For the latter, a specific CD signal is observed at half-reduction. RR monitoring of the redox process does not reveal multiple splitting of the high-frequency RR bands, at variance with previously published results on the enzymatic reduction of cyt.c3 from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki, a cytochrome highly homologous to D.v.H. cyt.c3 [Verma, A.L., Kimura, A., Nakamura, A., Yagi, T., Inoguchi, H., &amp; Kitagawa, T. (1988) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110, 6617-6623]. The low-frequency RR spectra of the intermediate species differ significantly from the ones calculated from a linear combination of the all-ferric and all-ferrous states, for the same reduction ratio. Frequency shifts of the bending modes of the cysteine and propionate heme substituents are observed, as well as changes specific to each cytochrome; most notable is the activation of two torsional modes in the case of D.d.N. cyt.c3. Comparison of the results obtained for the two cytochromes leads to the conclusion that reduction of heme IV triggers the observed conformational change. This conclusion is supported by the spectroelectrochemical investigation of the mutant D.v.H. cyt.c3 H25M, in which the sixth ligand of heme III, histidine, is replaced by a methionine.

22911886	20120823	Serine 727 phosphorylation of STAT3: an early change in mouse hepatocarcinogenesis induced by neonatal treatment with diethylnitrosamine.	STAT3 activation is involved in development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated STAT3 activation during hepatocarcinogenesis induced by neonatal diethylnitrosamine (DEN) treatment in mice. Nuclear accumulation and phosphorylation of STAT3 were detected in altered hepatocyte foci in the early stages as well as adenomas and HCCs in the late stages. Although total STAT3 levels were the same between the hepatic lesions and normal livers, S727-phosphorylated STAT3 was enhanced in adenomas and HCCs, whereas Y705-phosphorylated STAT3 was detected mainly in HCCs. In mouse HCC cell lines, although both S727 and Y705 remained un- or hypophosphorylated under serum-free conditions, fetal bovine serum (FBS) induced strong S727/weak Y705 phosphorylation, STAT3 nuclear accumulation and cell proliferation, whereas IL-6 treatment without FBS caused Y705 phosphorylation without S727 phosphorylation, STAT3 nuclear accumulation or cell proliferation. When HCCs were simultaneously treated with FBS/IL-6, selective suppression of S727 phosphorylation by an MEK inhibitor prevented STAT3 nuclear accumulation and cell proliferation. Furthermore, an S727 phosphorylation-deficient STAT3 mutant (S727A) had a diminished capacity to accumulate in the nucleus when compared with wild-type (WT) or the phosphorylation-mimic mutant (S727D) following treatment with FBS/IL-6. After treatment with FBS/IL-6, the cells expressing the S727A mutant proliferated more slowly than those expressing WT or S727D mutant. In contrast, suppression of Y705 phosphorylation by a JAK inhibitor in the FBS/IL-6 treated cells did not affect STAT3 nuclear accumulation or cell proliferation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that STAT3 activation, mainly through S727 phosphorylation, contributes to the DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis at the earliest stages. 	Mol._Carcinog.

24808854	20140509	The meaning of spikes from the neuron's point of view: predictive homeostasis generates the appearance of randomness.	The conventional interpretation of spikes is from the perspective of an external observer with knowledge of a neuron's inputs and outputs who is ignorant of the contents of the &quot;black box&quot; that is the neuron. Here we consider a neuron to be an observer and we interpret spikes from the neuron's perspective. We propose both a descriptive hypothesis based on physics and logic, and a prescriptive hypothesis based on biological optimality. Our descriptive hypothesis is that a neuron's membrane excitability is &quot;known&quot; and the amplitude of a future excitatory postsynaptic conductance (EPSG) is &quot;unknown&quot;. Therefore excitability is an expectation of EPSG amplitude and a spike is generated only when EPSG amplitude exceeds its expectation (&quot;prediction error&quot;). Our prescriptive hypothesis is that a diversity of synaptic inputs and voltage-regulated ion channels implement &quot;predictive homeostasis&quot;, working to insure that the expectation is accurate. The homeostatic ideal and optimal expectation would be achieved when an EPSP reaches precisely to spike threshold, so that spike output is exquisitely sensitive to small variations in EPSG input. To an external observer who knows neither EPSG amplitude nor membrane excitability, spikes would appear random if the neuron is making accurate predictions. We review experimental evidence that spike probabilities are indeed maintained near an average of 0.5 under natural conditions, and we suggest that the same principles may also explain why synaptic vesicle release appears to be &quot;stochastic&quot;. Whereas the present hypothesis accords with principles of efficient coding dating back to Barlow (1961), it contradicts decades of assertions that neural activity is substantially &quot;random&quot; or &quot;noisy&quot;. The apparent randomness is by design, and like many other examples of apparent randomness, it corresponds to the ignorance of external macroscopic observers about the detailed inner workings of a microscopic system.

22446313	20120327	Production and consumption of hydrogen in hot spring microbial mats dominated by a filamentous anoxygenic photosynthetic bacterium.	Microbial mats containing the filamentous anoxygenic photosynthetic bacterium Chloroflexus aggregans develop at Nakabusa hot spring in Japan. Under anaerobic conditions in these mats, interspecies interaction between sulfate-reducing bacteria as sulfide producers and C. aggregans as a sulfide consumer has been proposed to constitute a sulfur cycle; however, the electron donor utilized for microbial sulfide production at Nakabusa remains to be identified. In order to determine this electron donor and its source, ex situ experimental incubation of mats was explored. In the presence of molybdate, which inhibits biological sulfate reduction, hydrogen gas was released from mat samples, indicating that this hydrogen is normally consumed as an electron donor by sulfate-reducing bacteria. Hydrogen production decreased under illumination, indicating that C. aggregans also functions as a hydrogen consumer. Small amounts of hydrogen may have also been consumed for sulfur reduction. Clone library analysis of 16S rRNA genes amplified from the mats indicated the existence of several species of hydrogen-producing fermentative bacteria. Among them, the most dominant fermenter, Fervidobacterium sp., was successfully isolated. This isolate produced hydrogen through the fermentation of organic carbon. Dispersion of microbial cells in the mats resulted in hydrogen production without the addition of molybdate, suggesting that simultaneous production and consumption of hydrogen in the mats requires dense packing of cells. We propose a cyclic electron flow within the microbial mats, i.e., electron flow occurs through three elements: S (elemental sulfur, sulfide, sulfate), C (carbon dioxide, organic carbon) and H (di-hydrogen, protons).

15756275	20050310	The R72P P53 mutation is associated with familial breast cancer in Jewish women.	BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations account for a substantial proportion of familial breast cancer, but clearly mutations in additional genes exist, one candidate being the p53 gene. To evaluate its putative involvement in inherited predisposition to breast/ovarian cancer in Jewish high-risk women, mutational analysis of the p53 gene (exons 4-9) was carried out using exon-specific polymerase chain reaction followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis, complemented by DNA sequencing of abnormally migrating fragments. Overall, 132 Jewish breast cancer patient non-BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and 167 average risk controls (Ashkenazi (n=60), non-Ashkenazi (n=107)) were genotyped, and no inactivating p53 germline mutations were detected. Consistent migration abnormalities were noted in 167 fragments, 134 of which were shown to be the Arg72Pro polymorphism, whereas migration abnormalities in fragments containing exons 4 (n=2) and 6 (n=23) and introns 3 (n=4) and 9 (n=4) corresponded to five previously described polymorphisms. Allele distribution of the R72P missense mutation between ethnically diverse Jewish breast cancer cases and average risk controls showed significant differences: among non-Ashkenazi breast cancer cases, 62.5%, 33.3% and 4.2% were homozygous, heterozygous and homozygous for the Arg72, Arg72Pro and the Pro72 polymorphism, respectively, whereas for controls, the distribution was 22.4%, 65.4% and 12.2%, respectively (P=0.00052), and among Ashkenazi breast cancer cases, allele distribution was 68.5%, 29.6% and 1.9%, whereas for controls, the distribution was 50%, 40% and 10%, respectively (P=0.0125). We conclude that arginine homozygosity at codon 72 of the p53 gene is associated with a significant increased breast cancer risk in Jewish high-risk population. 	Br._J._Cancer	D016428 D013485
27306065	20160617	Clostridium perfringens ?-Toxin Impairs Innate Immunity via Inhibition of Neutrophil Differentiation.	Although granulopoiesis is accelerated to suppress bacteria during infection, some bacteria can still cause life-threatening infections, but the mechanism behind this remains unclear. In this study, we found that mature neutrophils in bone marrow cells (BMCs) were decreased in C. perfringens-infected mice and also after injection of virulence factor ?-toxin. C. perfringens infection interfered with the replenishment of mature neutrophils in the peripheral circulation and the accumulation of neutrophils at C. perfringens-infected sites in an ?-toxin-dependent manner. Measurements of bacterial colony-forming units in C. perfringens-infected muscle revealed that ?-toxin inhibited a reduction in the load of C. perfringens. In vitro treatment of isolated BMCs with ?-toxin (phospholipase C) revealed that ?-toxin directly decreased mature neutrophils. ?-Toxin did not influence the viability of isolated mature neutrophils, while simultaneous treatment of BMCs with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor attenuated the reduction of mature neutrophils by ?-toxin. Together, our results illustrate that impairment of the innate immune system by the inhibition of neutrophil differentiation is crucial for the pathogenesis of C. perfringens to promote disease to a life-threatening infection, which provides new insight to understand how pathogenic bacteria evade the host immune system.

26583107	20151120	Cognitive Interventions in Older Persons: Do They Change the Functioning of the Brain?	Cognitive interventions for older persons that may diminish the burden of cognitive problems and could delay conversion to dementia are of great importance. The underlying mechanisms of such interventions might be psychological compensation and neuronal plasticity. This review provides an overview of the literature concerning the evidence that cognitive interventions cause brain activation changes, even in damaged neural systems. A systematic search of the literature was conducted in several international databases, Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Cochrane, and Psychinfo. The methodological quality was assessed according to the guidelines of the Dutch Institute for Health Care Improvement (CBO). Nineteen relevant articles were included with varied methodological quality. All studies were conducted in diverse populations from healthy elderly to patients with dementia and show changes in brain activation after intervention. The results thus far show that cognitive interventions cause changes in brain activation patterns. The exact interpretation of these neurobiological changes remains unclear. More study is needed to understand the extent to which cognitive interventions are effective to delay conversion to dementia. Future studies should more explicitly try to relate clinically significant improvement to changes in brain activation. Long-term follow-up data are necessary to evaluate the stability of the effects. 	Biomed_Res_Int	D016428 D016454
22924156	20120828	Insights into Assessing the Genetics of Endometriosis.	Endometriosis is a complex disease arising from the interplay between multiple genetic and environmental factors. The genetic variants potentially underlying the hereditary component of endometriosis have been widely investigated through hypothesis-driven candidate gene studies, an approach that generally has proven to be inherently difficult and problematic for a number of reasons. Recently, through major collaborative efforts in the endometriosis research field, hypothesis-free genome-wide approaches have started to provide new insights into potential pathways leading to development of endometriosis, as well as highlighting the phenotypic heterogeneity of the condition. This review summarizes the most recent studies investigating the genetic variation contributing to endometriosis, with a particular focus on genome-wide approaches, and discusses promising future directions of genetic research.

1926785	19911101	Antitermination of vaccinia virus early transcription: possible role of RNA secondary structure.	Transcription of vaccinia early genes by the viral RNA polymerase terminates downstream of a signal sequence TTTTTNT in the nontemplate DNA strand. Signal recognition occurs at the level of the sequence UUUUUNU in nascent RNA and depends on a virus-encoded termination factor (VTF). The presence of TTTTTNT elements within protein encoding regions of some early genes requires that these 5' proximal signals be ignored in order to achieve early expression of the full-sized proteins. In the case of the A18R gene, which contains a proximal terminator that is not utilized in vivo (Pacha et al., J. Virol. 64, 3853-3863 (1990)), the TTTTTNT sequence can be folded into a potential hairpin structure such that UUUUUNU would be part of a duplex stem in the nascent RNA. We find that the A18R putative hairpin is unable to promote factor-dependent termination in a purified in vitro transcription system. Sequence manipulations that abrogate the potential to form an RNA hairpin restore the activity of the TTTTTNT motif. The in vitro studies suggest that antitermination at the proximal site of the A18R gene may be mediated by secondary structure in the nascent RNA, and that early termination involves recognition by VTF and/or RNA polymerase of the UUUUUNU sequence in single-stranded form.

26281176	20150819	[ALLELES C282Y AND H63D HFE GENE, INSULIN RESISTANCE AND SUSCEPTIBILITY TO DISTURBANCE OF PORPHYRIN METABOLISM IN NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE].	The aim of the present work was to study the frequency of genotypes and alleles of C282Y and H63D HFE gene that may be associated with impaired porphyrin metabolism, as well as possible reasons for the formation of dysmetabolism porphyrins with NAFLD. The study involved 65 patients (52 men and 13 women) aged 21 to 69 years (mean age 48.5?1.5 years). Excretion uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin, 6-aminolevulinic acid of porphobilinogen in urine was determined by chromatography and spectrophotometry calculated total excretion of porphyrins. Allele frequencies C282Y and H63D were determined during the molecular genetic analysis of DNA using the polymerase chain reaction followed by analysis of length polymorphism restraktsionnyh fragments. Condition of carbohydrate metabolism was evaluated by the level of fasting blood glucose and standard glucose tolerance test. Diagnosis of insulin resistance was performed according to the criteria proposed by the European Group for the Study of insulin resistance (EGIR). Skill test for the C282Y mutation carriage and H63D in the HFE gene in 65 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Disturbances in the metabolism of porphyrins were recorded in 43 (66.2%) patients. H63D and C282Y mutations were found in 18 (27.7%) patients, of whom 13 (72.2%) people with different options dismetabolism porphyrins and signs of insulin resistance. In 47 (72.3%) patients without mutations studied porphyrin metabolism disorders were detected in 30 (63.8 %), of which insulin resistance is registered only in 16 (34.0 %). Detection of mutations C282Y and H63D in the HFE gene in combination with disorders of porphyrin metabolism on the background of insulin resistance is likely to allow such patients considered as candidates for inclusion in the higher risk of formation of diabetes.

25542253	20141228	Investigation of the possible association of NEDD4-2 (NEDD4L) gene with idiopathic photosensitive epilepsy.	NEDD4-2 alias NEDD4L (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated) gene was reported as a candidate gene for epileptic photo-sensitivity. We aimed to investigate this possible association of NEDD4-2 variants with idiopathic photosensitive epilepsy. Consecutive patients who had been followed up at our epilepsy center and diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy according to ILAE criteria and clear-cut photoparoxysmal responses in their electroencephalograms and 100 ethnically matched healthy subjects were included in the study. The regions around previously reported three variants, namely, S233L, E271A and H515P were tracked with DHPLC and the samples showing variations were sequenced. 81 patients (63 females) aged between 12-63 years (45 had juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, 11 childhood absence epilepsy, 14 juvenile absence epilepsy, 7 late onset idiopathic generalized epilepsy, 1 unclassified idiopathic generalized epilepsy, and 3 patients with idiopathic photosensitive occipital lobe epilepsy) were included in this study. We found only one heterozygous S233L variant in a 23-year-old man who has photosensitive form of juvenile absence epilepsy and pattern sensitivity to striped carpets. Other two variants were not found in any of the other patients and controls. Our results suggest that three screened NEDD4-2 variants do not play a leading role in the pathogenesis of photosensitive epilepsy in the Turkish population. 	Acta_Neurol_Belg	D016428
22995309	20120922	Inhibition of cell proliferation by a selective inhibitor of the Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channel, Ano1.	Ion channels play important roles in regulation of cellular proliferation. Ano1 (TMEM16A) is a Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channel expressed in several tumors and cell types. In the muscle layers of the gastrointestinal tract Ano1 is selectively expressed in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and appears to be required for normal gastrointestinal slow wave electrical activity. However, Ano1 is expressed in all classes of ICC, including those that do not generate slow waves suggesting that Ano1 may have other functions. Indeed, a role for Ano1 in regulating proliferation of tumors and ICC has been recently suggested. Recently, a high-throughput screen identified a small molecule, T16A(inh)-A01 as a specific inhibitor of Ano1. To investigate the effect of the T16A(inh)-A01 inhibitor on proliferation in ICC and in the Ano1-expressing human pancreatic cancer cell line CFPAC-1. Inhibition of Ano1 was demonstrated by whole cell voltage clamp recordings of currents in cells transfected with full-length human Ano1. The effect of T16A(inh)-A01 on ICC proliferation was examined in situ in organotypic cultures of intact mouse small intestinal smooth muscle strips and in primary cell cultures prepared from these tissues. ICC were identified by Kit immunoreactivity. Proliferating ICC and CFPAC-1 cells were identified by immunoreactivity for the nuclear antigen Ki67 or EdU incorporation, respectively. T16A(inh)-A01 inhibited Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) currents by 60% at 10?M in a voltage-independent fashion. Proliferation of ICC was significantly reduced in primary cultures from BALB/c mice following treatment with T16A(inh)-A01. Proliferation of the CFPAC-1 human cell-line was also reduced by T16A(inh)-A01. In organotypic cultures of smooth muscle strips from mouse jejunum, the proliferation of ICC was reduced but the total number of proliferating cells/confocal stack was not affected, suggesting that the inhibitory effect was specific for ICC. The selective Ano1 inhibitor T16A(inh)-A01 inhibited Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) currents, reduced the number of proliferating ICC in culture and inhibited proliferation in the pancreatic cancer cell line CFPAC-1. These data support the notion that chloride channels in general and Ano1 in particular are involved in the regulation of proliferation. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.	D016428 D052061
18632931	20080718	Self-limited hyperexcitability: functional effect of a familial hemiplegic migraine mutation of the Nav1.1 (SCN1A) Na+ channel.	Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is an autosomal dominant inherited subtype of severe migraine with aura. Mutations causing FHM (type 3) have been identified in SCN1A, the gene encoding neuronal voltage-gated Na(v)1.1 Na(+) channel alpha subunit, but functional studies have been done using the cardiac Na(v)1.5 isoform, and the observed effects were similar to those of some epileptogenic mutations. We studied the FHM mutation Q1489K by transfecting tsA-201 cells and cultured neurons with human Na(v)1.1. We show that the mutation has effects on the gating properties of the channel that can be consistent with both hyperexcitability and hypoexcitability. Simulation of neuronal firing and long depolarizing pulses mimicking promigraine conditions revealed that the effect of the mutation is a gain of function consistent with increased neuronal firing. However, during high-frequency discharges and long depolarizations, the effect became a loss of function. Recordings of firing of transfected neurons showed higher firing frequency at the beginning of long discharges. This self-limited capacity to induce neuronal hyperexcitability may be a specific characteristic of migraine mutations, able to both trigger the cascade of events that leads to migraine and counteract the development of extreme hyperexcitability typical of epileptic seizures. Thus, we found a possible difference in the functional effects of FHM and familial epilepsy mutations of Nav1.1. 	J._Neurosci.	D003160 D016428 D013485
20219970	20100312	Src-dependent TrkA transactivation is required for pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 38-mediated Rit activation and neuronal differentiation.	Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a potent neuropeptide that possesses both neurotrophic and neurodevelopmental effects. Recently, the Rit GTPase was found to be activated by a novel Galpha/cAMP/exchange protein activated by cyclic AMP (Epac)-dependent signaling pathway and required for PACAP-dependent cAMP response element-binding protein activation and neuronal differentiation. However, Epac did not function as a Rit guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), and the nature of the PACAP regulatory cascade remained unclear. Here, we show that PACAP-mediated Rit activation involves Src family kinase-dependent TrkA receptor transactivation. PACAP receptor (PACR1) stimulation triggered both G(i)alpha and G(s)alpha/cAMP/Epac regulatory cascades resulting in Src kinase activity, which in turn induced TrkA kinase tyrosine phosphorylation. Importantly, Src inhibition, or the lack of functional Trk receptors, was found to inhibit PACAP-mediated Rit activation, whereas constitutively active Src alone was sufficient to stimulate Rit-guanosine triphosphate levels. A single tyrosine (Y(499)) phosphorylation event was identified as critical to both PACAP-mediated transactivation and TrkA-dependent Rit activation. Accordingly, PACAP stimulation resulted in TrkA-dependent phosphorylation of both the Shc adaptor and son of sevenless (SOS)1/2 GEFs, and Rit activation was inhibited by RNA interference silencing of SOS1/2, implicating a TrkA/Shc/SOS signaling complex in Rit regulation. Together, these observations expand upon the nature of PACR1-mediated transactivation and identify TrkA-Rit signaling as a key contributor to PACAP-dependent neuronal differentiation.

23762397	20130614	Class 3 semaphorin mediates dendrite growth in adult newborn neurons through Cdk5/FAK pathway.	Class 3 semaphorins are well-known axonal guidance cues during the embryonic development of mammalian nervous system. However, their activity on postnatally differentiated neurons in neurogenic regions of adult brains has not been characterized. We found that silencing of semaphorin receptors neuropilins (NRP) 1 or 2 in neural progenitors at the adult mouse dentate gyrus resulted in newly differentiated neurons with shorter dendrites and simpler branching in vivo. Tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr 397) and serine phosphorylation (Ser 732) of FAK were essential for these effects. Semaphorin 3A and 3F mediate serine phosphorylation of FAK through the activation of Cdk5. Silencing of either Cdk5 or FAK in newborn neurons phenocopied the defects in dendritic development seen upon silencing of NRP1 or NRP2. Furthermore, in vivo overexpression of Cdk5 or FAK rescued the dendritic phenotypes seen in NRP1 and NRP2 deficient neurons. These results point to a novel role for class 3 semaphorins in promoting dendritic growth and branching during adult hippocampal neurogenesis through the activation of Cdk5-FAK signaling pathway.

21541198	20110505	Target therapies in lung cancer.	Targeting intracellular signaling molecules is an attractive approach for treatment of malignancies. In particular lung cancer has reached a plateau regarding overall survival, and target therapies could offer the possibility to improve patients' outcome beyond cytotoxic activity. The goal for target therapies is to identify agents that target tumor-specific molecules, thus sparing normal tissues; those molecules are called biomarkers, and their identification is recommended because it has a predictive value, for example, provides information on outcome with regard to a specific treatment. The increased specificity should lead to decreased toxicity and better activity. Herein we provide an update of the main target therapies in development or already available for the treatment of nonsmall cell lung cancer. 	J._Biomed._Biotechnol.	D016428 D016454
10531353	19991026	Lethal kinesin mutations reveal amino acids important for ATPase activation and structural coupling.	To study the relationship between conventional kinesin's structure and function, we identified 13 lethal mutations in the Drosophila kinesin heavy chain motor domain and tested a subset for effects on mechanochemistry. S246F is a moderate mutation that occurs in loop 11 between the ATP- and microtubule-binding sites. While ATP and microtubule binding appear normal, there is a 3-fold decrease in the rate of ATP turnover. This is consistent with the hypothesis that loop 11 provides a structural link that is important for the activation of ATP turnover by microtubule binding. T291M is a severe mutation that occurs in alpha-helix 5 near the center of the microtubule-binding surface. It impairs the microtubule-kinesin interaction and directly effects the ATP-binding pocket, allowing an increase in ATP turnover in the absence of microtubules. The T291M mutation may mimic the structure of a microtubule-bound, partially activated state. E164K is a moderate mutation that occurs at the beta-sheet 5a/loop 8b junction, remote from the ATP pocket. Surprisingly, it causes both tighter ATP-binding and a 2-fold decrease in ATP turnover. We propose that E164 forms an ionic bridge with alpha-helix 5 and speculate that it helps coordinate the alternating site catalysis of dimerized kinesin heavy chain motor domains. 	J._Biol._Chem.

11352695	20010516	Angiotensinogen mutations and risk for ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Six case-control studies from the Copenhagen City Heart Study.	The M235T and T174M angiotensinogen mutations have been linked to increased risk for ischemic heart and cerebrovascular disease. To determine whether angiotensinogen mutations are associated with ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Six case-control studies from the Copenhagen City Heart Study. Copenhagen, Denmark. Participants in the Copenhagen City Heart Study and patients from the same hospital with ischemic heart disease (n = 866 and n = 943, respectively), myocardial infarction (n = 519 and n = 493, respectively), or ischemic cerebrovascular disease (n = 489 and n = 434, respectively) and 7975 controls without these conditions. Genotypes for the M235T and T174M angiotensinogen mutations were compared between controls and Copenhagen City Heart Study participants with ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular disease (studies 1a, 1b, and 1c) and patients from Copenhagen University Hospital with the same conditions (studies 2a, 2b, and 2c). Relative allele frequencies of 235T and 174M in the general population were 0.41 and 0.12, respectively. Genotype was not associated with increased risk for ischemic heart or ischemic cerebrovascular disease in studies of either mutation alone or combined in women or men. Among compound heterozygotes (235MT /174TM ), women in case-control study 2a had decreased risk for ischemic heart disease in age-adjusted analysis; however, this decreased risk was not seen in multifactorial-adjusted or matched analyses, in men, or in case-control study 1a. Among double homozygotes (235TT /174MM ), women in case-control study 2b had increased risk for myocardial infarction in matched analysis; however, this increased risk was not seen in age- or multifactorial-adjusted analyses, in men, or in case-control study 1b. Among single homozygotes (235TT /174TT ), men in case-control study 2b had increased risk for myocardial infarction in multifactorial-adjusted and matched analyses. This risk was not present in age-adjusted analysis, in women, or in case-control study 1b. In addition, male single homozygotes had decreased risk for ischemic cerebrovascular disease in case-control study 2c in age- and multifactorial-adjusted analyses, but this finding was not seen in matched analysis, in women, or in case-control study 1c. In six large case-control studies, the M235T and T174M angiotensinogen mutations were not consistently associated with increased (or decreased) risk for ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, or ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Statistically significant associations may represent chance findings rather than real phenomena. 	Ann._Intern._Med.	D016428 D013485
23272127	20121229	Wax ester synthesis is required for Mycobacterium tuberculosis to enter in vitro dormancy.	Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is known to produce wax esters (WE) when subjected to stress. However, nothing is known about the enzymes involved in biosynthesis of WE and their role in mycobacterial dormancy. We report that two putative Mtb fatty acyl-CoA reductase genes (fcr) expressed in E. coli display catalytic reduction of fatty acyl-CoA to fatty aldehyde and fatty alcohol. Both enzymes (FCR1/Rv3391) and FCR2/Rv1543) showed a requirement for NADPH as the reductant, a preference for oleoyl-CoA over saturated fatty acyl-CoA and were inhibited by thiol-directed reagents. We generated Mtb gene-knockout mutants for each reductase. Metabolic incorporation of( 14)C-oleate into fatty alcohols and WE was severely diminished in the mutants under dormancy-inducing stress conditions that are thought to be encountered by the pathogen in the host. The fatty acyl-CoA reductase activity in cell lysates of the mutants under nitric oxide stress was significantly reduced when compared with the wild type. Complementation restored the lost activity completely in the ?fcr1 mutant and partially in the ?fcr2 mutant. WE synthesis was inhibited in both ?fcr mutants. The ?fcr mutants exhibited faster growth rates, an increased uptake of (14)C-glycerol suggesting increased permeability of the cell wall, increased metabolic activity levels and impaired phenotypic antibiotic tolerance under dormancy-inducing combined multiple stress conditions. Complementation of the mutants did not restore the development of antibiotic tolerance to wild-type levels. Transcript analysis of ?fcr mutants showed upregulation of genes involved in energy generation and transcription, indicating the inability of the mutants to become dormant. Our results indicate that the fcr1 and fcr2 gene products are involved in WE synthesis under in vitro dormancy-inducing conditions and that WE play a critical role in reaching a dormant state. Drugs targeted against the Mtb reductases may inhibit its ability to go into dormancy and therefore increase susceptibility of Mtb to currently used antibiotics thereby enhancing clearance of the pathogen from patients.

26678033	20151219	Primary cross-resistance to BRAFV600E-, MEK1/2- and PI3K/mTOR-specific inhibitors in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells counteracted by dual pathway blockade.	Intrinsic cross-resistance to inhibition of different signaling pathways may hamper development of combinatorial treatments in melanoma, but the relative frequency of this phenotype and the strategies to overcome this hurdle remain poorly understood. Among 49 BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines from patients not previously treated with target therapy, 21 (42.9%) showed strong primary resistance (IC50 &gt; 1 ?M) to a BRAFV600E inhibitor. Most of the BRAF-inhibitor-resistant cell lines showed also strong or intermediate cross-resistance to MEK1/2- and to PI3K/mTOR-specific inhibitors. Primary cross-resistance was confirmed in an independent set of 23 BRAF-mutant short-term melanoma cell cultures. MEK1/2 and PI3K/mTOR co-targeting was the most effective approach, compared to BRAF and PI3K/mTOR dual blockade, to counteract primary resistance to BRAF inhibition and the cross-resistant phenotype. This was shown by extensive drug interaction analysis, tumor growth inhibition assays in-vivo, p-ERK and p-AKT inhibition, promotion of melanoma apoptosis, apoptosis-related protein modulation, activation of effector caspases and selective modulation of genes involved in melanoma drug resistance and belonging to the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT canonical pathways. Compared to co-targeting of mutant BRAF and PI3K/mTOR, the association of a MEK1/2 and a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor was more effective in the activation of Bax and of caspase-3 and in the induction of caspase-dependent melanoma apoptosis. Furthermore Bax silencing reduced the latter effects. These results suggest that intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibition is frequently associated with primary cross-resistance to MEK and PI3K/mTOR blockade in BRAF-mutant melanoma and provide pre-clinical evidence for a combinatorial approach to counteract this phenotype.

15277671	20040728	Mapping glycoside hydrolase substrate subsites by isothermal titration calorimetry.	Relating thermodynamic parameters to structural and biochemical data allows a better understanding of substrate binding and its contribution to catalysis. The analysis of the binding of carbohydrates to proteins or enzymes is a special challenge because of the multiple interactions and forces involved. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) provides a direct measure of binding enthalpy (DeltaHa) and allows the determination of the binding constant (free energy), entropy, and stoichiometry. In this study, we used ITC to elucidate the binding thermodynamics of xylosaccharides for two xylanases of family 10 isolated from Geobacillus stearothermophilus T-6. The change in the heat capacity of binding (DeltaCp = DeltaH/DeltaT) for xylosaccharides differing in one sugar unit was determined by using ITC measurements at different temperatures. Because hydrophobic stacking interactions are associated with negative DeltaCp, the data allow us to predict the substrate binding preference in the binding subsites based on the crystal structure of the enzyme. The proposed positional binding preference was consistent with mutants lacking aromatic binding residues at different subsites and was also supported by tryptophan fluorescence analysis.

26834636	20160203	Physiological and Pathophysiological Insights of Nav1.4 and Nav1.5 Comparison.	Mutations in Nav1.4 and Nav1.5 ?-subunits have been associated with muscular and cardiac channelopathies, respectively. Despite intense research on the structure and function of these channels, a lot of information is still missing to delineate the various physiological and pathophysiological processes underlying their activity at the molecular level. Nav1.4 and Nav1.5 sequences are similar, suggesting structural and functional homologies between the two orthologous channels. This also suggests that any characteristics described for one channel subunit may shed light on the properties of the counterpart channel subunit. In this review article, after a brief clinical description of the muscular and cardiac channelopathies related to Nav1.4 and Nav1.5 mutations, respectively, we compare the knowledge accumulated in different aspects of the expression and function of Nav1.4 and Nav1.5 ?-subunits: the regulation of the two encoding genes (SCN4A and SCN5A), the associated/regulatory proteins and at last, the functional effect of the same missense mutations detected in Nav1.4 and Nav1.5. First, it appears that more is known on Nav1.5 expression and accessory proteins. Because of the high homologies of Nav1.5 binding sites and equivalent Nav1.4 sites, Nav1.5-related results may guide future investigations on Nav1.4. Second, the analysis of the same missense mutations in Nav1.4 and Nav1.5 revealed intriguing similarities regarding their effects on membrane excitability and alteration in channel biophysics. We believe that such comparison may bring new cues to the physiopathology of cardiac and muscular diseases. 	Front_Pharmacol	D016428 D016454
21060687	20101110	Universal plant DNA barcode loci may not work in complex groups: a case study with Indian berberis species.	The concept of DNA barcoding for species identification has gained considerable momentum in animals because of fairly successful species identification using cytochrome oxidase I (COI). In plants, matK and rbcL have been proposed as standard barcodes. However, barcoding in complex genera is a challenging task. We investigated the species discriminatory power of four reportedly most promising plant DNA barcoding loci (one from nuclear genome--ITS, and three from plastid genome--trnH-psbA, rbcL and matK) in species of Indian Berberis L. (Berberidaceae) and two other genera, Ficus L. (Moraceae) and Gossypium L. (Malvaceae). Berberis species were delineated using morphological characters. These characters resulted in a well resolved species tree. Applying both nucleotide distance and nucleotide character-based approaches, we found that none of the loci, either singly or in combinations, could discriminate the species of Berberis. ITS resolved all the tested species of Ficus and Gossypium and trnH-psbA resolved 82% of the tested species in Ficus. The highly regarded matK and rbcL could not resolve all the species. Finally, we employed amplified fragment length polymorphism test in species of Berberis to determine their relationships. Using ten primer pair combinations in AFLP, the data demonstrated incomplete species resolution. Further, AFLP analysis showed that there was a tendency of the Berberis accessions to cluster according to their geographic origin rather than species affiliation. We reconfirm the earlier reports that the concept of universal barcode in plants may not work in a number of genera. Our results also suggest that the matK and rbcL, recommended as universal barcode loci for plants, may not work in all the genera of land plants. Morphological, geographical and molecular data analyses of Indian species of Berberis suggest probable reticulate evolution and thus barcode markers may not work in this case.

14743906	20040128	Delayed neurological deficits detected by an ischemic pattern in the extracellular cerebral metabolites in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.	In the treatment of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), early occlusion of the aneurysm is necessary as well as monitoring and treatment of complications following the primary bleeding episode. Monitoring with microdialysis has been studied for its ability to indicate and predict the occurrence of delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DINDs) in patients with SAH. In 42 patients with aneurysmal SAH microdialysis monitoring of metabolites was performed using a 0.3-microl/minute perfusion flow over several days, and the results were correlated to clinical events and to brain infarction observed on computerized tomography scans. The microdialysis probe was inserted into the territory of the parent artery of the aneurysm. The authors defined an ischemic pattern as increases in the lactate/glucose (L/G) and lactate/pyruvate (L/P) ratios that were greater than 20% followed by a 20% increase in glycerol concentration. This ischemic pattern was found in 17 of 18 patients who experienced a DIND and in three of 24 patients who did not experience a delayed clinical deterioration. The ischemic pattern preceded the occurrence of a DIND by a mean interval of 11 hours. Maximum L/G and L/P ratios did not correlate with the presence of DIND or outcome, and there was no association between the glycerol level and subsequent brain infarction. Microdialysis monitoring of the cerebral metabolism in patients with SAH may predict with high sensitivity and specificity the occurrence of a DIND. Whether an earlier diagnosis results in better treatment of DINDs and, therefore, in overall better outcomes remains to be proven, as it is linked to an efficacious treatment of cerebral vasospasm.

8297373	19940128	Identification of a nonsense mutation in ALD protein cDNA from a patient with adrenoleukodystrophy.	The molecular basis of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) was investigated. Six (A to 50) fragments of cDNA for ALD protein (Mosser et al. Nature 361: 726-730, 1993) from an adult patient with adrenomyeloneuropathy were amplified by PCR and mutations were screened by Mutation Detection Enhancement gel electrophoresis. A single base substitution (2154 C--&gt;T, which resulted in the formation of a termination codon for glutamine (Q590STOP) and deletes Pst I site (CTGCAG--&gt;CTGTAG), was detected. Eight other ALD patients did not have this mutation. A family study revealed the presence of both the mutant and normal alleles in the mother, a sister and a niece, indicating that these individuals were carriers. A nephew with childhood ALD who died 10 years earlier had the same mutant allele as detected by Pst I restriction assay. This report is the first description of a mutant allele for ALD, at the cDNA level, and presents confirmatory evidence of ALD protein as the primary etiology of ALD. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.

15144854	20040518	Fibrillization of alpha-synuclein and tau in familial Parkinson's disease caused by the A53T alpha-synuclein mutation.	Mutations in the alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) gene are responsible for a rare familial parkinsonism syndrome, a finding that has led to extensive characterization of altered alpha-syn structure in sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. We report here the immunohistochemical, biochemical and ultrastructural characterization of alpha-syn neuropathology in a case of familial PD with the A53T alpha-syn gene mutation. Insoluble filamentous alpha-syn lesions were detected in almost all brain regions examined and as in sporadic PD, we observed the accumulation of insoluble nitrated alpha-syn in this familial disorder. Significant accumulations of filamentous insoluble tau protein also were detected in some brain regions of this patient, suggesting a role for A53T mutant alpha-syn in tau fibrillization. Indeed, in vitro studies of tau and alpha-syn fibrillization showed that the A53T mutation accelerated alpha-syn fibril formation, initiated tau assembly into filaments and synergistically enhanced fibrillization of both tau and alpha-syn. Our data implicate fibrillization of alpha-syn and tau in the pathogenesis of PD, and suggest that distinct amyloidogenic proteins may cross-seed each other in neurodegenerative diseases.

20424160	20100429	The tyrosine 343 residue of nucleophosmin (NPM)-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is important for its interaction with SHP1, a cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase with tumor suppressor functions.	The cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 has been shown to inhibit the oncogenic fusion protein nucleophosmin (NPM)-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and loss of SHP1 contributes to NPM-ALK-mediated tumorigenesis. In this study, we aimed to further understand how SHP1 interacts and regulates NPM-ALK. We employed an in vitro model in which GP293 cells were transfected with various combinations of NPM-ALK (or mutants) and SHP1 (or mutants) expression vectors. We found that SHP1 co-immunoprecipitated with NPM-ALK, but not the enzymatically inactive NPM-ALK(K210R) mutant, or the mutant in which all three functionally important tyrosine residues (namely, Tyr(338), Tyr(342), and Tyr(343)) in the kinase activation loop (KAL) of ALK were mutated. Interestingly, whereas mutation of Tyr(338) or Tyr(342) did not result in any substantial change in the NPM-ALK/SHP1 binding (assessed by co-immunoprecipitation), mutation of Tyr(343) abrogated this interaction. Furthermore, the NPM-ALK/SHP1 binding was readily detectable when each of the remaining 8 tyrosine residues known to be phosphorylated were mutated. Although the expression of SHP1 effectively reduced the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of NPM-ALK, it did not affect that of the NPM-ALK(Y343F) mutant. In soft agar clonogenic assay, SHP1 expression significantly reduced the tumorigenicity of NPM-ALK but not that of NPM-ALK(Y343F). In conclusion, we identified Tyr(343) of NPM-ALK as the crucial site for mediating the NPM-ALK/SHP1 interaction. Our results also support the notion that the tumor suppressor effects of SHP1 on NPM-ALK are dependent on its ability to bind to this oncogenic protein. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
26606804	20151127	[SMN1 Gene Point Mutations in Type I-IV Proximal Spinal Muscular Atrophy Patients with a Single Copy of SMN1].	Type I-IV proximal spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is one of the most common autosomal-recessive diseas- es, which are characterized in the majority of cases by a severely disabling course. Proximal SMA results from mutations in the telomeric copy of SMN-SMN1 gene. Major SMN1 gene mutation types are deletions in the exons 7 and/or 8, which were revealed to be in the homozygous state in 95% of patients. Deletions in the in- dicated exons of SMN1 gene were revealed in a compound-heterozygous state in combination with intragenic point mutations in the remainder 5% of proximal SMA cases. In the present study, we conducted an analysis of point mutations in eight patients with type I-III proximal SMA phenotype, which had a deletion in 7-8- exons of SMN1 gene in the heterozygous state. We revealed seven different mutations, two of which (c.824G &gt; C (p.Gly275A1a) and c.825-2A &gt; T) are described here for the first time. In addition, mutation c.824G &gt; C (p.Gly275A1a) was observed twice in the examined sample. In seven cases a heterozygous carrier of point mutations was one of the parents of the affected children (in six cases, the father; in one case, the mother). Only one mutation, c.43C &gt; T (p.Gln15X), emerged de novo in a genital cell of the child's father. 	Genetika	D004740 D016428
26985607	20160318	Community Health Workers Versus Nurses as Counselors or Case Managers in a Self-Help Diabetes Management Program.	To confirm the effectiveness of community health workers' involvement as counselors or case managers in a self-help diabetes management program in 2009 to 2014. Our open-label, randomized controlled trial determined the effectiveness of a self-help intervention among Korean Americans aged 35 to 80 years in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. We measured and analyzed physiological and psychobehavioral health outcomes of the community health worker-counseled (n?=?54) and registered nurse (RN)-counseled (n?=?51) intervention groups in comparison with the control group (n?=?104). The community health workers' performance was comparable to that of the RNs for both psychobehavioral outcomes (e.g., self-efficacy, quality of life) and physiological outcomes. The community health worker-counseled group showed hemoglobin A1C reductions from baseline (-1.2%, -1.5%, -1.3%, and -1.6%, at months 3, 6, 9, and 12, respectively), all of which were greater than reductions in the RN-counseled (-0.7%, -0.9%, -0.9%, and -1.0%) or the control (-0.5%, -0.5%, -0.6%, and -0.7%) groups. Community health workers performed as well as or better than nurses as counselors or case managers in a self-help diabetes management program in a Korean American community.

18398970	20080410	Clinical and genetic determinants of intracellular tenofovir diphosphate concentrations in HIV-infected patients.	Nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), such as tenofovir, require intracellular phosphorylation for pharmacologic activity. Drug transporters may contribute to the intracellular disposition of NRTIs. We characterized intracellular tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentrations in HIV-infected patients (n = 30), and investigated associations between TFV-DP concentrations and polymorphisms in the drug transporter genes SLC22A6, ABCC2, and ABCC4. Subjects were genotyped for 6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms: 2 in SLC22A6 (encodes influx transporter, human organic anion transporter 1), 728G&gt;A and 453G&gt;A; 2 in ABCC2 (encodes efflux transporter, multidrug resistance protein [MRP] 2), -24C&gt;T and 1249G&gt;A; and 2 in ABCC4 (encodes efflux transporter, MRP4), 3463A&gt;G and 4131T&gt;G. The mean TFV-DP was 76.1 fmol/10(6) cells (range: 16.3 to 212 fmol/10(6) cells). Tenofovir apparent oral and renal clearances were significantly predictive of intracellular TFV-DP concentrations. For every 1-L/h decrease in tenofovir renal clearance, there was, on average, an 8% increase in TFV-DP (P = 0.002). We identified a novel relation between ABCC4 3463A&gt;G genotype and TFV-DP. ABCC4 3463G variants had TFV-DP concentrations 35% higher (29 fmol/10(6) cells) than wild type (P = 0.04). This study provides direction for future investigations to elucidate the contribution of clinical characteristics and drug transporter genotype to TFV-DP safety and efficacy.

14594108	20031105	Identification of two novel mutations in the human growth hormone receptor gene.	Deletions and mutations in the growth hormone receptor gene are the underlying etiology of Laron syndrome (LS). Most of the patients are distributed in and originating from the Mediterranean and Middle-Eastern countries. Thirty-nine mutations have been described so far. We hereby report 2 novel nonsense mutations, one in exon 2 found in three Jewish-Iraqi patients from Israel; and another in exon 6 found in an Italian girl. DNA sequencing of exon 2 revealed a G to A transition at nucleotide 83 in the fourth codon of the signal peptide (W-15X). In exon 6, a T to A transversion was found in amino acid 141 (L141X). Both mutations introduced a premature termination codon that led to a truncated non-functioning receptor. In addition we found in the Jewish-Iraqi patients, a mutation in exon 7 (R211H, previously described) and in the Italian family the polymorphism Gly168, in exon 6. 	J._Endocrinol._Invest.

22702905	20120619	Single nucleotide polymorphism in the interleukin 12B gene is associated with risk for breast cancer development.	We analysed the association of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene encoding the IL-12 subunit p40 (IL12B, rs3212227, A&gt;C) with breast cancer. The SNPs allelic and genotypic frequencies were compared between patients (n?=?191) and healthy (n?=?194) women in a case-control study from Croatia. The major allele (A) was associated with susceptibility to breast cancer (P?=?0.003; OR?=?1.67; 95% CI: 1.17-2.38). Likewise, the minor allele (C) was significantly correlated with protection (P?=?0.003; OR?=?0.60; 95% CI: 0.42-0.86). At the genotype level, AA homozygosity was significantly associated with predisposition to disease (P?=?0.013; OR?=?1.68, 95% CI: 1.09-2.59), whereas the minor allele homozygosity (CC) was correlated with protection to disease (P?=?0.020, OR?=?0.28, 95% CI: 0.09-0.91). The heterozygous genotype showed no significant correlation with disease. The product of the IL12B gene (IL-12 p40) can either form a homodimeric cytokine or be part of two pro-inflammatory (IL-12 and IL-23) cytokines. It is presently unclear whether the major allele is associated with higher or lower protein levels of IL-12 p40 and IL-12 p70, which are critical in inflammation and adaptive immune responses. However, as the A allele is high producer of IL12B (p40) mRNA, these results might imply that higher levels of IL-12 p40 (either as homodimers or joined with one or both of the other two subunits) predispose to breast cancer.

26549933	20151110	Using random forests to diagnose aviation turbulence.	Atmospheric turbulence poses a significant hazard to aviation, with severe encounters costing airlines millions of dollars per year in compensation, aircraft damage, and delays due to required post-event inspections and repairs. Moreover, attempts to avoid turbulent airspace cause flight delays and en route deviations that increase air traffic controller workload, disrupt schedules of air crews and passengers and use extra fuel. For these reasons, the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have funded the development of automated turbulence detection, diagnosis and forecasting products. This paper describes a methodology for fusing data from diverse sources and producing a real-time diagnosis of turbulence associated with thunderstorms, a significant cause of weather delays and turbulence encounters that is not well-addressed by current turbulence forecasts. The data fusion algorithm is trained using a retrospective dataset that includes objective turbulence reports from commercial aircraft and collocated predictor data. It is evaluated on an independent test set using several performance metrics including receiver operating characteristic curves, which are used for FAA turbulence product evaluations prior to their deployment. A?prototype implementation fuses data from Doppler radar, geostationary satellites, a lightning detection network and a numerical weather prediction model to produce deterministic and probabilistic turbulence assessments suitable for use by air traffic managers, dispatchers and pilots. The algorithm is scheduled to be operationally implemented at the National Weather Service's Aviation Weather Center in 2014. 	Mach_Learn	D016428
27105157	20160423	A loss-of-function variant in OSBPL1A predisposes to low plasma HDL cholesterol levels and impaired cholesterol efflux capacity.	Among subjects with high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) below the 1st percentile in the general population, we identified a heterozygous variant OSBPL1A p.C39X encoding a short truncated protein fragment that co-segregated with low plasma HDL-C. We investigated the composition and function of HDL from the carriers and non-carriers and studied the properties of the mutant protein in cultured hepatocytes. Plasma HDL-C and apolipoprotein (apo) A-I were lower in carriers versus non-carriers, whereas the other analyzed plasma components or HDL parameters did not differ. Sera of the carriers displayed a reduced capacity to act as cholesterol efflux acceptors (p?&lt;?0.01), whereas the cholesterol acceptor capacity of their isolated HDL was normal. Fibroblasts from a p.C39X carrier showed reduced cholesterol efflux to lipid-free apoA-I but not to mature HDL particles, suggesting a specific defect in ABCA1-mediated efflux pathway. In hepatic cells, GFP-OSBPL1A partially co-localized in endosomes containing fluorescent apoA-I, suggesting that OSBPL1A may regulate the intracellular handling of apoA-I. The GFP-OSBPL1A-39X mutant protein remained in the cytosol and failed to interact with Rab7, which normally recruits OSBPL1A to late endosomes/lysosomes, suggesting that this mutation represents a loss-of-function. The present work represents the first characterization of a human OSBPL1A mutation. Our observations provide evidence that a familial loss-of-function mutation in OSBPL1A affects the first step of the reverse cholesterol transport process and associates with a low HDL-C phenotype. This suggests that rare mutations in OSBPL genes may contribute to dyslipidemias. 	Atherosclerosis	D016428
16641899	20060428	Genetic instability in lung cancer: concurrent analysis of chromosomal, mini- and microsatellite instability and loss of heterozygosity.	To investigate what kind of genetic instability plays important roles in lung carcinogenesis, we analyzed micro- and minisatellite instability, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and chromosome instability in 55 cases of lung cancer, including, 10 squamous cell, 5 large cell, and 3 small cell carcinomas, and 37 adenocarcinomas. Analysis of minisatellite instability, the mechanism of which is different from microsatellite instability, has not been reported previously. Minisatellite instability was detected in only one case (1/55, 1.8%), and the frequency of microsatellite instability was low, being found only in three cases (3/55, 5.5%). In contrast, LOH, for at least in one locus, was observed in 27 cases (49.1%). In adenocarcinomas, the frequency of LOH was higher in poorly differentiated compared to more differentiated carcinomas. For chromosome instability, a similar correlation between differentiation grade and instability was observed in adenocarcinomas. And instability was more common in large cell and small cell carcinomas than in adenocarcinomas. Our analysis showed that chromosome instability and LOH, rather than mini- and microsatellite instability, play significant roles in the development of lung cancer.

26828826	20160202	Pluripotency markers are differentially induced by MEK inhibition in thyroid and melanoma BRAFV600E cell lines.	Oncogenic mutations in BRAF are common in melanoma and thyroid carcinoma and drive constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. Molecularly targeted therapies of this pathway improves survival compared to chemotherapy; however, responses tend to be short-lived as resistance invariably occursCell line models of melanoma and thyroid carcinoma, +/- BRAF(V600E) activating mutation, were treated with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901. Treated and naive samples were assayed for expression of key members of the MAPK pathway. Global microRNA expression profiling of naive and resistant cells was performed via next generation sequencingand indicated pluripotency pathways in resistance. Parental cell lines were progressed to holoclones to confirm the miRNA stemness profileMembers of the MIR302/373/374/520 family of embryonic stem cell specific cell cycle regulating (ESCC) microRNAs were identified as differentially expressed between resistant BRAF(V600E) melanoma and thyroid cell lines. Upregulated expression of gene and protein stemness markers, upregulated expression of MAPK pathway genes and downregulation of the ESCC MIR302 cluster in BRAF(V600E) melanoma indicated an increased stem-like phenotype in resistant BRAF(V600E) melanoma. Conversely, downregulated expression of gene and protein stemness markers, downregulated expression of MAPK pathway genes, upregulation of the ESCC MIR520 cluster, reeexpression of cell surface receptors, and induced differentiation-associated morphology in resistant BRAF(V600E) indicate a differentiated phenotype associated with MEK inhibitor resistance in BRAF(V600E) thyroid cellsThe differential patterns of resistance observed between BRAF(V600E) melanoma and thyroid cell lines may reflect tissue type or de novo differentiation, but could have significant impact on the response of primary and metastatic cells to MEK inhibitor treatment. This study provides a basis for the investigation of the cellular differentiation/self-renewal access and its role in resistance to MEK inhibition. 	Cancer_Biol._Ther.	D016428 D013485
17194844	20061230	Amino acid substitutions in GyrA of Burkholderia glumae are implicated in not only oxolinic acid resistance but also fitness on rice plants.	Oxolinic acid (OA) resistance in field isolates of Burkholderia glumae, a causal agent of bacterial grain rot, is dependent on an amino acid substitution at position 83 in GyrA (GyrA83). In the present study, among spontaneous in vitro mutants from the OA-sensitive B. glumae strain Pg-10, we selected OA-resistant mutants that emerged at a rate of 5.7 x 10(-10). Nucleotide sequence analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining region in GyrA showed that Gly81Cys, Gly81Asp, Asp82Gly, Ser83Arg, Asp87Gly, and Asp87Asn are observed in these OA-resistant mutants. The introduction of each amino acid substitution into Pg-10 resulted in OA resistance, similar to what was observed for mutants with the responsible amino acid substitution. In vitro growth of recombinants with Asp82Gly was delayed significantly compared to that of Pg-10; however, that of the other recombinants did not differ significantly. The inoculation of each recombinant into rice spikelets did not result in disease. In inoculated rice spikelets, recombinants with Ser83Arg grew less than Pg-10 during flowering, and growth of the other recombinants was reduced significantly. On the other hand, the reduced growth of recombinants with Ser83Arg in spikelets was compensated for under OA treatment, resulting in disease. These results suggest that amino acid substitutions in GyrA of B. glumae are implicated in not only OA resistance but also fitness on rice plants. Therefore, GyrA83 substitution is thought to be responsible for OA resistance in B. glumae field isolates. 	Appl._Environ._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485
11521835	20010828	Class III metallothioneins in response to cadmium toxicity in the marine microalga Tetraselmis suecica (Kylin) Butch.	Microalgae are one of the most important organisms in our ecosystems being seriously affected by metal pollution. However, the microalgae Tetraselmis suecica (Kylin) Butch is tolerant to cadmium; the concentration of this metal that reduces the population growth to 50% of the control growth level is 5.8 mg/L after 96 h of exposure. In this study, class III metallothioneins were investigated for their involvement as a possible tolerance mechanism in this microalga when exposed to cadmium. A set of these molecules was purified from these microalgal cells after exposure to the metal. These polypeptides were analyzed by capillary zone electrophoresis, which is a technique that allows the length of the metallothioneins synthesized by this microalga to be known. The T. suecica cells were able to synthesize class III metallothioneins of three to six subunits of (gamma-Glu-Cys). The most abundant polypeptide possessed four subunits, and (gamma-Glu-Cys)6-Gly was the largest polypeptide synthesized by this microalga and detected by this technique. Tolerance to cadmium as a function of increasing polypeptide length is also discussed. 	Environ._Toxicol._Chem.	D016428
12076080	20020622	Inhibitory effects of salmosin, a disintegrin, on posterior capsular opacification in vitro and in vivo.	The proliferation, migration and transdifferentiation of the remaining lens epithelial cells (LECs) after cataract surgery are a major cause of posterior capsular opacification (PCO). It has previously been reported that salmosin, a novel disintegrin, significantly inhibits solid tumor growth in mice by perturbation of tumor-specific angiogenesis via blocking alpha v beta 3 integrin expressed on vascular endothelial cells. In this study, the inhibitory function of salmosin in PCO was investigated and was found that salmosin inhibits the attachment of bovine LECs and rabbit lens cells (N/N1003A) to extracellular matrix-coated plates. The anti-adhesive activity of salmosin was approximately 1000 times higher than that of synthetic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide. In addition, the cell proliferation and migration of bovine LECs and N/N1003A were strongly inhibited by salmosin, whereas the proliferation of corneal endothelial cells was less affected. LEC migration and proliferation were also decreased by salmosin treatment in rabbit eyes without any toxic effect in the cornea, iris and retina. In this study, salmosin was shown to specifically inhibit LEC migration and proliferation in an animal model. Therefore, the authors suggest that further investigation may show salmosin to be a good candidate for inhibiting PCO development. 	Exp._Eye_Res.	D016428 D013485

28101201	20170120	Diosmetin inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis by regulating autophagy via the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells.	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is a type of malignant tumor, is the fifth most common cancer in men and ninth in women worldwide. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antitumor effect of diosmetin (DIOS) in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. The proliferation, apoptosis and autophagy rates of HepG2 cells were measured following treatment with DIOS. The effects of DIOS treatment on HepG2 cell proliferation and apoptosis rates were analyzed using MTT assays and Annexin V staining, respectively. The effect of DIOS treatment on autophagy levels was assessed using transmission electron microscopy, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain (LC3) transfection and LysoTracker Red staining. Furthermore, bafilomycin A1 (BA1), an autophagy inhibitor, was used to assess the association between DIOS and cell autophagy, proliferation and apoptosis. In addition, the expression of autophagy-related proteins [mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, P70S6K, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase and Akt] and apoptosis-related proteins [B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2-associated X protein, Bak, p53, Bcl-2 and caspase-3] were analyzed by western blotting. The results revealed that DIOS significantly inhibited proliferation (P&lt;0.01) and induced apoptosis (P&lt;0.001) in HepG2 cells. It was also demonstrated that DIOS triggered autophagy by regulating the mTOR pathway in HepG2 cells. Notably, following treatment of HepG2 cells with the autophagy inhibitor, BA1, the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, including Bax, Bak and p53, were significantly decreased (P&lt;0.05), and cell viability was recovered to a certain extent. In conclusion, DIOS inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in HepG2 cells via regulation of the mTOR pathway. Thus, the results of the current study indicate that DIOS may present a potential therapeutic agent for HCC treatment. 	Oncol_Lett	D016428
23052617	20121012	Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 gene polymorphism in Iranian Azeri Turkish patients with FMF disease and its association with amyloidosis.	Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by intermittent episodes of fever with serositis, arthritis, or eriseplemya. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) is a key element in the inhibition of fibrinolysis by inactivating tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activators. We evaluated the association of PAI-1 -675 4G/5G polymorphism with the severity of FMF disease. For this purpose, 89 FMF patients with M694V homozygous mutation and 95 healthy controls from Iranian Azeri Turks were selected. Detection of this polymorphism was performed by polymerase chain reaction using allele-specific primers. No significant association was found between patients and control group. However, these data showed that FMF patients with M694V homozygous mutation carrying 4G/4G genotype have a reduced risk for development of pleuritis (odds ratios (OR) 0.36; 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 0.5-0.85; P value?=?0.007) compared with 5G/5G homozygotes who have increased risk for development of amyloidosis (OR?=?2.46; 95 %CI?=?1.29-4.72; P value?=?0.001), pleuritis (OR?=?2.55; 95 %CI?=?1.31-4.99; P value?=?0.001), and fever (OR?=?4.68; 95 %CI?=?2.04-10.96; P value?=?0.000). Furthermore, the allelic frequency of the 4G among the patients with pleuritis was significantly low (OR?=?0.5, 95 % CI?=?0.27-0.92, P value?=?0.008). Our data suggest a protective role for the 4G allele against pleuritis in FMF patients with M694V homozygous mutation in this cohort. More evaluation of this polymorphism may be important and require further studies. 	Eur._J._Pediatr.	D016428 D013485
22347512	20120221	Virus identification in unknown tropical febrile illness cases using deep sequencing.	Dengue virus is an emerging infectious agent that infects an estimated 50-100 million people annually worldwide, yet current diagnostic practices cannot detect an etiologic pathogen in ?40% of dengue-like illnesses. Metagenomic approaches to pathogen detection, such as viral microarrays and deep sequencing, are promising tools to address emerging and non-diagnosable disease challenges. In this study, we used the Virochip microarray and deep sequencing to characterize the spectrum of viruses present in human sera from 123 Nicaraguan patients presenting with dengue-like symptoms but testing negative for dengue virus. We utilized a barcoding strategy to simultaneously deep sequence multiple serum specimens, generating on average over 1 million reads per sample. We then implemented a stepwise bioinformatic filtering pipeline to remove the majority of human and low-quality sequences to improve the speed and accuracy of subsequent unbiased database searches. By deep sequencing, we were able to detect virus sequence in 37% (45/123) of previously negative cases. These included 13 cases with Human Herpesvirus 6 sequences. Other samples contained sequences with similarity to sequences from viruses in the Herpesviridae, Flaviviridae, Circoviridae, Anelloviridae, Asfarviridae, and Parvoviridae families. In some cases, the putative viral sequences were virtually identical to known viruses, and in others they diverged, suggesting that they may derive from novel viruses. These results demonstrate the utility of unbiased metagenomic approaches in the detection of known and divergent viruses in the study of tropical febrile illness.

19860923	20091029	Comparative functional analysis of Jembrana disease virus Tat protein on lentivirus long terminal repeat promoters: evidence for flexibility at its N-terminus.	Jembrana disease virus (JDV) encodes a potent regulatory protein Tat that strongly stimulates viral expression by transactivating the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. JDV Tat (jTat) promotes the transcription from its own LTR as well as non-cognate LTRs, by recruiting host transcription factors and facilitating transcriptional elongation. Here, we compared the sequence requirements of jTat for transactivation of JDV, bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) LTRs. In this study, we identified the minimal protein sequence for LTR activation using jTat truncation mutants. We found that jTat N-terminal residues were indispensable for transactivating the HIV LTR. In contrast, transactivation of BIV and JDV LTRs depended largely on an arginine-rich motif and some flanking residues. Competitive inhibition assay and knockdown analysis showed that P-TEFb was required for jTat-mediated LTR transactivation, and a mammalian two-hybrid assay revealed the robust interaction of jTat with cyclin T1. In addition, HIV LTR transactivation was largely affected by fusion protein at the jTat N-terminus despite the fact that the cyclin T1-binding affinity was not altered. Furthermore, the jTat N-terminal sequence enabled HIV Tat to transactivate BIV and JDV LTRs, suggesting the flexibility at the jTat N-terminus. This study showed the distinct sequence requirements of jTat for HIV, BIV and JDV LTR activation. Residues responsible for interaction with cyclin T1 and transactivation response element are the key determinants for transactivation of its cognate LTR. N-terminal residues in jTat may compensate for transactivation of the HIV LTR, based on the flexibility. 	Virol._J.	D003160 D016428 D013485
27341162	20160625	Systematic profiling of chemotherapeutic drug response to EGFR gatekeeper mutation in non-small cell lung cancer.	The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted therapy has been established as a routine strategy for treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the gatekeeper mutation T790M in EGFR active site can confer generic resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), largely limiting the clinical applications of chemotherapeutic drugs in NSCLC. Here, a combined method of computational analysis and growth inhibition assay was described to systematically investigate the molecular response profile of wild-type-sparing and mutant-resistant inhibitors to the EGFR T790M mutation. The profile is highly consistent with previous clinical observations; three first-line chemotherapeutic drugs Gefitinib, Erlotinib and Lapatinib are established with acquired resistance upon the mutation. In addition, it was found that the alkaloid compound K252a, a Staurosporine analog isolated from Nocardiopisis sp., can selectively target the EGFR T790M mutant over wild-type kinase (23-fold selectivity), suggesting that the compound is good lead candidate for development of T790M mutant-selective inhibitors. Structural analysis revealed that the mutation-resulting Met790 residue does not induce steric hindrance to the EGFR T790M-K252a complex system, while a number of hydrophobic forces, van der Waals contacts and S?? interactions are observed between the aromatic rings of K252a and the sulfhydryl group of Met790, contributing considerable stabilization energy to the system.

18561251	20080619	Enantiomer self-disproportionation of chiral compounds on achiral ordered mesoporous silica M41S and regular silica gel as a stationary phase.	Chromatographic behavior of nonracemic mixtures, viz., mandelic acid and stilbene oxide as analytes has been studied in detailed by enantiomer self-disproportionation on achiral ordered mesoporous material M41S and regular silica gel as stationary phases. Enantiomer self-disproportionation gave enhanced separation of analytes. The extent and magnitude of enantiomer self-disproportionation is dependent on the optical purity of the starting non-racemic molecules, presence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding/pi-pi interactions and the nature of eluents used. The present study and previous literature data suggest that percentage ee of a nonracemic mixture needs to be determined before any chromatographic purification is taken up as enantiomer self-disproportionation phenomenon could occur during purification. The data show that enantiomer self-disproportionation of nonracemic mixtures can be harnessed for its enantioenrichment on inexpensive achiral stationary phases. 	Chirality	D016428 D013485
26731990	20160107	Association of APPL1 Gene Polymorphism with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Susceptibility in a Chinese Han Population.	The adaptor protein, phosphotyrosine interaction, PH domain and leucine zipper containing 1 (APPL1) has been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this article is to explore the relationship between APPL1 rs4640525 polymorphism and the susceptibility of NAFLD in a Chinese Han population. In this study, rs4640525, a significant single nucleotide polymorphism, in the APPL1 gene was detected by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method, followed by extracting genomic DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes from patients with NAFLD (n = 280) and matched controls (n = 281). The frequency of both the GG genotype and the G carrier (CG+GG) genotype were higher in NAFLD subjects compared with control subjects (all p &lt; 0.05). The G allele frequency was 0.3036 in the NAFLD group and 0.2206 in the control group, showing a significant difference (p &lt; 0.05). What is more, multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested that the GG genotype, G carrier genotype, body mass index, waist circumference, white blood cells, total cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, and ?-glutamyl-transferase might be associated with an increased susceptibility of NAFLD (all p &lt; 0.05). The article provides evidence that GG genotype and G carrier (CG+GG) genotypes of the rs4640525 polymorphism in the APPL1 gene may be suitable susceptibility biomarkers for NAFLD. 	Clin._Lab.

26747427	20160110	Comparison of biological activities of human antithrombins with high-mannose or complex-type nonfucosylated N-linked oligosaccharides.	The structure of the N-linked oligosaccharides attached to antithrombin (AT) has been shown to affect its anticoagulant activity and pharmacokinetics. Human AT has biantennary complex-type oligosaccharides with the unique feature of lacking a core fucose, which affects its biological activities by changing its heparin-binding affinity. In human plasma, AT circulates as a mixture of the ?-form bearing four oligosaccharides and the ?-form lacking an oligosaccharide at Asn135. However, it remains unclear how the immature high-mannose-type oligosaccharides produced by mammalian cells affect biological activities of AT. Here, we succeeded in directly comparing the activities between the high-mannose and complex types. Interestingly, although there were no substantial differences in thrombin inhibitory activity, the high-mannose type showed higher heparin-binding affinity. The anticoagulant activities were increased by heparin and correlated with the heparin-binding affinity, resulting in the strongest anticoagulant activity being displayed in the ?-form with the high-mannose type. In pharmacokinetic profiling, the high-mannose type showed a much shorter plasma half-life than the complex type. The ?-form was found to have a prolonged plasma half-life compared with the ?-form for the high-mannose type; conversely, the ?-form showed a longer half-life than the ?-form for the complex-type. The present study highlights that AT physiological activities are strictly controlled not only by a core fucose at the reducing end but also by the high-mannose-type structures at the nonreducing end. The ?-form with the immature high-mannose type appears to function as a more potent anticoagulant than the AT typically found in human plasma, once it emerges in the blood.

10573434	19991126	Estimating the true extent of cognitive decline in the old old.	To measure cognitive change using a brief measure over a period of 9 years and to adjust for attrition in the sample. The Cambridge City over 75 Cohort (CC75C), a complete sample of the 75 years and older age group from five group general practices in the city of Cambridge with a systematic one-third of a further practice, all followed on four occasions. Cambridge city, UK, the respondents' place of residence. A total of 2106 subjects were included at study entry. A brief interview, administered by a trained interviewer, containing a short cognitive scale and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at baseline, 2.4 years, 6 years, and 9 years. Decline in MMSE scores occurred across the population and was greater in the oldest age groups. Attrition at later stages of the follow-up was associated with greater decline at earlier stages. Adjusting the results for loss to the sample leads to considerably higher estimates of decline, with the older age groups declining faster from lower levels. To date, cognitive decline in the very old has been considerably underestimated by longitudinal studies. If studies of population samples are to reflect the health and social needs of this frail group accurately, adjustments for the effect of attrition must be included before true decline can be estimated.

11905990	20020322	Neurotoxic mechanisms triggered by Alzheimer's disease-linked mutant M146L presenilin 1: involvement of NO synthase via a novel pertussis toxin target.	While it has been reported that familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD)-linked mutants of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin (PS)2 induce neuronal cytotoxicity in a manner sensitive to antioxidant and pertussis toxin (PTX), little of the mechanism for PS1-mediated neuronal cell death has been characterized. We previously found that multiple mechanisms, different in detail, underlie cytotoxicities by two FAD-linked mutants of APP, using neuronal cells with an ecdysone-controlled expression system. Here we report that this system revealed that (i) low expression of FAD-linked M146L-PS1 caused neuronal cell death, whereas that of wild-type (wt)PS1 did not; (ii) mutation-specific cytotoxicity by M146L-PS1 was sensitive to antioxidant glutathione-ethyl-ester and resistant to Ac-DEVD-CHO; (iii) cytotoxicity by higher expression of wtPS1 was resistant to both; and (iv) cytotoxicity by M146L-PS1 was inhibited by PTX. It was also highly likely that the involved superoxide-generating enzyme was nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and that the PTX-sensitive cytotoxic signal by M146L-PS1 was mediated by none of the G(i/o) proteins. We conclude that M146L-PS1 activates a NOS-mediated cytotoxic pathway via a novel PTX target. 	J._Neurochem.	D016428 D013485
16237278	20051021	Anaphase promoting complex or cyclosome?	The anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) was initially described as a multi-subunit protein complex that ubiquitinates anaphase inhibitors thus targeting them for destruction by proteasomes to initiate loss of sister chromatid cohesion. However, recent studies have identified important new functions of the APC/C. Moreover, sister centromere separation can occur in the absence of APC/C activity in mammals, indicating that anaphase onset might be triggered by multiple factors. Here we discuss whether the APC/C functions primarily as the anaphase trigger, or whether it has more general properties, relevant for cell cycle control at multiple developmental and cell cycle stages. Additionally, we discuss the validity of the APC-dependent model for sister segregation in mammals. 	Cell_Cycle	D016428 D052061 D013485 D016454 D023361
24297320	20131204	Novel EXT1 mutation identified in a pedigree with hereditary multiple exostoses.	Hereditary multiple exostoses (HME) is an autosomal dominant bone disorder characterized by the presence of multiple benign cartilage-capped tumors. EXT1 located on chromosome 8q23-q24 and EXT2 located on 11p11-p12 are the main disease-causing genes which are responsible for ~90% of HME cases. Mutations of EXT1 or EXT2 result in insufficient heparan sulfate biosynthesis, which facilitates chondrocyte proliferation, boosts abnormal bone growth of neighboring regions, causes multiple exostoses, and ultimately leads to possible malignant transformation. A family who displayed typical features of HME was enrolled in the present study. Mutation screening by Sanger sequencing identified a novel heterozygous nonsense mutation c.1902C&gt;A (p.Tyr634X) in the EXT1 gene exclusively in all 3 patients, which is located in the glycosyltransferase domain and results in the truncation of 112 amino acids at the C-terminus of the EXT1 protein. Thus, the present study identified a novel disease-causing EXT1 mutation in a pedigree with HME, which provides additional evidence for developing quick and accurate genetic tools for HME diagnosis.

22831168	20120727	Genotyping and surveillance for scrapie in Finnish sheep.	The progression of scrapie is known to be influenced by the amino acid polymorphisms of the host prion protein (PrP) gene. There is no breeding programme for TSE resistance in sheep in Finland, but a scrapie control programme has been in place since 1995. In this study we have analysed PrP genotypes of total of 928 purebred and crossbred sheep together with the data of scrapie survey carried out in Finland during 2002-2008 in order to gain knowledge of the genotype distribution and scrapie prevalence in Finnish sheep. The ARQ/ARQ genotype was the most common genotype in all breeds studied. ARR allele frequency was less than 12% in purebred Finnish sheep and in most genotypes heterozygous for ARR, the second allele was ARQ. The VRQ allele was not detected in the Grey race sheep of Kainuu or in the Aland sheep, and it was present in less than 6% of the Finnish Landrace sheep. Leucine was the most prominent amino acid found in codon 141. In addition, one novel prion dimorphisms of Q220L was detected. During the scrapie survey of over 15 000 sheep in 2002-2008, no classical scrapie cases and only five atypical scrapie cases were detected. The results indicate that the Finnish sheep populations have genetically little resistance to classical scrapie, but no classical scrapie was detected during an extensive survey in 2002-2008. However, five atypical scrapie cases emerged; thus, the disease is present in the Finnish sheep population at a low level. 	BMC_Vet._Res.	D016428 D013485
26082635	20150618	Association analysis of the Cadherin13 gene with schizophrenia in the Japanese population.	Cadherin13 (CDH13) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell adhesion molecule that plays a crucial role in morphogenesis and the maintenance of neuronal circuitry. CDH13 has been implicated in the susceptibility to a variety of psychiatric diseases. A recent genome-wide association study using Danish samples showed, for the first time, the involvement of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of CDH13 (intronic SNP rs8057927) in schizophrenia. Here, we investigated the association between other SNPs of CDH13 and schizophrenia and tried to replicate the association for the SNP of rs8057927, in the Japanese population. Using TaqMan(?) SNP genotyping assays, five tag SNPs (rs12925602, rs7193788, rs736719, rs6565051, and rs7204454) in the promoter region of CDH13 were examined for their association with schizophrenia in two independent samples. The first sample comprised 665 patients and 760 controls, and the second sample comprised 677 patients and 667 controls. One tag SNP for rs8057927 was also examined for the association with schizophrenia in the first sample set. A GACAG haplotype of the five SNPs in the promoter region of CDH13 was significantly associated with schizophrenia in the first sample set (P=0.016 and corrected P=0.098). A combined analysis of the GACAG haplotype with the second sample set enhanced the significance (P=0.0026 and corrected P=0.021). We found no association between rs8057927 and schizophrenia in the first sample set. Our results suggest that CDH13 may contribute to the genetic risk of schizophrenia. Further replication on the association of CDH13 with schizophrenia and functional studies are required to confirm the current findings. 	Neuropsychiatr_Dis_Treat	D016428
11339816	20010508	Importance of amino acid residue 474 for substrate specificity of canine and human cytochrome p450 3A enzymes.	Canine cytochromes P450 3A12 and 3A26 are identical in sequence at 481 of 503 amino-acid positions but exhibit different substrate specificities. A recent study utilizing chimeric enzymes and site-directed mutagenesis identified three residues (187, 368, and 369) that contribute to differences in steroid hydroxylation and also indicated the presence of additional determinants of specificity among the 44 carboxyl terminal residues. Therefore, three 3A26 multiple mutants (I187T-S368P-V369I-S467P, I187T-S368P-V369I-S474P, and I187T-S368P-V369I-R476K-I477L-T479A-R480Q) were constructed. Insertion of 3A12 residue Pro-474 into 3A26 I187T-S368P-V369I resulted in metabolite profiles with testosterone, androstenedione, and progesterone very similar to 3A12. Substitution of Pro-474 with Ser in P450 3A12 or human 3A4 significantly increased 2beta-hydroxylase activity with all three steroids. Residue 474 was also found to be an important contributor to diazepam metabolism by the canine and human enzymes. The results provide further evidence for the role of steric constraints exerted by the enzyme in P450 3A-mediated oxidations. 	Arch._Biochem._Biophys.	D016428 D013487

23307483	20130112	Xq27 FRAXA locus is a strong candidate for dyslexia: evidence from a genome-wide scan in French families.	Dyslexia is a frequent neurodevelopmental learning disorder. To date, nine susceptibility loci have been identified, one of them being DYX9, located in Xq27. We performed the first French SNP linkage study followed by candidate gene investigation in dyslexia by studying 12 multiplex families (58 subjects) with at least two children affected, according to categorical restrictive criteria for phenotype definition. Significant results emerged on Xq27.3 within DYX9. The maximum multipoint LOD score reached 3,884 between rs12558359 and rs454992. Within this region, seven candidate genes were investigated for mutations in exonic sequences (CXORF1, CXORF51, SLITRK2, FMR1, FMR2, ASFMR1, FMR1NB), all having a role during brain development. We further looked for 5'UTR trinucleotide repeats in FMR1 and FMR2 genes. No mutation or polymorphism co-segregating with dyslexia was found. This finding in French families with Dyslexia showed significant linkage on Xq27.3 enclosing FRAXA, and consequently confirmed the DYX9 region as a robust susceptibility locus. We reduced the previously described interval from 6.8 (DXS1227-DXS8091) to 4?Mb also disclosing a higher LOD score. 	Behav._Genet.	D016428 D013485
18958281	20081030	Orientation of the calcium channel beta relative to the alpha(1)2.2 subunit is critical for its regulation of channel activity.	The Ca(v)beta subunits of high voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels control the trafficking and biophysical properties of the alpha(1) subunit. The Ca(v)beta-alpha(1) interaction site has been mapped by crystallographic studies. Nevertheless, how this interaction leads to channel regulation has not been determined. One hypothesis is that betas regulate channel gating by modulating movements of IS6. A key requirement for this direct-coupling model is that the linker connecting IS6 to the alpha-interaction domain (AID) be a rigid structure. The present study tests this hypothesis by altering the flexibility and orientation of this region in alpha(1)2.2, then testing for Ca(v)beta regulation using whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology. Flexibility was induced by replacement of the middle six amino acids of the IS6-AID linker with glycine (PG6). This mutation abolished beta2a and beta3 subunits ability to shift the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, and the ability of beta2a to produce non-inactivating currents. Orientation of Ca(v)beta with respect to alpha(1)2.2 was altered by deletion of 1, 2, or 3 amino acids from the IS6-AID linker (Bdel1, Bdel2, Bdel3, respectively). Again, the ability of Ca(v)beta subunits to regulate these biophysical properties were totally abolished in the Bdel1 and Bdel3 mutants. Functional regulation by Ca(v)beta subunits was rescued in the Bdel2 mutant, indicating that this part of the linker forms beta-sheet. The orientation of beta with respect to alpha was confirmed by the bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. These results show that the orientation of the Ca(v)beta subunit relative to the alpha(1)2.2 subunit is critical, and suggests additional points of contact between these subunits are required for Ca(v)beta to regulate channel activity.

12654918	20030326	Serine phosphorylation negatively regulates RhoA in vivo.	Previous work indicates that RhoA phosphorylation on Ser188 by cAMP or cGMP-dependent kinases inhibits its activity. However, these studies lacked the possibility to directly study phosphorylated RhoA activity in vivo. Therefore, we created RhoA proteins containing phosphomimetic residues in place of the cAMP/cGMP-dependent kinase phosphorylation site. RhoA phosphorylation or phosphomimetic substitution did not affect Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GTPase activating protein, or geranylgeranyl transferase activity in vitro but promoted binding to the Rho guanine-dissociation inhibitor as measured by exchange factor competition assays. The in vitro similarities between RhoA phosphomimetic proteins and phosphorylated RhoA allowed us to study function of phosphorylated RhoA in vivo. RhoA phosphomimetic proteins display depressed GTP loading when transiently expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. Stable-expressing RhoA and RhoA(S188A) clones spread significantly slower than mock-transfected or RhoA(S188E) clones. RhoA(S188A) clones were protected from the morphological effects of a cAMP agonist, whereas phosphomimetic clones exhibit stress fiber disassembly similar to control cells. Together, these data provide in vivo evidence that addition of a charged group to Ser188 upon phosphorylation negatively regulates RhoA activity and indicates that this occurs through enhanced Rho guanine-dissociation inhibitor interaction rather than direct perturbation of guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GTPase activating protein, or geranylgeranyl transferase activity.

24896116	20140605	Pore dynamics and conductance of RyR1 transmembrane domain.	Ryanodine receptors (RyR) are calcium release channels, playing a major role in the regulation of muscular contraction. Mutations in skeletal muscle RyR (RyR1) are associated with congenital diseases such as malignant hyperthermia and central core disease (CCD). The absence of high-resolution structures of RyR1 has limited our understanding of channel function and disease mechanisms at the molecular level. Previously, we have reported a hypothetical structure of the RyR1 pore-forming region, obtained by homology modeling and supported by mutational scans, electrophysiological measurements, and cryo-electron microscopy. Here, we utilize the expanded model encompassing six transmembrane helices to calculate the RyR1 pore region conductance, to analyze its structural stability, and to hypothesize the mechanism of the Ile4897 CCD-associated mutation. The calculated conductance of the wild-type RyR1 suggests that the proposed pore structure can sustain ion currents measured in single-channel experiments. We observe a stable pore structure on timescales of 0.2 ?s, with multiple cations occupying the selectivity filter and cytosolic vestibule, but not the inner chamber. We further suggest that stability of the selectivity filter critically depends on the interactions between the I4897 residue and several hydrophobic residues of the neighboring subunit. Loss of these interactions in the case of polar substitution I4897T results in destabilization of the selectivity filter, a possible cause of the CCD-specific reduced Ca(2+) conductance. 	Biophys._J.

22532693	20120426	Enhanced mammalian transmissibility of seasonal influenza A/H1N1 viruses encoding an oseltamivir-resistant neuraminidase.	Between 2007 and 2009, oseltamivir resistance developed among seasonal influenza A/H1N1 (sH1N1) virus isolates at an exponential rate, without a corresponding increase in oseltamivir usage. We hypothesized that the oseltamivir-resistant neuraminidase (NA), in addition to being relatively insusceptible to the antiviral effect of oseltamivir, might confer an additional fitness advantage on these viruses by enhancing their transmission efficiency among humans. Here we demonstrate that an oseltamivir-resistant clinical isolate, an A/Brisbane/59/2007(H1N1)-like virus isolated in New York State in 2008, transmits more efficiently among guinea pigs than does a highly similar, contemporaneous oseltamivir-sensitive isolate. With reverse genetics reassortants and point mutants of the two clinical isolates, we further show that expression of the oseltamivir-resistant NA in the context of viral proteins from the oseltamivir-sensitive virus (a 7:1 reassortant) is sufficient to enhance transmissibility. In the guinea pig model, the NA is the critical determinant of transmission efficiency between oseltamivir-sensitive and -resistant Brisbane/59-like sH1N1 viruses, independent of concurrent drift mutations that occurred in other gene products. Our data suggest that the oseltamivir-resistant NA (specifically, one or both of the companion mutations, H275Y and D354G) may have allowed resistant Brisbane/59-like viruses to outtransmit sensitive isolates. These data provide in vivo evidence of an evolutionary mechanism that would explain the rapidity with which oseltamivir resistance achieved fixation among sH1N1 isolates in the human reservoir.

26405221	20150926	Exome Sequence Data From Multigenerational Families Implicate AMPA Receptor Trafficking in Neurocognitive Impairment and Schizophrenia Risk.	Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by impairments in behavior, thought, and neurocognitive performance. We searched for susceptibility loci at a quantitative trait locus (QTL) previously reported for abstraction and mental flexibility (ABF), a cognitive function often compromised in schizophrenia patients and their unaffected relatives. Exome sequences were determined for 134 samples in 8 European American families from the original linkage study, including 25 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. At chromosome 5q32-35.3, we analyzed 407 protein-altering variants for association with ABF and schizophrenia status. For replication, significant, Bonferroni-corrected findings were tested against cognitive traits in Mexican American families (n = 959), as well as interrogated for schizophrenia risk using GWAS results from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC). From the gene SYNPO, rs6579797 (MAF = 0.032) shows significant associations with ABF (P = .015) and schizophrenia (P = .040), as well as jointly (P = .0027). In the Mexican American pedigrees, rs6579797 exhibits significant associations with IQ (P = .011), indicating more global effects on neurocognition. From the PGC results, other SYNPO variants were identified with near significant effects on schizophrenia risk, with a local linkage disequilibrium block displaying signatures of positive selection. A second missense variant within the QTL, rs17551608 (MAF = 0.19) in the gene WWC1, also displays a significant effect on schizophrenia in our exome sequences (P = .038). Remarkably, the protein products of SYNPO and WWC1 are interaction partners involved in AMPA receptor trafficking, a brain process implicated in synaptic plasticity. Our study reveals variants in these genes with significant effects on neurocognition and schizophrenia risk, identifying a potential pathogenic mechanism for schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

11722598	20011128	Periodic fever (TRAPS) caused by mutations in the TNFalpha receptor 1 (TNFRSF1A) gene of three German patients.	TNF-receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) is a recently recognized disorder characterized by prolonged attacks of high fever and severe localized inflammation. TRAPS is caused by dominant mutations in the 55 kDa TNF receptor gene (TNFRSF1A). We here describe three German TRAPS patients of two families with Cys30--&gt;Arg and Thr50--&gt;Met mutations, respectively. Both mutations have already been observed before in other nonrelated families. The Thr50--&gt;Met amino acid exchange, caused by an ACG--&gt;ATG transition, has been reported in two other families of different ethnic background. The possibility that the ACG--&gt;ATG sequence alteration is a mutational hot spot causing TRAPS is discussed. Furthermore, we describe and discuss the symptoms of our patients, possible inducers of febrile attacks, and treatments which the patients had received when their diagnoses were still unknown.

25496513	20141216	Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 R132C mutation occurs exclusively in microsatellite stable colorectal cancers with the CpG island methylator phenotype.	The CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) is fundamental to an important subset of colorectal cancer; however, its cause is unknown. CIMP is associated with microsatellite instability but is also found in BRAF mutant microsatellite stable cancers that are associated with poor prognosis. The isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene causes CIMP in glioma due to an activating mutation that produces the 2-hydroxyglutarate oncometabolite. We therefore examined IDH1 alteration as a potential cause of CIMP in colorectal cancer. The IDH1 mutational hotspot was screened in 86 CIMP-positive and 80 CIMP-negative cancers. The entire coding sequence was examined in 81 CIMP-positive colorectal cancers. Forty-seven cancers varying by CIMP-status and IDH1 mutation status were examined using Illumina 450K DNA methylation microarrays. The R132C IDH1 mutation was detected in 4/166 cancers. All IDH1 mutations were in CIMP cancers that were BRAF mutant and microsatellite stable (4/45, 8.9%). Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis identified an IDH1 mutation-like methylation signature in approximately half of the CIMP-positive cancers. IDH1 mutation appears to cause CIMP in a small proportion of BRAF mutant, microsatellite stable colorectal cancers. This study provides a precedent that a single gene mutation may cause CIMP in colorectal cancer, and that this will be associated with a specific epigenetic signature and clinicopathological features.

22329490	20120215	Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI in a Miniature Poodle-type dog caused by a deletion in the arylsulphatase B gene.	To investigate and characterise an inborn error of metabolism in a dog with skeletal and ocular abnormalities. A 2.5-year-old small male Miniature Poodle-like dog was presented with gross joint laxity and bilateral corneal opacities. Clinical examination was augmented by routine haematology, serum chemistry, radiographs, pathology, enzymology and molecular genetic studies. Euthanasia was requested when the dog was 3 years of age because of progressively decreasing quality of life. Radiology revealed generalised epiphyseal dysplasia, malformed vertebral bodies, luxation/subluxation of appendicular and lumbosacral joints with hypoplasia of the odontoid process and hyoid apparatus. These clinical and radiographic findings, together with a positive urinary Berry spot test for mucopolysaccharides, and metachromatic granules in leucocytes, were indicative of a mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), a lysosomal storage disease. Histological lesions included vacuolation of stromal cells of the cornea, fibroblasts, chondrocytes, macrophages and renal cells. The brain was essentially normal except for moderate secondary Wallerian-type degeneration in motor and sensory tracts of the hind brain. Dermatan sulphate-uria was present and enzymology revealed negligible activity of N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulphatase, also known as arylsulphatase B, in cultured fibroblasts and liver tissue. A novel homozygous 22 base pair (bp) deletion in exon 1 of this enzyme's gene was identified (c.103_124del), which caused aframe-shift and subsequent premature stop codon. The &quot;Wisdom pure breed-mixed breed&quot; test reported the dog as a cross between a Miniature and Toy Poodle. The clinicopathological features are similar to those of MPS type VI as previously described in dogs, cats and other species, and this clinical diagnosis was confirmed by enzymology and molecular genetic studies. This is an autosomal recessively inherited lysosomal storage disease. The prevalence of MPS VI in Miniature or Toy Poodles in New Zealand and elsewhere is currently unknown. Due to the congenital nature of the disorder, malformed pups may be subject to euthanasia without investigation and the potential genetic problem in the breed may not be fully recognised. The establishment of a molecular genetic test now permits screening for this mutation as a basis to an informed breeding policy. 	N_Z_Vet_J	D002363 D016428 D052061
18769672	20080905	Chronic cigarette smoke causes oxidative damage and apoptosis to retinal pigmented epithelial cells in mice.	The purpose of this study was to determine whether mice exposed to chronic cigarette smoke develop features of early age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Two month old C57Bl6 mice were exposed to either filtered air or cigarette smoke in a smoking chamber for 5 h/day, 5 days/week for 6 months. Eyes were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/2% paraformaldehyde and examined for ultrastructural changes by transmission electron microscopy. The contralateral eye was fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and examined for oxidative injury to the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) by 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) immunolabeling and apoptosis by TUNEL labeling. Mice exposed to cigarette smoke had immunolabeling for 8-OHdG in 85+/-3.7% of RPE cells counted compared to 9.5+/-3.9% in controls (p&lt;0.00001). Bruch membrane was thicker in mice exposed to smoke (1086+/-332 nm) than those raised in air (543+/-132 nm; p = 0.0069). The two most pronounced ultrastructural changes (severity grading scale from 0-3) seen were a loss of basal infoldings (mean difference in grade = 1.98; p&lt;0.0001), and an increase in intracellular vacuoles (mean difference in grade = 1.7; p&lt;0.0001). Ultrastructural changes to Bruch membrane in cigarette-smoke exposed mice were smaller in magnitude but consistently demonstrated significantly higher grade injury in cigarette-exposed mice, including basal laminar deposits (mean difference in grade = 0.54; p&lt;0.0001), increased outer collagenous layer deposits (mean difference in grade = 0.59; p = 0.002), and increased basal laminar deposit continuity (mean difference in grade = 0.4; p&lt;0.0001). TUNEL assay showed a higher percentage of apoptotic RPE from mice exposed to cigarette smoke (average 8.0+/-1.1%) than room air (average 0+/-0%; p = 0.043). Mice exposed to chronic cigarette smoke develop evidence of oxidative damage with ultrastructural degeneration to the RPE and Bruch membrane, and RPE cell apoptosis. This model could be useful for studying the mechanism of smoke induced changes during early AMD. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061 D013485
25534848	20141224	A complement C5 gene mutation, c.754G&gt;A:p.A252T, is common in the Western Cape, South Africa and found to be homozygous in seven percent of Black African meningococcal disease cases.	Patients with genetically determined deficiency of complement component 5 are usually diagnosed because of recurrent invasive Neisseria meningitidis infections. Approximately 40 individual cases have been diagnosed worldwide. Nevertheless, reports of the responsible genetic defects have been sporadic, and we know of no previous reports of C5 deficiency being associated with a number of independent meningococcal disease cases in particular communities. Here we describe C5 deficiency in seven unrelated Western Cape, South African families. Three different C5 mutations c.55C&gt;T:p.Q19X, c.754G&gt;A:p.A252T and c.4426C&gt;T:p.R1476X were diagnosed in index cases from two families who had both presented with recurrent meningococcal disease. p.Q19X and p.R1476X have already been described in North American Black families and more recently p.Q19X in a Saudi family. However, p.A252T was only reported in SNP databases and was not associated with disease until the present study was undertaken in the Western Cape, South Africa. We tested for p.A252T in 140 patients presenting with meningococcal disease in the Cape Town area, and found seven individuals in five families who were homozygous for the mutation p.A252T. Very low serum C5 protein levels (0.1-4%) and correspondingly low in vitro functional activity were found in all homozygous individuals. Allele frequencies of p.A252T in the Black African and Cape Coloured communities were 3% and 0.66% and estimated homozygosities are 1/1100 and 1/22,500 respectively. In 2012 we reported association between p.A252T and meningococcal disease. Molecular modelling of p.A252T has indicated an area of molecular stress in the C5 molecule which may provide a mechanism for the very low level in the circulation. This report includes seven affected families indicating that C5D is not rare in South Africa. 	Mol._Immunol.	D016428 D013485
10489161	19990917	BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation analysis: visit to the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC).	Breast cancer is a leading cancer in American women. About 7% of breast cancer is due to inheritance of mutated genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Numerous investigations have revealed a number of mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The inheritance of the mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes accounts for 45% and 35%, respectively, of hereditary breast cancers. A central database named Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) has been established in the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to coordinate the information related with BRCA1 and BRCA2 research. Nearly half of the mutations (49%) in the BRCA1 gene are frameshift mutations and the cancer-causing mutations account for 66% of all entries. However, for the BRCA2 gene frameshift mutations and cancer-causing mutations account for only 35% and 43%, respectively, of all entries. The significance of a large portion of missense sequence variants (24% of BRCA1 mutations and 47% of BRCA2 mutations) needs further evaluation. The incidence of 185delAG and 5382insC in BRCA1 gene and 6174delT in BRCA2 gene is predominantly high and the founder effect of these mutations is discussed. 	Oncol._Res.	D016428 D013487
26806099	20160126	Mycobacterium Lysine ?-aminotransferase is a novel alarmone metabolism related persister gene via dysregulating the intracellular amino acid level.	Bacterial persisters, usually slow-growing, non-replicating cells highly tolerant to antibiotics, play a crucial role contributing to the recalcitrance of chronic infections and treatment failure. Understanding the molecular mechanism of persister cells formation and maintenance would obviously inspire the discovery of new antibiotics. The significant upregulation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv3290c, a highly conserved mycobacterial lysine ?-aminotransferase (LAT) during hypoxia persistent model, suggested a role of LAT in persistence. To test this, a lat deleted Mycobacterium smegmatis was constructed. The expression of transcriptional regulator leucine-responsive regulatory protein (LrpA) and the amino acids abundance in M. smegmatis lat deletion mutants were lowered. Thus, the persistence capacity of the deletion mutant was impaired upon norfloxacin exposure under nutrient starvation. In summary, our study firstly reported the involvement of mycobacterium LAT in persister formation, and possibly through altering the intracellular amino acid metabolism balance.

9384616	19980228	Liver glycogenosis due to phosphorylase kinase deficiency: PHKG2 gene structure and mutations associated with cirrhosis.	Mutations in three different genes of phosphorylase kinase (Phk) subunits, PHKA2, PHKB and PHKG2, can give rise to glycogen storage disease of the liver. The autosomal-recessive, liver-specific variant of Phk deficiency is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the testis/liver isoform of the catalytic gamma subunit, PHKG2. To facilitate mutation detection and to improve our understanding of the molecular evolution of Phk subunit isoforms, we have determined the structure of the human PHKG2 gene. The gene extends over 9.5 kilonucleotides and is divided into 10 exons; positions of introns are highly conserved between PHKG2 and the gene of the muscle isoform of the gamma subunit, PHKG1. The beginning of intron 2 harbors a highly informative GGT/GT microsatellite repeat, the first polymorphic marker in the PHKG2 gene at human chromosome 16p11.2-p12.1. Employing the gene sequence, we have identified homozygous translation-terminating mutations, 277delC and Arg44ter, in the two published cases of liver Phk deficiency who developed cirrhosis in childhood. As liver Phk deficiency is generally a benign condition and progression to cirrhosis is very rare, this finding suggests that PHKG2 mutations are associated with an increased cirrhosis risk.

14613517	20031114	Mutational analysis of molecular requirements for the actions of general anaesthetics at the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor subtype, alpha1beta2gamma2.	Amino acids in the beta subunit contribute to the action of general anaesthetics on GABA(A) receptors. We have now characterized the phenotypic effect of two beta subunit mutations in the most abundant GABA(A) receptor subtype, alpha1beta2gamma2. The beta2(N265M) mutation in M2 decreased the modulatory actions of propofol, etomidate and enflurane, but not of alphaxalone, while the direct actions of propofol, etomidate and alphaxalone were impaired. The beta2(M286W) mutation in M3 decreased the modulatory actions of propofol, etomidate and enflurane, but not of alphaxalone, whereas the direct action of propofol and etomidate, but not of alphaxalone, was impaired. We found that the actions of general anaesthetics at alpha1beta2(N265M)gamma2 and alpha1beta2(M286W)gamma2 GABA(A) receptors are similar to those previously observed at alpha2beta3(N265M)gamma2 and alpha2beta3(M286W)gamma2 GABA(A) recpetors, respectively, with the notable exceptions that the direct action of propofol was decreased in alpha1beta2(M286W)gamma2 receptors but indistinguishable form wild type in alpha2beta3(M286W)gamma2 receptors and that the direct action of alphaxalone was decreased in alpha1beta2(N265M)gamma2 but not alpha2beta3(N265M)gamma2 receptors and indistinguishable form wild type in alpha1beta2(M286W)gamma2 receptors but increased in alpha2beta3(M286W)gamma2 receptors. Thus, selected phenotypic consequences of these two mutations are GABA(A) receptor subtype-specific. 	BMC_Pharmacol.	D016428 D013485
25132817	20140819	Inter-individual cognitive variability in children with Asperger's syndrome.	Multiple studies have tried to establish the distinctive profile of individuals with Asperger's syndrome (AS). However, recent reports suggest that adults with AS feature heterogeneous cognitive profiles. The present study explores inter-individual variability in children with AS through group comparison and multiple case series analysis. All participants completed an extended battery including measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence, executive functions, theory of mind, and classical neuropsychological tests. Significant group differences were found in theory of mind and other domains related to global information processing. However, the AS group showed high inter-individual variability (both sub- and supra-normal performance) on most cognitive tasks. Furthermore, high fluid intelligence correlated with less general cognitive impairment, high cognitive flexibility, and speed of motor processing. In light of these findings, we propose that children with AS are characterized by a distinct, uneven pattern of cognitive strengths and weaknesses. 	Front_Hum_Neurosci	D016428
25788990	20150320	Biomarkers for gastric cancer: Progression in early diagnosis and prognosis (Review).	Gastric cancer is one of leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide and is a notable disease due to its heterogeneity. Recently, numerous studies have investigated the molecular basis of gastric cancer, involving the alteration of pathogenesis, and invasion and metastasis. With the development of modern technologies, various novel biomarkers had been identified that appear to possess diagnostic and prognostic value; therefore, the present review describes our current knowledge of biomarkers for the early diagnosis and prognosis of gastric cancer. Classic biomarkers for gastric cancer diagnosis include carcinoembryonic antigen and cancer antigen 19-9, while microRNA and DNA hypomethylation are proposed as novel biomarkers. Excluding classical biomarkers, biomarkers for determining the progression and prognosis of gastric cancer focus on targeting microRNAs, epigenetic alterations and genetic polymorphisms.

24275092	20131127	Podoplanin is a substrate of presenilin-1/?-secretase.	Podoplanin (PDPN) is a mucin-like transmembrane glycoprotein that plays an important role in development and cancer. Here, we provide evidence that the intracellular domain (ICD) of podoplanin is released into the cytosol following a sequential proteolytic processing by a metalloprotease and ?-secretase. Western blotting and cell fractionation studies revealed that HEK293T and MDCK cells transfected with an eGFP-tagged podoplanin construct (PDPNeGFP, 50-63kDa) constitutively express two C-terminal fragments (CTFs): a ?33kDa membrane-bound PCTF33, and a ?29kDa cytosolic podoplanin ICD (PICD). While pharmacological inhibition of metalloproteases reduced the expression of PCTF33, treatment of cells with ?-secretase inhibitors resulted in enhanced PCTF33 levels. PCTF33 processing by ?-secretase depends on presenilin-1 (PS1) function: cells expressing a dominant negative form of PS1 (PS1 D385N), and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) genetically deficient in PS1, but not in PS2, show higher levels of PCTF33 expression with respect to wild-type MEFs. Furthermore, transfection of PS1 deficient MEFs with wild-type PS1 (PS1 wt) decreased PCTF33 levels. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the affinity purified PICD revealed that the ?-secretase cleavage site was located between valines 150 and 151, but these residues are not critical for proteolysis. We found that podoplanin CTFs are also generated in cells expressing podoplanin mutants harboring heterologous transmembrane regions. Taken together, these results indicate that podoplanin is a novel substrate for PS1/?-secretase. 	Int._J._Biochem._Cell_Biol.	D016428 D013485

26605088	20151126	Influence of Abdominal Obesity on the Lipid-Lipoprotein Profile in Apoprotein E2/4 Carriers: The Effect of an Apparent Duality.	Background. Apolipoprotein (Apo) E plays a key role in the handling of lipoprotein particles with ApoE2 and ApoE4 frequently having opposite effects compared to ApoE3. Some individuals simultaneously carry both E2 and E4 alleles. The impact of the ApoE2/4 genotype on lipid concentrations and its consequences on health remain poorly documented. Objective. This study compared the lipid profile between ApoE2/4 carriers and other ApoE genotypes in relation to the waist circumference. Methods. Cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and ApoB concentrations were measured among 2,680 Caucasians. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the contribution of ApoE2/4 to various dyslipidemic profiles associated with abdominal obesity. Results. In presence of abdominal obesity, the lipid profile was as deteriorated in ApoE2/4 carriers as in carriers of other ApoE genotypes. There was a more pronounced effect on TG-rich lipoproteins, particularly in ApoE2/2 (a feature of type III dysbetalipoproteinemia), and non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in ApoE4/4. Compared to ApoE2/2, ApoE2/4 carriers presented lower very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol concentrations and VLDL-cholesterol/TG ratios, with or without obesity, and higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations. Conclusion. In presence of abdominal obesity, the influence of the ApoE2 allele could be less pronounced than that of ApoE4 among ApoE2/4 individuals. 	J_Lipids	D016428
16170364	20050920	Activation of Rac by cadherin through the c-Src-Rap1-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Vav2 pathway.	Cadherin first forms homo-cis-dimers on the cell surface of the same cells, followed by formation of homo-trans-dimers (trans-interactions) in a Ca2+-dependent manner, eventually causing adherens junctions. In addition, trans-interacting cadherin induces activation of Rac small G protein, which stabilizes non-trans-interacting cadherin on the plasma membrane by inhibiting its endocytosis through the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. However, it has not fully been understood how cadherin induces the activation of Rac. We examined here the molecular mechanism of the activation of Rac by trans-interacting cadherin in fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Trans-interacting cadherin induced activation of c-Src locally at the cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion sites. c-Src then tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav2, one of the Rac-GDP/GTP exchange factors (GEFs), and induced activation of C3G, one of the Rap1-GEFs, through Crk adaptor protein, resulting in the activation of Rap1 locally at the cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion sites. The c-Src-catalysed tyrosine phosphorylation was not sufficient for the activation of Vav2 and the c-Src-induced activation of Rap1 was additionally necessary for it, although activated Rap1 alone was not sufficient for the activation of non-tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav2. This effect of Rap1 on Vav2 was mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. We describe here the signaling pathway from trans-interacting cadherin to the activation of Rac. 	Oncogene	D016428 D013485
10330420	19990520	DeltaF508 CFTR protein expression in tissues from patients with cystic fibrosis.	Heterologous expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) provided evidence that the major cystic fibrosis (CF) mutation DeltaF508 leads to defective protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum, which prevents its processing and targeting to the cell surface. In this study, we investigated endogenous CFTR expression in skin biopsies and respiratory and intestinal tissue specimens from DeltaF508 homozygous and non-CF patients, using immunohistochemical and immunoblot analyses with a panel of CFTR antibodies. CFTR expression was detected at the luminal surface of reabsorptive sweat ducts and airway submucosal glands, at the apex of ciliated cells in pseudostratified respiratory epithelia and of isolated cells of the villi of duodenum and jejunum, and within intracellular compartments of intestinal goblet cells. In DeltaF508 homozygous patients, expression of the mutant protein proved to be tissue specific. Whereas DeltaF508 CFTR was undetectable in sweat glands, the expression in the respiratory and intestinal tracts could not be distinguished from the wild-type by signal intensity or localization. The tissue-specific variation of DeltaF508 CFTR expression from null to apparently normal amounts indicates that DeltaF508 CFTR maturation can be modulated and suggests that determinants other than CFTR mislocalization should play a role in DeltaF508 CF respiratory and intestinal disease.

17687490	20070810	Cloning, sequence analysis and identification of a nonsense mutation-mediated mRNA decay of porcine GSTM2 gene.	The glutathione S-transferase mu 2 gene (GSTM2) encodes a GST functioning in the elimination of electrophilic compounds and the regulation of cell growth. In this study, the sequence of porcine GSTM2 gene that contains the complete sequence encoding a protein of 218 amino acids was cloned. The deduced amino acid sequence shared 76%, 78% and 76% identity with that of human, mouse and rat, respectively. mRNA expression analysis showed that the porcine GSTM2 gene was expressed at a high level in liver and testis, at a medium level in longissimus dorsi muscle, adipose tissue, spleen and lung, at a low level in kidney, and at a very low level in heart and embryo. A nonsense mutation (CGA--&gt;TGA) resulted from C27T substitution in the fifth exon to produce a premature translation termination codon was identified, and it was discovered that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay might have an effect on the regulation of porcine GSTM2 gene expression. This polymorphism was analyzed in Large White, Landrace, Meishan and Qingping pig populations using the Taq I-polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The result showed that allele C had a higher frequency than allele T in each population. 	Acta_Biochim._Biophys._Sin._(Shanghai)	D016428 D013485
25830353	20150402	Retinal vessel segmentation: an efficient graph cut approach with retinex and local phase.	Our application concerns the automated detection of vessels in retinal images to improve understanding of the disease mechanism, diagnosis and treatment of retinal and a number of systemic diseases. We propose a new framework for segmenting retinal vasculatures with much improved accuracy and efficiency. The proposed framework consists of three technical components: Retinex-based image inhomogeneity correction, local phase-based vessel enhancement and graph cut-based active contour segmentation. These procedures are applied in the following order. Underpinned by the Retinex theory, the inhomogeneity correction step aims to address challenges presented by the image intensity inhomogeneities, and the relatively low contrast of thin vessels compared to the background. The local phase enhancement technique is employed to enhance vessels for its superiority in preserving the vessel edges. The graph cut-based active contour method is used for its efficiency and effectiveness in segmenting the vessels from the enhanced images using the local phase filter. We have demonstrated its performance by applying it to four public retinal image datasets (3 datasets of color fundus photography and 1 of fluorescein angiography). Statistical analysis demonstrates that each component of the framework can provide the level of performance expected. The proposed framework is compared with widely used unsupervised and supervised methods, showing that the overall framework outperforms its competitors. For example, the achieved sensitivity (0:744), specificity (0:978) and accuracy (0:953) for the DRIVE dataset are very close to those of the manual annotations obtained by the second observer.

24097037	20131008	Ultrafast demagnetization enhancement in CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB magnetic tunneling junction driven by spin tunneling current.	The laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization of CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB magnetic tunneling junction is exploited by time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (TRMOKE) for both the parallel state (P state) and the antiparallel state (AP state) of the magnetizations between two magnetic layers. It was observed that the demagnetization time is shorter and the magnitude of demagnetization is larger in the AP state than those in the P state. These behaviors are attributed to the ultrafast spin transfer between two CoFeB layers via the tunneling of hot electrons through the MgO barrier. Our observation indicates that ultrafast demagnetization can be engineered by the hot electrons tunneling current. It opens the door to manipulate the ultrafast spin current in magnetic tunneling junctions. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D013485
19892775	20091107	Effects of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) polymorphisms on cancer: a meta-analysis.	O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase is one of the rare proteins to directly remove alkylating agents in the human DNA direct reversal repair pathway. Its two common single-nucleotide polymorphisms, Leu84Phe and Ile143Val, had previously been identified to contribute to susceptibility of cancer. However, there are conflicting results in studies on the association of the two polymorphisms with cancer. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to clarify the paradox with a large collected sample (13,069 cancer patients and 20,290 controls). We found significant association between the T allele (84Phe) and cancer risk, under the recessive genetic model [P = 0.023, odds ratio (OR) = 1.251, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.031-1.517, P(heterogeneity) = 0.270], TT versus CC comparison (P = 0.035, OR = 1.239, 95% CI 1.015-1.511, P(heterogeneity) = 0.225) and TT versus CT comparison (P = 0.007, OR = 1.292, 95% CI 1.071-1.559, P(heterogeneity) = 0.374), using the random-effect model. In the ethnicity subgroup analysis, a significant association with cancer among Caucasians was found under the recessive genetic model, homozygote comparison and TT versus TC comparison. In the tumour sites subgroup analysis, only the protective effects of Leu84Phe polymorphism were found in colorectal cancer, under CT versus CC comparison. No significant association between the G allele of Ile143Val and cancer risk was found. The G allele showed an increased lung cancer risk under the dominant genetic model and AG versus AA comparison in all Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium subjects, only when the fixed-effect model was used. However, it was insignificant in the random-effect model. 	Mutagenesis	D016428 D017418 D013485
18688269	20080809	Intramolecular cohesion of coils mediated by phenylalanine--glycine motifs in the natively unfolded domain of a nucleoporin.	The nuclear pore complex (NPC) provides the sole aqueous conduit for macromolecular exchange between the nucleus and the cytoplasm of cells. Its diffusion conduit contains a size-selective gate formed by a family of NPC proteins that feature large, natively unfolded domains with phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG domains). These domains of nucleoporins play key roles in establishing the NPC permeability barrier, but little is known about their dynamic structure. Here we used molecular modeling and biophysical techniques to characterize the dynamic ensemble of structures of a representative FG domain from the yeast nucleoporin Nup116. The results showed that its FG motifs function as intramolecular cohesion elements that impart order to the FG domain and compact its ensemble of structures into native premolten globular configurations. At the NPC, the FG motifs of nucleoporins may exert this cohesive effect intermolecularly as well as intramolecularly to form a malleable yet cohesive quaternary structure composed of highly flexible polypeptide chains. Dynamic shifts in the equilibrium or competition between intra- and intermolecular FG motif interactions could facilitate the rapid and reversible structural transitions at the NPC conduit needed to accommodate passing karyopherin-cargo complexes of various shapes and sizes while simultaneously maintaining a size-selective gate against protein diffusion.

24722487	20140412	The immunoregulation effect of alpha 1-antitrypsin prolong ?-cell survival after transplantation.	Islet transplantation has considerable potential as a cure for diabetes. However, the difficulties that arise from inflammation and the immunological rejection of transplants must be addressed for islet transplantation to be successful. Alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) inhibits the damage on ? cells caused by inflammatory reactions and promotes ?-cell survival and proliferation. This protein also induces specific immune tolerance to transplanted ? cells. However, whether the expression of AAT in ? cells themselves could eliminate or decrease immunological rejection of transplants is not clear. Therefore, we established a ? cell line (NIT-hAAT) that stably expresses human AAT. Interestingly, in a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-killing assay, we found that hAAT reduced apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine production in NIT-1 cells and regulated the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance in vitro. In vivo transplantation of NIT-hAAT cells into mice with diabetes showed hAAT inhibited immunological rejection for a short period of time and increased the survival of transplanted ? cells. This study demonstrated that hAAT generated remarkable immunoprotective and immunoregulation effects in a model of ? cell islet transplantation for diabetes model. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485

27419207	20160716	The Membrane Associated RING-CH Proteins: A Family of E3 Ligases with Diverse Roles through the Cell.	Since the discovery that conjugation of ubiquitin to proteins can drive proteolytic degradation, ubiquitination has been shown to perform a diverse range of functions in the cell. It plays an important role in endocytosis, signal transduction, trafficking of vesicles inside the cell, and even DNA repair. The process of ubiquitination-mediated control has turned out to be remarkably complex, involving a diverse array of proteins and many levels of control. This review focuses on a family of structurally related E3 ligases termed the membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) ubiquitin ligases, which were originally discovered as structural homologs to the virals E3s, K3, and K5 from Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). These proteins contain a catalytic RING-CH finger and are typically membrane-bound, with some having up to 14 putative transmembrane domains. Despite several lines of evidence showing that the MARCH proteins play a complex and essential role in several cellular processes, this family remains understudied.

26689701	20151223	A Polymorphism Within the 3'UTR of NLRP3 is Associated with Susceptibility for Ischemic Stroke in Chinese Population.	Stroke was regarded as a severe disorder with high morbidity and high mortality worldwide, ischemic stroke (IS) accounts for 85 to 90?% of new increased stroke cases. Partial mechanisms were elucidated by genetic factors including genomic instability such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Previous reports demonstrated that inflammation was involved in IS, NLRP3 [nucleotide-binding domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3], acting as a specific inflammatory gene, however, its function and influence on IS was not well clarified. In this study, a case-control study including 1102 IS patients and 1610 healthy controls was conducted to investigate the association between IS susceptibility with a SNP (rs10754558) in 3'UTR of NLRP3. Logistic regression analysis showed that the heterozygote and the homozygote GG confer a significantly increased risk of CRC after controlling for other covariates (adjusted OR?=?1.52, 95?% C.I. 1.19-1.97, P?=?0.002; adjusted OR?=?2.22, 95?% C.I. 2.18-3.67, P?&lt;?0.001, respectively). Carriage of G allele was associated with a greatly increased risk of developing the disease (OR?=?1.69, 95?% C.I. 1.31-1.83, P?&lt;?0.001). Stratification analysis found that hypertension had interaction with rs10754558 to modulate IS risk. Further in vitro assay revealed that rs10754558 can affect mRNA level of NLRP3, suggesting its possible functional significance. Our data suggested that genetic polymorphisms in NLRP3 may influence IS risk in Chinese population. Replication of our studies in other populations and further functional studies are required for complete comprehension of the roles of NLRP3 polymorphisms in IS risk. 	Cell._Mol._Neurobiol.	D016428
15005627	20040310	Chemo- and regioselective peptide cyclization triggered by the N-terminal fatty acid chain length: the recombinant cyclase of the calcium-dependent antibiotic from Streptomyces coelicolor.	Here we report the first biochemical characterization of a recombinant nonribosomal peptide cyclase of a streptomycete, the model actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). This bacterium produces the calcium-dependent antibiotic (CDA), which is a branched cyclic macrolactone belonging to the group of acidic lipopeptides. The recombinant CDA3 cyclase from CDA synthetase efficiently catalyzes ring formation of linear peptidyl thioester substrates based on a sequence analogous to natural CDA. Four leaving groups were attached to the C-terminus of the undecapeptide: coenzyme A (CoA), phosphopantetheine, N-acetylcysteamine (SNAC), and thiophenol. The best rates for cyclization were determined for the thiophenol substrate, revealing that chemical reactivity is more important than cofactor recognition. The cyclase catalyzes the formation of two regioisomeric macrolactones, which arise from simultaneous nucleophilic attack of the two adjacent Thr(2) and Ser(1) residues onto the C-terminus of the acyl-enzyme intermediate. This relaxed regioselectivity has not been observed for any other recombinant NRPS or PKS cyclases so far. Substitution of either Ser(1) or Thr(2) by alanine led to selective formation of a decapeptide or undecapeptide lactone ring. In contrast to that, CDA3 cyclase strictly retains stereoselectivity for both nucleophiles, accepting only l-configured Ser(1) and Thr(2) for cyclization. Further, our studies provide evidence for the crucial role of N-terminal fatty acyl groups of lipopeptides in controlling the regio- and chemoselectivity of enzyme-catalyzed macrocyclization. Elongation of the fatty acyl group of our thioester substrate from C(2) to C(6) as in CDA turned the relaxed regioselectivity into a strict regioselectivity, yielding solely the decapeptide lactone ring with a significantly improved cyclization-to-hydrolysis ratio.

23389292	20130208	Hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations and risk of gastric cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study.	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a strong risk factor for hepatocellular cancer, and mutations in the HFE gene associated with HH and iron overload may be related to other tumors, but no studies have been reported for gastric cancer (GC). A nested case-control study was conducted within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), including 365 incident gastric adenocarcinoma and 1284 controls matched by center, sex, age and date of blood collection. Genotype analysis was performed for two functional polymorphisms (C282Y/rs1800562 and H63D/rs1799945) and seven tagSNPs of the HFE genomic region. Association with all gastric adenocarcinoma, and according to anatomical localization and histological subtype, was assessed by means of the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) estimated by unconditional logistic regression adjusted for the matching variables. We observed a significant association for H63D with OR (per rare allele) of 1.32 (CI = 1.03-1.69). In subgroup analyses, the association was stronger for non-cardia anatomical subsite (OR = 1.60, CI = 1.16-2.21) and intestinal histological subtype (OR = 1.82, CI = 1.27-2.62). Among intestinal cases, two tagSNPs (rs1572982 and rs6918586) also showed a significant association that disappeared after adjustment for H63D. No association with tumors located in the cardia or with diffuse subtype was found for any of the nine SNPs analyzed. Our results suggest that H63D variant in HFE gene seems to be associated with GC risk of the non-cardia region and intestinal type, possibly due to its association with iron overload although a role for other mechanisms cannot be entirely ruled out.

18971527	20081031	A haplotype-based case-control study examining human extracellular superoxide dismutase gene and essential hypertension.	It has been reported that oxidative stress is involved in the pathophysiology of essential hypertension (EH), which is a multifactorial disorder. Extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) protects the human body from oxidative stress by converting the toxic superoxide anion (O2-) into less toxic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In EC-SOD knockout mice, blood pressure was reported to be significantly higher than that seen in wild-type mice. The aim of this study was thus to investigate the relationship between EH and the human EC-SOD gene by using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a haplotype-based case-control study. We selected 6 SNPs within the human EC-SOD gene (rs13306703, rs699473, rs699474, rs17881426, rs2536512 and rs1799895), and then performed case-control studies in 243 EH patients and 251 age-matched normotensive (NT) subjects. In Japanese subjects, no heterogeneity was found for rs699474, and no significant differences were observed between the EH and NT groups for the overall distribution of the genotypes or the alleles for each of the SNPs. However, in the haplotype-based case-control study that used rs13306703 and rs2536512, significant differences were observed in the overall distribution (chi2=14.26, p=0.003). The frequency of the T-A haplotype was significantly higher in the EH group than in the NT group (2.4% vs. 0.0%, p&lt;0.001). Based on the results of our haplotype-based case-control study, the T-A haplotype may be a genetic marker for EH, and thus the EC-SOD gene might be a susceptibility gene for EH. 	Hypertens._Res.

3678368	19870701	[Discriminant analysis of hematological and serum biochemical values in cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) bred and reared under the indoor individually-caged conditions].	The data on hematological and serum biochemical properties of laboratory-bred cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) at different ages were analyzed by discriminant analysis. All the animals had been bred and reared under uniform environmental conditions at Tsukuba Primate Center for Medical Science, N.I.H., Japan. The items used were as follows: red blood cell count (RBC), hematocrit value (Ht), hemoglobin concentration (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), white blood cell count (WBC), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase activity (GOT), glutamic pyruvic transaminase activity (GPT), total protein concentration (TP), albumin concentration (ALB), albumin-globulin ratio (A/G), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glucose concentration (GLU), total cholesterol concentration (TCHO), free cholesterol concentration (FCHO), triglyceride concentration (TG) and alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP). In total, 1086 animals in 10 age groups were examined. Data analyses were done with respect to the difference of sex. Discrimination was possible by Mahalanobis' generalized distance between centroids of groups. In canonical discriminant analysis (discriminant analysis with reduction of dimensionality), age was highly correlated to the value of the first canonical variate. From the approximate relative value of the eigenvector of the first canonical variate, the most discriminant variables are WBC, TP, ALB, A/G, TCHO, FCHO, TG, and ALP. It can be concluded that periodic measurement of these 8 parameters is necessary and sufficient to monitor the physiological conditions of growing monkeys. 	Jikken_Dobutsu	D004740 D016428
26528222	20151104	Genetic influences on insight problem solving: the role of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene polymorphisms.	People may experience an &quot;aha&quot; moment, when suddenly realizing a solution of a puzzling problem. This experience is called insight problem solving. Several findings suggest that catecholamine-related genes may contribute to insight problem solving, among which the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is the most promising candidate. The current study examined 753 healthy individuals to determine the associations between 7 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms on the COMT gene and insight problem-solving performance, while considering gender differences. The results showed that individuals carrying A allele of rs4680 or T allele of rs4633 scored significantly higher on insight problem-solving tasks, and the COMT gene rs5993883 combined with gender interacted with correct solutions of insight problems, specifically showing that this gene only influenced insight problem-solving performance in males. This study presents the first investigation of the genetic impact on insight problem solving and provides evidence that highlights the role that the COMT gene plays in insight problem solving.

7625762	19950401	Molecular analysis of the third allele of human deoxyribonuclease I polymorphism.	In addition to common phenotypes 1, 1-2 and 2 of human deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I), phenotypes 1-3 and 2-3, encoded by a third allele DNASE1*3, have been found by means of isoelectric focusing. The main objective of this study was to identify the mutation site(s) underlying phenotype 3. All eight exons covering the entire open reading frame of the human DNase I structural gene were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subjected to direct DNA sequencing. When the entire 780-bp coding region and exon/intron junctions of the DNase I gene of two individuals with phenotypes 1-3 and 2-3 were sequenced, only one nucleotide substitution, a C-G transition (CCC--&gt;GCC), in the codon for amino acid 132 of the mature enzyme located in exon VI was found that resulted in the replacement of proline with alanine (P132A). The mutation was confirmed by allele-specific amplification of genomic DNA. The replacement of the amino acid residue may reduce the hydrophobicity of the enzyme and thus increase the pI value of the type-3 isozyme compared with that of type 1, as increasing the hydrophobicity of a protein is known to decrease its pI value. The specific PCR-amplifications of exons and alleles developed in this study may provide a new tool suitable for rapid screening of DNase I variants. 	Ann._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
12704388	20030422	Constitutive hepcidin expression prevents iron overload in a mouse model of hemochromatosis.	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a prevalent genetic disorder of iron hyperabsorption leading to hyperferremia, tissue iron deposition and complications including cirrhosis, hepatocarcinoma, cardiomyopathy and diabetes. Most individuals affected with hereditary hemochromatosis are homozygous with respect to a missense mutation that disrupts the conformation of HFE, an atypical HLA class I molecule (ref. 1; OMIM 235200). Mice lacking Hfe or producing a C282Y mutant Hfe protein develop hyperferremia and have high hepatic iron levels. In both humans and mice, hereditary hemochromatosis is associated with a paucity of iron in reticuloendothelial cells. It has been suggested that HFE modulates uptake of transferrin-bound iron by undifferentiated intestinal crypt cells, thereby programming the absorptive capacity of enterocytes derived from these cells; however, this model is unproven and controversial. Hepcidin, a peptide hormone (HAMP; OMIM 606464), seems to act in the same regulatory pathway as HFE. Although expression of mouse Hamp is normally greater during iron overload, Hfe-/- mice have inappropriately low expression of Hamp. We crossed Hfe-/- mice with transgenic mice overexpressing Hamp and found that Hamp inhibited the iron accumulation normally observed in the Hfe-/- mice. This argues against the crypt programming model and suggests that failure of Hamp induction contributes to the pathogenesis of hemochromatosis, providing a rationale for the use of HAMP in the treatment of this disease.

21408193	20110317	A large expansion of the HSFY gene family in cattle shows dispersion across Yq and testis-specific expression.	Heat shock transcription factor, Y-linked (HSFY) is a member of the heat shock transcriptional factor (HSF) family that is found in multiple copies on the Y chromosome and conserved in a number of species. Its function still remains unknown but in humans it is thought to play a role in spermatogenesis. Through real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses we determined that the HSFY family is largely expanded in cattle (?70 copies) compared with human (2 functional copies, 4 HSFY-similar copies). Unexpectedly, we found that it does not vary among individual bulls as a copy number variant (CNV). Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) we found that the copies are dispersed along the long arm of the Y chromosome (Yq). HSFY expression in cattle appears restricted to the testis and its mRNA correlates positively with mRNA markers of spermatogonial and spermatocyte cells (UCHL1 and TRPC2, respectively) which suggests that HSFY is expressed (at least in part) in early germ cells.

21816034	20110806	The volatile compound BinBase mass spectral database.	Volatile compounds comprise diverse chemical groups with wide-ranging sources and functions. These compounds originate from major pathways of secondary metabolism in many organisms and play essential roles in chemical ecology in both plant and animal kingdoms. In past decades, sampling methods and instrumentation for the analysis of complex volatile mixtures have improved; however, design and implementation of database tools to process and store the complex datasets have lagged behind. The volatile compound BinBase (vocBinBase) is an automated peak annotation and database system developed for the analysis of GC-TOF-MS data derived from complex volatile mixtures. The vocBinBase DB is an extension of the previously reported metabolite BinBase software developed to track and identify derivatized metabolites. The BinBase algorithm uses deconvoluted spectra and peak metadata (retention index, unique ion, spectral similarity, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and peak purity) from the Leco ChromaTOF software, and annotates peaks using a multi-tiered filtering system with stringent thresholds. The vocBinBase algorithm assigns the identity of compounds existing in the database. Volatile compound assignments are supported by the Adams mass spectral-retention index library, which contains over 2,000 plant-derived volatile compounds. Novel molecules that are not found within vocBinBase are automatically added using strict mass spectral and experimental criteria. Users obtain fully annotated data sheets with quantitative information for all volatile compounds for studies that may consist of thousands of chromatograms. The vocBinBase database may also be queried across different studies, comprising currently 1,537 unique mass spectra generated from 1.7 million deconvoluted mass spectra of 3,435 samples (18 species). Mass spectra with retention indices and volatile profiles are available as free download under the CC-BY agreement (http://vocbinbase.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu). The BinBase database algorithms have been successfully modified to allow for tracking and identification of volatile compounds in complex mixtures. The database is capable of annotating large datasets (hundreds to thousands of samples) and is well-suited for between-study comparisons such as chemotaxonomy investigations. This novel volatile compound database tool is applicable to research fields spanning chemical ecology to human health. The BinBase source code is freely available at http://binbase.sourceforge.net/ under the LGPL 2.0 license agreement. 	BMC_Bioinformatics	D016428 D052061 D013485
19830424	20091016	Familial tumoral calcinosis and hyperostosis-hyperphosphataemia syndrome are different manifestations of the same disease: novel missense mutations in GALNT3.	To report on the biochemistry and clinical and genetic findings of two siblings, the younger sister presenting with recurrent bone pain of the radius and ulna, and medullary sclerosis, and the older brother with soft tissue calcific deposits (tumoral calcinosis) but who later developed bone pain. Both were found to be hyperphosphaturic. The index family comprised four individuals (father, mother, brother, sister). The affected siblings were the offspring of a non-consanguineous Indian family of Tamil origin. Bidirectional sequencing was performed on the DNA from the index family and on 160 alleles from a population of 80 unrelated unaffected control individuals of Tamil extraction and 72 alleles from individuals of non-Tamil origin. Two symptomatic siblings were found to harbour previously unreported compound heterozygous missense UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine: polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 (GalNAc-transferase; GALNT3) mutations in exon 4 c.842A&gt;G and exon 5 c.1097T&gt;G. This sequence variation was not detected in the control DNA. This is the first report of siblings exhibiting stigmata of familial tumoral calcinosis and hyperostosis-hyperphosphataemia syndrome with documented evidence of autosomal recessive missense GALNT3 mutations. The findings from this family add further evidence to the literature that familial tumoral calcinosis and hyperostosis-hyperphosphataemia syndrome are manifestations of the same disease and highlight the importance of appropriate metabolic and genetic investigations.

17885291	20070922	The presence of the Trim5alpha escape mutation H87Q in the capsid of late stage HIV-1 variants is preceded by a prolonged asymptomatic infection phase.	Recently, the tripartite interaction motif 5alpha (Trim5alpha) has been identified as an inhibitory factor blocking infection of a broad range of retroviruses in a species-specific manner. In particular, HIV-1 replication can be efficiently blocked by Trim5alpha from Old World monkeys. The cyclophilin A binding region in the HIV-1 capsid is believed to be the viral determinant for Trim5alpha, and mutations in this region lift the restriction in simian cells. Human Trim5alpha is also able to inhibit HIV-1 replication in vitro, implying that Trim5alpha may contribute to host control of HIV-1 replication in vivo. HIV-1 variants from participants of the Amsterdam cohort studies were analysed for Trim5alpha escape mutations in the capsid. Patients who harboured HIV-1 variants with Trim5alpha escape mutations were compared with patients who lacked such variants in terms of clinical course of infection. Trim5alpha escape mutants emerged in the late phase of infection and were ultimately present in 13.7% of HIV-1 infected individuals. Patients who developed Trim5alpha escape variants late in infection had a significantly lower set-point plasma viral RNA load and concomitantly a prolonged asymptomatic survival as compared to individuals who lacked Trim5alpha escape mutants. This protective effect was stronger in individuals who later developed X4 variants. In addition, X4-emergence was delayed in individuals who later developed Trim5alpha escape variants, compatible with suppression of viral replication. Our data are compatible with Trim5alpha-mediated suppression of viral replication, resulting in prolonged asymptomatic survival and ultimately the selection of Trim5alpha escape variants.

24316141	20131210	Study of the cytokine polymorphisms in correlation to rejection and graft survival in renal allograft donors and recipients from a homogenous Saudi population.	Allograft outcome can be improved with the discovery of risk factors that influence adverse events and may allow individualization of patients' treatment. Rejection is the main hurdle to successful transplantation and the immune response is the key effecter to rejection development. Hence, the major objective of the present study was to assess the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 5 cytokine genes, HLA mismatch and graft outcome in a cohort of 100 Saudi kidney transplant recipients and 100 living related donors at a single transplant center. Genotyping of the following positions: TNFA (-308G/A), TGFB1 (codon 10T/C, codon 25C/G), IL-10 (-1082G/A, -819C/T, -592C/A), IL-6 (-174C/G), and IFNG (+874T/A) were performed. The majority of the donors whose recipients presented with either cellular or antibody mediated graft rejection (90% and 100%) respectively were found to be significantly (p=0.0351) associated with intermediate or high IL-10 producing haplotypes, compared to those with stable grafts (58.66%). Haplotypes linked with lower IL-10 production were not detected in the donors or their recipients with antibody mediated graft rejection compared to donors with stable graft (41.33%). The distribution of donor IL-10-1082 haplotypes (GG, GA, AA) showed a statistically significant association of IL-10-1082 GA genotype (p=0.0351) with rejection, when grouped according to patients' rejection status. No other statistically significant deviations were observed in the donors' genotypes. Analyses of cytokine polymorphisms in the recipients revealed no significant association. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that only HLA-DRB1 mismatch significantly influenced graft loss (p=0.0135). This study demonstrates that the donor IL-10 genotypes and HLA-DRB1 mismatch are key determinants in graft outcome after renal transplantation. 	Transpl._Immunol.	D016428 D013485
21774947	20110722	Dopamine-depletion and increased ?-synuclein load induce degeneration of cortical cholinergic fibers in mice.	Cognitive dysfunction can be common among Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, and multiplication of the gene ?-synuclein (?syn) increases the risk of dementia. Here, we studied the role of dopamine-depletion and increased ?syn load and aggregation on cholinergic structures in vivo. Wild-type (WT) and mice with A30P ?syn overexpression were treated subacutely with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), and the number of cholinergic cells in their nucleus basalis magnocellularis-substantia innominata (NBM-SI), their cortical fiber density and their expression of different genes 1day or 90 days after the last MPTP-injection were measured. Long-term dopamine depletion decreased the expression of choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) in the NBM-SI of WT mice, but no neuron loss was observed. In contrast, cortical cholinergic fiber density was decreased three months after MPTP-injection. Increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression could maintain cholinergic functions under these conditions. Expression of A30P ?syn in six-months-old transgenic mice resulted in decreased tyrosine receptor kinase B expression, and lower cortical cholinergic fiber density. Dopamine-depletion by MPTP induced cholinergic cell loss in the NBM-SI and increased cortical fiber loss. Our findings may explain why cholinergic cells are more vulnerable in PD, leading to an increased probability of dementia. 	J._Neurol._Sci.	D016428 D013485

24353007	20131220	Gliomatosis cerebri type 1 with extensive involvement of the spinal cord and BRAF V600E mutation.	Gliomatosis cerebri (GC) is a rare neoplasm in which there is a diffuse cerebral infiltration by malignant glial cells with relative conservation of the underlying structures. A 67-year-old lady was admitted complaining of balance problems, troubled breathing, stuttered speech, decreased mobility, progressive ataxia and also some mild cognitive problems. MRI demonstrated ill defined T2 hyperintensity with mild mass effect mainly involving the brain stem and cerebellar hemispheres, with minor signal abnormalities extending supratentorially along the corticospinal tracts. The imaging appearances were static over a year. No biopsy was performed. The patient received palliative care and died 2 years after initial presentation. Macroscopic examination of the brain showed an extensive firm white-grey lesion predominantly in the cerebellar white matter, the brainstem, spreading to the full length of the spinal cord and invading the sensory ganglia. Histology revealed an extensively infiltrating diffuse glioma with small elongated fusiform nuclei. Diagnosis of GC type 1 was made. Molecular genetic tests revealed BRAF V600E mutation, while no IDH1 &amp; IDH2 mutations were found. GC should be taken into account in the differential diagnoses mainly when there is rapid clinical deterioration without clear evidence of radiological progression. Extensive spinal cord infiltration has been reported only in 9% and BRAF V600E mutation was detected only in one case in GC previously. Future clinical trials should address whether BRAF V600E mutant brain tumour patients will benefit from BRAF V600E-directed targeted therapies. 	Pathol._Oncol._Res.	D002363 D016428
24925926	20140614	Genome-wide transcript profiling reveals the coevolution of plastid gene sequences and transcript processing pathways in the fucoxanthin dinoflagellate Karlodinium veneficum.	Plastids utilize a complex gene expression machinery, which has coevolved with the underlying genome sequence. Relatively, little is known about the genome-wide evolution of transcript processing in algal plastids that have undergone complex endosymbiotic events. We present the first genome-wide study of transcript processing in a plastid acquired through serial endosymbiosis, in the fucoxanthin-containing dinoflagellate Karlodinium veneficum. The fucoxanthin dinoflagellate plastid has an extremely divergent genome and utilizes two unusual transcript processing pathways, 3'-poly(U) tail addition and sequence editing, which were acquired following the serial endosymbiosis event. We demonstrate that poly(U) addition and sequence editing are widespread features across the Karl. veneficum plastid transcriptome, whereas other dinoflagellate plastid lineages that have arisen through independent serial endosymbiosis events do not utilize either RNA processing pathway. These pathways constrain the effects of divergent sequence evolution in fucoxanthin plastids, for example by correcting mutations in the genomic sequence that would otherwise be deleterious, and are specifically associated with transcripts that encode functional plastid proteins over transcripts of recently generated pseudogenes. These pathways may have additionally facilitated divergent evolution within the Karl. veneficum plastid. Transcript editing, for example, has contributed to the evolution of a novel C-terminal sequence extension on the Karl. veneficum AtpA protein. We furthermore provide the first complete sequence of an episomal minicircle in a fucoxanthin dinoflagellate plastid, which contains the dnaK gene, and gives rise to polyuridylylated and edited transcripts. Our results indicate that RNA processing in fucoxanthin dinoflagellate plastids is evolutionarily dynamic, coevolving with the underlying genome sequence. 	Mol._Biol._Evol.	D016428 D013485
26312121	20150828	Multiple Infectious Complications in a Severely Injured Patient with Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Important Innate Immune Response Genes.	Trauma is a major public health problem worldwide. Infectious complications, sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) remain important causes for morbidity and mortality in patients who survive the initial trauma. There is increasing evidence for the role of genetic variation in the innate immune system on infectious complications in severe trauma patients. We describe a trauma patient with multiple infectious complications caused by multiple micro-organisms leading to prolonged hospital stay with numerous treatments. This patient had multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MBL2, MASP2, FCN2 and TLR2 genes, most likely contributing to increased susceptibility and severity of infectious disease.

19488405	20090603	Inhibition of Lassa virus glycoprotein cleavage and multicycle replication by site 1 protease-adapted alpha(1)-antitrypsin variants.	Proteolytic processing of the Lassa virus envelope glycoprotein precursor GP-C by the host proprotein convertase site 1 protease (S1P) is a prerequisite for the incorporation of the subunits GP-1 and GP-2 into viral particles and, hence, essential for infectivity and virus spread. Therefore, we tested in this study the concept of using S1P as a target to block efficient virus replication. We demonstrate that stable cell lines inducibly expressing S1P-adapted alpha(1)-antitrypsin variants inhibit the proteolytic maturation of GP-C. Introduction of the S1P recognition motifs RRIL and RRLL into the reactive center loop of alpha(1)-antitrypsin resulted in abrogation of GP-C processing by endogenous S1P to a similar level observed in S1P-deficient cells. Moreover, S1P-specific alpha(1)-antitrypsins significantly inhibited replication and spread of a replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the Lassa virus glycoprotein GP as well as authentic Lassa virus. Inhibition of viral replication correlated with the ability of the different alpha(1)-antitrypsin variants to inhibit the processing of the Lassa virus glycoprotein precursor. Our data suggest that glycoprotein cleavage by S1P is a promising target for the development of novel anti-arenaviral strategies. 	PLoS_Negl_Trop_Dis	D016428 D013485
14597264	20031105	Calmodulin-dependent regulation of a lipid binding domain in the v-SNARE synaptobrevin and its role in vesicular fusion.	Trans SNARE complex assembly is an essential step in Ca2+-dependent membrane fusion, although the SNARE proteins do not bind Ca2+ ions. Studies to evaluate how the Ca2+sensor protein calmodulin might regulate this process led to the identification of a consensus calmodulin binding motif in the v-SNARE VAMP2. This sequence (residues 77-90) is situated precisely C-terminal to the tetanus toxin (TeNT) and botulinum B toxin cleavage site (76Q-F77) close to the transmembrane anchor. The same domain also binds acidic phospholipids and Ca2+/calmodulin or lipid binding are mutually exclusive. Directed mutagenesis of basic or hydrophobic residues within this motif reduced interactions with both Ca2+/calmodulin and phospholipids to a similar extent. The effects of these mutations on Ca2+-dependent exocytosis was explored using an hGH release assay in permeabilized pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Treatment of cells with tetanus toxin (TeNT), which cleaves endogenous VAMP, abolished secretion. Secretion could be re-established by transfecting TeNT-resistant VAMP with mutations (Q76V,F77W) in the cleavage site. However rescue of exocytosis was abolished when additional mutations (K83A,K87V or W89A,W90A) were introduced that inhibited calmodulin and phospholipid binding to VAMP. Thus calmodulin and/or phospholipid binding to the membrane proximal region of VAMP is required for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. We speculate that interactions between cis phospholipids at the vesicle surface and the membrane proximal region of VAMP inhibits SNARE complex assembly. Displacement of these interactions by Ca2+/calmodulin may promote SNARE complex assembly and lead to trans interactions between the membrane proximal region of VAMP and phospholipids in the plasma membrane.

20030824	20091225	Molecular evolution of dentin phosphoprotein among toothed and toothless animals.	Dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) is the largest member of the SIBLING family and is the most abundant noncollagenous protein in dentin. DSPP is also expressed in non-mineralized tissues including metabolically active ductal epithelia and some cancers. Its function, however, is poorly defined. The carboxy-terminal fragment, dentin phosphoprotein (DPP) is encoded predominantly by a large repetitive domain that requires separate cloning/sequencing reactions and is, therefore, often incomplete in genomic databases. Comparison of DPP sequences from at least one member of each major branch in the mammalian evolutionary tree (including some &quot;toothless&quot; mammals) as well as one reptile and bird may help delineate its possible functions in both dentin and ductal epithelia. The BMP1-cleavage and translation-termination domains were sufficiently conserved to permit amplification/cloning/sequencing of most species' DPP. While the integrin-binding domain, RGD, was present in about half of species, only vestigial remnants of this tripeptide were identified in the others. The number of tandem repeats of the nominal SerSerAsp phosphorylation motif in toothed mammals (including baleen whale and platypus which lack teeth as adults), ranged from approximately 75 (elephant) to &gt;230 (human). These repeats were not perfect, however, and patterns of intervening sequences highlight the rapidity of changes among even closely related species. Two toothless anteater species have evolved different sets of nonsense mutations shortly after their BMP1 motifs suggesting that while cleavage may be important for DSPP processing in other tissues, the DPP domain itself may be required only in dentin. The lizard DSPP had an intact BMP1 site, a remnant RGD motif, as well as a distinctly different Ser/Asp-rich domain compared to mammals. The DPP domain of DSPP was found to change dramatically within mammals and was lost in two truly toothless animals. The defining aspect of DPP, the long repeating phosphorylation domain, apparently undergoes frequent slip replication and recombination events that rapidly change specific patterns but not its overall biochemical character in toothed animals. Species may have to co-evolve protein processing mechanisms, however, to handle increased lengths of DSP repeats. While the RGD domain is lost in many species, some evolutionary pressure to maintain integrin binding can be observed. 	BMC_Evol._Biol.	D016428 D052060
12529755	20030117	A novel hemizygous Bernard-Soulier Syndrome (BSS) mutation in the amino terminal domain of glycoprotein (GP)Ibbeta--platelet characterization and transfection studies.	Glycoprotein (GP) Ib-V-IX is a unique adhesion receptor complex on platelets. Mutations in GPIbalpha, Ibbeta, and IX can lead to the rare bleeding disorder, Bernard-Soulier Syndrome (BSS). Here, we report a novel hemizygous variant of BSS in which Pro29 in one GPIbbeta allele is substituted by a Leu (GPIbbeta:P29L). Fluoresence in situ hybridisation revealed that the 22q11 locus was deleted from the homologous chromosome. The pedigree was determined and revealed inheritance of the GPIbbeta:P29L allele from the father. Flow cytometry with a range of antibodies detected no expression of GPIb-V-IX on the surface of the patient's platelets. Western blotting revealed an absence of GPIbalpha and GPIbbeta from platelet lysates. Co-expression of GPIbbeta:P29L with normal GPIbalpha and GPIX in a heterologous cell system confirmed that the mutant subunit did not support surface expression of the complex. Interestingly, residual expression of GPIbbeta:P29L anchored in the plasma membrane alone was now seen. This novel BSS mutation expressed in heterologous cells is in agreement with recent in vitro evidence that the correct conformation of the amino terminal region of GPIbbeta is required for normal expression of the intact receptor complex.

25064221	20140728	The role of the rs1544410 polymorphism of vitamin D receptor gene in breast cancer susceptibility.	This study was devised to investigate the genetic effect modification of the BsmI polymorphism associated with the susceptibility to breast cancer. Case-control studies of the BsmI polymorphism and breast cancer were searched. A total of 17 eligible publications were included in our final analysis. Pooled ORs and 95 % CIs were obtained by means of fixed effects model. The general and stratified analyses according to ethnicity showed that the association between the BsmI polymorphism and the risk of breast cancer was not statistically significant. However, the subgroup of the hospital-based studies was found to confer protection against the disease (ORBBvs.bb = 0.83, 95 % CI = 0.71-0.97, P h = 0.571; OR BBvs.Bb+bb = 0.86, 95 % CI = 0.74-1.00, P h = 0.903; OR allele B vs. allele b = 0.92, 95 % CI = 0.86-0.99, P h = 0.337). Our results suggested that the presence of the BsmI polymorphism may contribute to the susceptibility of breast cancer. It is necessary that future large-scale studies should be conducted to further confirm the association between the BsmI polymorphism and breast cancer risk. 	Cell_Biochem._Biophys.	D016428 D017418
20937156	20101013	A comparison of DNA sequencing and the hydrolysis probe analysis (TaqMan assay) for knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations in Anopheles gambiae from the Republic of the Congo.	Knockdown resistance (kdr) caused by a single base pair mutation in the sodium channel gene is strongly associated with pyrethroid insecticide resistance in Anopheles gambiae in West-Central Africa. Recently, various molecular techniques have been developed to screen for the presence of the kdr mutations in vector populations with varying levels of accuracy. In this study, the results of the hydrolysis probe analysis for detecting the kdr mutations in An. gambiae s.s. from the Republic of the Congo were compared with DNA sequence analysis. A total of 52 pyrethroid and DDT resistant An. gambiae from Pointe-Noire (Congo-Brazzaville) were tested for detection of the two kdr mutations (kdr-e and kdr-w) that are known to occur in this species. Results from the hydrolysis probe analysis were compared to DNA sequencing to verify the accuracy of the probe analysis for this vector population. Fifty-one specimens were found to be An. gambiae S-form and one was a M/S hybrid. DNA sequencing revealed that more than half of the specimens (55.8%) carried both the kdr-e and kdr-w resistance mutations, seven specimens (13.5%) were homozygous for the kdr-e mutation, and 14 specimens (26.9%) were homozygous for the kdr-w mutation. A single individual was genotyped as heterozygous kdr-e mutation (1.9%) only and another as heterozygous kdr-w mutation (1.9%) only. Analysis using hydrolysis probe analysis, without adjustment of the allelic discrimination axes on the scatter plots, revealed six specimens (11.5%) carrying both mutations, 30 specimens (57.8%) as homozygous kdr-w, six specimens (11.5%) homozygous for the kdr-e mutation, one specimen (1.9%) heterozygous for the kdr-w mutation and one specimen (1.9%) present in wild type form. Eight of the specimens (15.4%) could not be identified using unadjusted hydrolysis probe analysis values. No heterozygous kdr-e mutations were scored when adjustment for the allelic discrimination axes was omitted. However, when the axes on the scatter plots were adjusted the results were consistent with those of the DNA sequence analysis, barring two individuals that were mis-scored in the hydrolysis probe analysis. Both the kdr-e and kdr-w mutations were abundant in An. gambiae S-form from Pointe-Noire. The hydrolysis probe analysis can lead to misleading results if adjustment to allelic discrimination axes is not investigated. This is mainly relevant when both kdr-e and kdr-w are present in a population in a high frequency. This report highlights the importance of concurrent screening for both mutations. Therefore, performing routine assay protocols blindly can result in the misinterpretation of results. Although hydrolysis probe analysis of kdr is still held as the gold standard assay, this paper highlights the importance of kdr mutation confirmation via sequencing especially in regions where kdr frequency has never been reported before or where both the kdr-e and kdr-w mutations are present simultaneously.

26662437	20151215	Investigation on the association between NLRP3 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to primary gout.	We conducted a case-control study to investigate the association between 3 common NALP3 polymorphisms (rs10754558, rs7512998, and rs12137901) and the susceptibility to primary gout. A total of 320 patients with primary gout and 320 controls were included in this study. The genotyping of NALP3 rs10754558, rs7512998, and rs12137901 were conducted by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Comparison analysis showed that primary gout patients were more likely to have higher body mass index, prevalence of hypertension, blood glucose, triglycerides, urea nitrogen, and uric acid (P &lt; 0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed no significant association between the NALP3 rs10754558, rs7512998, and rs12137901 polymorphisms and the risk of gouty arthritis. In conclusion, we found no significant association between NALP3 gene polymorphisms and the risk of primary gout. 	Genet._Mol._Res.	D016428
27191258	20160519	Rs2853677 modulates Snail1 binding to the TERT enhancer and affects lung adenocarcinoma susceptibility.	Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have shown that SNPs in non-coding regions are associated with inherited susceptibility to cancer. The effect of one single SNP, however, is weak. To identify potential co-factors of SNPs, we investigated the underlying mechanism by which SNPs affect lung cancer susceptibility. We found that rs2853677 is located within the Snail1 binding site in a TERT enhancer. This enhancer increases TERT transcription when juxtaposed to the TERT promoter. The binding of Snail1 to the enhancer disrupts enhancer-promoter colocalization and silences TERT transcription. The high risk variant of rs2853677 disrupts the Snail1 binding site and derepresses TERT expression in response to Snail1 upregulation, thus increasing lung adenocarcinoma susceptibility. Our data suggest that Snail1 may be a co-factor of rs2853677 for predicting lung adenocarcinoma susceptibility and prognosis. 	Oncotarget	D016428
25344219	20141026	Holt Oram syndrome: a registry-based study in Europe.	Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by upper limb anomalies and congenital heart defects. We present epidemiological and clinical aspects of HOS patients using data from EUROCAT (European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies) registries. The study was based on data collected during 1990-2011 by 34 registries. The registries are population-based and use multiple sources of information to collect data on all types of birth using standardized definitions, methodology and coding. Diagnostic criteria for inclusion in the study were the presence of radial ray abnormalities and congenital heart disease (CHD), or the presence of either radial ray anomaly or CHD, with family history of HOS. A total of 73 cases of HOS were identified, including 11 (15.1%) TOPFA and 62 (84.9%) LB. Out of 73 HOS cases, 30.8% (20/65) were suspected prenatally, 55.4% (36/65) at birth, 10.7% (7/65) in the first week of life, and 3.1% (2/65) in the first year of life. The prenatal detection rate was 39.2% (20/51), with no significant change over the study period. In 55% (11/20) of prenatally detected cases, parents decided to terminate pregnancy. Thumb anomalies were reported in all cases. Agenesis/hypoplasia of radius was present in 49.2% (30/61), ulnar aplasia/hypoplasia in 24.6% (15/61) and humerus hypoplasia/phocomelia in 42.6% (26/61) of patients. Congenital heart defects (CHD) were recorded in 78.7% (48/61) of patients. Isolated septal defects were present in 54.2 (26/48), while 25% (12/48) of patients had complex/severe CHD. The mean prevalence of HOS diagnosed prenatally or in the early years of life in European registries was 0.7 per 100,000 births or 1:135,615 births. HOS is a rare genetic condition showing regional variation in its prevalence. It is often missed prenatally, in spite of the existence of major structural anomalies. When discovered, parents in 45% (9/20) of cases opt for the continuation of pregnancy. Although a quarter of patients have severe CHD, the overall first week survival is very good, which is important information for counselling purposes. 	Orphanet_J_Rare_Dis	D016428 D013485
22513089	20120420	Conformational epitopes at cadherin calcium-binding sites and p120-catenin phosphorylation regulate cell adhesion.	We investigated changes in cadherin structure at the cell surface that regulate its adhesive activity. Colo 205 cells are nonadhesive cells with a full but inactive complement of E-cadherin-catenin complexes at the cell surface, but they can be triggered to adhere and form monolayers. We were able to distinguish the inactive and active states of E-cadherin at the cell surface by using a special set of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Another set of mAbs binds E-cadherin and strongly activates adhesion. In other epithelial cell types these activating mAbs inhibit growth factor-induced down-regulation of adhesion and epithelial morphogenesis, indicating that these phenomena are also controlled by E-cadherin activity at the cell surface. Both types of mAbs recognize conformational epitopes at different interfaces between extracellular cadherin repeat domains (ECs), especially near calcium-binding sites. Activation also induces p120-catenin dephosphorylation, as well as changes in the cadherin cytoplasmic domain. Moreover, phospho-site mutations indicate that dephosphorylation of specific Ser/Thr residues in the N-terminal domain of p120-catenin mediate adhesion activation. Thus physiological regulation of the adhesive state of E-cadherin involves physical and/or conformational changes in the EC interface regions of the ectodomain at the cell surface that are mediated by catenin-associated changes across the membrane.

25870223	20150415	Pectoral muscle attenuation as a marker for breast cancer risk in full-field digital mammography.	Mammographic percent density is an established marker of breast cancer risk. In a study of screen film mammograms, we recently reported a novel feature from the pectoral muscle region to be associated with breast cancer risk independently of area percent density (APD). We now investigate whether our novel feature is associated with risk in a study based on full-field digital mammography (FFDM). We carried out a breast cancer risk analysis using a data set of 3,552 healthy controls and 278 cases. We included three image-based measures in our analyses: volumetric percent density (VPD), APD, and the mean intensity of the pectoral muscle (MIP). The datasets comprised different machine vendors and models. In addition, the controls dataset was used to test for the association of our measures against rs10995190, in the ZNF365 gene, a genetic variant known to be associated with mammography density and breast cancer risk. MIP was associated with breast cancer risk [per SD OR, 0.811; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.707-0.930; P = 0.0028] after adjusting for conventional covariates and VPD. It was also associated with the genetic variant rs10995190 after adjusting for VPD and other covariates (per allele effect = 0.111; 95% CI, 0.053-0.170; P = 1.8 ? 10(-4)). Results were similar when adjusting for APD instead of VPD. MIP is a novel mammographic marker, which is associated with breast cancer risk and the genetic variant rs10995190 independently of PD measures. Inclusion of MIP in risk models should be considered for studies using PD from FFDM. 	Cancer_Epidemiol._Biomarkers_Prev.	D003160 D016428 D013485
21124649	20101203	Specific Investigation of Sample Handling Effects on Protease Activities and Absolute Serum Concentrations of Various Putative Peptidome Cancer Biomarkers.	INTRODUCTION: In the search for novel cancer biomarkers, various proteolytically derived peptides have been proposed to exhibit cancer or cancer-type specificity. As these peptides are presumably also generated after sample collection by tumor-specific proteases, extensive investigation of the involved proteolytic processes is crucial for further research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using two previously developed and fully validated liquid-chromatography coupled to tandem-mass spectrometry assays, absolute quantification of, in total, 13 proteolytically derived peptides in human serum was accomplished. The analytes included eight peptides derived from inter-?-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain-4 (ITIH(4)-30, ITIH(4)-29, ITIH(4)-28, ITIH(4)-27, ITIH(4)-26, ITIH(4)-25, ITIH(4)-22, and ITIH(4)-21), bradykinin, des-Arg(9)-bradykinin, Hyp(3)-bradykinin, and fragments from fibrinogen-?-chain (Fib-? ([605-629])) and complement component 4a (C4a ([1337-1350])). Samples were obtained from different healthy individuals and prepared with variable tube types, clotting times, and temperatures. Furthermore, stabilities in the serum fraction were assessed and compared to stabilities in serum from breast cancer patients. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The quantitative analyses showed either increasing or decreasing serum concentrations during blood coagulation, while comparable effects were observed in serum separated from the blood clot. Furthermore, comparisons of inter- and intra-individual variations suggested better reflection of an individual's protease activity after prolonged ex vivo incubation. This was illustrated for the putative breast cancer marker ITIH(4)-22, revealing better differentiation after incubation of serum at ambient temperature for 24?h. CONCLUSION: The presented study provides suggestions for more specific and optimized sample preparation, as well as extended knowledge necessary to further explore the opportunities of these proteolytic peptides as cancer biomarkers.

11463149	20010721	Categories of deltaF508 homozygous cystic fibrosis twin and sibling pairs with distinct phenotypic characteristics.	Cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common severe autosomal recessive trait among Caucasians, is caused by molecular lesions in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR). The course of the multi-organ disease CF is highly variable, suggesting the influence of environmental factors and/or modulating genes other than CFTR on the disease phenotype. To evaluate the cause of CF disease variability, the European CF Twin and Sibling Study collected data on two clinical parameters most sensitive for the course and prognosis of CF, ie weight predicted for height (wfh)% (representative for the nutritional status) and FEVPerc (representative for the pulmonary status) for a cohort of 277 sibling pairs, 12 pairs of dizygous twins and 29 pairs of monozygous twins. Of these 318 CF twin and sib pairs, 114 were reported to be homozygous for the most frequent CF disease-causing lesion, deltaF508. Intra-pair discordance was assessed by the intra-pair differences with wfh% and FEVPerc and by DELTA, a composite parameter defined by linear combination of wfh% and FEVPerc in order to describe discordance with respect to the overall disease severity. Monozygous twins had a significantly lower DELTA than dizygous twins (P = 0.05) indicating that CF disease severity is modulated by an inherited component in addition to the CFTR gene itself. Extreme phenotypes are considered to be more informative for the analysis of any quantitative trait. Thus, we aimed to quantify disease severity and intra-pair discordance in order to select pairs with the extreme phenotypes DIS (discordant patient pairs), CON+ (concordant and mildy affected patient pairs) and CON- (concordant and severely affected patient pairs). The algorithm reliably discriminated between pairs DIS, CON+ and CON- among the cohort of deltaF508 homozygotes. The selected pairs from these categories demonstrated non-overlapping properties for wfh%, FEVPerc and the intra-pair difference of both parameters. 	Twin_Res	D003160 D016428 D013485 D018486
11927079	20020403	[Crouzon's syndrome with acanthosis nigricans].	Crouzon's syndrome is a complex craniosynostosis disorder due to mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) type 2. We report a female patient with Crouzon's syndrome associated with acanthosis nigricans. The molecular abnormality in this patient is a point mutation (Ala391Glu) in the transmembrane domain of another FGFR (type 3), which is very close to the mutation (Gly380Arg) most frequently observed in achondroplasia. Acanthosis nigricans is an emerging disorder. Its clinical features and molecular findings differ from those of isolated Crouzon's syndrome. These data are very useful when molecular tests are required for prenatal diagnosis. 	An._Esp._Pediatr.	D002363 D003160 D016428
23825971	20130705	From many, one: genetic control of prolificacy during maize domestication.	A reduction in number and an increase in size of inflorescences is a common aspect of plant domestication. When maize was domesticated from teosinte, the number and arrangement of ears changed dramatically. Teosinte has long lateral branches that bear multiple small ears at their nodes and tassels at their tips. Maize has much shorter lateral branches that are tipped by a single large ear with no additional ears at the branch nodes. To investigate the genetic basis of this difference in prolificacy (the number of ears on a plant), we performed a genome-wide QTL scan. A large effect QTL for prolificacy (prol1.1) was detected on the short arm of chromosome 1 in a location that has previously been shown to influence multiple domestication traits. We fine-mapped prol1.1 to a 2.7 kb &quot;causative region&quot; upstream of the grassy tillers1 (gt1) gene, which encodes a homeodomain leucine zipper transcription factor. Tissue in situ hybridizations reveal that the maize allele of prol1.1 is associated with up-regulation of gt1 expression in the nodal plexus. Given that maize does not initiate secondary ear buds, the expression of gt1 in the nodal plexus in maize may suppress their initiation. Population genetic analyses indicate positive selection on the maize allele of prol1.1, causing a partial sweep that fixed the maize allele throughout most of domesticated maize. This work shows how a subtle cis-regulatory change in tissue specific gene expression altered plant architecture in a way that improved the harvestability of maize. 	PLoS_Genet.

25197120	20140909	Concomitant Takayasu arteritis and Cushing syndrome in a child undergoing open adrenalectomy: An anaesthetic challenge.	Takayasu's arteritis (TA) is a rare, chronic progressive panendarteritis involving the aorta and its main branches. Anaesthesia for patients with TA is complicated by their severe uncontrolled hypertension, end-organ dysfunction, stenosis of major blood vessels, and difficulties encountered in monitoring arterial blood pressure. In a patient with Cushing's syndrome (CS), the anaesthesiologist needs to deal with volume overload, hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, difficult airway and ventilation. Anaesthetic management of a patient with concomitant TA and CS undergoing adrenalectomy has hardly ever been reported. We present the successful anaesthetic management of a 15-year-old child with coexisting TA and CS undergoing open adrenalectomy. 	Indian_J_Anaesth	D016428
21049466	20101105	Case report of a woman with monoclonal gammapathy and papillary thyroid carcinoma, diagnosed because of detection of CHEK2 (I157T) mutation in genetic examinations.	The CHEK2 gene encodes the CHK2 protein, which is kinase involved in DNA repair processes. By activating a lot of cell substrates, it can regulate the cell cycle, demonstrates suppressive effects, and participates in the senescence and apoptosis processes. Mutations in the CHEK2 gene are associated with increased risk of numerous cancers. The case described herein is that of a woman with a missense mutation that results in the substitution of isoleucine for threonine at position 157. This variant of the mutation doubles the risk of papillary thyroid carcinoma two times and causes up to 9% of these cancer. It is also associated with a two-fold increased risk of cancers of the kidney (10%), colon (10%), and ovary (10% - G1), a 1.6-fold increased risk of prostate cancer (8% of all of them and 12% of familiar ones), and a 1.5-fold increased risk of breast cancer (7%). The screening procedures were initiated in a carrier who revealed papillary thyroid carcinoma. Genetic screening of the family diagnosed her daughter as the carrier of this mutation. Until now no active cancer disease has been recognized in the daughter. On the example of the presented case we discuss indications for screening in cases of positive family history. The group especially predisposed seem to be patients with at least two coexisting carcinomas. Having diagnosed the mutation, it is necessary to do genetic screening of family members. Continuous oncological observation of the carriers of CHEK 2 mutation is essential. 	Endokrynol_Pol	D002363 D016428
18487511	20080520	Mutations in EKLF/KLF1 form the molecular basis of the rare blood group In(Lu) phenotype.	Comparison of normal erythroblasts and erythroblasts from persons with the rare In(Lu) type of Lu(a-b-) blood group phenotype showed increased transcription levels for 314 genes and reduced levels for 354 genes in In(Lu) cells. Many erythroid-specific genes (including ALAS2, SLC4A1) had reduced transcript levels, suggesting the phenotype resulted from a transcription factor abnormality. A search for mutations in erythroid transcription factors showed mutations in the promoter or coding sequence of EKLF in 21 of 24 persons with the In(Lu) phenotype. In all cases the mutant EKLF allele occurred in the presence of a normal EKLF allele. Nine different loss-of-function mutations were identified. One mutation abolished a GATA1 binding site in the EKLF promoter (-124T&gt;C). Two mutations (Leu127X; Lys292X) resulted in premature termination codons, 2 (Pro190LeufsX47; Arg319GlufsX34) in frameshifts, and 4 in amino acid substitution of conserved residues in zinc finger domain 1 (His299Tyr) or domain 2 (Arg328Leu; Arg328His; Arg331Gly). Persons with the In(Lu) phenotype have no reported pathology, indicating that one functional EKLF allele is sufficient to sustain human erythropoiesis. These data provide the first description of inactivating mutations in human EKLF and the first demonstration of a blood group phenotype resulting from mutations in a transcription factor.

25367099	20141105	Behavioral phenotype in Costello syndrome with atypical mutation: a case report.	Costello syndrome (CS) is a rare genetic disorder caused, in the majority of cases, by germline missense HRAS mutations affecting Gly(12) promoting enhanced signaling through the MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling cascades. In general, the cognitive profile in CS is characterized by intellectual disability ranging from mild to severe impairment. The first published descriptions of behavior in CS children underlined the presence of irritability and shyness at younger ages with sociable personality and good empathic skills after 4-5 years of age, however some recent studies have reported autistic traits. We report on a 7-year-old boy heterozygous for a rare duplication of codon 37 (p.E37dup) in HRAS, manifesting impaired social interaction and non-verbal communication and with circumscribed interests. These additional features improve phenotype delineation in individuals with rare HRAS mutations, facilitating the development of specific behavioral treatments which could lead to improvement in cases of autism spectrum disorder.

7533932	19940101	Myelin proteolipid protein mutation in the rabbit: a new model of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.	Proteolipid protein (PLP) is a major myelin protein of the central nervous system. Mutations of the Plp gene are responsible for a number of sex-linked disorders in humans (Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease) and in animals. We have identified a novel mutation of the Plp gene which gives rise to the paralytic tremor (pt) phenotype in rabbit. Pt rabbits are hypomyelinated and present very low levels of PLP protein and its mRNA. Sequence analysis revealed a single nucleotide change in exon 2 which results in the substitution of a histidine by a glutamine at position 36. Histidine36 is positioned at the boundary of the first transmembrane domain. Therefore, its position can be crucial for the efficient interaction of PLP with other proteins and lipids, and for correct incorporation into the membrane.

17540843	20070602	MEK1/2 inhibitors potentiate UCN-01 lethality in human multiple myeloma cells through a Bim-dependent mechanism.	The role of Bim in synergistic interactions between UCN-01 and MEK1/2 inhibitors in human multiple myeloma cells was investigated. Exposure of U266 or RPMI8226 cells to UCN-01 resulted in ERK1/2 activation-associated Bim(EL) phosphorylation/down-regulation, events abrogated by MEK1/2 inhibitors. Enforced activation of ERK1/2 by transfection with constitutively active MEK1 diminished the capacity of PD98059 but not PD184352 to block UCN-01-mediated Bim(EL) phosphorylation and to potentiate apoptosis. Cotreatment with MEK1/2 inhibitors increased the association of Bim(EL) with both Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) in UCN-01-treated cells, leading to Bax/Bak conformational change and Bax mitochondrial translocation. Down-regulation of Bim(EL) by shRNA substantially diminished UCN-01/MEK inhibitor-mediated Bax/Bak activation and apoptosis. Furthermore, transfection of cells with S65A Bim, a mutant resistant to UCN-01-mediated phosphorylation, significantly sensitized cells to UCN-01 lethality. Conversely, ectopic expression of either Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L) did not alter UCN-01/MEK1/2 inhibitor-mediated modifications in Bim(EL) phosphorylation but largely prevented cell death. Finally, IL-6 or IGF-1 failed to prevent MEK1/2 inhibitors from blocking UCN-01-induced Bim(EL) phosphorylation/degradation or cell death. Collectively, these findings argue that UCN-01-mediated ERK1/2 activation leads to Bim(EL) phosphorylation/inactivation, resulting in cytoprotection, and that interference with these events by MEK1/2 inhibitors plays a critical role in synergistic induction of apoptosis by these agents.

1945883	19911111	Manipulation of the 'zinc cluster' region of transcriptional activator LEU3 by site-directed mutagenesis.	The transcriptional activator LEU3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae belongs to a family of lower eukaryotic DNA binding proteins with a well-conserved DNA binding motif known as the Zn(II)2Cys6 binuclear cluster. We have constructed mutations in LEU3 that affect either one of the conserved cysteines (Cys47) or one of several amino acids located within a variable subregion of the DNA binding motif. LEU3 proteins with a mutation at Cys47 were very poor activators which could not be rescued by supplying Zn(II) to the growth medium. Mutations within the variable subregion were generally well-tolerated. Only two of seven mutations in this region generated poor activators, and both could be reactivated by Zn(II) supplements. Three of the other five mutations gave rise to activators that were better than wild type. One of these, His50Cys, exhibited a 1.5 fold increase in in vivo target gene activation and a notable increase in the affinity for target DNA. The properties of the His50Cys mutant are discussed in terms of a variant structure of the DNA binding motif. During the course of this work, evidence was obtained suggesting that only one of the two LEU3 protein-DNA complexes routinely seen actually activates transcription. The other (which may contain an additional protein factor) does not. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D013487
19202104	20090210	Kinase activity of the dgk gene product is involved in the virulence of Streptococcus mutans.	C-terminal deletion of the diacylglycerol kinase (Dgk) homologue of the cariogenic oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans resulted in loss of aciduricity. To confirm the role of the C terminus of the Dgk homologue in aciduricity, various mutants of S. mutans UA159 with a C-terminally truncated Dgk homologue were constructed. The deletion of one or two amino acid residues at the C terminus had no effect on the acid-tolerance properties of mutants. When further amino acid residues at the C terminus were removed, mutants became more acid-sensitive. The mutant with deletion of eight amino acid residues at the C terminus did not grow at pH 5.5, suggesting that the C-terminal tail of the Dgk homologue was indispensable for tolerance to acid stress in S. mutans. Kinase activity assays revealed that deletion of the C-terminal amino acids of Dgk led to a reduction of kinase activity for undecaprenol. A truncated mutant that had completely lost kinase activity was unable to grow at pH 5.5. These results suggest that the acid tolerance of S. mutans is closely related to kinase activity of the Dgk homologue. Additionally, the dgk deletion mutant exhibited markedly reduced levels of smooth-surface carious lesions in pathogen-free rats, despite there being no difference between the mutant and the parental organism in the extent of total smooth surface plaque. The results suggest that Dgk activity may play a direct role in the virulence of S. mutans. 	Microbiology_(Reading,_Engl.)	D016428 D013485
25201053	20140910	Screening of clock gene polymorphisms demonstrates association of a PER3 polymorphism with morningness-eveningness preference and circadian rhythm sleep disorder.	A system of self-sustained biological clocks controls the 24-h rhythms of behavioral and physiological processes such as the sleep-wake cycle. The circadian clock system is regulated by transcriptional and translational negative feedback loops of multiple clock genes. Polymorphisms in circadian clock genes have been associated with morningness-eveningness (diurnal) preference, familial advanced sleep phase type (ASPT), and delayed sleep phase type (DSPT). We genotyped single-nucleotide polymorphisms in circadian clock genes in 182 DSPT individuals, 67 free-running type (FRT) individuals, and 925 controls. The clock gene polymorphisms were tested for associations with diurnal preference and circadian rhythm sleep disorder (CRSD) phenotypes. The PER3 polymorphism (rs228697) was significantly associated with diurnal preference and the FRT phenotype. The minor allele of rs228697 was more prevalent in evening types than in morning types (sex-adjusted odds ratio (OR), 2.483, Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.012) and in FRT individuals compared with the controls (age- and sex-adjusted OR, 2.021, permutated P = 0.017). Our findings support the notion that PER3 polymorphisms could be a potential genetic marker for an individual's circadian and sleep phenotypes. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D013485
22805374	20120719	Alzheimer's disease A? assemblies mediating rapid disruption of synaptic plasticity and memory.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by episodic memory impairment that often precedes clinical diagnosis by many years. Probing the mechanisms of such impairment may provide much needed means of diagnosis and therapeutic intervention at an early, pre-dementia, stage. Prior to the onset of significant neurodegeneration, the structural and functional integrity of synapses in mnemonic circuitry is severely compromised in the presence of amyloidosis. This review examines recent evidence evaluating the role of amyloid-? protein (A?) in causing rapid disruption of synaptic plasticity and memory impairment. We evaluate the relative importance of different sizes and conformations of A?, including monomer, oligomer, protofibril and fibril. We pay particular attention to recent controversies over the relevance to the pathophysiology of AD of different water soluble A? aggregates and the importance of cellular prion protein in mediating their effects. Current data are consistent with the view that both low-n oligomers and larger soluble assemblies present in AD brain, some of them via a direct interaction with cellular prion protein, cause synaptic memory failure. At the two extremes of aggregation, monomers and fibrils appear to act in vivo both as sources and sinks of certain metastable conformations of soluble aggregates that powerfully disrupt synaptic plasticity. The same principle appears to apply to other synaptotoxic amyloidogenic proteins including tau, ?-synuclein and prion protein. 	Mol_Brain	D016428 D013485 D016454

22589106	20120517	Coupling of native IEF and extended X-ray absorption fine structure to characterize zinc-binding sites from pI isoforms of SOD1 and A4V pathogenic mutant.	Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) has already provided high-resolution structures of metal-binding sites in a wide variety of metalloproteins. Usually, EXAFS is performed on purified metalloproteins either in solution or crystallized form but purification steps are prone to modify the metallation state of the protein. We developed a protocol to couple EXAFS analysis to metalloprotein separation using native gel electrophoresis. This coupling opens a large field of applications as metalloproteins can be characterized in their native state avoiding purification steps. Using native isoelectric focusing, the method enables the EXAFS analysis of metalloprotein pI isoforms. We applied this methodology to SOD1, wild-type, and Ala4Val mutant (A4V), a mutation found in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) because decreased Zn affinity to SOD1 mutants is suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disease. We observed similar coordination structures for Zn in wild-type and mutant proteins, in all measured pI isoforms, demonstrating the feasibility of EXAFS on electrophoresis gels and suggesting that the Zn-binding site is not structurally modified in A4V SOD1 mutant.

26834308	20160203	Adsorption and removal of strontium in aqueous solution by synthetic hydroxyapatite.	Hydroxyapatite (HAP) is a main mineral constituent of bone and tooth and has an outstanding biocompatibility. HAP is a possible sorbent for heavy metals in wastewater due to its high adsorption capacity and low water solubility. We developed a removal system of90Sr from aqueous solution by HAP column procedure. More than 90?% of90Sr was adsorbed and removed from the90Sr containing solution. Divalent cations, Ca2+, had little effect on the removal of90Sr up to a concentration of 1?mmol?L-1. This clearly indicates that the HAP column technique is advantageous with respect to the capacity to adsorb90Sr from water present in the environment. 	J_Radioanal_Nucl_Chem	D016428
25950190	20150508	Eradication of T315I mutation in chronic myeloid leukemia without third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor: a case report.	We report the case of a patient bearing a T315I-mutant chronic myeloid leukemia resistant to nilotinib, successfully treated with omacetaxine and then with dasatinib. After 9 months of nilotinib, the patient achieved a major molecular response but relapsed 3 months later due to the T315I mutation. Because third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor was not available and the patient refused bone marrow transplantation, he received two cycles of omacetaxine. This treatment had been stopped after two cycles because of clinical intolerance, but a major molecular response and total disappearance of the T315I clone was obtained. Treatment with dasatinib was then started and after 34-month follow-up the patient is still in major molecular response, thus suggesting that eradication of the T315I mutation could be achieved without third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

11566956	20010922	Thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR) gene is associated with essential hypertension.	In essential hypertension, a polygenic and multifactorial syndrome, several genes interact with the environment to produce high blood pressure. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) plays an important role in central cardiovascular regulation. We have described that TRH overexpression induces hypertension in a normal rat, which was reversed by TRH antisense treatment. This treatment also reduces the central TRH hyperactivity in spontaneously hypertensive rats and normalizes blood pressure. Human TRH receptor (TRHR) belongs to the G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane domain receptor superfamily. Mutations of these receptors may result in constitutive activation. As it has been demonstrated that hypertensive patients have a blunted TSH response to TRH injection, suggesting a defect in the TRHR, we postulate that the TRHR gene is involved in human hypertension. We studied 2 independent populations from different geographic regions of our country: a sample of adult subjects from a referral clinic and a population-based sample of high school students. In search of molecular variants of TRHR, we disclosed that a polymorphic TG dinucleotide repeat (STR) at -68 bp and a novel single nucleotide polymorphism, a G--&gt;C conversion at -221 located in the promoter of the TRHR are associated with essential hypertension. As STRs detected in gene promoters are potential Z-DNA-forming sequences and seem to affect gene expression, we studied the potentially different transcriptional activity of these TRHR promoter variants and found that the S/-221C allele has a higher affinity than does the L/G-221 allele to nuclear protein factor(s). Our findings support the hypothesis that the TRHR gene participates in the etiopathogenesis of essential hypertension. 	Hypertension	D016428 D013485
21668431	20110615	Cardiomyopathy with alopecia and palmoplantar keratoderma (CAPK) is caused by a JUP mutation.	Inherited desmosomal cardiocutaneous syndromes are characterized by the quartet of woolly hair, palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK), skin fragility and cardiac abnormalities, which are caused by mutations in genes coding for desmosomal proteins. We describe a previously unrecognized autosomal recessive syndrome in a family with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy associated with alopecia and PPK (named CAPK). Genetic investigation of the family led us to find a homozygous disease-causing mutation, p.R265H, in JUP which encodes plakoglobin, a well-described member of the desmosome complex. This study expands the clinical spectrum of disorders associated with germline mutations affecting desmosomal proteins by describing a novel phenotype. 	Br._J._Dermatol.	D002363 D016428 D013485
25037980	20140720	Mitochondrial myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia (MLASA) plus associated with a novel de novo mutation (m.8969G&gt;A) in the mitochondrial encoded ATP6 gene.	Mitochondrial myopathy, lactic acidosis and sideroblastic anemia (MLASA) is a rare mitochondrial disorder that has previously been associated with mutations in PUS1 and YARS2. In the present report, we describe a 6-year old male with an MLASA plus phenotype. This patient had features of MLASA in the setting of developmental delay, sensorineural hearing loss, epilepsy, agenesis of the corpus callosum, failure to thrive, and stroke-like episodes. Sequencing of the mitochondrial genome identified a novel de novo, heteroplasmic mutation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded ATP6 gene (m.8969G&gt;A, p.S148N). Whole exome sequencing did not identify mutations or variants in PUS1 or YARS2 or any known nuclear genes that could affect mitochondrial function and explain this phenotype. Studies of fibroblasts derived from the patient revealed a decrease in oligomycin-sensitive respiration, a finding which is consistent with a complex V defect. Thus, this mutation in MT-ATP6 may represent the first mtDNA point mutation associated with the MLASA phenotype. 	Mol._Genet._Metab.	D002363 D016428 D052061 D013485
2999881	19851001	The biological relevance of HPLC-purified vasoactive intestinal polypeptide monoiodinated at tyrosine 10 or tyrosine 22.	Three major forms of monoiodinated VIP (M125I-VIP) were isolated after chloramine-T iodination and HPLC purification. The iodinated tyrosine residue was located in each form of M125I-VIP using arginase C and trypsin digestion for obtaining defined fragments containing only one tyrosine residue. The HPLC isolated iodinated fragments thus obtained were used for HPLC comigration studies with iodinated synthetic C and N terminal VIP fragments and for amino acid analysis. The first two eluting peaks 1 and 2 are (M125I-Tyr10-VIP); peak 1 has an oxidized methionine; peak 3 is a (M125I-Tyr22-VIP) which also has an oxidized methionine. A reduced counterpart of peak 3 named peak 4 was isolated by further HPLC analysis. The ability of the different species of M125I-VIP to stimulate adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphate (cAMP) production in transformed colonic cells in culture (HT-29) was compared to that of native VIP. The mean potencies of the M125I-VIP species expressed as a percentage relative to the potency of native VIP were, peak (1): 0.98; (2): 0.84; (3): 1.38; (4): 1.48, in the range of concentrations tested (2-60 pM). The M125I-Tyr22-VIP are significantly more active than native VIP (P less than 0.01). Oxidation of methionine or iodination of tyrosine 10 does not significantly modify the biological activity of VIP. We conclude that iodination of Tyr-22 located in the apolar helical COOH-terminal of VIP increases the effectiveness of VIP interaction with its receptors. Thus the tyrosyl residue and the localized hydrophobic features of VIP are critically involved in the function of this neurotransmitter. 	Regul._Pept.	D003160 D016428
24183450	20131105	Global analysis of DNA methylation variation in adipose tissue from twins reveals links to disease-associated variants in distal regulatory elements.	Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation play a key role in gene regulation and disease susceptibility. However, little is known about the genome-wide frequency, localization, and function of methylation variation and how it is regulated by genetic and environmental factors. We utilized the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource (MuTHER) and generated Illumina 450K adipose methylome data from 648 twins. We found that individual CpGs had low variance and that variability was suppressed in promoters. We noted that DNA methylation variation was highly heritable (h(2)median = 0.34) and that shared environmental effects correlated with metabolic phenotype-associated CpGs. Analysis of methylation quantitative-trait loci (metQTL) revealed that 28% of CpGs were associated with nearby SNPs, and when overlapping them with adipose expression quantitative-trait loci (eQTL) from the same individuals, we found that 6% of the loci played a role in regulating both gene expression and DNA methylation. These associations were bidirectional, but there were pronounced negative associations for promoter CpGs. Integration of metQTL with adipose reference epigenomes and disease associations revealed significant enrichment of metQTL overlapping metabolic-trait or disease loci in enhancers (the strongest effects were for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and body mass index [BMI]). We followed up with the BMI SNP rs713586, a cg01884057 metQTL that overlaps an enhancer upstream of ADCY3, and used bisulphite sequencing to refine this region. Our results showed widespread population invariability yet sequence dependence on adipose DNA methylation but that incorporating maps of regulatory elements aid in linking CpG variation to gene regulation and disease risk in a tissue-dependent manner.

19273584	20090311	Functional analysis of upstream common polymorphisms of the dopamine transporter gene.	The human dopamine transporter (DAT, SLC6A3) has been extensively investigated because of its potential involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders. The core elements responsible for its transcription have been identified. A regulatory role for certain genomic variants upstream to the core promoter is known. Recently, other single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in this region and are thought to be associated with schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder. Hence, we have investigated the impact of common SNPs in a 2.8-kilobase region flanking the core promoter region (-2.7 to +63 base pair) in the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. Haplotypes generated by site-directed mutagenesis revealed varying impact of individual SNPs on promoter activity using dual luciferase assays. In silico analyses also predicted allele-specific binding of transcription factors for some of these SNPs. Though electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated several factors that appeared to bind to specific sites within this region, allele-specific binding was not detected for any SNP apart from rs3756450. We have thus identified novel putative regulatory domains flanking the core promoter of DAT that merit further investigation. 	Schizophr_Bull	D016428 D052061
21031079	20101030	Disturbed Wnt Signalling due to a Mutation in CCDC88C Causes an Autosomal Recessive Non-Syndromic Hydrocephalus with Medial Diverticulum.	The etiology of non-syndromic hydrocephalus is poorly understood. Via positional cloning in a consanguineous family with autosomal recessive hydrocephalus we have now identified a homozygous splice site mutation in the CCDC88C gene as a novel cause of a complex hydrocephalic brain malformation. The only living patient showed normal psychomotor development at the age of 3 years and 3 months and her deceased aunt, who was assumed to suffer from the same condition, had mild mental retardation. The mutation in the affected patients, a homozygous substitution in the donor splice site of intron 29, resulted in a shorter transcript due to exclusion of exon 29 and loss of functional protein, as shown by Western blotting (p.S1591HfsX7). In normal human tissue panels, we found CCDC88C ubiquitously expressed, but most prominently in the fetal brain, especially in pons and cerebellum, while expression in the adult brain appeared to be restricted to cortex and medulla oblongata. CCDC88C encodes DAPLE (HkRP2), a Hook-related protein with a binding domain for the central Wnt signalling pathway protein Dishevelled. Targeted quantitative RT-PCR and expression profiling of 84 genes from the Wnt signalling pathway in peripheral blood from the index patient and her healthy mother revealed increased mRNA levels of CCDC88C indicating transcriptional upregulation. Due to loss of CCDC88C function ?-catenin (CTNNB1) and the downstream target LEF1 showed increased mRNA levels in the patient, but many genes from the Wnt pathway and transcriptional target genes showed reduced expression, which might be explained by a complex negative feedback loop. We have thus identified a further essential component of the Wnt signalling pathway in human brain development. 	Mol_Syndromol	D016428
23807887	20130629	Clinical and radiological pictures of two newborn babies with manifestations of chondrodysplasia punctata and review of available literature.	Chondrodysplasia punctata (CDP) is a rare, heterogeneous congenital skeletal dysplasia, characterized by punctate or dot-like calcium deposits in cartilage observed on neonatal radiograms. A number of inborn metabolic diseases are associated with CDP, including peroxisomal and cholesterol biosynthesis dysfunction and other inborn errors of metabolism such as: mucolipidosis type II, mucopolysacharidosis type III, GM1 gangliosidosis. CDP is also related to disruption of vitamin K-dependent metabolism, causing secondary effects on the embryo, as well as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), chromosomal abnormalities that include trisomies 18 and 21, Turner syndrome. This article presents clinical data and diagnostic imaging findings of two newborn babies with chondrodysplasia punctata. Children presented with skeletal and cartilage anomalies, dysmorphic facial feature, muscles tone abnormalities, skin changes and breathing difficulties. One of the patients demonstrated critical stenosis of spinal canal with anterior subluxation of C1 vertebra relative to C2. The aim of this article is to present cases and briefly describe current knowledge on etiopathogenesis as well as radiological and clinical symptoms of diseases coexisting with CDP. Radiological diagnostic imaging allows for visualization of punctate focal mineralization in bone epiphyses during neonatal age and infancy. Determining the etiology of chondrodysplasia punctata requires performing various basic as well as additional examinations, including genetic studies. 	Pol_J_Radiol	D016428
28006821	20161223	SRC-1 Regulates Blood Pressure and Aortic Stiffness in Female Mice.	Framingham Heart Study suggests that dysfunction of steroid receptor coactivator-1 may be involved in the development of hypertension. However, there is no functional evidence linking steroid receptor coactivator-1 to the regulation of blood pressure. We used immunohistochemistry to map the expression of steroid receptor coactivator-1 protein in mouse brain, especially in regions implicated in the regulation of blood pressure. Steroid receptor coactivator-1 protein was found in central amygdala, medial amygdala, supraoptic nucleus, arcuate nucleus, ventromedial, dorsomedial, paraventricular hypothalamus, and nucleus of the solitary tract. To determine the effects of steroid receptor coactivator-1 protein on cardiovascular system we measured blood pressures, blood flow velocities, echocardiographic parameters, and aortic input impedance in female steroid receptor coactivator-1 knockout mice and their wild type littermates. Steroid receptor coactivator-1 knockout mice had higher blood pressures and increased aortic stiffness when compared to female wild type littermates. Additionally, the hearts of steroid receptor coactivator-1 knockout mice seem to consume higher energy as evidenced by increased impedance and higher heart rate pressure product when compared to female wild type littermates. Our results demonstrate that steroid receptor coactivator-1 may be functionally involved in the regulation of blood pressure and aortic stiffness through the regulation of sympathetic activation in various neuronal populations.

17669634	20070803	The CNR1 gene as a pharmacogenetic factor for antipsychotics rather than a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia.	Neurobiological research suggests a significant role of the endocannabinoid system in schizophrenia vulnerability and also in the quality of response to antipsychotics. Genetics offer an opportunity to disentangle its involvement in the disease vulnerability vs an influence on antipsychotics' effects. The possible role of a tag SNP (the 1359G/A polymorphism) of the gene encoding the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CNR1) in schizophrenia and/or therapeutic response to atypical antipsychotics was assessed in a cohort of 133 French schizophrenic patients compared to 141 normal control subjects. No difference in 1359G/A polymorphism was observed between patients and control subjects, and no relationships were noted between this polymorphism and any clinical parameter considered as potential intermediate factor. However, the G allele frequency was significantly higher among non-responsive vs responsive patients, with a dose effect of the G allele. In contrast, no association was found for three other genetic polymorphisms of the CNR1 gene. The G allele of the CNR1 gene polymorphisms could be a psychopharmacogenetic rather than a vulnerability factor regarding schizophrenia and its treatment. 	Eur_Neuropsychopharmacol	D016428 D013485
18984671	20081106	The TRIB3 Q84R polymorphism and risk of early-onset type 2 diabetes.	The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), particularly among young adults, has been rising steadily during the past 2 decades. T2D, especially in its early-onset subtype, is under genetic control. TRIB3 inhibits insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and subsequent insulin action. A TRIB3 gain-of-function polymorphism, Q84R (rs2295490), impairs insulin signaling. The objective of the study was to verify the association of TRIB3 Q84R with: 1) T2D, either subtyped or not according to age at diagnosis (early-onset, &lt;45 yr, or &gt;or= 45 yr); 2) insulin secretion and sensitivity in nondiabetic individuals; or 3) in vitro insulin secretion from isolated human islets. Four different case-control samples comprising a total of 5,469 whites were examined. Insulinogenic and insulin sensitivity indexes and their interplay (disposition index) were assessed in 645 nondiabetic individuals at oral glucose tolerance test, glucose (16.7 mmol/liter)-induced in vitro insulin secretion was assessed in islets isolated from 54 nondiabetic donors. In the whole sample, the R84 variant was nominally associated with T2D (odds ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.36, P = 0.04). When stratifying according to age of diabetes onset, R84 carriers had an increased risk of early-onset T2D (odds ratio 1.32, 95% confidence interval 1.10-1.58, P = 0.002). Among 645 nondiabetic subjects, R84 carriers had higher glucose levels (P = 0.005) and lower insulinogenic (P = 0.03) and disposition index (P = 0.02) during the oral glucose tolerance test. R84 islets were more likely to display relatively low glucose-stimulated insulin release (P = 0.04). The TRIB3 R84 variant is associated with early-onset T2D in whites. Alteration in the insulin secretion/insulin sensitivity interplay appears to underlie this association. 	J._Clin._Endocrinol._Metab.	D016428 D052061 D013485
25343008	20141025	NADPH oxidase and the cardiovascular toxicity associated with smoking.	Smoking is one of the most serious but preventable causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Key aspects of pathological process associated with smoking include endothelial dysfunction, a prothrombotic state, inflammation, altered lipid metabolism, and hypoxia. Multiple molecular events are involved in smokinginduced CVD. However, the dysregulations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and metabolism mainly contribute to the development of diverse CVDs, and NADPH oxidase (NOX) has been established as a source of ROS responsible for the pathogenesis of CVD. NOX activation and resultant ROS production by cigarette smoke (CS) treatment have been widely observed in isolated blood vessels and cultured vascular cells, including endothelial and smooth muscle cells. NOX-mediated oxidative stress has also been demonstrated in animal studies. Of the various NOX isoforms, NOX2 has been reported to mediate ROS generation by CS, but other isoforms were not tested thoroughly. Of the many CS constituents, nicotine, methyl vinyl ketone, and ?,?-unsaturated aldehydes, such as, acrolein and crotonaldehyde, appear to be primarily responsible for NOX-mediated cytotoxicity, but additional validation will be needed. Human epidemiological studies have reported relationships between polymorphisms in the CYBA gene encoding p22phox, a catalytic subunit of NOX and susceptibility to smoking-related CVDs. In particular, G allele carriers of A640G and -930(A/G) polymorphisms were found to be vulnerable to smoking-induced cardiovascular toxicity, but results for C242T studies are conflicting. On the whole, evidence implicates the etiological role of NOX in smoking-induced CVD, but the clinical relevance of NOX activation by smoking and its contribution to CVD require further validation in human studies. A detailed understanding of the role of NOX would be helpful to assess the risk of smoking to human health, to define high-risk subgroups, and to develop strategies to prevent or treat smoking-induced CVD.

25624525	20150128	LDLR gene synonymous mutation c.1813C&gt;T results in mRNA splicing variation in a kindred with familial hypercholesterolaemia.	Familial hypercholesterolaemia, one of the most common inherited diseases in the general population, is associated with mutations in at least three different genes including the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB) and protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) genes. In this report, we describe an unclassified DNA variant (c.1813C&gt;T; p.Leu605Leu) within exon 12 of the LDLR gene in a kindred in which familial hypercholesterolaemia is associated with c.1813C&gt;T heterozygosity. In silico analysis suggested that c.1813C&gt;T might affect splicing of the LDLR gene by creating a cryptic donor splice site, which was confirmed by RT-PCR coupled with cDNA sequencing, to result in the loss of 34 base pairs in the coding sequence. The latter truncated mRNA is predicted to generate a frameshift leading to a premature stop at codon 652 and early termination of the low density lipoprotein receptor polypeptide chain, and thus provides a molecular basis for the hypercholesterolaemic phenotype. This case report highlights the emerging utility of RNA studies for the molecular diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia in patients with potential mRNA splicing variants. 	Ann._Clin._Biochem.

18422784	20080422	Functional analysis of single amino-acid mutations in the thrombopoietin-receptor Mpl underlying congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia.	Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT) is a rare disorder that presents with severe thrombocytopenia and absence of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. The disease may develop into bone marrow aplasia. Genetic defects in the gene encoding the thrombopoietin (Tpo) receptor, MPL, are the cause of this disease. In a previous study, we identified four missense mutations in CAMT patients, predicting Arg102Pro, Pro136His, Arg257Cys and Pro635Leu. To investigate whether these mutations result in defective Tpo-binding and/or signalling, full-length wildtype and mutant MPL were transduced into K562 cells. Expression levels and the ability to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase, Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription and phosphoinositide-3 kinase pathways upon Tpo-binding were studied. The results predicted that MPL carrying the P136H or P635L mutation was not properly expressed, whereas the R102P and R257C mutations resulted in impaired signal transduction. Our results indicate that a severe clinical course may be expected when these mutations lead to absent Mpl expression or signalling in CAMT patients with missense mutations. 	Br._J._Haematol.

21350650	20110226	A modified porous titanium sheet prepared by plasma-activated sintering for biomedical applications.	This study aimed to develop a contamination-free porous titanium scaffold by a plasma-activated sintering within an originally developed TiN-coated graphite mold. The surface of porous titanium sheet with or without a coated graphite mold was characterized. The cell adhesion property of porous titanium sheet was also evaluated in this study. The peak of TiC was detected on the titanium sheet processed with the graphite mold without a TiN coating. Since the titanium fiber elements were directly in contact with the carbon graphite mold during processing, surface contamination was unavoidable event in this condition. The TiC peak was not detectable on the titanium sheet processed within the TiN-coated carbon graphite mold. This modified plasma-activated sintering with the TiN-coated graphite mold would be useful to fabricate a contamination-free titanium sheet. The number of adherent cells on the modified titanium sheet was greater than that of the bare titanium plate. Stress fiber formation and the extension of the cells were observed on the titanium sheets. This modified titanium sheet is expected to be a new tissue engineering material in orthopedic bone repair. 	J_Tissue_Eng	D016428
26904102	20160224	Structural and Dynamic Characterization of the C313Y Mutation in Myostatin Dimeric Protein, Responsible for the &quot;Double Muscle&quot; Phenotype in Piedmontese Cattle.	The knowledge of the molecular effects of the C313Y mutation, responsible for the &quot;double muscle&quot; phenotype in Piedmontese cattle, can help understanding the actual mechanism of phenotype determination and paves the route for a better modulation of the positive effects of this economic important phenotype in the beef industry, while minimizing the negative side effects, now inevitably intersected. The structure and dynamic behavior of the active dimeric form of Myostatin in cattle was analyzed by means of three state-of-the-art Molecular Dynamics simulations, 200-ns long, of wild-type and C313Y mutants. Our results highlight a role for the conserved Arg333 in establishing a network of short and long range interactions between the two monomers in the wild-type protein that is destroyed upon the C313Y mutation even in a single monomer. Furthermore, the native protein shows an asymmetry in residue fluctuation that is absent in the double monomer mutant. Time window analysis on further 200-ns of simulation demonstrates that this is a characteristic behavior of the protein, likely dependent on long range communications between monomers. The same behavior, in fact, has already been observed in other mutated dimers. Finally, the mutation does not produce alterations in the secondary structure elements that compose the characteristic TGF-? cystine-knot motif. 	Front_Genet	D016428

19152328	20090120	Cross-linking of a DOPA-containing peptide ligand into its G protein-coupled receptor.	The interaction between a 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) labeled analogue of the tridecapeptide alpha-factor (W-H-W-L-Q-L-K-P-G-Q-P-M-Y) and Ste2p, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), has been analyzed by periodate-mediated cross-linking. Chemically synthesized alpha-factor with DOPA substituting for tyrosine at position 13 and biotin tagged onto lysine(7)([Lys(7)(BioACA),Nle(12),DOPA(13)]alpha-factor; Bio-DOPA-alpha-factor) was used for cross-linking into Ste2p. The biological activity of Bio-DOPA-alpha-factor was about one-third that of native alpha-factor as determined by growth arrest assay and exhibited about a 10-fold lower binding affinity to Ste2p. Bio-DOPA-alpha-factor cross-linked into Ste2p as demonstrated by Western blot analysis using a neutravidin-HRP conjugate to detect Bio-DOPA-alpha-factor. Cross-linking was inhibited by excess native alpha-factor and an alpha-factor antagonist. The Ste2p-ligand complex was purified using a metal ion affinity column, and after cyanogen bromide treatment, avidin affinity purification was used to capture Bio-DOPA-alpha-factor-Ste2p cross-linked peptides. MALDI-TOF spectrometric analyses of the cross-linked fragments showed that Bio-DOPA-alpha-factor reacted with the Phe(55)-Met(69) region of Ste2p. Cross-linking of Bio-DOPA-alpha-factor was reduced by 80% using a cysteine-less Ste2p (Cys59Ser). These results suggest an interaction between position 13 of alpha-factor and residue Cys(59) of Ste2p. This study is the first to report DOPA cross-linking of a peptide hormone to a GPCR and the first to identify a residue-to-residue cross-link between Ste2p and alpha-factor, thereby defining a specific contact point between the bound ligand and its receptor.

19844230	20091022	Myelosuppression and kinase selectivity of multikinase angiogenesis inhibitors.	Myelosuppression has been observed with several multikinase angiogenesis inhibitors in clinical studies, although the frequency and severity varies among the different agents. Inhibitors targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) often inhibit other kinases, which may contribute to their adverse-event profiles. Kinase selectivity of pazopanib, sorafenib, and sunitinib was evaluated in a panel of 242 kinases. Cellular potency was measured using autophosphorylation assays. Effect on human bone marrow progenitor growth in the presence of multiple growth factors was evaluated and correlated with the kinase selectivity. Sunitinib inhibited more kinases than pazopanib and sorafenib, at potencies within 10-fold of VEGFR-2. All three compounds potently inhibited VEGFR-2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta and c-Kit, However, pazopanib was less active against Flt-3 in both kinase and cellular assays. The inhibitory properties of pazopanib, sorafenib, and sunitinib were dependent on the growth factor used to initiate bone marrow colony formation. Addition of stem cell factor and/or Flt-3 ligand with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor resulted in significant shifts in potency for sorafenib and sunitinib but less so for pazopanib. Activity against c-kit and Flt-3 by multikinase angiogenesis inhibitors provide a potential explanation for the differences in myelosuppression observed with these agents in patients.

25266401	20141001	Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke interacts with OPRM1 to modulate dietary preference for fat.	Preference for fatty foods is a risk factor for obesity. It is a complex behaviour that involves the brain reward system and is regulated by genetic and environmental factors, such as the opioid receptor mu-1 gene (OPRM1) and prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking (PEMCS). We examined whether OPRM1 and PEMCS interact in influencing fat intake and whether exposure-associated epigenetic modifications of OPRM1 may mediate this gene-environment interaction. We studied adolescents from a French Canadian genetic founder population, half of whom were exposed prenatally to maternal cigarette smoking. Fat intake was assessed with a 24-hour food recall in the form of a structured interview conducted by a trained nutritionist. The OPRM1 variant rs2281617 was genotyped for the whole sample with the Illumina Human610-Quad and HumanOmniExpress BeadChips. Methylation of blood DNA was assessed at 21 CpGs across OPRM1 in a subset of the sample using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. We included 956 adolescents in our study. In the whole sample, OPRM1 (T carrier in rs2281617) was associated with lower fat intake (-1.6%, p = 0.017), and PEMCS was associated with higher fat intake (+1.6%, p = 0.005). OPRM1 and PEMCS interacted with each other (p = 0.003); the &quot;protective&quot; (fat intake-lowering) allele of OPRM1 was associated with lower fat intake in nonexposed (-3.2%, p &lt; 0.001) but not in exposed individuals (+0.8%, p = 0.42). Further, PEMCS was associated with lower DNA methylation across multiple CpGs across OPRM1 in exposed versus nonexposed individuals (p = 0.031). A limitation of our study was its cross-sectional design. Our study suggests that PEMCS may interact with OPRM1 in increasing fat preference. Silencing of the protective OPRM1 allele in exposed adolescents might be related to epigenetic modification of this gene. 	J_Psychiatry_Neurosci	D016428 D013485
26739444	20160108	Drug resistance characteristics and cluster analysis of M. tuberculosis in Chinese patients with multiple episodes of anti-tuberculosis treatment.	Tuberculosis (TB) patients with multiple episodes of anti-TB treatment represent an important source of TB transmission, as well as a serious threat to the control of drug resistant TB, due to the high risk of multidrug and extensively drug resistance (MDR/XDR) and elongating infectiousness of this patient group. In this study we analyzed the possible risk of development and transmission of MDR and XDR in TB patients with multiple episodes of previous treatment history. The study subjects were pulmonary TB patients who had at least two episodes of previous anti-TB treatment. A total of 166 eligible patients were identified from 10 counties/districts distributed in east, west, north, south and central China. Drug susceptibility test (DST) was performed by proportion method on LJ-media for the 1st line anti-TB drugs and a line probe assay was used to detect mutations related to resistance of the key 2nd-line drugs. Genotyping of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) was performed with MIRU-VNTR and Spoligotyping. Resistances to 1st-line drugs was observed in 122 (73.5%) of the 166 Mtb isolates with 97 (58.4%) being MDR-TB. Mutations relevant to 2nd-line drug resistance was seen in 63 isolates, including 35 MDR-TB isolates (30 pre-XDR, 5 XDR-TB). The Spoligotyping revealed 83.1% Mtb isolates belonged to the Beijing family. The MIRU-VNTR based genotyping revealed 32 (19.3%) of patients were infected with more than one strain. The number of previous TB treatment episode was found being significantly associated with the risk of MDR-TB and XDR-TB. Among the remaining 134 patients infected with a single Mtb strain, MIRU-VNTR revealed a high homogeneity of strain especially within Beijing family despite the polymorphic variations along with geographic locations. The high genetic relatedness and risk of MDR-TB and subsequent pre-XDR and XDR-TB among repeatedly treated patients suggest the establishment of M/XDR Mtb in this specific patient population. It highlights the urgent needs of providing DST of both 1st- and 2nd-line drugs before and during the medication in China's MDR-TB control program. Furthermore, the possibility of infection with multiple strains should also be considered to be associated with the drug resistance, which calls for the modification of treatment regimen.

27166176	20160512	PTPN22 polymorphisms, but not R620W, were associated with the genetic susceptibility of systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis in a Chinese Han population.	The present study aimed to detect a possible association between PTPN22 gene polymorphisms and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a Chinese Han population. 7 PTPN22 SNPs were genotyped in 358 patients with RA and 713 patients with SLE, as well as 564 RA controls and 672 SLE controls by Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP). Association analyses were conducted on the whole data set. Significant relationships were also examined between clinical features and SNPs for both RA and SLE. Rs2476601 was lack of polymorphism with a ?0.1% frequency in both SLE and RA patients and healthy controls in our study. The two SNPs rs1217414 and rs3811021 of PTPN22 shown strong association with both SLE (rs1217414T: padj?=?6.07e-004, OR=0.57; rs3811021C: padj?=?4.68e-005, OR=0.65) and RA (rs1217414T: padj?=?2.01e-008, OR=0.26; rs3811021C: padj?=?0.028, OR=0.70). And the rs3765598 revealed a strong risk factor for SLE (p=9.38e-009, padj?=?6.57e-008, OR=1.93), but not for RA (p=0.48, OR=1.12). Moreover, protective haplotype ACTTC in RA (p=7.73e-016, padj?=?5.51-015, OR[95%CI]=0.02[0.002-0.10]) and SLE (p=8.29e-018, padj?=?5.80e-017, OR[95%CI]=0.11[0.06-0.21]) were observed. In addition, the distribution of risk haplotypes ACGTC and GCTTT in RA (ACGTC: p=0.0006, padj?=?0.004, OR[95%CI]=1.85[1.29-2.63]; GCTTT: p=2.62e-005, padj?=?1.85e-004, OR[95%CI]=2.40[1.57-3.65]) and SLE (ACGTC: p=0.0006, padj?=?0.004, OR[95%CI]=1.85[1.29-2.63]; ACGTC: p=7.74e-011, padj?=?6.81e-010, OR[95%CI]=2.21[1.12-3.34]; GCTTT: p=2.40[1.57-3.65], padj?=?2.26e-006, OR[95%CI]=2.64[1.79-3.87]) were significant different from that in controls. Furthermore, significant association was observed between the PTPN22 rs3765598 and antinuclear antibodies 1 (ANA1) in SLE. Our data provide strong evidence that the rs1217414 and rs3811021 in PTPN22 gene might be common protective factors contributed to SLE and RA susceptibility in the Chinese Han population. While, the rs3765598 might increase the genetic susceptibility of SLE, but not RA. 	Hum._Immunol.	D016428
25206546	20140911	Similarity on neural stem cells and brain tumor stem cells in transgenic brain tumor mouse models.	Although it is believed that glioma is derived from brain tumor stem cells, the source and molecular signal pathways of these cells are still unclear. In this study, we used stable doxycycline-inducible transgenic mouse brain tumor models (c-myc(+)/SV40Tag(+)/Tet-on(+)) to explore the malignant trans-formation potential of neural stem cells by observing the differences of neural stem cells and brain tumor stem cells in the tumor models. Results showed that chromosome instability occurred in brain tumor stem cells. The numbers of cytolysosomes and autophagosomes in brain tumor stem cells and induced neural stem cells were lower and the proliferative activity was obviously stronger than that in normal neural stem cells. Normal neural stem cells could differentiate into glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive and microtubule associated protein-2-positive cells, which were also negative for nestin. However, glial fibrillary acidic protein/nestin, microtubule associated protein-2/nestin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein/microtubule associated protein-2 double-positive cells were found in induced neural stem cells and brain tumor stem cells. Results indicate that induced neural stem cells are similar to brain tumor stem cells, and are possibly the source of brain tumor stem cells. 	Neural_Regen_Res	D016428

Their three-dimensional conformation prompted us to further investigate their potential interest as a preclinical cancer tool. Patient-derived CRC xenografts were used to produce numerous colospheres. Mechanism of formation was elucidated by confocal microscopy. Expression analysis of a panel of 64 selected cancer-related genes by real-time qRT-PCR and hierarchical clustering allowed comparison of colospheres with parent xenografts. In vitro and in vivo assays were performed for migration and chemosensitivity studies. Colospheres, formed by tissue remodelling and compaction, remained viable several weeks in floating conditions, escaping anoikis through their strong cell-cell interactions. Colospheres matched the gene expression profile of the parent xenograft tissue. Colosphere-forming cells migrated in collagen I matrix and metastasised when subrenally implanted in nude mice. Besides, the colosphere responses to 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan, two standard drugs in CRC, reproduced those of the in vivo original xenografts. Colospheres closely mimic biological characteristics of in vivo CRC tumours. Consequently, they would be relevant ex vivo CRC models. 	Br._J._Cancer	D016428 D013485
24711448	20140409	Defective Tibetan PHD2 binding to p23 links high altitude adaption to altered oxygen sensing.	The Tibetan population has adapted to the chronic hypoxia of high altitude. Tibetans bear a genetic signature in the prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2/EGLN1) gene, which encodes for the central oxygen sensor of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. Recent studies have focused attention on two nonsynonymous coding region substitutions, D4E and C127S, both of which are markedly enriched in the Tibetan population. These amino acids reside in a region of PHD2 that harbors a zinc finger, which we have previously discovered binds to a Pro-Xaa-Leu-Glu (PXLE) motif in the HSP90 cochaperone p23, thereby recruiting PHD2 to the HSP90 pathway to facilitate HIF-? hydroxylation. We herein report that the Tibetan PHD2 haplotype (D4E/C127S) strikingly diminishes the interaction of PHD2 with p23, resulting in impaired PHD2 down-regulation of the HIF pathway. The defective binding to p23 depends on both the D4E and C127S substitutions. We also identify a PXLE motif in HSP90 itself that can mediate binding to PHD2 but find that this interaction is maintained with the D4E/C127S PHD2 haplotype. We propose that the Tibetan PHD2 variant is a loss of function (hypomorphic) allele, leading to augmented HIF activation to facilitate adaptation to high altitude. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D052061
21463523	20110406	Immune response CC chemokines CCL2 and CCL5 are associated with pulmonary sarcoidosis.	Pulmonary sarcoidosis involves an intense leukocyte infiltration of the lung with the formation of non-necrotizing granulomas. CC chemokines (chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2)-CCL5) are chemoattractants of mononuclear cells and act through seven transmembrane G-coupled receptors. Previous studies have demonstrated conflicting results with regard to the associations of these chemokines with sarcoidosis. In an effort to clarify previous discrepancies, we performed the largest observational study to date of CC chemokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. BALF chemokine levels from 72 patients affected by pulmonary sarcoidosis were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and compared to 8 healthy volunteers. BALF CCL3 and CCL4 levels from pulmonary sarcoidosis patients were not increased compared to controls. However, CCL2 and CCL5 levels were elevated, and subgroup analysis showed higher levels of both chemokines in all stages of pulmonary sarcoidosis. CCL2, CCL5, CC chemokine receptor type 1 (CCR1), CCR2 and CCR3 were expressed from mononuclear cells forming the lung granulomas, while CCR5 was only found on mast cells. These data suggest that CCL2 and CCL5 are important mediators in recruiting CCR1, CCR2, and CCR3 expressing mononuclear cells as well as CCR5-expressing mast cells during all stages of pulmonary sarcoidosis.

23166849	20121121	Affinity is an important determinant of the anti-trypanosome activity of nanobodies.	The discovery of Nanobodies (Nbs) with a direct toxic activity against African trypanosomes is a recent advancement towards a new strategy against these extracellular parasites. The anti-trypanosomal activity relies on perturbing the highly active recycling of the Variant-specific Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) that occurs in the parasite's flagellar pocket. Here we expand the existing panel of Nbs with anti-Trypanosoma brucei potential and identify four categories based on their epitope specificity. We modified the binding properties of previously identified Nanobodies Nb_An05 and Nb_An33 by site-directed mutagenesis in the paratope and found this to strongly affect trypanotoxicity despite retention of antigen-targeting properties. Affinity measurements for all identified anti-trypanosomal Nbs reveal a strong correlation between trypanotoxicity and affinity (K(D)), suggesting that it is a crucial determinant for this activity. Half maximal effective (50%) affinity of 57 nM was calculated from the non-linear dose-response curves. In line with these observations, Nb humanizing mutations only preserved the trypanotoxic activity if the K(D) remained unaffected. This study reveals that the binding properties of Nanobodies need to be compatible with achieving an occupancy of &gt;95% saturation of the parasite surface VSG in order to exert an anti-trypanosomal activity. As such, Nb-based approaches directed against the VSG target would require binding to an accessible, conserved epitope with high affinity. 	PLoS_Negl_Trop_Dis	D016428 D013485
26955368	20160309	Structural and Enzymatic Characterization of ABgp46, a Novel Phage Endolysin with Broad Anti-Gram-Negative Bacterial Activity.	The present study demonstrates the antibacterial potential of a phage endolysin against Gram-negative pathogens, particularly against multidrug resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii. We have cloned, heterologously expressed and characterized a novel endolysin (ABgp46) from Acinetobacter phage vb_AbaP_CEB1 and tested its antibacterial activity against several multidrug-resistant A. baumannii strains. LC-MS revealed that ABgp46 is an N-acetylmuramidase, that is also active over a broad pH range (4.0-10.0) and temperatures up to 50?C. Interestingly, ABgp46 has intrinsic and specific anti-A. baumannii activity, reducing multidrug resistant strains by up to 2 logs within 2 h. By combining ABgp46 with several organic acids that act as outer membrane permeabilizing agents, it is possible to increase and broaden antibacterial activity to include other Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. In the presence of citric and malic acid, ABgp46 reduces A. baumannii below the detection limit (&gt;5 log) and more than 4 logs Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium strains. Overall, this globular endolysin exhibits a broad and high activity against Gram-negative pathogens, that can be enhanced in presence of citric and malic acid, and be used in human and veterinary medicine.

26899623	20160223	Association Analysis of Interleukin-17 Gene Polymorphisms with the Risk Susceptibility to Tuberculosis.	Recently, many institutions have investigated the associations of interleukin-17 (IL17) polymorphisms with tuberculosis (TB) susceptibility, while those results are inconsistent. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to comprehensively assess whether IL17A rs22275913, IL17F rs763780, and IL17A rs3748067 polymorphisms are correlated with TB risk. Electronic bibliographic databases were searched for case-control studies which potentially focused on the relationship between the aforementioned polymorphisms and TB risk on October 15th, 2015. Pooled odds ratios (OR) combined with 95?% confidence intervals (CI) were employed to assess the associations. There was no significant association of IL-17A rs22275913 polymorphism with susceptibility to TB in Asians or Caucasians. For IL-17A rs3748067 polymorphism, significant associations were observed in Asian (T vs. C: OR 1.461, 95?% CI 1.158-1.844, P?=?0.001; TT vs. CC: OR 1.871, 95?% CI 1.140-3.069, P?=?0.013; TT/TC vs. CC: OR 1.392 95?% CI 1.062-1.825, P?=?0.017; TT vs. OR 1.820, 95?% CI 1.111-2.981, P?=?0.017). For IL-17F rs763780, we detected the significant associations under allele contrast, heterozygote, dominant and recessive models (C vs. T: OR 1.571, 95?% CI 1.352-1.824, P?=?0.000; CT vs. TT: OR 1.624, 95?% CI 1.346-1.958, P?=?0.000; CT/TT vs. TT: OR 1.639, 95?% CI 1.381-1.946, P?=?0.000, respectively). The corresponding results were also detected in Asian populations (C vs. T: OR 1.068, 95?% CI 1.380-1.875, P?=?0.000; CT vs. TT: OR 1.689, 95?% CI 1.390-2.053, P?=?0.000; CT/TT vs. TT: OR 1.695, 95?% CI 1.420-2.023, P?=?0.000), while there were no significant associations in Caucasian. IL-17F rs763780 allele C and IL-17A rs3748067 allele C may be involved in the susceptibility to TB in Asian populations. There were no significant associations between IL-17A rs22275913 polymorphism and risk of TB. 	Lung	D016428 D017418 D016454
20526361	20100608	The GimA locus of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli: does reductive evolution correlate with habitat and pathotype?	IbeA (invasion of brain endothelium), which is located on a genomic island termed GimA, is involved in the pathogenesis of several extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) pathotypes, including newborn meningitic E. coli (NMEC) and avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC). To unravel the phylogeny of GimA and to investigate its island character, the putative insertion locus of GimA was determined via Long Range PCR and DNA-DNA hybridization in 410 E. coli isolates, including APEC, NMEC, uropathogenic (UPEC), septicemia-associated E. coli (SEPEC), and human and animal fecal isolates as well as in 72 strains of the E. coli reference (ECOR) collection. In addition to a complete GimA (approximately 20.3 kb) and a locus lacking GimA we found a third pattern containing a 342 bp remnant of GimA in this strain collection. The presence of GimA was almost exclusively detected in strains belonging to phylogenetic group B2. In addition, the complete GimA was significantly more frequent in APEC and NMEC strains while the GimA remnant showed a higher association with UPEC strains. A detailed analysis of the ibeA sequences revealed the phylogeny of this gene to be consistent with that obtained by Multi Locus Sequence Typing of the strains. Although common criteria for genomic islands are partially fulfilled, GimA rather seems to be an ancestral part of phylogenetic group B2, and it would therefore be more appropriate to term this genomic region GimA locus instead of genomic island. The existence of two other patterns reflects a genomic rearrangement in a reductive evolution-like manner. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
21523436	20110428	Thiodigalactoside inhibits murine cancers by concurrently blocking effects of galectin-1 on immune dysregulation, angiogenesis and protection against oxidative stress.	Cancer cells produce galectin-1 as a tumor promoting protein. Thiodigalactoside (TDG) as a non-metabolised small drug, is shown to suppress tumor growth by inhibiting multiple cancer enhancing activities of galectin-1, including immune cell dysregulation, angiogenesis and protection against oxidative stress. Thus, using B16F10 melanoma and 4T1 orthotopic breast cancer models, intratumoral injection of TDG significantly raised the levels of tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) lymphocytes and reduced CD31(+) endothelial cell content, reducing tumor growth. TDG treatment of tumors in Balb/c nude mice (defective in T cell immunity) reduced angiogenesis and slowed tumor growth by a third less than in immunocompetent mice. Knocking down galectin-1 expression (G1KD) in both cancer cell types significantly impeded tumor growth and the sensitivity of the G1KD tumors to TDG was severely reduced, highlighting a specific role for galectin-1. Endothelial cells were protected by galectin-1 from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis induced by H(2)O(2), but TDG inhibited this antioxidant protective effect of galectin-1 and reduced tube forming activity in angiogenic assays. We show for the first time that the single agent, TDG, concurrently prevents many tumor promoting effects of galectin-1 on angiogenesis, immune dysregulation and protection against oxidative stress, providing a potent and novel small molecule as an anti-cancer drug.

15273104	20040727	Novel azasterols as potential agents for treatment of leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis.	This paper describes the design and evaluation of novel azasterols as potential compounds for the treatment of leishmaniasis and other diseases caused by trypanosomatid parasites. Azasterols are a known class of (S)-adenosyl-L-methionine: Delta24-sterol methyltransferase(24-SMT) inhibitors in fungi, plants, and some parasitic protozoa. The compounds prepared showed activity at micromolar and nanomolar concentrations when tested against Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma spp. The enzymatic and sterol composition studies indicated that the most active compounds acted by inhibiting 24-SMT. The role of the free hydroxyl group at position 3 of the sterol nucleus was also probed. When an acetate was attached to the 3beta-OH, the compounds did not inhibit the enzyme but had an effect on parasite growth and the levels of sterols in the parasite, suggesting that the acetate group was removed in the organism. Thus, an acetate group on the 3beta-OH may have application as a prodrug. However, there may be an additional mode(s) of action for these acetate derivatives. These compounds were shown to have ultrastructural effects on Leishmania amazonensis promastigote membranes, including the plasma membrane, the mitochondrial membrane, and the endoplasmic reticulum. The compounds were also found to be active against the bloodstream form (trypomastigotes) of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, a causative agent of African trypanosomiasis.

19324529	20090328	Cannabis use and age of diagnosis of schizophrenia.	Observational studies have reported earlier onset of psychosis in schizophrenic patients with a history of cannabis use. Earlier age of onset of schizophrenia has been associated with a poorer outcome. We aimed to examine whether cannabis use determined an earlier onset of schizophrenia in a sample of first episode patients, in an area with one of Europe's highest rates of cannabis use. 116 subjects with first episode psychosis and subsequent diagnosis of schizophrenia (after a 12-month follow-up) were included Age at first antipsychotic treatment (A1T) was used as proxy for age of psychosis onset, and acted as dependent variable for the statistical analysis. Cannabis use was evaluated retrospectively, and divided into three groups according to peak frequency (never, sporadic/frequent, daily). 46 (39.7%) subjects had never used cannabis, 23 (19.9%) had done so sporadically/frequently, and 47 (40.5%) daily. A1T differed between the three groups (mean, in years and [SD]: 27.0 [4.94]; 25.7 [4.44] and 24.5 [4.36]; p=0.033) and diminished as cannabis use increased (linear tendency; p=0.009). Post-hoc analysis showed that cannabis use (irrespective of frequency) was significantly associated with decrease in A1T (p=0.033), as shown by the first contrast [1 -1/2 -1/2]. Post-hoc contrast showed that cannabis users had a significantly lower age of onset of psychosis (mean decrease, in years: 1.93; CI (confidence interval) 95%: 0.17-3.70; p=0.033). Cannabis use was significantly associated with a decrease in age of onset of schizophrenia. Age of onset of the disease correlated with frequency of cannabis use. 	Eur._Psychiatry	D016428 D013485
15561970	20041125	Variation in the interleukin-6 receptor gene associates with type 2 diabetes in Danish whites.	Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in the pathophysiology of various human diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. IL-6 signals via a heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of a soluble IL-6 alpha-subunit (IL-6 receptor [IL6R]) and a signal transducing subunit (gp130). The IL6R gene maps to an important candidate locus for type 2 diabetes on chromosome 1q21. An Asp358Ala polymorphism of the IL6R has been reported to associate with obesity in Pima Indians. We investigated the Asp358Ala polymorphism in relation to type 2 diabetes, obesity, and other pre-diabetic quantitative traits among Danish whites. By applying a recessive genetic model in a case-control study of 1,349 type 2 diabetic patients and 4,596 glucose-tolerant control subjects, we found a significant difference in genotype distribution (P = 0.008) and in allele frequency (Ala-allele 38.3% [95% CI 36.5-40.1] in diabetic subjects vs. 41.2% [40.2-42.2] in control subjects; P = 0.007). The odds ratio for the Asp/Asp carriers versus Ala/Ala carriers was 1.38 (1.09-1.71). Among 4,251 middle-aged glucose-tolerant subjects, the Asp358Ala polymorphism was not associated with estimates of obesity, post-oral glucose tolerance test serum insulin release, or the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index. In conclusion, the Asp358Ala polymorphism of the IL6R associates with type 2 diabetes in Danish whites. 	Diabetes	D016428 D013485
27863435	20161119	Myb expression is critical for myeloid leukemia development induced by Setbp1 activation.	SETBP1 missense mutations have been frequently identified in multiple myeloid neoplasms; however, their oncogenic potential remains unclear. Here we show that expression of Setbp1 mutants carrying two such mutations in mouse bone marrow progenitors efficiently induced development of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) in irradiated recipient mice with significantly shorter latencies and greater penetrance than expression of wild-type Setbp1, suggesting that these mutations are highly oncogenic. The increased oncogenicity of Setbp1 missense mutants could be due in part to their capability to drive significantly higher target gene transcription. We further identify Myb as a critical mediator of Setbp1-induced self-renewal as its knockdown caused efficient differentiation of myeloid progenitors immortalized by wild-type Setbp1 and Setbp1 missense mutants. Interestingly, Myb is also a direct transcriptional target of Setbp1 and Setbp1 missense mutants as they directly bind to the Myb locus in immortalized cells and dramatically activate a critical enhancer/promoter region of Myb in luciferase reporter assays. Furthermore, Myb knockdown in Setbp1 and Setbp1 missense mutations-induced AML cells also efficiently induced their differentiation in culture and significantly prolonged the survival of their secondary recipient mice, suggesting that targeting MYB pathway could be a promising strategy for treating human myeloid neoplasms with SETBP1 activation.

12208875	20020905	Constitutive activation of the SRC family kinase Hck results in spontaneous pulmonary inflammation and an enhanced innate immune response.	To identify the physiological role of Hck, a functionally redundant member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases expressed in myelomonocytic cells, we generated Hck(F/F) &quot;knock-in&quot; mice which carry a targeted tyrosine (Y) to phenylalanine (F) substitution of the COOH-terminal, negative regulatory Y(499)-residue in the Hck protein. Unlike their Hck(-/-) &quot;loss-of-function&quot; counterparts, Hck(F/F) &quot;gain-of-function&quot; mice spontaneously acquired a lung pathology characterized by extensive eosinophilic and mononuclear cell infiltration within the lung parenchyma, alveolar airspaces, and around blood vessels, as well as marked epithelial mucus metaplasia in conducting airways. Lungs from Hck(F/F) mice showed areas of mild emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis, which together with inflammation resulted in altered lung function and respiratory distress in aging mice. When challenged transnasally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Hck(F/F) mice displayed an exaggerated pulmonary innate immune response, characterized by excessive release of matrix metalloproteinases and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha. Similarly, Hck(F/F) mice were highly sensitive to endotoxemia after systemic administration of LPS, and macrophages and neutrophils derived from Hck(F/F) mice exhibited enhanced effector functions in vitro (e.g., nitric oxide and TNFalpha production, chemotaxis, and degranulation). Based on the demonstrated functional association of Hck with leukocyte integrins, we propose that constitutive activation of Hck may mimic adhesion-dependent priming of leukocytes. Thus, our observations collectively suggest an enhanced innate immune response in Hck(F/F) mice thereby skewing innate immunity from a reversible physiological host defense response to one causing irreversible tissue damage.

21503378	20110420	Use of monoclonal faecal elastase-1 concentration for pancreatic status assessment in cystic fibrosis patients.	To assess the concentration of faecal elastase-1 (EL-1) in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis with mutation DeltaF508. Cross-sectional study with samples collected consecutively from 51 patients aged 4 months to 17 years old (mean 9.11?4.74); 32 (62.8%) patients were male. Clinical-demographic data were collected, as well as data on the type of mutation. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency was established by the activity of faecal EL-1 &lt;?200 ?g/g. EL-1 was quantified through the monoclonal ELISA method (ScheBo Biotech AG, Germany). Pancreatic supplements were used in 46 (90.2%) patients. Forty-one (80.4%) patients presented with pancreatic insufficiency (EL-1 fecal &lt; 100 ?g/g): 17 (41.5%) were homozygous, 14 were heterozygous (34.1%) and 10 were non-DeltaF508 (24.4%). Regarding the mutation, there was a statistically significant association of homozygosity with faecal EL-1 concentration &lt; 100??g/g (p = 0.010). All patients considered to be pancreatic insufficient?(n = 41) by the test were using pancreatic supplements. Ten (19.6%) presented faecal EL-1 &gt; 200 ?g/g, and 5/10 (50%) used enzymes. The activity of faecal EL-1 &lt; 100 ?g/g, indicating pancreatic insufficiency, was observed in 17/17 (100%) of homozygous patients, as expected, and was less frequent in patients who were heterozygous for DeltaF508 and in patients without the mutation. There was no association of faecal EL-1 concentration with age and sex of patients. The test was standardized, is easy to execute, and can be used to assess the pancreatic status of patients with cystic fibrosis. 	J_Pediatr_(Rio_J)	D016428 D013485
22641774	20120530	The Arabidopsis central vacuole as an expression system for intracellular transporters: functional characterization of the Cl-/H+ exchanger CLC-7.	Functional characterization of intracellular transporters is hampered by the inaccessibility of animal endomembranes to standard electrophysiological techniques. Here, we used Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts as a novel heterologous expression system for the lysosomal chloride?proton exchanger CLC-7 from rat. Following transient expression of a rCLC-7:EGFP construct in isolated protoplasts, the fusion protein efficiently targeted to the membrane of the large central vacuole, the lytic compartment of plant cells. Membrane currents recorded from EGFP-positive vacuoles were almost voltage independent and showed time-dependent activation at elevated positive membrane potentials as a hallmark. The shift in the reversal potential of the current induced by a decrease of cytosolic pH was compatible with a 2Cl(-)/1H(+) exchange stoichiometry. Mutating the so-called gating glutamate into alanine (E245A) uncoupled chloride fluxes from the movement of protons, transforming the transporter into a chloride channel-like protein. Importantly, CLC-7 transport activity in the vacuolar expression system was recorded in the absence of the auxiliary subunit Ostm1, differently to recent data obtained in Xenopus oocytes using a CLC-7 mutant with partial plasma membrane expression. We also show that plasma membrane-targeted CLC-7(E245A) is non-functional in Xenopus oocytes when expressed without Ostm1. In summary, our data suggest the existence of an alternative CLC-7 operating mode, which is active when the protein is not in complex with Ostm1. The vacuolar expression system has the potential to become a valuable tool for functional studies on intracellular ion channels and transporters from animal cells. 	J._Physiol._(Lond.)

22536352	20120427	De novo transcriptomic analysis of an oleaginous microalga: pathway description and gene discovery for production of next-generation biofuels.	Eustigmatos cf. polyphem is a yellow-green unicellular soil microalga belonging to the eustimatophyte with high biomass and considerable production of triacylglycerols (TAGs) for biofuels, which is thus referred to as an oleaginous microalga. The paucity of microalgae genome sequences, however, limits development of gene-based biofuel feedstock optimization studies. Here we describe the sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly for a non-model microalgae species, E. cf. polyphem, and identify pathways and genes of importance related to biofuel production. We performed the de novo assembly of E. cf. polyphem transcriptome using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. In a single run, we produced 29,199,432 sequencing reads corresponding to 2.33 Gb total nucleotides. These reads were assembled into 75,632 unigenes with a mean size of 503 bp and an N50 of 663 bp, ranging from 100 bp to &gt;3,000 bp. Assembled unigenes were subjected to BLAST similarity searches and annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthology identifiers. These analyses identified the majority of carbohydrate, fatty acids, TAG and carotenoids biosynthesis and catabolism pathways in E. cf. polyphem. Our data provides the construction of metabolic pathways involved in the biosynthesis and catabolism of carbohydrate, fatty acids, TAG and carotenoids in E. cf. polyphem and provides a foundation for the molecular genetics and functional genomics required to direct metabolic engineering efforts that seek to enhance the quantity and character of microalgae-based biofuel feedstock.

15221901	20040629	Detection of ganciclovir resistance after valacyclovir-prophylaxis in renal transplant recipients with active cytomegalovirus infection.	Whether valaciclovir (VCV) prophylaxis could be responsible for ganciclovir (GCV)-resistance of Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in transplantation has never been documented. A multicentric retrospective pilot study was undertaken to detect GCV-resistance through mutations within the UL97 gene in renal transplant recipients who experienced active HCMV infection and received valacyclovir prophylaxis. Twenty-three patients who experienced HCMV antigenaemia or DNAemia during or at the end of prophylaxis were included. UL97 genotyping was carried out on peripheral blood samples, using a nested in-house PCR, which amplified the full-length UL97 gene. One patient has a resistance-related mutation (M460I); the major risk factor for emergence of resistance in this patient was the presence of early and persistent antigenaemia. GCV-resistance during VCV-prophylaxis was rare after renal transplantation. However, special attention must be paid to patients developing early active HCMV infection under prophylaxis.

The association between CYP17A1 T-34C polymorphism and endometrial cancer risk has been inconsistent and underpowered. To clarify the effect of CYP17A1 T-34C polymorphism on the risk of endometrial cancer, a meta-analysis of all available studies relating CYP17A1 T-34C polymorphism to the risk of endometrial cancer was conducted. The authors searched PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and VisionCite databases updated on March 2013. Data were extracted by two independent authors and pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) was calculated. Finally, seven studies with 1,570 endometrial cancer cases and 2,474 controls were included in the meta-analysis. There was no statistically significant association between CYP17A1 T-34C polymorphism and endometrial cancer under heterogeneous codominant model (OR = 0.91, 95 %CI = 0.68-1.21). Although CYP17A1 T-34C polymorphism was marginally associated with endometrial cancer risk under homogeneous codominant model (OR = 0.69, 95 %CI = 0.49-0.99), the significant association was not stable after sensitivity analysis. We concluded that CYP17A1 T-34C polymorphism might not be one risk factor in the carcinogenesis of endometrial cancer. Further large and well-designed studies are needed to confirm this association.

24886140	20140603	LC3, an autophagosome marker, is expressed on oligodendrocytes in Nasu-Hakola disease brains.	Nasu-Hakola disease (NHD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sclerosing leukoencephalopathy and multifocal bone cysts, caused by a loss-of-function mutation of either DAP12 or TREM2. TREM2 and DAP12 constitute a receptor/adaptor signaling complex expressed exclusively on osteoclasts, dendritic cells, macrophages, and microglia. Neuropathologically, NHD exhibits profound loss of myelin and accumulation of axonal spheroids, accompanied by intense gliosis accentuated in the white matter of the frontal and temporal lobes. At present, the molecular mechanism responsible for development of leukoencephalopathy in NHD brains remains totally unknown. By immunohistochemistry, we studied the expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), an autophagosome marker, in 5 NHD and 12 control brains. In all NHD brains, Nogo-A-positive, CNPase-positive oligodendrocytes surviving in the non-demyelinated white matter intensely expressed LC3. They also expressed ubiquitin, ubiquilin-1, and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) but did not express Beclin 1 or sequestosome 1 (p62). Substantial numbers of axonal spheroids were also labeled with LC3 in NHD brains. In contrast, none of oligodendrocytes expressed LC3 in control brains. Furthermore, surviving oligodendrocytes located at the demyelinated lesion edge of multiple sclerosis (MS) did not express LC3, whereas infiltrating Iba1-positive macrophages and microglia intensely expressed LC3 in MS lesions. These results propose a novel hypothesis that aberrant regulation of autophagy might induce oligodendrogliopathy causative of leukoencephalopathy in NHD brains. 	Orphanet_J_Rare_Dis	D016428 D013485
22519865	20120424	A case-control nutrigenomic study on the synergistic activity of folate and vitamin B12 in cervical cancer progression.	The present study was designed to identify the role of folate, B12, homocysteine, and polymorphisms of methylene tetrahydrofolatereductase (MTHFR) gene in cervical carcinogenesis among 322 women from Kerala, South India. Serum folate, vitamin B12 (chemiluminescence assay), and homocysteine (EIA) along with genetic polymorphisms of MTHFR gene (polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism) were analyzed for 136 control subjects, 92 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) subjects, and 94 invasive cervical cancer cases (ICC). Statistically significant associations between MTHFR polymorphisms, serum homocysteine, and folate levels with cervical carcinogenesis were not evident, but we found that these parameters acted as effect modifiers of serum vitamin B12. The risk estimates observed for B12 became prominent only when there was a deficiency in serum folate levels [LSIL-odds ratio (OR): 14.9 (95% CI: 2.65 to 84.4); ICC-OR = 8.72 (95% CI = 1.55 to 48.8)] or when MTHFR A1298C polymorphic variant was present [LSIL-OR = 9.8 (95% CI = 2.61 to 36.7); ICC-OR = 10.0 (95%CI = 2.5 to 39.3)]. The statistical significance of this effect modification was further studied using an interaction model, where only folate was observed to have an influence on B12 levels as suggested by the odds ratio of 7.11 (95% CI = 0.45 to 111.9) obtained for ICC group, implicating a synergistic role of these 2 vitamins in invasive cervical cancer.

25809654	20150327	[Diagnostic molecular pathology of lymphatic and myeloid neoplasms].	Molecular pathology has been an integral part of the diagnostics of tumors of the hematopoietic system substantially longer than for solid neoplasms. In contrast to solid tumors, the primary objective of molecular pathology in hematopoietic neoplasms is not the prediction of drug efficacy but the diagnosis itself by excluding reactive proliferation and by using molecular features for tumor classification. In the case of malignant lymphomas, the most commonly applied molecular tests are those for gene rearrangements for immunoglobulin heavy chains and T-cell receptors. However, this article puts the focus on new and diagnostically relevant assays in hematopathology. Among these are mutations of MYD88 codon 265 in lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas, B-raf V600E in hairy cell leukemia and Stat3 exon 21 in indolent T-cell lymphomas. In myeloproliferative neoplasms, MPL W515, calreticulin exon?9 and the BCR-ABL and JAK2 V617F junctions are the most frequently analyzed differentiation series. In myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative neoplasms, SRSF2, SETBP1 and CSF3R mutations provide important differential diagnostic information. Genes mutated in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are particularly diverse but their analysis significantly improves the differential diagnostics between reactive conditions and MDS. The most frequent changes in MDS include mutations of TET2 and various genes encoding splicing factors. 	Pathologe	D004740 D016428 D016454
17264123	20070201	Sumoylation delays the ATF7 transcription factor subcellular localization and inhibits its transcriptional activity.	Over the past few years, small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification has emerged as an important regulator of diverse pathways and activities including protein localization and transcriptional regulation. We identified a consensus sumoylation motif (IKEE), located within the N-terminal activation domain of the ATF7 transcription factor and thus investigated the role of this modification. ATF7 is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor, homologous to ATF2, that binds to CRE elements within specific promoters. This protein is able to heterodimerize with Jun or Fos proteins and its transcriptional activity is mediated by interaction with TAF12, a subunit of the general transcription factor TFIID. In the present article, we demonstrate that ATF7 is sumoylated in vitro (using RanBP2 as a E3-specific ligase) and in vivo. Moreover, we show that ATF7 sumoylation affects its intranuclear localization by delaying its entry into the nucleus. Furthermore, SUMO conjugation inhibits ATF7 transactivation activity by (i) impairing its association with TAF12 and (ii) blocking its binding-to-specific sequences within target promoters.

22367614	20120228	Differential degradation of full-length and cleaved ataxin-7 fragments in a novel stable inducible SCA7 model.	Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is one of nine neurodegenerative disorders caused by expanded polyglutamine repeats, and a common toxic gain-of-function mechanism has been proposed. Proteolytic cleavage of several polyglutamine proteins has been identified and suggested to modulate the polyglutamine toxicity. In this study, we show that full-length and cleaved fragments of the SCA7 disease protein ataxin-7 (ATXN7) are differentially degraded. We found that the ubiquitin-proteosome system (UPS) was essential for the degradation of full-length endogenous ATXN7 or transgenic full-length ATXN7 with a normal or expanded glutamine repeat in both HEK 293T and stable PC12 cells. However, a similar contribution by UPS and autophagy was found for the degradation of proteolytically cleaved ATXN7 fragments. Furthermore, in our novel stable inducible PC12 model, induction of mutant ATXN7 expression resulted in toxicity and this toxicity was worsened by inhibition of either UPS or autophagy. In contrast, pharmacological activation of autophagy could ameliorate the ATXN7-induced toxicity. Based on our findings, we propose that both UPS and autophagy are important for the reduction of mutant ataxin-7-induced toxicity, and enhancing ATXN7 clearance through autophagy could be used as a potential therapeutic strategy in SCA7.

27580028	20160901	A PGC1?-mediated transcriptional axis suppresses melanoma metastasis.	Melanoma is the deadliest form of commonly encountered skin cancer because of its rapid progression towards metastasis. Although metabolic reprogramming is tightly associated with tumour progression, the effect of metabolic regulatory circuits on metastatic processes is poorly understood. PGC1? is a transcriptional coactivator that promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, protects against oxidative stress and reprograms melanoma metabolism to influence drug sensitivity and survival. Here, we provide data indicating that PGC1? suppresses melanoma metastasis, acting through a pathway distinct from that of its bioenergetic functions. Elevated PGC1? expression inversely correlates with vertical growth in human melanoma specimens. PGC1? silencing makes poorly metastatic melanoma cells highly invasive and, conversely, PGC1? reconstitution suppresses metastasis. Within populations of melanoma cells, there is a marked heterogeneity in PGC1? levels, which predicts their inherent high or low metastatic capacity. Mechanistically, PGC1? directly increases transcription of ID2, which in turn binds to and inactivates the transcription factor TCF4. Inactive TCF4 causes downregulation of metastasis-related genes, including integrins that are known to influence invasion and metastasis. Inhibition of BRAFV600Eusing vemurafenib, independently of its cytostatic effects, suppresses metastasis by acting on the PGC1?-ID2-TCF4-integrin axis. Together, our findings reveal that PGC1? maintains mitochondrial energetic metabolism and suppresses metastasis through direct regulation of parallel acting transcriptional programs. Consequently, components of these circuits define new therapeutic opportunities that may help to curb melanoma metastasis. 	Nature	D016428
16545551	20060321	Co-expression of different subunits of human phenylalanine hydroxylase: evidence of negative interallelic complementation.	To study the interaction between two different subunits of the heteromeric human phenylalanine hydroxylase (hPAH), present in hyperphenylalaninemic (HPA) compound heterozygous patients, heteroallelic hPAH enzymes were produced. A dual vector expression system was used (PRO Bacterial Expression System) in which each mutant subunit was expressed from a separate compatible vector, with different epitope tags, in a single bacterial host. Experimental conditions were selected in order that each plasmid produced equivalent levels of mutant subunits. In this study, we demonstrated that both subunits were expressed and that the purified heteroallelic enzymes, were catalytically active. As expected, the produced proteins displayed enzymatic activities levels lower than the predicted catalytic activity, calculated by averaging in vitro PAH activities from both alleles, and were strongly dependent on the proteins subunit composition. The obtained data suggest that interactions between the studied hPAH subunits, namely the I65T, R261Q, R270K and V388M, and the wild-type protein occurred. As postulated, this phenomenon could be a source of phenotypic variation in genetic diseases involving multimeric proteins. 	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D013485
23108104	20121031	Urinary conjugated ?-tocopheronolactone--a biomarker of oxidative stress in children with type 1 diabetes.	Increased oxidative stress has been implicated in both the onset and the progression of diabetes mellitus and its complications. The development of easy to measure biomarkers of oxidative stress would, therefore, help in determining in a prospective manner the impact of glycemic control on oxidative stress and macrovascular disease in patients with diabetes. We report the development and validation of a novel method to directly measure the urinary concentrations of the conjugated metabolites of vitamin E (?-tocopherol) and investigate whether the oxidized metabolite ?-tocopheronolactone (?-TL) could be used as a biomarker of oxidative stress in children with type 1 diabetes. A novel method using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed and used to measure directly and rapidly the urinary concentrations of the glucuronidated and sulfated metabolites of ?-tocopherol in 32 young patients with type 1 diabetes and age-matched controls. The mean concentrations of the glucuronidated and sulfated conjugates of ?-TL were all highly significantly increased in the children with type 1 diabetes (p&lt;0.001). The results suggest that the measurement of the urinary concentrations of ?-TL conjugates may provide a useful biomarker of oxidative stress in diabetes and possibly in other clinical conditions in which oxidative stress has been implicated.

21205326	20110106	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers in relation to autism and developmental delay: a case-control study.	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are flame retardants used widely and in increasing amounts in the U.S. over the last few decades. PBDEs and their metabolites cross the placenta and studies in rodents demonstrate neurodevelopmental toxicity from prenatal exposures. PBDE exposures occur both via breastfeeding and hand-to-mouth activities in small children. Participants were 100 children from the CHARGE (CHildhood Autism Risk from Genetics and the Environment) Study, a case-control epidemiologic investigation of children with autism/autism spectrum disorder, with developmental delay and from the general population. Diagnoses of autism were confirmed by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and Autism Diagnostic Inventory-Revised, and of developmental delay using the Mullen's Scales of Early Learning and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales. Typically developing controls were those with no evidence of delay, autism, or autism spectrum disorder. Eleven PBDE congeners were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry from serum specimens collected after children were assessed. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between plasma PBDEs and autism. Children with autism/autism spectrum disorder and developmental delay were similar to typically developing controls for all PBDE congeners, but levels were high for all three groups. Plasma samples collected post-diagnosis in this study may not represent early life exposures due to changes in diet and introduction of new household products containing PBDEs. Studies with direct measurements of prenatal or infant exposures are needed to assess the possible causal role for these compounds in autism spectrum disorders.

22639582	20120529	Protein-Protein Interaction Network and Subcellular Localization of the Arabidopsis Thaliana ESCRT Machinery.	The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) consists of several multi-protein subcomplexes which assemble sequentially at the endosomal surface and function in multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis. While ESCRT has been relatively well characterized in yeasts and mammals, comparably little is known about ESCRT in plants. Here we explored the yeast two-hybrid protein interaction network and subcellular localization of the Arabidopsis thaliana ESCRT machinery. We show that the Arabidopsis ESCRT interactome possesses a number of protein-protein interactions that are either conserved in yeasts and mammals or distinct to plants. We show also that most of the Arabidopsis ESCRT proteins examined at least partially localize to MVBs in plant cells when ectopically expressed on their own or co-expressed with other interacting ESCRT proteins, and some also induce abnormal MVB phenotypes, consistent with their proposed functional role(s) as part of the ESCRT machinery in Arabidopsis. Overall, our results help define the plant ESCRT machinery by highlighting both conserved and unique features when compared to ESCRT in other evolutionarily diverse organisms, providing a foundation for further exploration of ESCRT in plants.

10413112	19990721	Mutagenesis and crystallographic studies of Zymomonas mobilis tRNA-guanine transglycosylase to elucidate the role of serine 103 for enzymatic activity.	The tRNA modifying enzyme tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) is involved in the exchange of guanine in the first position of the anticodon with preQ1 as part of the biosynthesis of the hypermodified base queuine (Q). Mutation of Ser90 to an alanine in Escherichia coli TGT leads to a dramatic reduction of enzymatic activity (Reuter, K. et al. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 7041-7046). To further clarify the role of this residue in the catalytic center, we have mutated the corresponding Ser103 of the crystallizable Zymomonas mobilis TGT into alanine. The crystal structure of a TGT(S103A)/preQ1 complex combined with biochemical data presented in this paper suggest that Ser103 is essential for substrate orientation in the TGT reaction. 	FEBS_Lett.

16410393	20060118	Effects of Delta1 and Jagged1 on early human hematopoiesis: correlation with expression of notch signaling-related genes in CD34+ cells.	It has been shown that Notch signaling mediated by ligands of both Jagged and Delta families expands the hematopoietic stem cell compartment while blocking or delaying terminal myeloid differentiation. Here we show that Delta1- and Jagged1-expressing stromal cells have distinct effects on the clonogenic and differentiation capacities of human CD34(+) CD38(+) cells. Jagged1 increases the number of bipotent colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) and unipotent progenitors (CFU-granulocytes and CFU-macrophages), without quantitatively affecting terminal cell differentiation, whereas Delta1 reduces the number of CFU-GM and differentiated monocytic cells. Expression analysis of genes coding for Notch receptors, Notch targets, and Notch signaling modulators in supernatant CD34(+) cells arising upon contact with Jagged1 and Delta1 shows dynamic and differential gene expression profiles over time. At early time points, modest upregulation of Notch1, Notch3, and Hes1 was observed in Jagged1-CD34(+) cells, whereas those in contact with Delta1 strikingly upregulated Notch3 and Hes1. Later, myeloid progenitors with strong clonogenic potential emerging upon contact with Jagged1 upregulated Notch1 and Deltex and downregulated Notch signaling modulators, whereas T/NK progenitors originated by Delta1 strikingly upregulated Notch3 and Deltex and, to a lesser extent, Hes1, Lunatic Fringe, and Numb. Together, the data unravel previously unrecognized expression patterns of Notch signaling-related genes in CD34(+) CD38(+) cells as they develop in Jagged1- or Delta1-stromal cell environments, which appear to reflect sequential maturational stages of CD34(+) cells into distinct cell lineages.

10427702	19990731	Indispensable glutamic acid residue-139 of NtpK proteolipid in the reaction of vacuolar Na(+)-translocating ATPase in Enterococcus hirae.	Enterococcus hirae vacuolar ATPase catalyzes translocation of Na+ or Li+ coupled with ATP hydrolysis. It is suggested that the glutamic acid residue (Glu139) of NtpK proteolipid subunit of this multisubunit enzyme is the binding site of these ions for translocation. Here we established a complementation system for the ntpK gene with its deletion mutant, and found that the ATPase activity disappeared upon replacement of Glu139 by aspartic acid. The side-chain length of this acidic residue of NtpK is thus important for this ATPase reaction. 	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 D013485
26266953	20150813	The Beta Cell in Its Cluster: Stochastic Graphs of Beta Cell Connectivity in the Islets of Langerhans.	Pancreatic islets of Langerhans consist of endocrine cells, primarily ?, ? and ? cells, which secrete glucagon, insulin, and somatostatin, respectively, to regulate plasma glucose. ? cells form irregular locally connected clusters within islets that act in concert to secrete insulin upon glucose stimulation. Due to the central functional significance of this local connectivity in the placement of ? cells in an islet, it is important to characterize it quantitatively. However, quantification of the seemingly stochastic cytoarchitecture of ? cells in an islet requires mathematical methods that can capture topological connectivity in the entire ?-cell population in an islet. Graph theory provides such a framework. Using large-scale imaging data for thousands of islets containing hundreds of thousands of cells in human organ donor pancreata, we show that quantitative graph characteristics differ between control and type 2 diabetic islets. Further insight into the processes that shape and maintain this architecture is obtained by formulating a stochastic theory of ?-cell rearrangement in whole islets, just as the normal equilibrium distribution of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process can be viewed as the result of the interplay between a random walk and a linear restoring force. Requiring that rearrangements maintain the observed quantitative topological graph characteristics strongly constrained possible processes. Our results suggest that ?-cell rearrangement is dependent on its connectivity in order to maintain an optimal cluster size in both normal and T2D islets. 	PLoS_Comput._Biol.	D016428 D052060

25469793	20141204	Association of polymorphisms in interleukin (IL)-12A and -B genes with rheumatoid arthritis in a Chinese population.	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by synovial infiltrates and progressive cell-mediated destruction of the joints, which results in significant disability and early mortality. Genetic factors may play an important role in the development of RA. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of common polymorphisms in interleukin (IL)-12A and IL-12B genes with RA in a Chinese Han population. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL-12 genes were genotyped in 412 patients with RA and 279 control subjects using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Our data showed that IL-12B gene SNPs?rs3212227 and rs6887695 were observed as a risk factor of RA. The minor allele (C) frequency of IL-12B gene rs3212227 and rs6887695 increased the risk of RA. Individuals carrying the rs3212227/rs6887695 C/C haplotype were associated with a significantly increased risk of RA. RA patients with the C allele of IL-12B gene rs6887695 was a protective factor to erosive arthropathy. Carriers of the C allele of IL-12B gene rs3212227 were significantly more likely to be RF-positive. No significant association was observed between rs2243115 in IL-12A and RA, due probably to the limited power. These results suggest that common variants in IL-12B may contribute to the development of RA in the Chinese population. 	Clin._Exp._Immunol.	D016428 D016448 D016449 D013485
22916230	20120824	Combined species identification, genotyping, and drug resistance detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures by MLPA on a bead-based array.	The population structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is typically clonal therefore genotypic lineages can be unequivocally identified by characteristic markers such as mutations or genomic deletions. In addition, drug resistance is mainly mediated by mutations. These issues make multiplexed detection of selected mutations potentially a very powerful tool to characterise Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We used Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to screen for dispersed mutations, which can be successfully applied to Mycobacterium tuberculosis as was previously shown. Here we selected 47 discriminative and informative markers and designed MLPA probes accordingly to allow analysis with a liquid bead array and robust reader (Luminex MAGPIX technology). To validate the bead-based MLPA, we screened a panel of 88 selected strains, previously characterised by other methods with the developed multiplex assay using automated positive and negative calling. In total 3059 characteristics were screened and 3034 (99.2%) were consistent with previous molecular characterizations, of which 2056 (67.2%) were directly supported by other molecular methods, and 978 (32.0%) were consistent with but not directly supported by previous molecular characterizations. Results directly conflicting or inconsistent with previous methods, were obtained for 25 (0.8%) of the characteristics tested. Here we report the validation of the bead-based MLPA and demonstrate its potential to simultaneously identify a range of drug resistance markers, discriminate the species within the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, determine the genetic lineage and detect and identify the clinically most relevant non-tuberculous mycobacterial species. The detection of multiple genetic markers in clinically derived Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains with a multiplex assay could reduce the number of TB-dedicated screening methods needed for full characterization. Additionally, as a proportion of the markers screened are specific to certain Mycobacterium tuberculosis lineages each profile can be checked for internal consistency. Strain characterization can allow selection of appropriate treatment and thereby improve treatment outcome and patient management. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
18854826	20081016	PTCH mutations in basal cell carcinomas from azathioprine-treated organ transplant recipients.	The immunosuppressant azathioprine is used to prevent graft rejection after organ transplantation. To investigate whether azathioprine-associated mutagenesis contributes to the high incidence of skin tumours in organ transplant recipients (OTRs), we analysed PTCH gene mutations in 60 basal cell carcinomas (BCC); 39 from OTRs receiving azathioprine and 21 from individuals never exposed to azathioprine. PTCH was mutated in 55% of all tumours, independent of azathioprine treatment. In both the azathioprine and non-azathioprine groups, transitions at dipyrimidine sequences, considered to indicate mutation by ultraviolet-B radiation, occurred frequently in tumours from chronically sun-exposed skin. In BCC from non-sun-exposed skin of azathioprine-treated patients, there was an over-representation of unusual G:C to A:T transitions at non-dipyrimidine sites. These were exclusive to the azathioprine-exposed group and all in the same TGTC sequence context at different positions within PTCH. Meta-analysis of 247 BCCs from published studies indicated that these mutations are rare in sporadic BCC and had never previously been reported in this specific sequence context. This study of post-transplant BCC provides the first indication that azathioprine exposure may be associated with PTCH mutations, particularly in tumours from non-sun-exposed skin.

23705005	20130525	Evolution of smooth tubercle Bacilli PE and PE_PGRS genes: evidence for a prominent role of recombination and imprint of positive selection.	PE and PE_PGRS are two mycobateria-restricted multigene families encoding membrane associated and secreted proteins that have expanded mainly in the pathogenic species, notably the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). Several lines of evidence attribute to PE and PE_PGRS genes critical roles in mycobacterial pathogenicity. To get more insight into the nature of these genes, we sought to address their evolutionary trajectories in the group of smooth tubercle bacilli (STB), the putative ancestor of the clonal MTBC. By focussing on six polymorphic STB PE/PE_PGRS genes, we demonstrate significant incongruence among single gene genealogies and detect strong signals of recombination using various approaches. Coalescent-based estimation of population recombination and mutation rates (? and ?, respectively) indicates that the two mechanisms are of roughly equal importance in generating diversity (?/??=?1.457), a finding in a marked contrast to house keeping genes (HKG) whose evolution is chiefly brought about by mutation (?/??=?0.012). In comparison to HKG, we found 15 times higher mean rate of nonsynonymous substitutions, with strong evidence of positive selection acting on PE_PGRS62 (dN/dS?=?1.42), a gene that has previously been shown to be essential for mycobacterial survival in macrophages and granulomas. Imprint of positive selection operating on specific amino acid residues or along branches of PE_PGRS62 phylogenetic tree was further demonstrated using maximum likelihood- and covarion-based approaches, respectively. Strikingly, PE_PGR62 proved highly conserved in present-day MTBC strains. Overall the data indicate that, in STB, PE/PE_PGRS genes have undergone a strong diversification process that is speeded up by recombination, with evidence of positive selection. The finding that positive selection involved an essential PE_PGRS gene whose sequence appears to be driven to fixation in present-day MTBC strains lends further support to the critical role of PE/PE_PGRS genes in the evolution of mycobacterial pathogenicity.

8599675	19951201	Spectroscopic studies of a phosphoinositide-binding peptide from gelsolin: behavior in solutions of mixed solvent and anionic micelles.	The peptide G(150-169) corresponds to a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and filamentous actin (F-actin) binding site on gelsolin (residues 150-169, with the sequence KHVVPNEVVVQRLFQVKGRR). The conformation of this peptide in trifluoroethanol (TFE) aqueous solution was determined by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance as the first step toward understanding the structural aspects of the interaction of G(150-169) and PIP2. The circular dichroism experiments show that G(150-169) adopts a predominantly alpha-helical form in both 50% TFE aqueous solution and in the presence of PIP2 micelles, therefore establishing a connection between the two conformations. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance experiments of G(150-169) in TFE co-solvent show that the helical region extends from Pro-154 to Lys-166. The amphiphilic nature of this helical structure may be the key to understanding the binding of the peptide to lipids. Sodium dodecyl sulfate micelle solution is used as a model for anionic lipid environments. Preliminary studies of the conformation of G(150-169) in sodium dodecyl sulfate micelle solution show that the peptide forms an alpha-helix similar to but with some structural differences from that in TFE co-solvent. Fluorescence experiments provide evidence of peptide clustering over a narrow range of peptide/PIP2 ratios, which is potentially relevant to the biological function of PIP2. 	Biophys._J.

19196960	20090207	Disruption of the M80-Fe ligation stimulates the translocation of cytochrome c to the cytoplasm and nucleus in nonapoptotic cells.	Native cytochrome c (cyt c) has a compact tertiary structure with a hexacoordinated heme iron and functions in electron transport in mitochondria and apoptosis in the cytoplasm. However, the possibility that protein modifications confer additional functions to cyt c has not been explored. Disruption of methionine 80 (M80)-Fe ligation of cyt c under nitrative stress has been reported. To model this alteration and determine if it confers new properties to cyt c, a cyt c mutant (M80A) was constitutively expressed in cells. M80A-cyt c has increased peroxidase activity and is spontaneously released from mitochondria, translocating to the cytoplasm and nucleus in the absence of apoptosis. Moreover, M80A models endogenously nitrated cyt c because nitration of WT-cyt c is associated with its translocation to the cytoplasm and nucleus. Further, M80A cyt c may up-regulate protective responses to nitrative stress. Our findings raise the possibility that endogenous protein modifications that disrupt the M80-Fe ligation (such as tyrosine nitration) stimulate nuclear translocation and confer new functions to cyt c in nonapoptotic cells.

15500688	20041027	Killing Bugs at the Bedside: a prospective hospital survey of how frequently personal digital assistants provide expert recommendations in the treatment of infectious diseases.	Personal Digital Assistants (PDAS) are rapidly becoming popular tools in the assistance of managing hospitalized patients, but little is known about how often expert recommendations are available for the treatment of infectious diseases in hospitalized patients. To determine how often PDAs could provide expert recommendations for the management of infectious diseases in patients admitted to a general medicine teaching service. Prospective observational cohort study Internal medicine resident teaching service at an urban hospital in Dayton, Ohio 212 patients (out of 883 patients screened) were identified with possible infectious etiologies as the cause for admission to the hospital. Patients were screened prospectively from July 2002 until October 2002 for infectious conditions as the cause of their admissions. 5 PDA programs were assessed in October 2002 to see if treatment recommendations were available for managing these patients. The programs were then reassessed in January 2004 to evaluate how the latest editions of the software would perform under the same context as the previous year. PDAs provided treatment recommendations in at least one of the programs for 100% of the patients admitted over the 4 month period in the 2004 evaluation. Each of the programs reviewed improved from 2002 to 2004, with five of the six programs offering treatment recommendations for over 90% of patients in the study.

9488482	19980306	Evidence for direct physical association between a K+ channel (Kir6.2) and an ATP-binding cassette protein (SUR1) which affects cellular distribution and kinetic behavior of an ATP-sensitive K+ channel.	Structurally unique among ion channels, ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels are essential in coupling cellular metabolism with membrane excitability, and their activity can be reconstituted by coexpression of an inwardly rectifying K+ channel, Kir6.2, with an ATP-binding cassette protein, SUR1. To determine if constitutive channel subunits form a physical complex, we developed antibodies to specifically label and immunoprecipitate Kir6.2. From a mixture of Kir6.2 and SUR1 in vitro-translated proteins, and from COS cells transfected with both channel subunits, the Kir6.2-specific antibody coimmunoprecipitated 38- and 140-kDa proteins corresponding to Kir6.2 and SUR1, respectively. Since previous reports suggest that the carboxy-truncated Kir6.2 can form a channel independent of SUR, we deleted 114 nucleotides from the carboxy terminus of the Kir6.2 open reading frame (Kir6.2deltaC37). Kir6.2deltaC37 still coimmunoprecipitated with SUR1, suggesting that the distal carboxy terminus of Kir6.2 is unnecessary for subunit association. Confocal microscopic images of COS cells transfected with Kir6.2 or Kir6.2deltaC37 and labeled with fluorescent antibodies revealed unique honeycomb patterns unlike the diffuse immunostaining observed when cells were cotransfected with Kir6.2-SUR1 or Kir6.2deltaC37-SUR1. Membrane patches excised from COS cells cotransfected with Kir6.2-SUR1 or Kir6.2deltaC37-SUR1 exhibited single-channel activity characteristic of pancreatic KATP channels. Kir6.2deltaC37 alone formed functional channels with single-channel conductance and intraburst kinetic properties similar to those of Kir6.2-SUR1 or Kir6.2deltaC37-SUR1 but with reduced burst duration. This study provides direct evidence that an inwardly rectifying K+ channel and an ATP-binding cassette protein physically associate, which affects the cellular distribution and kinetic behavior of a KATP channel.

19272164	20090311	Global comparative transcriptome analysis of cartilage formation in vivo.	During vertebrate embryogenesis the initial stages of bone formation by endochondral ossification involve the aggregation and proliferation of mesenchymal cells into condensations. Continued growth of the condensations and differentiation of the mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes results in the formation of cartilage templates, or anlagen, which prefigure the shape of the future bones. The chondrocytes in the anlagen further differentiate by undergoing a complex sequence of maturation and hypertrophy, and are eventually replaced by mineralized bone. Regulation of the onset of chondrogenesis is incompletely understood, and would be informed by comprehensive analyses of in vivo gene expression. Tibial and fibular pre-condensed mesenchyme was microdissected from mouse hind limbs at 11.5 dpc, and the corresponding condensations at 12.5 dpc and cartilage anlagen at 13.5 dpc. Total RNA was isolated, and cRNA generated by linear amplification was interrogated using mouse whole genome microarrays. Differential expression was validated by quantitative PCR for Agc1, Bmp8a, Col2a1, Fgfr4, Foxa3, Gdf5, Klf2, Klf4, Lepre1, Ncad, Sox11, and Trpv4. Further, independent validation of the microarray data was achieved by in situ hybridization to analyse the expression of Lepre1, Pcdh8, Sox11, and Trpv4 from 11.5 dpc to 13.5 dpc during mouse hind limb development. We found significant differential expression of 931 genes during these early stages of chondrogenesis. Of these, 380 genes were down-regulated and 551 up-regulated. Our studies characterized the expression pattern of gene families previously associated with chondrogenesis, such as adhesion molecules, secreted signalling molecules, transcription factors, and extracellular matrix components. Gene ontology approaches identified 892 differentially expressed genes not previously identified during the initiation of chondrogenesis. These included several Bmp, Gdf, Wnt, Sox and Fox family members. These data represent the first global gene expression profiling analysis of chondrogenic tissues during in vivo development. They identify genes for further study on their functional roles in chondrogenesis, and provide a comprehensive and important resource for future studies on cartilage development and disease.

10752623	20000407	Structural similarities and differences in Staphylococcus aureus exfoliative toxins A and B as revealed by their crystal structures.	Staphylococcal aureus epidermolytic toxins (ETs) A and B are responsible for the induction of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, a disease of neonates and young children. The clinical features of this syndrome vary from localized blisters to severe exfoliation affecting most of the body surface. Comparison of the crystal structures of two subtypes of ETs-rETA (at 2.0 A resolution), rETB (at 2.8 A resolution), and an active site variant of rETA, Ser195Ala at 2.0 A resolution has demonstrated that their overall topology resembles that of a &quot;trypsin-like&quot; serine protease, but with significant differences at the N- and C-termini and loop regions. The details of the catalytic site in both ET structures are very similar to those in glutamate-specific serine proteases, suggesting a common catalytic mechanism. However, the &quot;oxyanion hole,&quot; which is part of the catalytic sites of glutamate specific serine proteases, is in the closed or inactive conformation for rETA, yet in the open or active conformation for rETB. The ETs contain a unique amphipathic helix at the N-terminus, and it appears to be involved in optimizing the conformation of the catalytic site residues. Determination of the structure of the rETA catalytic site variant, Ser195Ala, showed no significant perturbation at the active site, establishing that the loss of biological and esterolytic activity can be attributed solely to disruption of the catalytic serine residue. Finally, the crystal structure of ETs, together with biochemical data and mutagenesis studies, strongly confirms the classification of these molecules as &quot;serine proteases&quot; rather than &quot;superantigens.&quot; 	Protein_Sci.

23189200	20121129	Characterization of a new Vaccinia virus isolate reveals the C23L gene as a putative genetic marker for autochthonous Group 1 Brazilian Vaccinia virus.	Since 1999, several Vaccinia virus (VACV) isolates, the etiological agents of bovine vaccinia (BV), have been frequently isolated and characterized with various biological and molecular methods. The results from these approaches have grouped these VACV isolates into two different clusters. This dichotomy has elicited debates surrounding the origin of the Brazilian VACV and its epidemiological significance. To ascertain vital information to settle these debates, we and other research groups have made efforts to identify molecular markers to discriminate VACV from other viruses of the genus Orthopoxvirus (OPV) and other VACV-BR groups. In this way, some genes have been identified as useful markers to discriminate between the VACV-BR groups. However, new markers are needed to infer ancestry and to correlate each sample or group with its unique epidemiological and biological features. The aims of this work were to characterize a new VACV isolate (VACV DMTV-2005) molecularly and biologically using conserved and non-conserved gene analyses for phylogenetic inference and to search for new genes that would elucidate the VACV-BR dichotomy. The VACV DMTV-2005 isolate reported in this study is biologically and phylogenetically clustered with other strains of Group 1 VACV-BR, the most prevalent VACV group that was isolated during the bovine vaccinia outbreaks in Brazil. Sequence analysis of C23L, the gene that encodes for the CC-chemokine-binding protein, revealed a ten-nucleotide deletion, which is a new Group 1 Brazilian VACV genetic marker. This deletion in the C23L open reading frame produces a premature stop-codon that is shared by all Group 1 VACV-BR strains and may also reflect the VACV-BR dichotomy; the deletion can also be considered to be a putative genetic marker for non-virulent Brazilian VACV isolates and may be used for the detection and molecular characterization of new isolates.

23542690	20130402	Strengthening the accumbal indirect pathway promotes resilience to compulsive cocaine use.	A hallmark of addiction is the loss of control over drug intake, which is seen in only a fraction of those exposed to stimulant drugs such as cocaine. The cellular mechanisms underlying vulnerability or resistance to compulsive drug use remain unknown. We found that individual variability in the development of highly motivated and perseverative behavior toward cocaine is associated with synaptic plasticity in medium spiny neurons expressing dopamine D2 receptors (D2-MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice. Potentiation of glutamatergic inputs onto indirect pathway D2-MSNs was associated with resilience toward compulsive cocaine seeking. Inhibition of D2-MSNs using a chemicogenetic approach enhanced the motivation to obtain cocaine, whereas optogenetic activation of D2-MSNs suppressed cocaine self-administration. These results indicate that recruitment of D2-MSNs in NAc functions to restrain cocaine self-administration and serves as a natural protective mechanism in drug-exposed individuals. 	Nat._Neurosci.

26063955	20150612	Dynamic Changes, Cut-Off Points, Sensitivity, and Specificity of Laboratory Data to Differentiate Macrophage Activation Syndrome from Active Disease.	To compare the laboratory data and changes in these data between patients with MAS and patients with flare-up of the autoimmune diseases. In a prospective study, the static laboratory data and dynamic changes in the selected data in 17 consecutive patients with MAS and 53 patients with active disease of SJIA, PJIA, Kawasaki disease, and SLE were compared. The ROC curve analysis was used to evaluate cut-off points, sensitivity, and specificity of the static and dynamic laboratory data to differentiate between MAS and active disease. In the MAS group, the mean CRP3, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, ferritin, LDH, PT, PTT, and INR were significantly higher and the mean WBC2, PMN2, Lymph2, Hgb1, 2, 3, ESR2, serum albumin, and sodium were significantly lower than in control group. Some of the important cut-off points were PLT2 &lt; 209000/microliter, AST &gt; 38.5, ALT &gt; 38, WBC &lt; 8200 ? 103/UL, ferritin &gt; 5277 ng/mL. The dynamic changes in some laboratory data, especially PLT, can differentiate between MAS and active disease. The changes in WBC, PMN, and ESR and the levels of the liver enzymes may also be helpful in the early differentiation. Very high levels of ferritin may also help the diagnosis along with other clinical and laboratory signs. 	Dis._Markers	D016428
27656899	20160923	Microbiome Composition and Function Drives Wound-Healing Impairment in the Female Genital Tract.	The mechanism(s) by which bacterial communities impact susceptibility to infectious diseases, such as HIV, and maintain female genital tract (FGT) health are poorly understood. Evaluation of FGT bacteria has predominantly been limited to studies of species abundance, but not bacterial function. We therefore sought to examine the relationship of bacterial community composition and function with mucosal epithelial barrier health in the context of bacterial vaginosis (BV) using metaproteomic, metagenomic, and in vitro approaches. We found highly diverse bacterial communities dominated by Gardnerella vaginalis associated with host epithelial barrier disruption and enhanced immune activation, and low diversity communities dominated by Lactobacillus species that associated with lower Nugent scores, reduced pH, and expression of host mucosal proteins important for maintaining epithelial integrity. Importantly, proteomic signatures of disrupted epithelial integrity associated with G. vaginalis-dominated communities in the absence of clinical BV diagnosis. Because traditional clinical assessments did not capture this, it likely represents a larger underrepresented phenomenon in populations with high prevalence of G. vaginalis. We finally demonstrated that soluble products derived from G. vaginalis inhibited wound healing, while those derived from L. iners did not, providing insight into functional mechanisms by which FGT bacterial communities affect epithelial barrier integrity.

27994913	20161221	Evaluation of MIF -173 G/C Polymorphism in Turkish Patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis.	Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease mainly affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints. Macrophage migration inhibitory(MIF)factor is a regulatory cytokine that inhibits random immune cell migration. MIF gene promoter polymorphisms play a role in the progression of several inflammatory disorders. To investigate the relationship between theMIF gene -173 G/Csingle-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and AS. Cross-sectional study. In this study, a total of 161 AS and 194 normal controls were recruited. The MIF gene -173 G/C SNP was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction using the restriction fragment length polymorphism method. There was no significant difference between groups in terms of genotype distribution (p&gt;0.05). When wild-type G/G and G/C+C/C genotypes are compared in terms of clinical characteristics, there is a significant difference between the average age and the duration of disease in AS patients (p&lt;0.05). No significant relationship between AS disease andMIF -173 G/Cpolymorphism was found.MIF -173 G/Cpolymorphism (C allele) may affect the time of onset and the duration of disease in AS patients.

21454592	20110402	Binding affinity and specificity of neuromyelitis optica autoantibodies to aquaporin-4 M1/M23 isoforms and orthogonal arrays.	Autoantibodies against astrocyte water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) are highly specific for the neuroinflammatory disease neuromyelitis optica (NMO). We measured the binding of NMO autoantibodies to AQP4 in human astrocyte-derived U87MG cells expressing M1 and/or M23 AQP4, or M23 mutants that do not form orthogonal array of particles (OAPs). Binding affinity was quantified by two-color fluorescence ratio imaging of cells stained with NMO serum or a recombinant monoclonal NMO autoantibody (NMO-rAb), together with a C terminus anti-AQP4 antibody. NMO-rAb titrations showed binding with dissociation constants down to 44 ? 7 nm. Different NMO-rAbs and NMO patient sera showed a wide variation in NMO-IgG binding to M1 versus M23 AQP4. Differences in binding affinity rather than stoichiometry accounted for M1 versus M23 binding specificity, with consistently greater affinity of NMO-IgG binding to M23 than M1 AQP4. Binding and OAP measurements in cells expressing different M1:M23 ratios or AQP4 mutants indicated that the differential binding of NMO-IgG to M1 versus M23 was due to OAP assembly rather than to differences in the M1 versus M23 N termini. Purified Fab fragments of NMO-IgG showed similar patterns of AQP4 isoform binding, indicating that structural changes in the AQP4 epitope upon array assembly, and not bivalent cross-linking of whole IgG, result in the greater binding affinity to OAPs. Our study establishes a quantitative assay of NMO-IgG binding to AQP4 and indicates remarkable, OAP-dependent heterogeneity in NMO autoantibody binding specificity. 	J._Biol._Chem.

27679561	20160929	A Case for Microtubule Vulnerability in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Altered Dynamics During Disease.	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an aggressive multifactorial disease converging on a common pathology: the degeneration of motor neurons (MNs), their axons and neuromuscular synapses. This vulnerability and dysfunction of MNs highlights the dependency of these large cells on their intracellular machinery. Neuronal microtubules (MTs) are intracellular structures that facilitate a myriad of vital neuronal functions, including activity dependent axonal transport. In ALS, it is becoming increasingly apparent that MTs are likely to be a critical component of this disease. Not only are disruptions in this intracellular machinery present in the vast majority of seemingly sporadic cases, recent research has revealed that mutation to a microtubule protein, the tubulin isoform TUBA4A, is sufficient to cause a familial, albeit rare, form of disease. In both sporadic and familial disease, studies have provided evidence that microtubule mediated deficits in axonal transport are the tipping point for MN survivability. Axonal transport deficits would lead to abnormal mitochondrial recycling, decreased vesicle and mRNA transport and limited signaling of key survival factors from the neurons peripheral synapses, causing the characteristic peripheral &quot;die back&quot;. This disruption to microtubule dependant transport in ALS has been shown to result from alterations in the phenomenon of microtubule dynamic instability: the rapid growth and shrinkage of microtubule polymers. This is accomplished primarily due to aberrant alterations to microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) that regulate microtubule stability. Indeed, the current literature would argue that microtubule stability, particularly alterations in their dynamics, may be the initial driving force behind many familial and sporadic insults in ALS. Pharmacological stabilization of the microtubule network offers an attractive therapeutic strategy in ALS; indeed it has shown promise in many neurological disorders, ALS included. However, the pathophysiological involvement of MTs and their functions is still poorly understood in ALS. Future investigations will hopefully uncover further therapeutic targets that may aid in combating this awful disease. 	Front_Cell_Neurosci	D016428 D016454

Genetic analysis of an XY newborn with hypospadias and micropenis. Puberty developed spontaneously with a rise in T levels and normal LH contrasting with high FSH and low inhibin B concentrations, revealing a Sertoli cell defect. None. NR5A1/SF-1 gene molecular analysis. Genetic analysis identified a new NR5A1/SF-1 mutation, c.842G&gt;C (p.Arg281Pro). In vitro functional studies showed that the p.Arg281Pro mutant mainly altered Sertoli cell function, as observed in vivo with a high FSH level and low inhibin B concentration contrasting with normal LH concentration. The mutation was found in the father's DNA at a low copy number through direct sequencing and high-resolution melting assay, suggesting mosaicism. We describe a new heterozygous NR5A1/SF-1 mutation that mainly altered Sertoli cell function. However, this 46,XY disorders of sex development (DSD) boy had no M?llerian derivatives, suggesting normal Sertoli cell function during fetal life. During puberty, Sertoli cell deficiency became more apparent.

14605329	20031108	Safety profile of tissue plasminogen activator treatment among stroke patients carrying a common polymorphism (C-1562T) in the promoter region of the matrix metalloproteinase-9 gene.	Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression, related to blood-brain barrier disruption, has been implicated in the appearance of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) after tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment in stroke patients. Because an in vitro functional polymorphism of the promoter region of MMP-9 gene (C-1562T) has been described, we hypothesize that patients carrying this mutation might have higher MMP-9 levels and greater susceptibility to developing HT when receiving tPA. We studied strokes involving the middle cerebral artery territory of 61 patients who received tPA &lt;3 hours after stroke onset. Blood samples were obtained before tPA administration. Plasmatic MMP-9 determinations were performed (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ng/mL), and C-1562T genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction. Healthy age-matched control subjects were used to study allele distribution (n=59). Hemorrhagic events were classified according to CT criteria (petechial hemorrhagic infarctions [HI,1 to 2] and large parenchymal hemorrhages [PH,1 to 2]). Allele distribution was similar in patients and control subjects (CC/CT/TT: 72.3/27.7/0% versus 79.7/20.3/0%, respectively; P=0.37). Among patients, mutation carriers (CT/TT alleles) had similar rates of HT and PH than noncarriers (HT: 23.1% versus 38.2%, P=0.49; PH: 15.4% versus 17.6%, P=1.0). Although the highest MMP-9 level corresponded to patients who later developed a PH (PH, 191.4 ng/mL; non-PH, 68.05 ng/mL; P=0.022), no relation between MMP-9 mutation presence and plasmatic levels was found (CC, 127.12 ng/mL; CT/TT, 46.31 ng/mL; P=0.11). Although MMP-9 level predicts PH appearance after tPA treatment, no relationship exists with the C-1562T polymorphism, probably because this mutation is not functional in response to cerebral ischemia in vivo.

27861640	20161119	Association of High-Density Lipoprotein Subclasses with Chronic Kidney Disease Progression, Atherosclerosis, and Klotho.	Atherosclerosis is often a complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) because of dyslipidemia and CKD-mineral and bone disorder. High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are grouped into various subclasses composed of multiple proteins and lipids, and their transformation is altered in CKD. We investigated the roles of lipoprotein subclasses in CKD progression, and atherosclerosis, and the relationships with Klotho and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23. Seventy-one CKD patients were enrolled in this prospective cohort study in Japan. The proportions of cholesterol level to total cholesterol level (cholesterol proportion) and lipoprotein particle numbers in 20 lipoprotein fractions were measured by a newly developed high-performance gel permeation chromatography. Diabetic nephropathy was observed in 23.9% of the patients. The mean age was 75.0 years and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 17.2 ml/min./1.73m2. The lipoprotein particle numbers in small HDLs were higher in Stage 4 group than in Stage 5 group (p = 0.002). Multivariate regression analysis adjusted for baseline characteristics showed that the cholesterol proportions in very small HDLs were associated with eGFR change rate [F19 ? = -17.63, p = 0.036] and ABI [F19 ? = 0.047, p = 0.047] in Stage 4 group, and that serum soluble ?-Klotho level was associated with the lipoprotein particle numbers in very small HDLs [F19 ? = 0.00026, p = 0.012; F20 ? = 0.00041, p = 0.036] in Stage 5 group. This study showed that HDL subclasses are associated with CKD progression, ABI, and Klotho level in CKD-stage-specific manner. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428
23900199	20130801	Exome sequencing identifies RDH12 compound heterozygous mutations in a family with severe retinitis pigmentosa.	Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most prevalent type of inherited retinal degeneration and one of the commonest causes of genetically determined visual dysfunction worldwide. To date, approximately 35 genes have been associated with nonsyndromic autosomal recessive RP (arRP), however the small contribution of each gene to the total prevalence of arRP and the lack of a clear genotype-phenotype correlation complicate the genetic analysis in affected patients. Next generation sequencing technologies are powerful and cost-effective methods for detecting causative mutations in both sporadic and familial RP cases. A Mexican family with 5 members affected from arRP was studied. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination. Molecular methods included genome-wide SNP homozygosity mapping, exome sequencing analysis, and Sanger-sequencing confirmation of causal mutations. No regions of shared homozygosity among affected subjects were identified. Exome sequencing in a single patient allowed the detection of two missense mutations in the RDH12 gene: a c.446T&gt;C transition predicting a novel p.L149P substitution, and a c.295C&gt;A transversion predicting a previously reported p.L99I replacement. Sanger sequencing confirmed that all affected subjects carried both RDH12 mutations. This study adds to the molecular spectrum of RDH12-related retinopathy and offers an additional example of the power of exome sequencing in the diagnosis of recessively inherited retinal degenerations.

24676280	20140329	The Fanconi anemia group C protein interacts with uncoordinated 5A and delays apoptosis.	The Fanconi anemia group C protein (FANCC) is one of the several proteins that comprise the Fanconi anemia (FA) network involved in genomic surveillance. FANCC is mainly cytoplasmic and has many functions, including apoptosis suppression through caspase-mediated proteolytic processing. Here, we examined the role of FANCC proteolytic fragments by identifying their binding partners. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with caspase-mediated FANCC cleavage products and identified the dependence receptor uncoordinated-5A (UNC5A) protein. Here, we show that FANCC physically interacts with UNC5A, a pro-apoptotic dependence receptor. FANCC interaction occurs through the UNC5A intracellular domain, specifically via its death domain. FANCC modulates cell sensitivity to UNC5A-mediated apoptosis; we observed reduced UNC5A-mediated apoptosis in the presence of FANCC and increased apoptosis in FANCC-depleted cells. Our results show that FANCC interferes with UNC5A's functions in apoptosis and suggest that FANCC may participate in developmental processes through association with the dependence receptor UNC5A.

21923838	20110920	DNA polymorphisms and tissue cyclooxygenase-2 expression in oral lichen planus: a case-control study.	Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory disorder defined as a precancerous condition. Special attention has been paid to the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and its potential role in development of oral squamous cell carcinoma. The identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms that affect gene function or expression and contribute to disease predisposition has become a major area of investigation toward understanding the mechanisms for cancer. The objective of this study is to investigate the association between the COX-2 765G&gt;C gene polymorphism, tissue COX-2 expression and the development of OLP as a chronic inflammatory condition. This study was done on 50 patients with OLP and 50 healthy controls. COX-2 activity was assessed by measuring tissue prostaglandin E (PGE)2 levels by enzyme immunometric assay kit. COX-2 765G&gt;C gene polymorphism was assessed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by restricted fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). OLP patients showed statistically significant higher mean PGE2 than the control group. We did not observe any statistically significant differences in genotype distribution or allele frequency between the patients and the control group (P &gt; 0.05). Odds ratio showed no statistically significant association between COX-2 765G&gt;C polymorphism and lichen planus. The present evidence thus indicates that variation in the COX-2 gene is unlikely to be of relevance to the aetiology of OLP. As this is the first report concerning the COX-2 -765G&gt;C gene polymorphism and the risk of OLP, additional studies with larger sample size will be required to confirm these findings.

23035691	20121006	Analysis of the Lactobacillus casei supragenome and its influence in species evolution and lifestyle adaptation.	The broad ecological distribution of L. casei makes it an insightful subject for research on genome evolution and lifestyle adaptation. To explore evolutionary mechanisms that determine genomic diversity of L. casei, we performed comparative analysis of 17 L. casei genomes representing strains collected from dairy, plant, and human sources. Differences in L. casei genome inventory revealed an open pan-genome comprised of 1,715 core and 4,220 accessory genes. Extrapolation of pan-genome data indicates L. casei has a supragenome approximately 3.2 times larger than the average genome of individual strains. Evidence suggests horizontal gene transfer from other bacterial species, particularly lactobacilli, has been important in adaptation of L. casei to new habitats and lifestyles, but evolution of dairy niche specialists also appears to involve gene decay. Genome diversity in L. casei has evolved through gene acquisition and decay. Acquisition of foreign genomic islands likely confers a fitness benefit in specific habitats, notably plant-associated niches. Loss of unnecessary ancestral traits in strains collected from bacterial-ripened cheeses supports the hypothesis that gene decay contributes to enhanced fitness in that niche. This study gives the first evidence for a L. casei supragenome and provides valuable insights into mechanisms for genome evolution and lifestyle adaptation of this ecologically flexible and industrially important lactic acid bacterium. Additionally, our data confirm the Distributed Genome Hypothesis extends to non-pathogenic, ecologically flexible species like L. casei. 	BMC_Genomics	D016428 D013485 D013486
24761828	20140426	Kinetic mechanism at the branchpoint between the DNA synthesis and editing pathways in individual DNA polymerase complexes.	Exonucleolytic editing of incorrectly incorporated nucleotides by replicative DNA polymerases (DNAPs) plays an essential role in the fidelity of DNA replication. Editing requires that the primer strand of the DNA substrate be transferred between the DNAP polymerase and exonuclease sites, separated by a distance that is typically on the order of ~30 ?. Dynamic transitions between functional states can be quantified with single-nucleotide spatial precision and submillisecond temporal resolution from ionic current time traces recorded when individual DNAP complexes are held atop a nanoscale pore in an electric field. In this study, we have exploited this capability to determine the kinetic relationship between the translocation step and primer strand transfer between the polymerase and exonuclease sites in complexes formed between the replicative DNAP from bacteriophage ?29 and DNA. We demonstrate that the pathway for primer strand transfer from the polymerase to exonuclease site initiates prior to the translocation step, while complexes are in the pre-translocation state. We developed a mathematical method to determine simultaneously the forward and reverse translocation rates and the rates of primer strand transfer in both directions between the polymerase and the exonuclease sites, and we have applied it to determine these rates for ?29 DNAP complexes formed with a DNA substrate bearing a fully complementary primer-template duplex. This work provides a framework that will be extended to determine the kinetic mechanisms by which incorporation of noncomplementary nucleotides promotes primer strand transfer from the polymerase site to the exonuclease site.

20405931	20100422	Mass spectrometry following mild enzymatic digestion reveals phosphorylation of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli through mechanisms involving direct nucleotide binding.	A straightforward method using mild enzymatic digestions combined with MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) was used to enhance determination of the multiple phosphorylation sites of a set of recombinant nucleotide-binding proteins in Escherichia coli, including kinases and cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) domain containing proteins. The protein kinases reveal abundant phosphorylations in the kinase domains and relatively low phosphogluconoylation (258 Da) at the N-terminal His-tag. In contrast, the CBS domain-containing proteins possess a highly conserved phosphorylation in vivo at Ser-2 of the His-tag. Multistage MS/MS and selected reaction monitoring established that the CBS domain proteins also contain a combined modification of gluconoylation (178 Da) and phosphorylation (80 Da) at two different sites, instead of an isobaric phosphogluconoylation (258 Da) event at the N-terminus. Functional analysis of 20 recombinant proteins as identified by mass spectrometry has shown the phosphorylation at the N-terminal His-tag is relevant to nucleotide binding and phosphotransfer reaction catalyzed by a serine protein kinase.

26528989	20151104	Fish Synucleins: An Update.	Synucleins (syns) are a family of proteins involved in several human neurodegenerative diseases and tumors. Since the first syn discovery in the brain of the electric ray Torpedo californica, members of the same family have been identified in all vertebrates and comparative studies have indicated that syn proteins are evolutionary conserved. No counterparts of syns were found in invertebrates suggesting that they are vertebrate-specific proteins. Molecular studies showed that the number of syn members varies among vertebrates. Three genes encode for ?-, ?- and ?-syn in mammals and birds. However, a variable number of syn genes and encoded proteins is expressed or predicted in fish depending on the species. Among biologically verified sequences, four syn genes were identified in fugu, encoding for ?, ? and two ? (?1 and ?2) isoforms, whereas only three genes are expressed in zebrafish, which lacks ?-syn gene. The list of &quot;non verified&quot; sequences is much longer and is often found in sequence databases. In this review we provide an overview of published papers and known syn sequences in agnathans and fish that are likely to impact future studies in this field. Indeed, fish models may play a key role in elucidating some of the molecular mechanisms involved in physiological and pathological functions of syn proteins. 	Mar_Drugs	D016428 D013485 D016454
22881342	20120814	Melanopsin gene variations interact with season to predict sleep onset and chronotype.	The human melanopsin gene has been reported to mediate risk for seasonal affective disorder (SAD), which is hypothesized to be caused by decreased photic input during winter when light levels fall below threshold, resulting in differences in circadian phase and/or sleep. However, it is unclear if melanopsin increases risk of SAD by causing differences in sleep or circadian phase, or if those differences are symptoms of the mood disorder. To determine if melanopsin sequence variations are associated with differences in sleep-wake behavior among those not suffering from a mood disorder, the authors tested associations between melanopsin gene polymorphisms and self-reported sleep timing (sleep onset and wake time) in a community sample (N = 234) of non-Hispanic Caucasian participants (age 30-54 yrs) with no history of psychological, neurological, or sleep disorders. The authors also tested the effect of melanopsin variations on differences in preferred sleep and activity timing (i.e., chronotype), which may reflect differences in circadian phase, sleep homeostasis, or both. Daylength on the day of assessment was measured and included in analyses. DNA samples were genotyped for melanopsin gene polymorphisms using fluorescence polarization. P10L genotype interacted with daylength to predict self-reported sleep onset (interaction p &lt;?.05). Specifically, sleep onset among those with the TT genotype was later in the day when individuals were assessed on longer days and earlier in the day on shorter days, whereas individuals in the other genotype groups (i.e., CC and CT) did not show this interaction effect. P10L genotype also interacted in an analogous way with daylength to predict self-reported morningness (interaction p &lt;?.05). These results suggest that the P10L TT genotype interacts with daylength to predispose individuals to vary in sleep onset and chronotype as a function of daylength, whereas other genotypes at P10L do not seem to have effects that vary by daylength. A better understanding of how melanopsin confers heightened responsivity to daylength may improve our understanding of a broad range of behavioral responses to light (i.e., circadian, sleep, mood) as well as the etiology of disorders with seasonal patterns of recurrence or exacerbation.

25349260	20141029	Septins promote stress fiber-mediated maturation of focal adhesions and renal epithelial motility.	Organogenesis and tumor metastasis involve the transformation of epithelia to highly motile mesenchymal-like cells. Septins are filamentous G proteins, which are overexpressed in metastatic carcinomas, but their functions in epithelial motility are unknown. Here, we show that a novel network of septin filaments underlies the organization of the transverse arc and radial (dorsal) stress fibers at the leading lamella of migrating renal epithelia. Surprisingly, septin depletion resulted in smaller and more transient and peripheral focal adhesions. This phenotype was accompanied by a highly disorganized lamellar actin network and rescued by the actin bundling protein ?-actinin-1. We show that preassembled actin filaments are cross-linked directly by Septin 9 (SEPT9), whose expression is increased after induction of renal epithelial motility with the hepatocyte growth factor. Significantly, SEPT9 overexpression enhanced renal cell migration in 2D and 3D matrices, whereas SEPT9 knockdown decreased migration. These results suggest that septins promote epithelial motility by reinforcing the cross-linking of lamellar stress fibers and the stability of nascent focal adhesions. 	J._Cell_Biol.	D016428 D052061
25774512	20150317	A novel multiplex PCR discriminates Bacillus anthracis and its genetically related strains from other Bacillus cereus group species.	Anthrax is an important zoonotic disease worldwide that is caused by Bacillus anthracis, a spore-forming pathogenic bacterium. A rapid and sensitive method to detect B. anthracis is important for anthrax risk management and control in animal cases to address public health issues. However, it has recently become difficult to identify B. anthracis by using previously reported molecular-based methods because of the emergence of B. cereus, which causes severe extra-intestinal infection, as well as the human pathogenic B. thuringiensis, both of which are genetically related to B. anthracis. The close genetic relation of chromosomal backgrounds has led to complexity of molecular-based diagnosis. In this study, we established a B. anthracis multiplex PCR that can screen for the presence of B. anthracis virulent plasmids and differentiate B. anthracis and its genetically related strains from other B. cereus group species. Six sets of primers targeting a chromosome of B. anthracis and B. anthracis-like strains, two virulent plasmids, pXO1 and pXO2, a bacterial gene, 16S rRNA gene, and a mammalian gene, actin-beta gene, were designed. The multiplex PCR detected approximately 3.0 CFU of B. anthracis DNA per PCR reaction and was sensitive to B. anthracis. The internal control primers also detected all bacterial and mammalian DNAs examined, indicating the practical applicability of this assay as it enables monitoring of appropriate amplification. The assay was also applied for detection of clinical strains genetically related to B. anthracis, which were B. cereus strains isolated from outbreaks of hospital infections in Japan, and field strains isolated in Zambia, and the assay differentiated B. anthracis and its genetically related strains from other B. cereus group strains. Taken together, the results indicate that the newly developed multiplex PCR is a sensitive and practical method for detecting B. anthracis. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
26191295	20150721	CXCL12 rs266085 and TNF-? rs1799724 polymorphisms and susceptibility to cervical cancer in a Chinese population.	Further research is required to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the association of TNF-?/rs1799724 and CXCL12/rs266085 polymorphisms with susceptibility to cervical cancer in Han Chinese population in Shandong Province. 348 patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma, including CIS (121) and invasive carcinoma (227), and 351 healthy controls. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and genotyping for TNF-?/rs1799724 and CXCL12/rs266085 was carried out using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays. TNF-?/rs1799724 polymorphism showed the C-allele was less prevalent among cases as compared to controls (74.3% vs. 92.0%), while the T-allele was more prevalent among cases (P=0.000, OR=3.99, 95% C.I.: 2.90-5.51). CXCL12/rs266085 polymorphism showed the C-allele was less prevalent among cases as compared to controls (41.2% vs. 49.7%), while the T-allele was more prevalent among cases (P=0.001, OR=1.41, 95% C.I.: 1.14-1.74). The genotype and allele frequencies of these two SNPs did not differ between CIS and invasive squamous cell carcinoma (P&gt;0.05). Moreover, the allele frequencies of rs1799724 were significantly different between controls without or with HPV infection (P&lt;0.05). Neither the genotype nor allele frequencies of rs266085 were statistically different between HPV-negative and positive controls. TNF-?/rs1799724 and CXCL12/rs266085 polymorphisms are associated with cervical cancer. C-&gt;T polymorphism of these two SNPs and HPV infection are linked to high risk for cervical cancer.

15221887	20040629	Mutation analysis of two patients with hypokalemic periodic paralysis and suspected malignant hyperthermia.	Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) and malignant hyperthermia (MH) are autosomal-dominant genetically heterogeneous ion channelopathies. MH has been described in patients with HypoPP, suggesting a potential link between these disorders. However, a common genetic determinant has not been described. With the aim of corroborating this association, four candidate genes were screened in two independent HypoPP patients, one of whom was also diagnosed as MH-susceptible and the other as MH-normal by the in vitro contracture test (IVCT). An A&gt;G change at nucleotide 7025 was detected in the RYR1 gene in the HypoPP/MH-susceptible patient. Detection of the same mutation in three independent MH families suggested that 7025A&gt;G represents a novel MH-susceptibility allele and that MH and HypoPP occurred independently in the case presented. Conclusive evidence in support of the hypothesis that MH and HypoPP are allelic was therefore not obtained. 	Muscle_Nerve	D002363 D016428 D013485
15364586	20040915	The disintegrin echistatin stabilizes integrin alphaIIbbeta3's open conformation and promotes its oligomerization.	We have employed echistatin, a 5.4 kDa snake venom disintegrin, as a model protein to investigate the paradox that small ligand-mimetics can bind to the resting alphaIIbbeta3 integrin while adhesive macromolecules cannot. We characterized the interactions between purified human alphaIIbbeta3 and two recombinant echistatin variants: rEch (1-49) M28L, chosen for its selectivity toward beta3-integrins, and rEch (1-40) M28L, a carboxy-terminal truncation mutant. While both contain an RGD integrin targeting sequence, only rEch (1-49) M28L was an effective inhibitor of alphaIIbbeta3 function. Electron microscopy of rotary shadowed specimens yielded a variety of alphaIIbbeta3 conformers ranging from compact, spherical particles (maximum dimension 22 nm) to the classical &quot;head with two tails&quot; forms (32 nm). The population of larger particles (42-56 nm) increased from 17% to 28% in the presence of rEch (1-49) M28L, indicative of ligand-induced oligomerization. Sedimentation velocity measurements demonstrated that both full length and truncated echistatin perturbed alphaIIbbeta3's solution structure, yielding slower-sedimenting open conformers. Dynamic light scattering showed that rEch (1-49) M28L protected alphaIIbbeta3 from thermal aggregation, raising its transition mid-point from 46 degrees C to 69 degrees C; a smaller shift resulted with rEch (1-40) M28L. Sedimentation equilibrium demonstrated that both echistatin ligands induced substantial alphaIIbbeta3 dimerization. van't Hoff analysis revealed a pattern of entropy/enthalpy compensation similar to tirofiban, a small RGD ligand-mimetic that binds tightly to alphaIIbbeta3, but yields smaller conformational perturbations than echistatin. We propose that echistatin may serve as a paradigm for understanding multidomain adhesive macromolecules because its ability to modulate alphaIIbbeta3's structure resides on an RGD loop, while full disintegrin activity requires an auxiliary site that includes the carboxy-terminal nine amino acid residues.

27449138	20160725	HBV/HIV co-infection and APOBEC3G polymorphisms in a population from Burkina Faso.	Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) is a potent host defense factor, which interferes with HIV-1 and HBV. Our study had three objectives, to screen a population of HIV-1 infected and uninfected patients in Burkina Faso for HBV, to screen the population for APOBEC3G variants rs6001417, rs8177832, and rs35228531 previously described, and to analyze the effect of these three variants and their haplotypes on HIV-1/HBV co-infection in Burkina Faso. HBV detection was performed on samples from HIV-1 infected and uninfected subjects using rapid detection tests and real-time PCR. APOBEC3 genotyping was done by the TaqMan allelic discrimination method. Fisher Exact test, Odds ratio (OR), confidence intervals (CI) at 95?%, Linkage disequilibrium (LD) summary statistics and haplotype frequencies were calculated. The prevalence of HBV was 56.7?% among HIV-1 positive patients of our study while it was about 12.8?% among HIV-1 seronegative subjects. Genotype E was the genotype of HBV present in our hepatitis B positive samples. Minor allele frequencies of rs6001417, rs8177832, and rs35228531 were higher in seronegative subjects. The T minor allele of variant rs35228531 was protective against HIV-1/HBV co-infection with OR?=?0.61, 95?% CI (0.42-0.90), p?=?0.013. There was also an association between the GGT haplotype and protection against HIV-1/HBV co-infection, OR?=?0.57, 95?% CI (0.33-0.99), p?=?0.050. The other haplotypes present in the population were not statistically significant. There minor allele T of the rs35228531 was protective against HIV mono-infection OR?=?0.53, 95?% CI (0.3-0.93), P?=?0.030. But there was no effect of protection against HBV mono-infection. APOBEC3G through its variants rs6001417, rs8177832, and rs35228531, in this study interferes with HIV-1/HBV co-infection could be due the HIV-1 mono-infection in a population from Burkina Faso.

3235445	19881101	Prediction of in-vivo modification sites of proteins from their primary structures.	In order to make better use of the information contained in rapidly expanding amino acid sequence data, a new method to predict various modification sites of proteins from their primary structures is presented. It is also applicable to the prediction of other functional sites in proteins. Here we show the examples of N-glycosylation and serine/threonine phosphorylation sites. The method is essentially an elaboration of consensus sequence pattern matching based on stepwise discriminant analysis. The occurring amino acids near a potential modification site are represented by six numerical values which reflect various properties of amino acids. Longer-range effects around these sites are also considered. The stepwise procedure enabled us to automatically select effective features for discrimination. A computer program with our method first identifies potential modification sites by a sequence pattern, NX(S/T) for N-glycosylation or (S/T) for phosphorylation, and then decides by discriminant analysis whether a potential site is likely to be a true modification site. The prediction accuracy in the second step of discrimination was about 60% for glycosylation sites and about 80% for phosphorylation sites. 	J._Biochem.	D016428 D013485
22022602	20111025	Rapid internalization of the oncogenic K+ channel K(V)10.1.	K(V)10.1 is a mammalian brain voltage-gated potassium channel whose ectopic expression outside of the brain has been proven relevant for tumor biology. Promotion of cancer cell proliferation by K(V)10.1 depends largely on ion flow, but some oncogenic properties remain in the absence of ion permeation. Additionally, K(V)10.1 surface populations are small compared to large intracellular pools. Control of protein turnover within cells is key to both cellular plasticity and homeostasis, and therefore we set out to analyze how endocytic trafficking participates in controlling K(V)10.1 intracellular distribution and life cycle. To follow plasma membrane K(V)10.1 selectively, we generated a modified channel of displaying an extracellular affinity tag for surface labeling by ?-bungarotoxin. This modification only minimally affected K(V)10.1 electrophysiological properties. Using a combination of microscopy and biochemistry techniques, we show that K(V)10.1 is constitutively internalized involving at least two distinct pathways of endocytosis and mainly sorted to lysosomes. This occurs at a relatively fast rate. Simultaneously, recycling seems to contribute to maintain basal K(V)10.1 surface levels. Brief K(V)10.1 surface half-life and rapid lysosomal targeting is a relevant factor to be taken into account for potential drug delivery and targeting strategies directed against K(V)10.1 on tumor cells.

25807057	20150326	Viral interference with functions of the cellular receptor tyrosine phosphatase CD45.	The receptor tyrosine phosphatase CD45 is expressed on the surface of almost all cells of hematopoietic origin. CD45 functions are central to the development of T cells and determine the threshold at which T and B lymphocytes can become activated. Given this pivotal role of CD45 in the immune system, it is probably not surprising that viruses interfere with the activity of CD45 in lymphocytes to dampen the immune response and that they also utilize this molecule to accomplish their replication cycle. Here we report what is known about the interaction of viral proteins with CD45. Moreover, we debate putative interactions of viruses with CD45 in myeloid cells and the resulting consequences-subjects that remain to be investigated. Finally, we summarize the evidence that pathogens were the driving force for the evolution of CD45. 	Viruses	D016428 D052061 D013485 D016454
3105868	19870601	Modification of Ha-ras oncogene p21 expression and cell cycle progression in the human colonic cancer cell line HT-29.	Multiparameter flow cytometric measurements of the Ha-ras oncogene product, Ha-p21, versus DNA content were used to study the effect of prednisolone, sodium butyrate, and hyperosmolality on the expression of this gene during the cell cycle of HT-29, a human colonic carcinoma cell line. In control cells the expression of Ha-p21 was cell cycle dependent; it increased during G1 and remained approximately constant as cells traversed the S- and G2 + M phases. Two compartments of G1 cells, one expressing low (G1A) and the other (G1B) high levels of Ha-p21 could be identified. Cells grown with prednisolone (1.4-2.1 microM) expressed higher Ha-p21 levels than controls. Cell cycle analysis revealed that this effect was accompanied by a change in the distribution of cells in G1 phase: whereas the proportion of cells in G1A was reduced, that of cells in G1B was increased. The steroid had no detectable effect on cells in S and G2 + M. By contrast, sodium butyrate and hyperosmolality caused a marked decrease in Ha-p21 content. This reduction was not accompanied by any modification of the proportion of cells in the cell cycle compartments. These results would suggest that Ha-p21 is not likely to be a primary regulator of cell cycle progression in HT-29 cells. 	Cancer_Res.	D016428 D013487
18706089	20080819	Identification of a novel CHEK2 variant and assessment of its contribution to the risk of breast cancer in French Canadian women.	BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for the majority of the known familial breast cancer risk, however, the impact of other cancer susceptibility genes largely remains to be elucidated. Checkpoint Kinase 2 (CHEK2) is an important signal transducer of cellular responses to DNA damage, whose defects have been associated with an increase in breast cancer risk. Previous studies have identified low penetrance CHEK2 alleles such as 1100delC and I157T, as well as variants such as S428F in the Ashkenazi Jewish population and IVS2 + 1G&gt;A in the Polish population. No founder allele has been specifically identified in the French Canadian population. The 14 coding exons of CHEK2 were fully sequenced for variant alleles in a panel of 25 affected French Canadian women and 25 healthy controls. Two variants were identified of which one novel variant was further screened for in an additional panel of 667 breast cancer patients and 6548 healthy controls. Additional genotyping was conducted using allele specific PCR and a restriction digest assay. Significance of amino acid substitutions were deduced by employing comparative analysis techniques. Two variants were identified: the previously reported silent substitution 252A&gt;G (E84E) and the novel missense variant, 1217G&gt;A (R406H). No significant difference in allele distribution between French Canadian women with breast cancer and healthy controls was observed (3/692, 0.43% vs. 22/6573, 0.33%, respectively, P = 0.73). The novel CHEK2 missense variant identified in this study, R406H, is unlikely to contribute to breast cancer risk in French Canadian women. 	BMC_Cancer	D016428 D013485
27366163	20160702	First Imported Case of Chikungunya Virus Infection in a Travelling Canadian Returning from the Caribbean.	This is the first Canadian case of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection reported in a traveller returning from the Caribbean. Following multiple mosquito bites in Martinique Island in January 2014, the patient presented with high fever, headaches, arthralgia on both hands and feet, and a rash on the trunk upon his return to Canada. Initial serological testing for dengue virus infection was negative. Support therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was administered. The symptoms gradually improved 4 weeks after onset with residual arthralgia and morning joint stiffness. This clinical feature prompted the clinician to request CHIKV virus serology which was found to be positive for the presence of IgM and neutralizing antibodies. In 2014, over four hundred confirmed CHIKV infection cases were diagnosed in Canadian travellers returning from the Caribbean and Central America. Clinical suspicion of CHIKV or dengue virus infections should be considered in febrile patients with arthralgia returning from the recently CHIKV endemic countries of the Americas.

12171601	20020813	Glycosylation of human proteinase-activated receptor-2 (hPAR2): role in cell surface expression and signalling.	We have analysed the role of N-linked glycosylation in regulating human proteinase-activated receptor-2 (hPAR(2)) expression and function. Epitope-tagged wild-type hPAR(2) (wt-hPAR(2)) or hPAR(2) that lacked glycosylation sequons (following site-directed mutagenesis) in either the N-terminus [hPAR(2)N30A (Asn(30)--&gt;Ala)], extracellular loop 2 [ECL2; hPAR(2)N222Q (Asn(222)--&gt;Gln) or hPAR(2)N222A (Asn(222)--&gt;Ala)] or both (hPAR(2)N30A,N222A or hPAR(2)N30A,N222Q) were expressed in the Chinese-hamster ovary (CHO) fibroblast cell line, Pro5. Western blot analysis of wt-hPAR(2) showed mature wt-hPAR(2) to have a molecular mass of 55-100 kDa, and 33-48 kDa following N -glycosidase F deglycosylation. FACS analysis and immunocytochemistry of the wt-hPAR(2) and PAR(2) mutant cell lines revealed that removal of both glycosylation sequons decreases (50% of wt-hPAR(2)) cell surface expression. Western blot analysis indicated that both N-linked sites are glycosylated. In functional studies, hPAR(2)N30A displayed a selective and significant increase in sensitivity towards tryptase. Interestingly, hPAR(2)N222A displayed a loss in sensitivity towards all PAR(2) agonists tested. However, further analysis revealed receptor sensitivity to alanine mutations in this domain, as the more conservative substitution hPAR(2)N222Q displayed no change in response to PAR(2) agonists. hPAR(2)N30A,N222Q displayed increased sensitivity towards tryptase, but a loss in sensitivity towards trypsin and the synthetic peptide SLIGRL-NH(2), although this loss in sensitivity towards trypsin and SLIGRL-NH(2) was secondary to changes in cell-surface expression. Finally, expression of sialic-acid-deficient wt-hPAR(2) in the CHO Lec2 glycosylation-deficient mutant cell line, showed a 40 kDa loss in molecular mass, in addition to a marked and selective increase in sensitivity towards tryptase. We conclude that hPAR(2) N-linked glycosylation and sialylation regulates receptor expression and/or signalling. 	Biochem._J.	D016428 D013485
20922109	20101006	Knowledge and Outcome Measure of HbA1c Testing in Asian Indian Patients with Type 2 Diabetes from a Tertiary Care Center.	HbA1c test is considered to be the reliable measure for evaluating long-term glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether knowledge about HbA1c test is associated with a better glycemic control. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 480 (M:F; 287:193) adults with type 2 diabetes attending a tertiary care center during a period of four months. Baseline demographic and clinical data of all the subjects was obtained. Subject's knowledge about HbA1c test and their target goal was assessed using a questionnaire. Recent HbA1c results were obtained from medical records. Seventy four per cent of the subjects had awareness about HbA1c test and about 43% of those who knew HbA1c test also knew their target goal. 33% remember their last HbA1c result. The mean A1C of Group A was significantly lower when compared with Group B (8.1 ? 1.7 vs 9.2 ? 1.9, P&lt;0.0001). Group C had lower A1C levels compared to Group D (7.7 ? 1.4 vs 8.5 ? 1.9, p&lt;0.0001). Patients who kept their HbA1c less than 7% were significantly higher in Group C than in Group D. (37.8 vs 12.7%, p&lt;0.00001). Subjects had good glycemic control with increasing levels of awareness about HbA1c. Majority of the diabetic patients who attended the tertiary care center for diabetes care knew HbA1c test and half of them were aware about their target goal. Awareness about HbA1c had a positive impact on maintenance of better glycemic control. 	Indian_J_Community_Med	D016428
21805404	20110802	The discovery of LOX-1, its ligands and clinical significance.	LOX-1 is an endothelial receptor for oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), a key molecule in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.The basal expression of LOX-1 is low but highly induced under the influence of proinflammatory and prooxidative stimuli in vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, macrophages, platelets and cardiomyocytes. Multiple lines of in vitro and in vivo studies have provided compelling evidence that LOX-1 promotes endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis induced by oxLDL. The roles of LOX-1 in the development of atherosclerosis, however, are not simple as it had been considered. Evidence has been accumulating that LOX-1 recognizes not only oxLDL but other atherogenic lipoproteins, platelets, leukocytes and CRP. As results, LOX-1 not only mediates endothelial dysfunction but contributes to atherosclerotic plaque formation, thrombogenesis, leukocyte infiltration and myocardial infarction, which determine mortality and morbidity from atherosclerosis. Moreover, our recent epidemiological study has highlighted the involvement of LOX-1 in human cardiovascular diseases. Further understandings of LOX-1 and its ligands as well as its versatile functions will direct us to ways to find novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to cardiovascular disease.

15611833	20041222	[Thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis, an endocrine emergency: clinical and genetic features in 25 patients].	Thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis (THPP) is a medical emergency characterized by acute attacks of weakness, hypokalemia, and thyrotoxicosis that resolve with the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Attacks are transient, self-limited, associated with hypokalemia and resemble those of familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis (FHPP), an autosomal dominant neurological channelopathy. This study reviews the clinical features and genetic findings of THPP in 25 Brazilian patients. Most patients had weight loss, taquicardia, goiter, tremor, and ophthalmopathy. Most often attacks arose during the night and recovered spontaneously but some patients evolved to total quadriplegia, and few experienced cardiac arrhythmias. All patients had suppressed TSH and elevated T4 and most had positive anti-thyroid antibodies, indicating autoimmunity thyrotoxic etiology. Potassium was low in all patients during the crisis. Prophylactic potassium therapy has not been shown to prevent attacks; however it was useful for curbing the paralysis during the crisis. We identified the mutation R83H in the KCNE3 gene in one sporadic case, and M58V in the KCNE4 gene in one case with family history. Furthermore, we identified other genetic polymorphisms in the CACNA1S, SCN4A, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNE1L, KCNJ2, KCNJ8 e KCNJ11 genes. We conclude that THPP is the most common treatable cause of acquired periodic paralysis; therefore, it must be included in the differential diagnosis of acute muscle weakness.

18060073	20071207	Mutation analysis of BRAF, MEK1 and MEK2 in 15 ovarian cancer cell lines: implications for therapy.	Among gynecologic cancers, ovarian cancer is the second most common and has the highest death rate. Cancer is a genetic disorder and arises due to the accumulation of somatic mutations in critical genes. An understanding of the genetic basis of ovarian cancer has implications both for early detection and for therapeutic intervention in this population of patients. Fifteen ovarian cancer cell lines, commonly used for in vitro experiments, were screened for mutations using bidirectional direct sequencing in all coding regions of BRAF, MEK1 and MEK2. BRAF mutations were identified in four of the fifteen ovarian cancer cell lines studied. Together, these four cell lines contained four different BRAF mutations, two of which were novel. ES-2 had the common B-Raf p.V600E mutation in exon 15 and Hey contained an exon 11 missense mutation, p.G464E. The two novel B-Raf mutants identified were a 5 amino acid heterozygous deletion p.N486-P490del in OV90, and an exon 4 missense substitution p.Q201H in OVCAR 10. One of the cell lines, ES-2, contained a mutation in MEK1, specifically, a novel heterozygous missense substitution, p.D67N which resulted from a nt 199 G--&gt;A transition. None of the cell lines contained coding region mutations in MEK2. Functional characterization of the MEK1 mutant p.D67N by transient transfection with subsequent Western blot analysis demonstrated increased ERK phosphorylation as compared to controls. In this study, we report novel BRAF mutations in exon 4 and exon 12 and also report the first mutation in MEK1 associated with human cancer. Functional data indicate the MEK1 mutation may confer alteration of activation through the MAPK pathway. The significance of these findings is that BRAF and MEK1/2 mutations may be more common than anticipated in ovarian cancer which could have important implications for treatment of patients with this disease and suggests potential new therapeutic avenues.

17101698	20061115	Filopodia formation mediated by receptor tyrosine kinase Ror2 is required for Wnt5a-induced cell migration.	The receptor tyrosine kinase Ror2 plays important roles in developmental morphogenesis. It has recently been shown that Ror2 mediates Wnt5a-induced noncanonical Wnt signaling by activating the Wnt-JNK pathway and inhibiting the beta-catenin-TCF pathway. However, the function of Ror2 in noncanonical Wnt signaling leading to cell migration is largely unknown. We show, using genetically different or manipulated cultured cells, that Ror2 is critical for Wnt5a-induced, but not Wnt3a-induced, cell migration. Ror2-mediated cell migration requires the extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD), which is the binding site for Wnt5a, and the cytoplasmic proline-rich domain (PRD) of Ror2. Furthermore, Ror2 can mediate filopodia formation via actin reorganization, irrespective of Wnt5a, and this Ror2-mediated filopodia formation requires the actin-binding protein filamin A, which associates with the PRD of Ror2. Intriguingly, disruption of filopodia formation by suppressing the expression of either Ror2 or filamin A inhibits Wnt5a-induced cell migration, indicating that Ror2-mediated filopodia formation is essential for Wnt5a-induced cell migration.

18580445	20080627	Polymorphisms of the TNF, CD14, and HSPA1B genes in patients with acute alcohol-induced pancreatitis.	Genotype assessment has been suggested to be a tool for predicting disease severity in acute pancreatitis (AP). To study this hypothesis, we performed genotype analysis of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -308 A/G, CD14 -159C/T, and HSPA1B +1267 A/G polymorphisms. This is a case-control association study of 397 patients with AP (214 of whom had an alcohol-induced AP) and 300 controls. The control group comprised 218 subjects with detailed data of alcohol consumption, 70 of whom were heavy drinkers (daily alcohol intake &gt;40 g), and 92 blood donors. The severity of AP was determined according to the Atlanta classification. Genotyping was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry-assisted genotyping method. Major allele frequency in TNF gene was 0.87 for patients with AP and 0.86 for controls. For CD14, the gene major allele frequency was 0.60 for patients and 0.63 for controls. For HSPA1B, the major allele frequencies were 0.52 for patients and 0.49 for controls, respectively. The allele frequencies did not differ significantly between AP patients with organ failure and those with mild disease, patients with alcohol-induced AP, or those with biliary AP. The patients with septic infectious complications (n = 47) had genotype distribution no different from those with mild, uncomplicated disease (n = 245). The TNF, CD14, and HSPA1B polymorphisms studied seem not to play a role in determining the severity of AP or the risk of alcohol-induced AP and thus do not serve as a tool for predicting disease severity.

7592708	19951027	Potent and selective Kunitz domain inhibitors of plasma kallikrein designed by phage display.	Phage displaying APPI Kunitz domain libraries have been used to design potent and selective active site inhibitors of human plasma kallikrein, a serine protease that plays an important role in both inflammation and coagulation. Selected clones from two Kunitz domain libraries randomized at or near the binding loop (positions 11-13, 15-19, and 34) were sequenced following five rounds of selection on immobilized plasma kallikrein. Invariant preferences for Arg at position 15 and His at position 18 were found, whereas His, Ala, Ala, and Pro were highly preferred residues at positions 13, 16, 17, and 19, respectively. At position 11 Pro, Asp, and Glu were favored, while hydrophobic residues were preferred at position 34. Selected variants, purified by trypsin affinity chromatography and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, potently inhibited plasma kallikrein, with apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (Ki*) ranging from approximately 75 to 300 pM. From sequence and activity data, consensus mutants were constructed by site directed mutagenesis. One such mutant, KALI-DY, which differed from APPI at 6 key residues (T11D, P13H, M17A, I18H, S19P, and F34Y), inhibited plasma kallikrein with a Ki* = 15 +/- 14 pM, representing an increase in binding affinity of more than 10,000-fold compared to APPI. Similar to APPI, the variants also inhibited Factor XIa with high affinity, with Ki* values ranging from approximately 0.3 to 15 nM; KALI-DY inhibited Factor XIa with a Ki* = 8.2 +/- 3.5 nM. KALI-DY did not inhibit plasmin, thrombin, Factor Xa, Factor XIIa, activated protein C, or tissue factor. Factor VIIa. Consistent with the protease specificity profile, KALI-DY did not prolong the clotting time in a prothrombin time assay, but did prolong the clotting time in an activated partial thromboplastin time assay &gt; 3.5-fold at 1 microM.

23251262	20121220	Role of the CASP-9 Ex5+32 G&gt;A polymorphism in susceptibility to cancer: A meta-analysis.	Failure of apoptosis is one of the hallmarks of cancer. As an execution-phase caspase, caspase-9 plays a crucial role during apoptosis. To examine whether the Ex5+32 G&gt;A (rs1052576) polymorphism in the CASP-9 gene alters cancer risk, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of 7 case-control studies consisting of a total of 1668 cancer cases and 2294 healthy controls. All studies considered, A allele and A allele carriers of Ex5+32 G&gt;A in the CASP-9 gene had significant associations with cancer risk (OR=0.72, 95% CI, 0.58-0.89, P= 0.003; OR= 0.76, 95% CI, 0.63-0.92, P= 0.004; respectively). In the subgroup analysis, we found that the A allele of Ex5+32 G&gt;A was a protective factor for cancer risk in Chinese and American populations (OR=0.60, 95% CI, 0.44-0.81, P&lt;0.001; OR= 0.80, 95% CI, 0.69-0.94, P= 0.005; respectively). Similarly, we also found positive associations between A allele carriers of Ex5+32 G&gt;A and cancer risk in Chinese and American populations (OR=0.63, 95% CI, 0.44-0.90, P= 0.01; OR= 0.78, 95% CI, 0.62-0.98, P=0.03; respectively). In addition, we identified that A allele and A allele carriers of Ex5+32 G&gt;A may decrease the risk of cancer in the Asian population (OR=0.60, 95% CI, 0.44-0.81, P&lt;0.001; OR= 0.63, 95% CI, 0.44-0.90, P= 0.01; respectively). In conclusion, this meta-analysis demonstrated that A allele and A allele carriers of the Ex5+32 G&gt;A polymorphism in the CASP-9 gene may be protective factors for cancer risk.

25556925	20150106	Renal function and klotho gene polymorphisms among Uygur and Kazak populations in Xinjiang, China.	The association of genetic polymorphisms of klotho gene with aging has not been thoroughly examined. Previous studies showed that longevity in the Uygurs was considerably greater than in Kazaks in Xinjiang. This study aimed to investigate the difference of renal function and Klotho gene polymorphisms between Kazak and Uygur normal populations in Xinjiang, China. A total of 249 Uygur and 386 Kazak clinically normal subjects were included in this study. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs1207568, rs564481, rs9527025, and rs9536314) of the klotho gene were genotyped using the ABI SNaPshot method. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated according to the Chinese simplified MDRD equation. There were significant differences between Kazak and Uygur healthy populations in both allele frequencies and genotype distributions in rs9527025 and rs9536314 (P&lt;0.05, respectively). When the subjects were divided into 2 groups according to the genotypes of the klotho gene polymorphism, in the GA+AA genotype distributions of the rs1207568, the differences I serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate between the Kazak and Uygur groups were statistically significant (P&lt;0.05, respectively). In CC genotype of rs564481, serum creatinine was significantly higher in Kazaks compared with Uygurs (P&lt;0.05). In GG genotype of rs9527025, serum creatinine was significantly higher in the Kazak group compared with the Uygur group (P&lt;0.05), as well as in CG+CC genotype of rs9527025 (P&lt;0.05). Serum creatinine was significantly higher in the Kazak group compared with the Uygur group in TT genotype of rs9536314 (P&lt;0.05), as was GT+GG genotype of rs9536314. Haplotype analysis indicated that the frequencies of ACGT, GTGT, and GCCG haplotypes were significantly different between Kazak and Uygur healthy populations (P=0.04, P=0.018, P=0.000, respectively). Significant differences in klotho gene rs9527025 and rs9536314 polymorphisms were found between the Uygur and Kazak populations. 	Med._Sci._Monit.	D016428 D013485
27658030	20160923	SpyTag/SpyCatcher Cyclization Enhances the Thermostability of Firefly Luciferase.	SpyTag can spontaneously form a covalent isopeptide bond with its protein partner SpyCatcher. Firefly luciferase from Photinus pyralis was cyclized in vivo by fusing SpyCatcher at the N terminus and SpyTag at the C terminus. Circular LUC was more thermostable and alkali-tolerant than the wild type, without compromising the specific activity. Structural analysis indicated that the cyclized LUC increased the thermodynamic stability of the structure and remained more properly folded at high temperatures when compared with the wild type. We also prepared an N-terminally and C-terminally shortened form of the SpyCatcher protein and cyclization using this truncated form led to even more thermostability than the original form. Our findings suggest that cyclization with SpyTag and SpyCatcher is a promising and effective strategy to enhance thermostability of enzymes. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428
26694948	20151224	Improved Incorporation of Noncanonical Amino Acids by an Engineered tRNA(Tyr) Suppressor.	The Methanocaldcoccus jannaschii tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS):tRNA(Tyr) cognate pair has been used to incorporate a large number of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. However, the structural elements of the suppressor tRNA(Tyr) used in these experiments have not been examined for optimal performance. Here, we evaluate the steady-state kinetic parameters of wild-type M. jannaschii TyrRS and an evolved 3-nitrotyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (nitroTyrRS) toward several engineered tRNA(Tyr) suppressors, and we correlate aminoacylation properties with the efficiency and fidelity of superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) synthesis in vivo. Optimal ncAA-sfGFP synthesis correlates with improved aminoacylation kinetics for a tRNA(Tyr) amber suppressor with two substitutions in the anticodon loop (G34C/G37A), while four additional mutations in the D and variable loops, present in the tRNA(Tyr) used in all directed evolution experiments to date, are deleterious to function both in vivo and in vitro. These findings extend to three of four other evolved TyrRS enzymes that incorporate distinct ncAAs. Suppressor tRNAs elicit decreases in amino acid Km values for both TyrRS and nitroTyrRS, suggesting that direct anticodon recognition by TyrRS need not be an impediment to superior performance of this orthogonal system and offering insight into novel approaches for directed evolution. The G34C/G37A tRNA(Tyr) may enhance future incorporation of many ncAAs by engineered TyrRS enzymes. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D052061
20696606	20100811	Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) P479L prevalence in live newborns in Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut.	Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), encoded by the gene CPT1A, is the hepatic isoform of CPT1 and is a major regulatory point in long-chain fatty acid oxidation. CPT1A deficiency confers risk for hypoketotic hypoglycaemia, hepatic encephalopathy, seizures, and sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI). It remains controversial whether the CPT1A gene variant, c.1436C&gt;T (p.P479L), identified in Inuit, First Nations, and Alaska Native infants, causes susceptibility to decompensation, in particular during times of fever and intercurrent illness. Although newborn screening for the P479L variant occurs in some jurisdictions, background knowledge about the presence of the variant in Canadian Aboriginal populations is lacking. In an effort to understand the population implications of the variant in northern Canada, overall frequencies of the variant were assessed. Further studies are underway to determine associated risk. Ethics approval was obtained from university REBs, local research institutes, and with consultation with territorial Aboriginal groups. Newborn screening blood spots from all infants born in 2006 in the three territories were genotyped for the p.P479L variant. p.P479L (c.1436C&gt;T) allele frequencies in the three territories were 0.02, 0.08, and 0.77 in Yukon (n=325), Northwest Territories (n=564), and Nunavut (n=695), respectively. Homozygosity rates were 0%, 3%, and 64%. Aboriginal status was available only in NWT, with allele frequencies of 0.04, 0.44, 0.00, and 0.01 for First Nations, Inuvialuit/Inuit, M?tis, and non-Aboriginal populations. Although individual blood spots were not identified for Aboriginal ethnicity in Nunavut infants, ~90% of infants in Nunavut are born to Inuit women. The allele frequency and rate of homozygosity for the CPT1A P479L variant were high in Inuit and Inuvialuit who reside in northern coastal regions. The variant is present at a low frequency in First Nations populations, who reside in areas less coastal than the Inuit or Inuvialuit in the two western territories. The significance of the population and geographic distribution remains unclear, but the high population frequencies of the variant suggest a historically low penetrance for adverse outcomes. Further evidence is needed to determine if there is an increased risk for infant mortality and morbidity and whether newborn screening will be indicated on a population basis. 	Mol._Genet._Metab.

24099765	20131009	Functional analysis of the NH2-terminal hydrophobic region and BRICHOS domain of GKN1.	Gastrokine 1 (GKN1) protects the gastric antral mucosa and promotes healing by facilitating restitution and proliferation after injury. GKN1 is down-regulated in Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells and loss of GKN1 expression is tightly associated with gastric carcinogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms as a tumor suppressor are largely unknown. Presently, the hydrophobic region and BRICHOS domain of GKN1, pGKN1(D13N), pGKN1(?68-199), and pGKN1(?1-67,165-199) were shown to suppress gastric cancer cell growth and recapitulate GKN1 functions. As well, the hydrophobic region and BRICHOS domain of GKN1 had a synergistic anti-cancer effect with 5-FU on tumor cell growth, implying that the NH2-terminal hydrophobic region and BRICHOS domain of GKN1 are sufficient for tumor suppression, thereby suggesting a therapeutic intervention for gastric cancer. Also, its domain inducing endogenous miR-185 directly targeted the epigenetic effectors DNMT1 and EZH2 in gastric cancer cells. Our results suggest that the NH2-terminal hydrophobic region and BRICHOS domain of GKN1 are sufficient for its tumor suppressor activities. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.	D016428 D013485
19347029	20090407	Inactivation of AMPK alters gene expression and promotes growth of prostate cancer cells.	AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) serves as a fuel-sensing enzyme that is activated by binding of AMP and subsequent phophorylation by upstream kinases such as the tumor suppressor LKB1, when cells sense an increase in the ratio of AMP to ATP. Acute activation of AMPK stimulates fatty acid oxidation to generate more ATP and simultaneously inhibits ATP-consuming processes including fatty acid and protein syntheses, thereby preserving energy for acute cell-surviving program, whereas chronic activation leads to inhibition of cell growth. The goal of the present study is to explore the mechanisms by which AMPK regulates cell growth. Toward this end, we established stable cell lines by introducing a dominant-negative mutant of AMPK alpha1 subunit or its shRNA into the prostate cancer C4-2 cells and other cells, or wild type LKB1 into the lung adenocarcinoma A549 and breast MB-MDA-231 cancer cells, both of which lack functional LKB1. Our results showed that the inhibition of AMPK accelerated cell proliferation and promoted malignant behavior such as increased cell migration and anchorage-independent growth. This was associated with decreased G1 population, downregulation of p53 and p21, and upregulation of S6K, IGF-1 and IGF1R. Conversely, treatment of the C4-2 cells with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-D-ribonucleoside (AICAR), a prototypical AMPK activator, caused opposite changes. In addition, our study using microarray and RT-PCR revealed that AMPK regulated gene expression involved in tumor cell growth and survival. Thus, our study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of AMPK action in cancer cells and presents AMPK as an ideal drug target for cancer therapy. 	Oncogene	D016428 D052061

27371493	20160703	Relation of genomic variants for Alzheimer disease dementia to common neuropathologies.	To investigate the associations of previously reported Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia genomic variants with common neuropathologies. This is a postmortem study including 1,017 autopsied participants from 2 clinicopathologic cohorts. Analyses focused on 22 genomic variants associated with AD dementia in large-scale case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses. The neuropathologic traits of interest were a pathologic diagnosis of AD according to NIA-Reagan criteria, macroscopic and microscopic infarcts, Lewy bodies (LB), and hippocampal sclerosis. For each variant, multiple logistic regression was used to investigate its association with neuropathologic traits, adjusting for age, sex, and subpopulation structure. We also conducted power analyses to estimate the sample sizes required to detect genome-wide significance (p &lt; 5 ? 10(-8)) for pathologic AD for all variants. APOE ?4 allele was associated with greater odds of pathologic AD (odds ratio [OR] 3.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.67-5.46, p = 1.9 ? 10(-13)), while ?2 allele was associated with lower odds of pathologic AD (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.30-0.61, p = 3.1 ? 10(-6)). Four additional genomic variants including rs6656401 (CR1), rs1476679 (ZCWPW1), rs35349669 (INPP5D), and rs17125944 (FERMT2) had p values less than 0.05. Remarkably, half of the previously reported AD dementia variants are not likely to be detected for association with pathologic AD with a sample size in excess of the largest GWAS meta-analyses of AD dementia. Many recently discovered genomic variants for AD dementia are not associated with the pathology of AD. Some genomic variants for AD dementia appear to be associated with other common neuropathologies. 	Neurology	D016428
17272299	20070203	The gateway pDEST17 expression vector encodes a -1 ribosomal frameshifting sequence.	The attB1 site in the Gateway (Invitrogen) bacterial expression vector pDEST17, necessary for in vitro site-specific recombination, contains the sequence AAA-AAA. The sequence A-AAA-AAG within the Escherichia coli dnaX gene is recognized as 'slippery' and promotes -1 translational frameshifting. We show here, by expressing in E. coli several plant cDNAs with and without single nucleotide deletions close to the translation initiation codons, that pDEST17 is intrinsically susceptible to -1 ribosomal frameshifting at the sequence C-AAA-AAA. The deletion mutants produce correct-sized, active enzymes with a good correlation between enzyme amount and activity. We demonstrate unambiguously the frameshift through a combination of Edman degradation, MALDI-ToF mass fingerprint analysis of tryptic peptides and MALDI-ToF reflectron in-source decay (rISD) sequencing. The degree of frameshifting depends on the nature of the sequence being expressed and ranged from 25 to 60%. These findings suggest that caution should be exercised when employing pDEST17 for high-level protein expression and that the attB1 site has some potential as a tool for studying -1 frameshifting.

24678795	20140401	Identification of critical phosphorylation sites on the carboxy tail of melanopsin.	Light-activated opsins undergo carboxy-terminal phosphorylation, which contributes to the deactivation of their photoresponse. The photopigment melanopsin possesses an unusually long carboxy tail containing 37 serine and threonine sites that are potential sites for phosphorylation by a G-protein dependent kinase (GRK). Here, we show that a small cluster of six to seven sites is sufficient for deactivation of light-activated mouse melanopsin. Surprisingly, these sites are distinct from those that regulate deactivation of rhodopsin. In zebrafish, there are five different melanopsin genes that encode proteins with distinct carboxy-terminal domains. Naturally occurring changes in the same cluster of phosphorylatable amino acids provides diversity in the deactivation kinetics of the zebrafish proteins. These results suggest that variation in phosphorylation sites provides flexibility in the duration and kinetics of melanopsin-mediated light responses. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D052061 D013486
22468675	20120404	Regional differences and similarities of FAP in Sweden.	Marked differences in phenotype in familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) populations have been noted between but also within FAP populations. Initially, it was believed that patients with FAP, caused by the TTR V30M mutation, shared the same founder. However, recent studies have clearly shown that the V30M mutation in Sweden occurred spontaneously later in time than that in Portugal. The Swedish FAP-population's phenotype differs between various areas within northern Sweden. Thus the age at onset is in average 20 years earlier in Skellefte? than in Pite? areas, a distance of only 60 km. Age at onset appears also to have an impact on complications of the disease. Late-onset cases often develop a cardiomyopathy, especially male patients. Mitochondrial haplotype distribution has been noted to differ between early- and late- onset patients in the Swedish population. Mitochondrial function is one possible factor contributing to the differences seen both between and within populations. 	Amyloid	D016428
7968540	19931101	Suppression of temperature-sensitive assembly mutants of heat-labile enterotoxin B subunits.	Deletions or substitutions of amino acids at the carboxyl-terminus of the heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit (EtxB) affect its assembly into pentamers in a temperature-dependent manner. At 42 degrees C, the mutations prevent the B subunits from achieving their final pentameric structure resulting in membrane association of the monomers. However, mutant B subunits produced at 30 degrees C assemble, in the periplasm, into pentamers that remain stable when transferred to 42 degrees C, indicating that the mutant pentamers are stable under conditions where their formation is inhibited. The mutant pentamers are, similarly to wild-type pentamers, SDS-resistant and stable, in vitro, at temperatures up to 65 degrees C. This suggests that although the C-terminal amino acids are part of the subunit interface, they appear not to contribute significantly to the stability of the final pentameric complex, but are instead essential for the formation or stabilization of an assembly intermediate in the pentamerization process. Single second site mutations suppress the assembly defect of mutant EtxB191.5, which carries substitutions at its C-terminus. The Thr--&gt;Ile replacement at position 75 in the alpha 2-helix probably restores the van der Waals contact between residues 75 and 101, which had been greatly reduced by the Met--&gt;Leu substitution at position 101 in the beta 6-strand of EtxB191.5. Interaction between the alpha 2-helix and beta 6-strand which contains the C-terminus probably stabilizes a conformation essential for assembly and is therefore required for the formation of pentamers.

27401831	20160713	Screening of sensitivity to mandipropamid of Plasmopara viticola populations from Italian vineyards by molecular and biological methods.	The objective of this work was to study the sensitivity to mandipropamid of 33 Plasmopara viticola populations utilizing both molecular and biological techniques. The PCR-RFLP technique was developed in order to detect the single point mutation, G1105S, occurring on the PvCesA3 gene. The sensitivity was also studied using the leaf-disc bioassay. Thirty-three downy mildew-infected leaf samples, collected from 2010 to 2013 from Italian vineyards, were used in the study. PCR-RFLP revealed the presence of 7 resistant, 12 sensitive, 14 mixed (sensitive and resistant) mutation profiles. Effective concentration for 50% inhibition rate (EC50 ) calculated from the bioassays showed an EC50 ?&lt;?1?mg?l(-1) for samples that showed sensitive profiles, while for those samples that had a mixed profile, EC50 ranged from &lt;1 to &gt;300?mg?l(-1) , and values for resistant profiles ranged from 200?28 to &gt;300?mg?l(-1) . The results suggest that P.?viticola populations infecting Italian vineyards are under a selection pressure due to CAA-based fungicide applications. We characterized Plasmopara viticola populations utilizing PCR-RFLP technique to detect a point mutation known to cause resistance to carboxylic acid amides (CAA) fungicides. Sensitivity of these samples to the mandipropamid fungicide was assayed by a leaf-disc method. In this work, we provide the first evidence about the presence of mandipropamid-resistant populations of P.?viticola from commercial vineyards in Italy. Improving the knowledge about development of resistant populations could enhance the current grapevine downy mildew management strategies and minimize the risk of the spread of mandipropamid and other CAA-resistant populations.

23134043	20121109	Identifying genetic variation for alcohol dependence.	Researchers are using various strategies to identify the genes that may be associated with alcoholism. The initial efforts primarily relied on candidate gene and linkage studies; more recently, however, modern advances in genotyping have resulted in widespread use of genome-wide association studies for alcohol dependence. The key findings of the earlier studies were that variations (i.e., polymorphisms) in the DNA sequences of the genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (i.e., the ADH1B gene), aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (i.e., the ALDH2 gene), and other alcohol-metabolizing enzymes mediate the risk for alcoholism; moreover, these polymorphisms also have an impact on the risk of alcohol-related cancers, such as esophageal cancer. In addition, a gene encoding one of the receptors for the neurotransmitter ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) known as GABRA2 seems to have a role in the development of alcohol dependence. Genome-wide association studies now offer a host of emerging opportunities, as well as challenges, for discovering the genetic etiology of alcohol dependence and for unveiling new treatment strategies.

The studied group comprises 124 patients with acute myocardial infarction on dual antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and thienopyridines. Antiplatelet therapy was monitored by platelet-rich plasma light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) using the APACT 4004 analyzer (Helena Laboratories) and by whole blood impedance aggregometry (multiple electrode aggregometry [MEA]) using the Multiplate analyzer (Dynabyte). Platelet aggregation was detected after stimulation with arachidonic acid for detection of aspirin resistance and with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and prostaglandin E1 for detection of thienopyridine resistance. To determine the frequencies of P2Y12 (i-744T&gt;C; rs2046934), P2Y12 (34C&gt;T; rs6785930), COX-1 (-842A&gt;G; rs10306114), GPVI (13254T&gt;C; rs1613662), and GPIbA (5T&gt;C; rs2243093) polymorphisms, DNA of patients with AIM was tested by real-time-polymerase chain reaction and melting curve analysis using the LightCycler 480 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics). The cut-off points used for patients with effective ASA therapy are 25% of aggregated platelets and 220 area under the curve (AUC)/min if LTA or MEA, respectively. The cut-off points used for effective thienopyridine therapy are 45% of aggregated platelets or 298 AUC/min, respectively. Both LTA and MEA found that aspirin and thienopyridine therapies failed in 14.51% and 25.8%, respectively. The data were statistically processed using the SPSS version 15 software (SPSS, Inc.). Associations between receptor mutation status and response to therapy were assessed with Fisher's exact test. The significance level was set at 0.05. The aim of our work was to use the two functional laboratory methods described earlier to assess both aspirin and thienopyridine resistance and to determine the contribution of genetic polymorphisms of platelet receptors to resistance to antiplatelet therapy in AIM. Fisher's exact test showed a significant statistical correlation between platelet function tests suitable for monitoring ASA resistance, that is, LTA and MEA, and mutation status of COX1_A1 (-A842G). Fisher's exact test showed no statistically significant correlations between platelet function tests suitable for monitoring ASA resistance, that is, LTA and MEA, and mutation status of GP1bA (-5T&gt;C) and GP6 (T13254C). Fisher's exact test showed no statistically significant correlation between mutational statuses of the receptors P2RY12 (i-T744C), P2RY12 (C34T), GP1bA (-5T&gt;C), or GP6 (T13254C) and response to antiplatelet therapy with 75?mg of clopidogrel.

8585732	19951101	DNA sequence differences of ampD mutants of Citrobacter freundii.	Three groups of mutants with increased levels of beta-lactamase synthesis were selected from Citrobacter freundii 382010 by beta-lactam antibiotics at concentrations just above the MIC. Uninduced cultures of the hyperinducible group had 3- to 5-fold more beta-lactamase activity than the parent strain, with one mutant (termed type b) expressing 19 times the activity of the parent strain; the partially derepressed group had a relative 55-fold increase, while fully derepressed strains exhibited a 460-fold increase. Upon induction by growth in the presence of cefoxitin (32 micrograms/ml) for 2 h, the hyperinducible and derepressed groups had similar relative beta-lactamase activities of 650 and 725, respectively. Induction of beta-lactamase activity from partially derepressed mutants resulted in a relative activity of only 240. The ampD gene including its promoter region was amplified from the parent strain and the mutant strains by PCR. The sequence of ampD from the parent strain showed only three nucleotide changes from a previously published sequence, none of which resulted in a change to the deduced amino acid sequence. Hyperinducible mutant strains of type a had an amino acid change of either a tryptophan in codon 95 to an arginine (Trp-95--&gt;Arg) (three mutants) or Ala-158--&gt;Asp (one mutant). The hyperinducible type b strain had the change Tyr-102--&gt;Asp. The derepressed strains had the following changes: Val-33--&gt;Gly (one mutant), Asp-164--&gt;Glu (one mutant), and Trp-95--&gt;termination codon (two mutants). We infer that the amino acid changes in the hyperinducible mutants result in altered AmpD activity, whereas, in contrast, they lead to an inactive protein in derepressed mutants. No nucleotide differences were found in the ampD gene from partially derepressed strains. 	Antimicrob._Agents_Chemother.	D016428 D013485
24787765	20140503	Two novel human cytomegalovirus NK cell evasion functions target MICA for lysosomal degradation.	NKG2D plays a major role in controlling immune responses through the regulation of natural killer (NK) cells, ?? and ?? T-cell function. This activating receptor recognizes eight distinct ligands (the MHC Class I polypeptide-related sequences (MIC) A andB, and UL16-binding proteins (ULBP)1-6) induced by cellular stress to promote recognition cells perturbed by malignant transformation or microbial infection. Studies into human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) have aided both the identification and characterization of NKG2D ligands (NKG2DLs). HCMV immediate early (IE) gene up regulates NKGDLs, and we now describe the differential activation of ULBP2 and MICA/B by IE1 and IE2 respectively. Despite activation by IE functions, HCMV effectively suppressed cell surface expression of NKGDLs through both the early and late phases of infection. The immune evasion functions UL16, UL142, and microRNA(miR)-UL112 are known to target NKG2DLs. While infection with a UL16 deletion mutant caused the expected increase in MICB and ULBP2 cell surface expression, deletion of UL142 did not have a similar impact on its target, MICA. We therefore performed a systematic screen of the viral genome to search of addition functions that targeted MICA. US18 and US20 were identified as novel NK cell evasion functions capable of acting independently to promote MICA degradation by lysosomal degradation. The most dramatic effect on MICA expression was achieved when US18 and US20 acted in concert. US18 and US20 are the first members of the US12 gene family to have been assigned a function. The US12 family has 10 members encoded sequentially through US12-US21; a genetic arrangement, which is suggestive of an 'accordion' expansion of an ancestral gene in response to a selective pressure. This expansion must have be an ancient event as the whole family is conserved across simian cytomegaloviruses from old world monkeys. The evolutionary benefit bestowed by the combinatorial effect of US18 and US20 on MICA may have contributed to sustaining the US12 gene family. 	PLoS_Pathog.	D016428 D013485
21226935	20110114	Insulin use and persistence in patients with type 2 diabetes adding mealtime insulin to a basal regimen: a retrospective database analysis.	The objective of this study was to characterize insulin use and examine factors associated with persistence to mealtime insulin among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) on stable basal insulin therapy initiating mealtime insulin therapy. Insulin use among patients with T2D initiating mealtime insulin was investigated using Thomson Reuters MarketScan? research databases from July 2001 through September 2006. The first mealtime insulin claim preceded by 6 months with 2 claims for basal insulin was used as the index event. A total of 21 months of continuous health plan enrollment was required. Patients were required to have a second mealtime insulin claim during the 12-month follow-up period. Persistence measure 1 defined non-persistence as the presence of a 90-day gap in mealtime insulin claims, effective the date of the last claim prior to the gap. Persistence measure 2 required 1 claim per quarter to be persistent. Risk factors for non-persistence were assessed using logistic regression. Patients initiating mealtime insulin (n = 4752; 51% male, mean age = 60.3 years) primarily used vial/syringe (87%) and insulin analogs (60%). Patients filled a median of 2, 3, and 4 mealtime insulin claims at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively, with a median time of 76 days between refills. According to measure 1, persistence to mealtime insulin was 40.7%, 30.2%, and 19.1% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Results for measure 2 were considerably higher: 74.3%, 55.3%, and 42.2% of patients were persistent at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Initiating mealtime insulin with human insulin was a risk factor for non-persistence by both measures (OR &lt; 0.80, p &lt; 0.01). Additional predictors of non-persistence at 12 months included elderly age, increased insulin copayment, mental health comorbidity, and polypharmacy (p &lt; 0.05 for all). Mealtime insulin use and persistence were both considerably lower than expected, and were significantly lower for human insulin compared to analogs. 	BMC_Endocr_Disord	D016428
17319831	20070227	Different inactivating mutations in the LU genes of three individuals with the Lutheran-null phenotype.	The null phenotype of the Lutheran blood group system, Lu(null) or Lu(a-b-), is characterized by the lack of all Lutheran system antigens. It can arise from three genetic backgrounds: recessive, dominant, or X-linked. Lu(null) of the recessive type appears to result from homozygosity for an inactive LU gene. Three unrelated recessive Lu(null) individuals were assessed by standard serologic tests. All exons of the LU gene were directly sequenced from amplified genomic DNA. The validity of the observed mutations within the LU gene was confirmed by the use of either restriction enzymes or allele-specific primers. All three individuals had the serologic characteristics of recessive Lu(null). One individual was doubly heterozygous for a nonsense mutation 691C&gt;T in exon 6 (Arg231STOP) and a deletion of LU exons 3 and 4. The other two samples showed homozygous nonsense mutations: one had 711C&gt;A in exon 6 (Cys237STOP) and the other 361C&gt;T in exon 3 (Arg121STOP). The results revealed four unique genetic backgrounds from three examples of the rare recessive Lu(null) phenotype, each encoding Lutheran glycoproteins with a disrupted structure.

6108321	19801210	Tightly bound calcium of adenosine triphosphatase in sarcoplasmic reticulum from rabbit skeletal muscle.	Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were shown to possess a class of tightly bound calcium ions, inaccessible to the chelator, ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid at 0 degrees C or 25 degrees C, amounting to 4.5 nmol/mg of protein (approximately 0.5 mol/mol (Ca2+,Mg2+)-ATPase). The calcium ionophores, A23187 and X537A, induced rapid exchange of tightly bound calcium in the presence of chelator. Chelator alone at 37 degrees C, caused irreversible loss of bound calcium, which correlated with uncoupling of transport from (Ca2+,Mg2+)-ATPase activity. Uncoupling was not accompanied by increased permeability to [14C]inulin. Slow exchange of tightly bound calcium with medium calcium was unaffected by turnover of the ATPase or by tryptic cleavage into 55,000- and 45,000-dalton fragments. Binding studies with labeled calcium suggested that tight binding involves a two-step process: Ca2+ + E in equilibrium K E . Ca2+ leads to E &lt; Ca2+ where E and &lt; Ca2+ represent the ATPase and tightly bound calcium, and K = 1.6 X 10(3) M-1. It is suggested that tightly bound calcium is located in a hydrophobic pocket in, or in close proximity to the ATPase, and, together with tightly bound adenine nucleotides (Aderem, A., McIntosh, D. B., and Berman, M. C. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 76, 3622-03632), is related to the ability of the ATPase to couple hydrolysis of ATP to vectorial transfer of calcium across the membrane. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428
23818486	20130703	Overexpression of the Escherichia coli TolQ protein leads to a null-FtsN-like division phenotype.	Mutations involving the Tol-Pal complex of Escherichia coli result in a subtle phenotype in which cells chain when grown under low-salt conditions. Here, the nonpolar deletion of individual genes encoding the cytoplasmic membrane-associated components of the complex (TolQ, TolR, TolA) produced a similar phenotype. Surprisingly, the overexpression of one of these proteins, TolQ, resulted in a much more overt phenotype in which cells occurred as elongated rods coupled in long chains when grown under normal salt conditions. Neither TolR nor TolA overexpression produced a phenotype, nor was the presence of either protein required for the TolQ-dependent phenotype. Consistent with their native membrane topology, the amino-terminal domain of TolQ specifically associated in vivo with the periplasmic domain of FtsN in a cytoplasm-based two-hybrid analysis. Further, the concomitant overexpression of FtsN rescued the TolQ-dependent phenotype, suggesting a model wherein the overexpression of TolQ sequesters FtsN, depleting this essential protein from the divisome during Gram-negative cell division. The role of the Tol-Pal system in division is discussed. 	Microbiologyopen	D016428 D013485
19077918	20081217	C-reactive protein genotypes and haplotypes, polymorphisms in NSAID-metabolizing enzymes, and risk of colorectal polyps.	C-reactive protein (CRP) is a nonspecific marker of inflammation linked to cardiovascular disease and possibly colon cancer. Polymorphisms in CRP have been associated with differential CRP concentrations among healthy adults, with some evidence for functional effects on CRP expression. A linkage disequilibrium-based tag single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-selection algorithm identified six tagSNPs for Europeans (-821A&gt;G, -390C&gt;T/A, 90A&gt;T, 838G&gt;C, 2043G&gt;A, and 4363C&gt;A), defining six haplotypes with more than 1% frequency. In a case-control study of adenomatous (n=491) or hyperplastic (n=184) polyps versus polyp-free controls (n=583) we investigated these SNPs in relation to colorectal polyp risk. Individuals with 838 GC or CC genotypes had a modestly, although not statistically significantly, increased risk of adenomas (odds ratio: 1.4 95% confidence interval: 0.9-2.1) and a nearly 2-fold increased risk of concurrent adenomas and hyperplastic polyps (odds ratio: 2.0 95% confidence interval: 1.1-3.6). Increased risk for concurrent adenomas and hyperplastic polyps was also observed for haplotype ACACAC. No other main associations were detected. Risk of adenomas associated with 2043G&gt;A differed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. Among NSAID nonusers, there was a suggestion that the GA or AA genotypes were associated with decreased risk of adenomas; this was not seen among NSAID users (P interaction=0.03). We also observed interactions between UGT1A1 [TA](7) promoter repeat polymorphism and CRP tagSNPs -390C&gt;T/A and 90A&gt;T, in which only the homozygous variant CRP genotype was associated with increased risk of adenoma among those with the UGT1A1 6rpt/6rpt genotype (P interaction=0.02 and 0.04 for -390C&gt;T/A and 90A&gt;T, respectively). These results provide limited support for associations between genetic variation in CRP and colorectal polyp risk. The observed interactions should be evaluated further.

21070952	20101113	Crystallographic and functional analysis of the ESCRT-I /HIV-1 Gag PTAP interaction.	Budding of HIV-1 requires the binding of the PTAP late domain of the Gag p6 protein to the UEV domain of the TSG101 subunit of ESCRT-I. The normal function of this motif in cells is in receptor downregulation. Here, we report the 1.4-1.6?? structures of the human TSG101 UEV domain alone and with wild-type and mutant HIV-1 PTAP and Hrs PSAP nonapeptides. The hydroxyl of the Thr or Ser residue in the P(S/T)AP motif hydrogen bonds with the main chain of Asn69. Mutation of the Asn to Pro, blocking the main-chain amide, abrogates PTAP motif binding in?vitro and blocks budding of HIV-1 from cells. N69P and other PTAP binding-deficient alleles of TSG101 did not rescue HIV-1 budding. However, the mutant alleles did rescue downregulation of endogenous EGF receptor. This demonstrates that the PSAP motif is not rate determining in EGF receptor downregulation under normal conditions. 	Structure	D016428 D052061 D052060 D013486

14577840	20031028	Quantitative trait loci in Anopheles gambiae controlling the encapsulation response against Plasmodium cynomolgi Ceylon.	Anopheles gambiae females are the world's most successful vectors of human malaria. However, a fraction of these mosquitoes is refractory to Plasmodium development. L3-5, a laboratory selected refractory strain, encapsulates transforming ookinetes/early oocysts of a wide variety of Plasmodium species. Previous studies on these mosquitoes showed that one major (Pen1) and two minor (Pen2, Pen3) autosomal dominant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) control the melanotic encapsulation response against P. cynomolgi B, a simian malaria originating in Malaysia. We have investigated the response of L3-5 to infection with P. cynomolgi Ceylon, a different but related parasite species, in crosses with the susceptible strain 4Arr. Refractoriness to this parasite is incompletely recessive. Infection and genotyping of F2 intercross females at genome-spanning microsatellite loci revealed that 3 autosomal QTLs control encapsulation of this species. Two loci map to the regions containing Pen2 and Pen3. The novel QTL maps to chromosome 3R, probably to polytene division 32 or 33. Thus the relative contribution of any QTL to oocyst encapsulation varies with the species of parasite. Further, different QTLs were most readily identified in different F2 families. This, like the F1 data, suggests that L3-5 is not genetically homogeneous and that somewhat different pathways may be used to achieve an encapsulation response. We have shown here that different QTLs are involved in responses against different Plasmodium parasites. 	BMC_Genet.	D016428 D013485 D013487
20720307	20100820	Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase genes COX1 and COX2 - novel modifiers of disease severity in cystic fibrosis patients.	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common autosomal recessive diseases among Caucasians caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene. However, the clinical outcome of CF pulmonary disease varies remarkably even in patients with the same CFTR genotype. This has led to a search for genetic modifiers located outside the CFTR gene. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of functional variants in prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase genes (COX1 and COX2) on the severity of lung disease in CF patients. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time when analysis of COX1 and COX2 as potential CF modifiers is provided. The study included 94 CF patients homozygous for F508del mutation of CFTR. To compare their clinical condition, several parameters were recorded, e.g. a unique clinical score: disease severity status (DSS). To analyse the effect of non-CFTR genetic polymorphisms on the clinical course of CF patients, the whole coding region of COX1 and selected COX2 polymorphisms were analysed. Statistical analysis of genotype-phenotype associations revealed a relationship between the heterozygosity status of identified polymorphisms and better lung function. These results mainly concern COX2 polymorphisms: -765G&gt;C and 8473T&gt;C. The COX1 and COX2 polymorphisms reducing COX protein levels had a positive effect on all analysed clinical parameters. This suggests an important role of these genes as protective modifiers of pulmonary disease in CF patients, due to inhibition of arachidonic acid conversion into prostaglandins, which probably reduces the inflammatory process.

26406335	20150926	A Pilot Study of Demographic and Dopaminergic Genetic Contributions to Weight Change in Kidney Transplant Recipients.	Kidney transplant recipients often experience a significant amount of weight gain in the first year post-transplantation. While demographic factors such as age, race, and sex have been associated with weight gain in this population, these factors do not explain all of the variability seen. A number of studies have suggested that genetics also plays a critical role in weight changes. Recently, alterations in the activity of the neurotransmitter dopamine have been associated with weight change, and gene expression studies in kidney transplant recipients have supported this association. The purpose of this pilot study is to first examine the feasibility and methodology, and then to examine the associations of age, race, sex, and genotype for 13 SNPs and 3 VNTRs in 9 dopaminergic pathway genes (ANKK1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, SLC6A3/DAT1, MAOA, MAOB, COMT, CPE) for associations with percent weight change at 12 months post-transplantation. Seventy kidney transplant recipients had demographic and clinical data collected as a part of a larger observational study. DNA was extracted from repository buffy coat samples taken at the time of transplant, and genotyped using Taqman and PCR based methods. Three SNPs were independently associated with percent weight change: ANKK1 rs1800497 (r = -0.28, p = 0.05), SLC6A3/DAT1 rs6347 (p = 0.046), and CPE rs1946816 (p = 0.028). Stepwise regression modelling confirmed the combined associations of age (p = 0.0021), DRD4 VNTR 4/5 genotype (p = 0.0074), and SLC6A3/DAT1 rs6347 CC genotype (p = 0.0009) and TT genotype (p = 0.0004) with percent weight change in a smaller sample (n = 35) of these kidney transplant recipients that had complete genotyping. These associations indicate that there may be a genetic, and an age component to weight changes post transplantation. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D064888 D052061
14742276	20040127	Abnormalities in alpha-dystroglycan expression in MDC1C and LGMD2I muscular dystrophies.	We recently identified mutations in the fukutin related protein (FKRP) gene in patients with congenital muscular dystrophy type 1C (MDC1C) and limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I (LGMD2I). The sarcolemma of these patients typically displays an immunocytochemical reduction of alpha-dystroglycan. In this report we extend these observations and report a clear correlation between the residual expression of alpha-dystroglycan and the phenotype. Three broad categories were identified. Patients at the severe end of the clinical spectrum (MDC1C) were compound heterozygote between a null allele and a missense mutation or carried two missense mutations and displayed a profound depletion of alpha-dystroglycan. Patients with LGMD with a Duchenne-like severity typically had a moderate reduction in alpha-dystroglycan and were compound heterozygotes between a common C826A (Leu276Ileu) FKRP mutation and either a missense or a nonsense mutation. Individuals with the milder form of LGMD2I were almost invariably homozygous for the Leu276Ile FKRP mutation and showed a variable but subtle alteration in alpha-dystroglycan immunolabeling. Our data therefore suggest a correlation between a reduction in alpha-dystroglycan, the mutation and the clinical phenotype in MDC1C and LGMD2I which supports the hypothesis that dystroglycan plays a central role in the pathogenesis of these disorders.

17493759	20070512	Importance of a hypervariable active-site residue in human Mu class glutathione transferases catalyzing the bioactivation of chemotherapeutic thiopurine prodrugs.	Glutathione transferases (GSTs) catalyze the bioactivation of the thiopurine prodrugs azathioprine, cis-6-(2-acetylvinylthio)purine (cAVTP) and trans-6-(2-acetylvinylthio)guanine (tAVTG), thereby releasing the antimetabolites 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine. In the GST Mu class, GST M1-1 has the highest catalytic efficiency, whereas GST M2-2 and other enzymes are less active. In the evolution of Mu class GSTs, residue 210 appears hypervariable and has particular functional significance. We demonstrate that the catalytic activity of GST M1-1 with cAVTP or tAVTG is successively diminished when wild-type Ser-210 is mutated into Ala followed by Thr. Conversely, mutating wild-type Thr-210 in GST M2-2 into Ala and Ser enhanced the corresponding activities. Comparisons were also made with GST M2-2 distinguished by Gly or Pro in position 210, as well as wild-type GSTs M4-4 and M5-5. The results suggest that the hydroxyl group of Ser in position 210 stabilizes the transition state of the GST-catalyzed reaction. The low activity of GSTs containing Thr in position 210 is probably due to steric hindrance caused by the beta-methyl group of the side chain. The ratios of the different catalytic efficiencies were translated into differences in the Gibbs free energies of transition state stabilization. The effects of the mutations were qualitatively parallel for the alternative substrates, but vary significantly in magnitude. From the evolutionary perspective the data show that a point mutation can alternatively enhance or attenuate the activity with a particular substrate and illustrate the functional plasticity of GSTs.

26829228	20160202	The Genetic Architecture of Murine Glutathione Transferases.	Glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes play a protective role against oxidative stress and may influence disease risk and drug pharmacokinetics. In this study, massive multiscalar trait profiling across a large population of mice derived from a cross between C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA2/J (D2)--the BXD family--was combined with linkage and bioinformatic analyses to characterize mechanisms controlling GST expression and to identify downstream consequences of this variation. Similar to humans, mice show a wide range in expression of GST family members. Variation in the expression of Gsta4, Gstt2, Gstz1, Gsto1, and Mgst3 is modulated by local expression QTLs (eQTLs) in several tissues. Higher expression of Gsto1 in brain and liver of BXD strains is strongly associated (P &lt; 0.01) with inheritance of the B6 parental allele whereas higher expression of Gsta4 and Mgst3 in brain and liver, and Gstt2 and Gstz1 in brain is strongly associated with inheritance of the D2 parental allele. Allele-specific assays confirmed that expression of Gsto1, Gsta4, and Mgst3 are modulated by sequence variants within or near each gene locus. We exploited this endogenous variation to identify coexpression networks and downstream targets in mouse and human. Through a combined systems genetics approach, we provide new insight into the biological role of naturally occurring variants in GST genes. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061 D013485
24026105	20130913	Downregulation of miR-145 contributes to lung adenocarcinoma cell growth to form brain metastases.	The development of metastases involves the dissociation of cells from the primary tumor, penetrating the basement membrane, invasion and exiting from the vasculature to seed, and finally colonizing in distant tissues. The formation of brain metastasis (BM) in lung adenocarcinoma remains poorly understood. We examined the differential microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of 5?primary and 3?brain metastatic lung adenocarcinoma samples by Agilent miRNA Microarrays. Five upregulated miRNAs (miRs-9*, -1471, 718, 3656, 720) and 3?downregulated miRNAs (miRs-214, -145 and -23a) were detected. The 4?most significantly deregulated miRNAs (miR-145, miR-214, miR-9* and miR-1471) were validated in the additional 43?samples (35?primary and 8?brain metastatic lung adenocarcinoma samples) using TaqMan quantitative PCR. By functional assay, we found that the expression of miR-145 can regulate the ability of proliferation of A549 and SPC-A1 cells in?vitro, but is not related to lymph node metastasis, migration and invasion. These results suggest that miR-145 may have a cell type-specific function and play important roles in the process of BM from lung adenocarcinoma. 	Oncol._Rep.	D016428 D013485
17713120	20070824	[Clinical molecular genetics for PARK8 (LRRK2)].	Parkinson's disease (PD) is an etiologically heterogeneous disorder characterized by parkinsonism (bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability) with good response to L-dopa. PD is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer disease. Although the majority of PD cases are sporadic, 5-10% of PD is monogenic form of PD as familial PD (FPD). Multifactorial genetic-environmental interaction has been thought in PD pathogenesis, although these interactions are still poorly understood. In 2004, LRRK2 was identified as the causative gene for PARK8 originally mapped in the large Japanese Sagamihara family with late-onset autosomal dominant PD (ADPD). Patients with LRRK2 mutations account for approximately 2-13% of ADPD and 0.5-3% of sporadic PD. Genetically, LRRK2 mutations have been distributed worldwide with some ethnic differences by single founder effect such as G2019S, R1441G, and G2385R variants. LRRK2 G2385R was reported to be a risk factor for sporadic PD in Asia. Clinically, most patients with LRRK2 mutations develop typical idiopathic PD, however, variable clinical features and pathologies such as diffuse Lewy body disease, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have been reported. Although Lewy bodies have been considered as a pathological hallmark for sporadic PD classically, some FPD and sporadic PD patients with heterozygous LRRK2 mutations or homozygous parkin mutations have no Lewy bodies. On the other hand, LRRK2 was reported as a component of Lewy bodies. Based on the variability, multifunction of LRRK2 such as phosphorylation of other proteins, especially, alpha-synuclein and tau, have been suggested. As interaction of Parkin and LRRK2 was reported, interaction and intersection among the autosomal-recessive or autosomal-dominant PD proteins could be involved in some common pathways, and LRRK2 may play an important role as a key FPD gene product. Identification of PARK8 and LRRK2 has given meaningful insights in not only PD but also numerous neurodegenerative disorders such as synucleinopathies and tauopathies with or without Lewy bodies.

25275628	20141003	Sequence analysis of six blood pressure candidate regions in 4,178 individuals: the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) targeted sequencing study.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified multiple loci for blood pressure (BP) and hypertension. Six genes--ATP2B1, CACNB2, CYP17A1, JAG1, PLEKHA7, and SH2B3--were evaluated for sequence variation with large effects on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Targeted genomic sequence was determined in 4,178 European ancestry participants from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium. Common variants (?50 minor allele copies) were evaluated individually and rare variants (minor allele frequency, MAF?1%) were aggregated by locus. 464 common variants were identified across the 6 genes. An upstream CYP17A1 variant, rs11191416 (MAF?=?0.09), was the most significant association for SBP (P?=?0.0005); however the association was attenuated (P?=?0.0469) after conditioning on the GWAS index single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). A PLEKHA7 intronic variant was the strongest DBP association (rs12806040, MAF?=?0.007, P?=?0.0006) and was not in LD (r??=?0.01) with the GWAS SNP. A CACNB2 intronic SNP, rs1571787, was the most significant association with PP (MAF?=?0.27, P?=?0.0003), but was not independent from the GWAS SNP (r??=?0.34). Three variants (rs6163 and rs743572 in the CYP17A1 region and rs112467382 in PLEKHA7) were associated with BP traits (P&lt;0.001). Rare variation, aggregately assessed in the 6 regions, was not significantly associated with BP measures. Six targeted gene regions, previously identified by GWAS, did not harbor novel variation with large effects on BP in this sample. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D057666 D052061 D013485
24600987	20140308	Plasma annexin A5, anti-annexin A5 antibodies and annexin A5 polymorphism in Egyptian female patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome.	Annexin A5 exhibits anticoagulant properties that appear to be defective in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) resulting in repeated thrombosis and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). APS occurs frequently in association with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The present study aimed to find out a possible relationship between annexin A5 (gene polymorphism, antibodies or plasma level) and the pathophysiology of SLE, APS and RPL. 47 female patients divided into 3 groups (SLE, APS and RPL) and 20 healthy controls are included in the study. Detection of annexin A5 (-1C/T) gene polymorphism was done by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. Anti-annexin A5 antibodies (IgG and IgM) and annexin A5 plasma level were measured by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The frequency of annexin A5 (-1C/T) polymorphism was significantly higher in SLE related groups (p = 0.02), but it did not correlate with RPL (p = 0.57) or annexin A5 level (p = 0.5). Anti-annexin A5 IgM level was significantly higher among APS patients and was associated with RPL (p = 0.005, odds ratio = 23.75, 95% confidence interval = 2.15 - 262.48). Annexin A5 (-1C/T) gene mutation may play a role in the pathophysiology of SLE. Anti-annexin A5 IgM was the antibody associated with RPL in this group of APS patients. Annexin A5 plasma levels are not affected by the presence of annexin A5 (-1C/T) polymorphism. 	Clin._Lab.	D016428
18082611	20071218	Structural organization of the anaphase-promoting complex bound to the mitotic activator Slp1.	The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a conserved multisubunit E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase required to signal the degradation of key cell-cycle regulators. Using single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we have determined a three-dimensional (3D) structure of the core APC/C from Schizosaccharomyces pombe bound to the APC/C activator Slp1/Cdc20. At the 27 A resolution of our density map, the APC/C is a triangular-shaped structure, approximately 19x17x15 nm in size, with a deep internal cavity and a prominent horn-like protrusion emanating from a lip of the cavity. Using antibody labeling and mutant analysis, we have localized 12 of 13 core APC/C components, as well as the position of the activator Slp1, enabling us to propose a structural model of APC/C organization. Comparison of the APC/C with another multiprotein E3 ligase, the SCF complex, uncovers remarkable structural similarities. 	Mol._Cell	D016428 D052061 D013485 D013486
11972033	20020425	Cys-328 of IscS and Cys-63 of IscU are the sites of disulfide bridge formation in a covalently bound IscS/IscU complex: implications for the mechanism of iron-sulfur cluster assembly.	IscS and IscU from Escherichia coli cooperate with each other in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters. IscS catalyzes the desulfurization of L-cysteine to produce L-alanine and sulfur. Cys-328 of IscS attacks the sulfur atom of L-cysteine, and the sulfane sulfur derived from L-cysteine binds to the Sgamma atom of Cys-328. In the course of the cluster assembly, IscS and IscU form a covalent complex, and a sulfur atom derived from L-cysteine is transferred from IscS to IscU. The covalent complex is thought to be essential for the cluster biogenesis, but neither the nature of the bond connecting IscS and IscU nor the residues involved in the complex formation have been determined, which have thus far precluded the mechanistic analyses of the cluster assembly. We here report that a covalent bond is formed between Cys-328 of IscS and Cys-63 of IscU. The bond is a disulfide bond, not a polysulfide bond containing sulfane sulfur between the two cysteine residues. We also found that Cys-63 of IscU is essential for the IscU-mediated activation of IscS: IscU induced a six-fold increase in the cysteine desulfurase activity of IscS, whereas the IscU mutant with a serine substitution for Cys-63 had no effect on the activity. Based on these findings, we propose a mechanism for an early stage of iron-sulfur cluster assembly: the sulfur transfer from IscS to IscU is initiated by the attack of Cys-63 of IscU on the Sgamma atom of Cys-328 of IscS that is bound to sulfane sulfur derived from L-cysteine.

12169695	20020810	Stalk segment 5 of the yeast plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase. Labeling with a fluorescent maleimide reveals a conformational change during glucose activation.	Glucose is well known to cause a rapid, reversible activation of the yeast plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase, very likely mediated by phosphorylation of two or more Ser/Thr residues near the C terminus. Recent mutagenesis studies have shown that glucose-dependent activation can be mimicked constitutively by amino acid substitutions in stalk segment 5 (S5), an alpha-helical stretch connecting the catalytic part of the ATPase with transmembrane segment 5 (Miranda, M., Allen, K. E., Pardo, J. P., and Slayman, C. W. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 22485-22490). In the present work, the fluorescent maleimide Alexa-488 has served as a probe for glucose-dependent changes in the conformation of S5. Experiments were carried out in a &quot;3C&quot; version of the ATPase, from which six of nine native cysteines had been removed by site-directed mutagenesis to eliminate background labeling by Alexa-488. In this construct, three of twelve cysteines introduced at various positions along S5 (A668C, S672C, and D676C) reacted with the Alexa dye in a glucose-independent manner, as shown by fluorescent labeling of the 100 kDa Pma1 polypeptide and by isolation and identification of the corresponding tryptic peptides. Especially significant was the fact that three additional cysteines reacted with Alexa-488 more rapidly (Y689C) or only (V665C and L678C) in plasma membranes from glucose-metabolizing cells. The results support a model in which the S5 alpha-helix undergoes a significant change in conformation to expose positions 665, 678, and 689 during glucose-dependent activation of the ATPase.

26944198	20160306	Genetic Mutation that May Contribute to Failure of Prolapse Surgery in White Women: A Case-Control Study.	To identify a potential genetic basis for early failure after prolapse surgery. Case-control study (Canadian Task Force classification II). This study was carried out in 1 academic community medical center referral practice, and all patients had surgery at 1?of 2 hospitals. Ten women with early, multicompartment prolapse recurrence after robotic sacrocolpopexy compared with 40 control subjects with known success after the same procedure. Patients were treated with robotic sacrocolpopexy. DNA was isolated and initially genotyped on a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to direct more detailed exome analyses. Exome sequences were mapped to the Human Genome Reference Sequence (GRCh37), and variants were compared between groups and to participants in the 1000 Genomes Project. Statistical analyses were performed using a software package commonly used in genetics research. TaqMan assay was used for verification, and p?values were adjusted using the false discovery rate. Demographics of groups were compared using ?(2), Mann-Whitney U, and t tests. A SNP [rs171821] located near the ZFYVE16?gene was associated with patients but not control subjects, and the false discovery rate-adjusted p value was .046 (odds ratio, 45.2; 95% confidence interval, 5.06-403). Exome analyses of this gene yielded another SNP [rs249038 (G/A)] in 6 of 10 patients and none of the control subjects (p?=?.02). This SNP causes a?heterozygous missense mutation of glycine to serine predicted to be deleterious by the Protein Variation Effect Analyzer and was also very rare among participants in the 1000 Genomes Project (p?&lt;?.001). Two SNPs located near the ZFYVE16 gene on chromosome 5 may have played a role in the early, multicompartment sacrocolpopexy failure experienced by our patients.

26726071	20160105	Snord116 is critical in the regulation of food intake and body weight.	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the predominant genetic cause of obesity in humans. Recent clinical reports have suggested that micro-deletion of the Snord116 gene cluster can lead to PWS, however, the extent of the contributions of the encoded snoRNAs is unknown. Here we show that mice lacking Snord116 globally have low birth weight, increased body weight gain, energy expenditure and hyperphagia. Consistent with this, microarray analysis of hypothalamic gene expression revealed a significant alteration in feeding related pathways that was also confirmed by in situ hybridisation. Importantly, selective deletion of Snord116 only from NPY expressing neurons mimics almost exactly the global deletion phenotype including the persistent low birth weight, increased body weight gain in early adulthood, increased energy expenditure and hyperphagia. Mechanistically, the lack of Snord116 in NPY neurons leads to the upregulation of NPY mRNA consistent with the hyperphagic phenotype and suggests a critical role of Snord116 in the control of NPY neuronal functions that might be dysregulated in PWS.

10973962	20000907	The insulin-like growth factor-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway regulates myogenin expression in normal myogenic cells but not in rhabdomyosarcoma-derived RD cells.	Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) can stimulate skeletal muscle differentiation. One of the molecular mechanisms underlying IGF-stimulated myogenesis is transcriptional induction of myogenin. The current work is aimed to elucidate the signaling pathways mediating the IGF effect on myogenin promoter in mouse C2C12 myogenic cells. We show that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and p70(S6K) are crucial signaling molecules mediating the stimulatory effect of IGFs on myogenin expression. We have identified three cis-elements, namely the E box, MEF2, and MEF3 sites, within the 133-base pair mouse proximal myogenin promoter that are under the control of the IGF/PI3K/Akt pathway. Simultaneous mutation of all three elements completely abolishes activation of the myogenin promoter by PI3K/Akt. We demonstrate that PI3K/Akt can increase both the MyoD and the MEF2-dependent reporter activity by enhancing the transcriptional activity of MyoD and MEF2. Interestingly, IGF1 does not enhance myogenin expression in Rhabdomyosarcoma-derived RD cells. Consistently, the constitutively active PI3K/Akt fail to activate the myogenic reporters, suggesting the IGF/PI3K/Akt pathway is defective in RD cells and the defect(s) is downstream to PI3K/Akt. This is the first time that a defect in the IGF/PI3K/Akt pathway has been revealed in RD cells which provides another clue to future therapeutic treatment of Rhabdomyosarcoma. 	J._Biol._Chem.

22357470	20120224	[Relationship between TIM-4 polymorphism and childhood asthma].	To elucidate whether the polymorphism of asthma immune regulator gene TIM-4 is associated with the risk of childhood allergic asthma in the southwest region of China. TIM-4 gene promoter region RS6882076 and intron RS4704727 were studied. PCR-RFLP was used to test the genotypes of two polymorphism loci among 579 cases (average 7.2 years old) of asthma and 524 controls (average 7.6 years old) in a case-control study. There were significant differences in the frequency of gene types at RS4704727 site between the asthma and the control groups (P&lt;0.01). The results of PCR-RFLP showed that the polyporphisms of RS6882076 and RS4704727 in TIM-4 gene were present in this study population. The frequency of T allele at the RS4704727 site in the asthma group was significantly lower than that in the control group (OR=1.603; 95%CI 1.304-1.971; P&lt;0.01). There were no significant differences in the frequencies of gene types and allele at RS6882076 site between the two groups (P&gt;0.05). RS4704727 polymorphism of TIM-4 gene may be associated with childhood asthma, providing a better understanding of the pathogenesis of childhood asthma in the Southwest region of China.

18759691	20080902	Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors for overriding Bcr-Abl/T315I: from the second to third generation.	Treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has changed drastically with the emergence of the Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), imatinib mesylate. However, primary and secondary resistance have frequently been reported, particularly in patients with advanced-stage disease. Point mutations within the Abl kinase domain that interfere with imatinib binding are the most critical cause of imatinib resistance. In order to override this resistance, several second generation ATP-competitive Abl TKIs including dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib and INNO-406 have been developed. Despite promising clinical results from these novel Abl TKIs for most mutations, the frequently observed mutant T315I is not effectively targeted by any of these agents. Thus, identification of novel agents and the development of new strategies for the effective treatment of CML patients with the T315I mutation are important and challenging tasks. In this review, the current status of novel agents for CML treatment is overviewed as follows: pathogenesis and features of CML; imatinib and second-generation Abl TKIs; why Abl TKIs are not effective against T315I; and novel agents that may override the T315I mutation.

16511311	20060303	A single point mutation changes the crystallization behavior of Mycoplasma arthritidis-derived mitogen.	Mycoplasma arthritidis-derived mitogen (MAM) functions as a conventional superantigen (SAg). Although recombinant MAM has been crystallized by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method, the crystals diffracted poorly to only 5.0 A resolution, with large unit-cell parameters a = 163.8, b = 93.0, c = 210.9 A, beta = 93.7 degrees in the monoclinic space group P2(1). Unit-cell content analysis revealed that as many as 24 molecules could be present in the asymmetric unit. Systematic alanine mutagenesis was applied in order to search for mutants that give crystals of better quality. Two mutants, L50A and K201A, were crystallized under the same conditions as wild-type MAM (MAMwt). Crystals of the L50A mutant are isomorphous with those of MAMwt, while a new crystal form was obtained for the K201 mutant, belonging to the cubic space group P4(1)32 with unit-cell parameters a = b = c = 181.9 A. Diffraction data were collected to 3.6 and 2.8 A resolution from crystals of the MAM L50A and K201A mutants, respectively. Molecular-replacement calculations suggest the presence of two molecules in the asymmetric unit for the MAM K201A mutant crystal, resulting in a VM of 5.0 A Da(-1) and a solvent content of 75%. An interpretable electron-density map for the MAM K201A mutant crystal was produced using the molecular-replacement method. 	Acta_Crystallogr._Sect._F_Struct._Biol._Cryst._Commun.

26795254	20160123	Genetic basis for glandular trichome formation in cotton.	Trichomes originate from epidermal cells and can be classified as either glandular or non-glandular. Gossypium species are characterized by the presence of small and darkly pigmented lysigenous glands that contain large amounts of gossypol. Here, using a dominant glandless mutant, we characterize GoPGF, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix domain-containing transcription factor, that we propose is a positive regulator of gland formation. Silencing GoPGF leads to a completely glandless phenotype. A single nucleotide insertion in GoPGF, introducing a premature stop codon is found in the duplicate recessive glandless mutant (gl2gl3). The characterization of GoPGF helps to unravel the regulatory network of glandular structure biogenesis, and has implications for understanding the production of secondary metabolites in glands. It also provides a potential molecular basis to generate glandless seed and glanded cotton to not only supply fibre and oil but also provide a source of protein for human consumption.

11916629	20020328	Aromatase and breast cancer: W39R, an inactive protein.	Aromatase (CYP19) catalyzes the conversion of androgens into estrogens. It is in particular involved in development, reproduction and breast cancer. One of its polymorphisms, W39R localized in the N-terminal region of CYP19, significantly decreases breast cancer risk among Japanese women and was chosen for this study. In this work, we studied the structure-function relationships between W39R polymorphism and CYP19 enzyme activity. To examine the kinetic properties of the mutant W39R recombinant protein in transfected human cells devoid of steroidogenic activity. Expression vectors for the wild-type or the mutated R39 aromatase were transiently transfected into E293 human embryonal kidney cells. The conversions of androstenedione to estrone and of testosterone and nortestosterone to 17beta-estradiol were assayed by RIA. Expression of recombinant cDNAs was analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting. W39R recombinant protein was devoid of aromatase activity whatever the substrate used. This absence of activity was not due to the lack of expression of the recombinant enzyme since the mRNA and protein were detected. Our present in vitro study shows that the R39 mutant is unable to synthesize estrogens. This work provides a novel observation, being consistent with the fact that Japanese women with the variant allele (arg) have significantly lower risk of developing a breast tumor.

9398221	19971216	Catalytic mechanism of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of CheY: kinetic characterization of imidazole phosphates as phosphodonors and the role of acid catalysis.	Kinetic and equilibrium measurements of phosphotransfer events involving CheY carried out over a range of pH conditions elucidated several features of the phosphotransfer mechanism. Using tryptophan fluorescence intensity measurements as a monitor of phosphorylation, we showed that phosphorylation using small molecule phosphodonors occurred by fast association of CheY with the phosphodonor, followed by rate-limiting phosphotransfer. Two previously uncharacterized phosphodonors, monophosphoimidazole and diphosphoimdazole, were able to phosphorylate CheY at a concentration about 6-fold lower than that of the previously described phosphodonors acetyl phosphate and phosphoramidate. This was shown to be due to tighter binding of the imidazole phosphates to CheY and implied the presence of binding interactions between CheY and the imidazole group. The ability of CheY to autophosphorylate through the pH range of 5-10 differed for various phosphodonors. Acetyl phosphate and diphosphoimidazole were unaffected by pH over this range, whereas phosphoramidate and monophosphoimidazole showed a steep dependence on pH with a loss of phosphorylation ability at about pH 7.4 (midpoint) for monophosphoimidazole and pH 7.8 (midpoint) for phosphoramidate. This behavior correlated with the loss of the positive charge on the nitrogen atom in the nitrogen-phosphorus bond in both monophosphoimidazole and phosphoramidate and implied that CheY was not capable of donating a proton to the leaving group in phosphotransfer with small molecules. The rate of phosphotransfer from [32P]CheA-phosphate to wild type CheY also decreased markedly (&gt; 150 times) between pH 7.5 and 10. Because the mutant CheY proteins K109R and T87A showed the same pH dependence as the wild type, the loss of activity in the alkaline range could not be attributed to deprotonation of either of these active site residues. This observation, combined with the moderate decreases in phosphotransfer rates for these mutants relative to that of wild type CheY, indicated that it is unlikely that either Thr87 or Lys109 plays a direct role in the catalysis of phosphotransfer. Finally, we showed that the rate of autodephosphorylation of CheY was independent of pH over the range of 4.5-11. Together, these studies led to a model with CheY playing a largely entropic role in its own phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. 	Biochemistry	D003160 D016428 D013487
26617343	20151201	Observed deep energetic eddies by seamount wake.	Despite numerous surface eddies are observed in the ocean, deep eddies (a type of eddies which have no footprints at the sea surface) are much less reported in the literature due to the scarcity of their observation. In this letter, from recently collected current and temperature data by mooring arrays, a deep energetic and baroclinic eddy is detected in the northwestern South China Sea (SCS) with its intensity, size, polarity and structure being characterized. It remarkably deepens isotherm at deep layers by the amplitude of ~120?m and induces a maximal velocity amplitude about 0.18?m/s, which is far larger than the median velocity (0.02?m/s). The deep eddy is generated in a wake when a steering flow in the upper layer passes a seamount, induced by a surface cyclonic eddy. More observations suggest that the deep eddy should not be an episode in the area. Deep eddies significantly increase the velocity intensity and enhance the mixing in the deep ocean, also have potential implication for deep-sea sediments transport. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D013485
26535094	20151105	Effect of platform switching on the peri-implant bone: A finite element study.	There exists a relation between the presence and location of the micro-gap and the loss of peri implant bone. Several authors have shown that the treatments based on the use of platform switching result in less peri-implant bone loss and an increased tissue stability. The purpose of this study was to analyse the effect of the platform switching on the distribution of stresses on the peri-implant bone using the finite element method. A realistic 3D full-mandible finite element model representing cortical bone and trabecular bone was used to study the distribution of the stress on the bone induced by an implant of diameter 4.1 mm. Two abutments were modelled. The first one, of diameter 4.1 mm, was used in the reference model to represent a conventional implant. The second one, of diameter 3.2 mm, was used to represent the implant with platform switching. Both models were subjected to axial and oblique masticatory loads. The analyses showed that, although no relevant differences can be found for the trabecular bone, the use of platform switching reduces the maximum stress level in the cortical bone by almost 36% with axial loads and by 40% with oblique loads. The full 3D Finite Element model, that can be used to investigate the influence of other parameters (implant diameter, connexion type, ?) on the biomechanical behaviour of the implant, showed that this stress reduction can be a biomechanical reasons to explain why the platform switching seems to reduce or eliminate crestal bone resorption after the prosthetic restoration.

24236291	20131116	Evaluation of NK cell function by flowcytometric measurement and impedance based assay using real-time cell electronic sensing system.	Although real-time cell electronic sensing (RT-CES) system-based natural killer (NK) cytotoxicity has been introduced, it has not been evaluated using human blood samples. In present study, we measured flowcytometry based assay (FCA) and RT-CES based NK cytotoxicity and analyzed degranulation activity (CD107a) and cytokine production. In 98 healthy individuals, FCA with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at effector to target (E/T) ratio of 32 revealed 46.5 ? 2.6% cytolysis of K562 cells, and 23.5 ? 1.1% of NK cells showed increased degranulation. In RT-CES system, adherent NIH3T3 target cells were resistant to basal killing by PBMC or NK cells. NK cell activation by adding IL-2 demonstrated real-time dynamic killing activity, and lymphokine-activated PBMC (E/T ratio of 32) from 15 individuals showed 59.1 ? 6.2% cytotoxicity results after 4 hours incubation in RT-CES system. However, there was no significant correlation between FCA and RT-CES cytotoxicity. After K562 target cell stimulation, PBMC produced profound proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines/chemokines including IL-2, IL-8, IL-10, MIP-1 ? ? , IFN- ? , and TNF- ? , and cytokine/chemokine secretion was related to flowcytometry-based NK cytotoxicity. These data suggest that RT-CES and FCA differ in sensitivity, applicability and providing information, and further investigations are necessary in variable clinical conditions.

26627473	20151203	Aedes aegypti has spatially structured and seasonally stable populations in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.	Dengue fever, the most prevalent global arboviral disease, represents an important public health problem in Indonesia. Control of dengue relies on the control of its main vector, the mosquito Aedes aegypti, yet nothing is known about the population history and genetic structure of this insect in Indonesia. Our aim was to assess the spatio-temporal population genetic structure of Ae. aegypti in Yogyakarta, a densely populated region on Java with common dengue outbreaks. We used multiple marker systems (microsatellites, nuclear and mitochondrial genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms generated via Restriction-site Associated DNA sequencing) to analyze 979 Ae. aegypti individuals collected from the Yogyakarta city and the surrounding hamlets during the wet season in 2011 and the following dry season in 2012. We employed individual- and group-based approaches for inferring genetic structure. We found that Ae. aegypti in Yogyakarta has spatially structured and seasonally stable populations. The spatial structuring was significant for the nuclear and mitochondrial markers, while the temporal structuring was non-significant. Nuclear markers identified three main genetic clusters, showing that hamlets have greater genetic isolation from each other and from the inner city sites. However, one hamlet experienced unrestricted mosquito interbreeding with the inner city, forming a single genetic cluster. Genetic distance was poorly correlated with the spatial distance among mosquito samples, suggesting stronger influence of human-assisted gene flow than active mosquito movement on spatial genetic structure. A star-shaped mitochondrial haplotype network and a significant R(2) test statistic (R(2)?=?0.0187, P?=?0.001) support the hypothesis that Ae. aegypti in Yogyakarta originated from a small or homogeneous source and has undergone a relatively recent demographic expansion. We report the first insights into the spatio-temporal genetic structure and the underlying processes in the dengue fever mosquito from Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Our results provide valuable information on the effectiveness of local control measures as well as guidelines for the implementation of novel biocontrol strategies such as release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes.

20567899	20100623	Possible risk modifications in the association between MnSOD Ala-9Val polymorphism and breast cancer risk: subgroup analysis and evidence-based sample size calculation for a future trial.	Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) has been identified as an important scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can cause oxidative stress followed by breast cancer. A number of subsequent population-based studies have investigated the association between MnSOD Ala-9Val polymorphism and the risk of breast cancer. However, these studies have yielded conflicting results. This fact implies that the effect of MnSOD Ala-9Val polymorphism on the susceptibility to breast cancer may be modified by other risk factors. To provide a more definitive conclusion, a full meta-analysis combining and summarizing 16 studies was first performed using both traditional and Bayesian approaches. During this step, a recessive inheritance mode was determined after a biological justification. The capability of the Bayesian method was highlighted in the estimation of a pooled odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. As a result, no significant association was observed (OR = 0.978, CI = 0.914-1.046). Bayesian meta-regression and subgroup analysis were then conducted to find possible risk modifications by other factors, including menopausal status, ethnicity effect, use of oral contraceptives, use of hormone replacement therapy, fruits and vegetables intake, vitamin supplement, and body mass index. While the power of most subgroups may be insufficient to make a statistical statement, an evidence-based sample size calculation based upon updated meta-analysis was performed to power a future trial. For example, approximately 5,000 subjects are required for a new Asian study (2,500 cases and 2,500 controls) to achieve 80% power. 	Breast_Cancer_Res._Treat.	D016428 D017418 D013485
25052705	20140724	The Brazilian founder mutation TP53 p.R337H is uncommon in Portuguese women diagnosed with breast cancer.	Since the first studies reporting the TP53 p.R337H mutation as founder mutation in Southern and Southeastern Brazil, there has been controversy on its origin. Preliminary analysis of a small subset of Brazilian mutation carriers revealed that the haplotype incided on a Caucasian background. The vast majority of carriers identified today reside in Brazil or, if identified in other countries, are Brazilian immigrants. To our knowledge, the only two exceptions of carriers without a recognizable link with Brazil are two European families, from Portugal and Germany. Haplotype analysis in the Portuguese family revealed the same haplotype identified in Brazilian individuals, but in the German family, a distinct haplotype was found. Knowing that a significant proportion of women with breast cancer (BC) in Southern Brazil are p.R337H carriers, we analyzed p.R337H in a Portuguese cohort of women diagnosed with this disease. Median age at diagnosis among the first 573 patients tested was 60 years and 100 (17.4%) patients had been diagnosed at or under the age of 45 years. Mutation screening failed to identify the mutation in the 573 patients tested. These results are in contrast with the mutation frequency observed in a study including 815 BC-affected women from Brazil, in which carrier frequencies of 12.1 and 5.1% in pre- and postmenopausal women were observed, respectively. These findings suggest that the Brazilian founder mutation p.R337H, the most frequent germline TP53 mutation reported to date, is not a common germline alteration in Portuguese women diagnosed with BC.

8996971	19960901	A recurrent 1992delCT mutation of the type X collagen gene in a Japanese patient with Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia.	We report here a recurrent frameshift mutation within the carboxyl-terminal noncollagenous domain coding region of the type X collagen gene (COL10A1) in a Japanese patient with Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia. The mutation involves deletion of a CT dinucleotide from position 1992 (1992delCT), and produces a frameshift which creates a premature termination codon close to the site of the deletion. The predicted length of the mutant polypeptide is 664 amino acids, which is shorter than the wild type polypeptide (680 amino acids). A 1992delCT mutation of COL10A1 has been previously reported in one family. The independent occurrence of de novo mutation of this specific dinucleotide repeat suggests that this region is a possible mutational hot spot on COL10A1. 	Jpn._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
21543897	20110506	RON (MST1R) is a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.	RON (MST1R) is one of two members of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase family, along with parent receptor MET. RON has a putative role in several cancers, but its expression and function is poorly characterized in gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. A recognized functional role of MET tyrosine kinase in gastroesophageal cancer has led to early phase clinical trials using MET inhibitors, with unimpressive results. Therefore, the role of RON in gastroesophageal cancer, as well as its role in cooperative signaling with MET and as a mechanism of resistance to MET inhibition, was studied in gastroesophageal tissues and cell lines. By IHC, RON was highly over-expressed in 74% of gastroesophageal samples (n=94), and over-expression was prognostic of poor survival (p=0.008); RON and MET co-expression occurred in 43% of samples and was prognostic of worst survival (p=0.03). High MST1R gene copy number by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and/or array comparative genomic hybridization, was seen in 35.5% (16/45) of cases. High MST1R gene copy number correlated with poor survival (p=0.01), and was associated with high MET and ERBB2 gene copy number. A novel somatic MST1R juxtamembrane mutation R1018G was found in 11% of samples. RON signaling was functional in cell lines, activating downstream effector STAT3, and resulted in increased viability over controls. RON and MET co-stimulation assays led to enhanced malignant phenotypes over stimulation of either receptor alone. Growth inhibition as evidenced by viability and apoptosis assays was optimal using novel blocking monoclonal antibodies to both RON and MET, versus either alone. SU11274, a classic MET small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked signaling of both receptors, and proved synergistic when combined with STAT3 inhibition (combination index &lt; 1). These preclinical studies define RON as an important novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for gastroesophageal cancer warranting further investigation. 	Cancer_Biol._Ther.

7655456	19950601	Interallelic complementation of beta-subunit defects in fibroblasts of patients with propionyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency microinjected with mutant cDNA constructs.	Propionic acidemia results from deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) activity. PCC is a biotin-dependent, mitochondrial enzyme composed of alpha- and beta-subunits (structure, alpha 4 beta 4), with the alpha-subunit containing the biotin ligand. About two-thirds of fibroblast lines from patients with mutations in the PCCB (beta-subunit) gene show interallelic complementation in cell fusion experiments (the pccB and pccC subgroups of the pccBC major group defining beta-subunit mutations, where pccB x pccC fusions show complementation). We previously identified the mutations in several pccB or pccC cell lines and suggested that point mutations or small, in-frame insertions or deletions were likely responsible for the complementation obtained between beta-subunit defects. To test this hypothesis, we have introduced five different mutations (three pccB and two pccC) that fit these criteria into a PCC beta-subunit cDNA plasmid expressed from a cytomegalovirus promoter. The cDNA plasmids were microinjected into mutant fibroblasts and the cells were assayed by radioautographic detection of 14C-propionate incorporation into cellular macromolecules. Four different mutations (Pro228Leu or dupKICK140 from pccB or delta IIe408 or Arg410Trp from pccC) complemented cells from complementation subgroups in a pattern congruent with the results obtained in cell fusion experiments. The fifth mutation, Arg536Asn, which was found both in a complementing pccB and a non-complementing pccBC cell line, failed to complement any of the mutant cell lines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) 	Hum._Mol._Genet.

The title compounds, [(1R,3R,4R,5R,6S)-4,5-bis-(acet-yloxy)-7-oxo-2-oxabi-cyclo[4.2.0]octan-3-yl]methyl acetate, C14H18O8, (I), [(1S,4R,5S,6R)-5-acet-yloxy-7-hy-droxy-imino-2-oxobi-cyclo-[4.2.0]octan-4-yl acetate, C11H15NO6, (II), and [(3aR,5R,6R,7R,7aS)-6,7-bis-(acet-yloxy)-2-oxo-octa-hydro-pyrano[3,2-b]pyrrol-5-yl]methyl acetate, C14H19NO8, (III), are stable bicyclic carbohydrate derivatives. They can easily be synthesized in a few steps from commercially available glycals. As a result of the ring strain from the four-membered rings in (I) and (II), the conformations of the carbohydrates deviate strongly from the ideal chair form. Compound (II) occurs in the boat form. In the five-membered lactam (III), on the other hand, the carbohydrate adopts an almost ideal chair conformation. As a result of the distortion of the sugar rings, the configurations of the three bicyclic carbohydrate derivatives could not be determined from their NMR coupling constants. From our three crystal structure determinations, we were able to establish for the first time the absolute configurations of all new stereocenters of the carbohydrate rings.

19223177	20090219	MTHFR C677T polymorphism contributes to prostate cancer risk among Caucasians: A meta-analysis of 3511 cases and 2762 controls.	Published data regarding the association between 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk have been conflicting. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to assess the association between MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk. Six studies including 3511 cases and 2762 controls described C677T genotypes, among which four articles totalling 838 cases and 1121 controls described A1298C genotypes, were involved in this meta-analysis. Overall meta-analysis indicated that the 677T allele was more likely to exert a protective effect on prostate cancer risk (OR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.68-0.98) with a recessive genetic model. No association was found for the 677CT genotype and the 677TT mutant homozygote with prostate cancer risk compared with 677CC, with OR=1.13 (95% CI: 0.88-1.45) and OR=0.85 (95% CI: 0.71-1.03), respectively. No evidence of an association of MTHFR A1298C polymorphism with prostate cancer was found. This meta-analysis supports that the C677T of the MTHFR gene is a low-penetrance susceptibility gene for prostate cancer, and might provide protective effects against prostate cancer risk.

23169889	20121122	Tooth agenesis association with self-reported family history of cancer.	It has been proposed that tooth agenesis and cancer development share common molecular pathways. We performed a cross-sectional study to investigate the epidemiological and molecular association between tooth agenesis and self-reported family history of cancer. Eighty-two individuals with tooth agenesis and 328 individuals with no birth defect were recruited from the same institution. Tooth agenesis was assessed in permanent teeth and was defined based on the age of the participants and when initial tooth formation should be radiographically visible. We also investigated the role of genes involved in dental development that have been implicated in tumorigenesis, and 14 markers in AXIN2, FGF3, FGF10, and FGFR2 were genotyped. Individuals with tooth agenesis had an increased risk of having a family history of cancer (p = 0.00006; OR = 2.7; 95% C.I., 1.6-4.4). There were associations between AXIN2, FGF3, FGF10, and FGFR2 with tooth agenesis [i.e., individuals who carried the polymorphic allele of FGFR2 (rs1219648) presented higher risk for having premolar agenesis (p = 0.02; OR = 1.8; 95% C.I., 1.1-3.0)]. In conclusion, tooth agenesis was associated with positive self-reported family history of cancer and with variants in AXIN2, FGF3, FGF10, and FGFR2. Prospective studies are needed to confirm if tooth agenesis can be used as a risk marker for cancer. 	J._Dent._Res.	D003160 D016428 D013485
1915343	19910915	Formation of nucleophosmin/B23 oligomers requires both the amino- and the carboxyl-terminal domains of the protein.	Nucleophosmin/B23 is a nucleolar phosphoprotein which forms oligomers. To determine the domain essential for oligomer formation, various deletion and point mutation clones of nucleophosmin/B23 were constructed. Nucleophosmin/B23 and the mutant proteins were produced by (a) coupled in vitro transcription and translation and (b) expression in Escherichia coli with T7 RNA polymerase expression vector (pET-8c). Nucleophosmin/B23 synthesized in vitro has the same peptide map as that synthesized in HeLa cells. Similarly, it formed oligomers which could be detected in SDS/PAGE and were cross-linked with nitrogen mustard in vivo. Substitution of Met5, Met7, and Met9 with Leu or deletion of five amino acids at the C-terminus abolished the oligomerization. Deletion of portions of amino acids in the middle of the molecule (amino acid residues 83-152, 117-186 and 185-240) had little effect on the oligomerization. Co-expression of the N- and C-terminal mutant clones in vitro did not produce oligomers. These results indicate that intra-molecular interactions with both the N- and C-terminal domains are essential for oligomer formation. 	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 D013487
19383029	20090423	Activity of triptolide against human mast cells harboring the kinase domain mutant KIT.	Gain-of-function mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT can cause systemic mastocytosis (SM) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Most of the constitutively active KIT can be inhibited by imatinib; D816V KIT cannot. In this study, we investigated the activity of triptolide, a diterpenoid isolated from the Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f., in cells expressing mutant KIT, including D816V KIT. Imatinib-sensitive HMC-1.1 cells harboring the mutation V560G in the juxtamembrane domain of KIT, imatinib-resistant HMC-1.2 cells harboring both V560G and D816V mutations, and murine P815 cells, were treated with triptolide, and analyzed in terms of growth, apoptosis, and signal transduction. The in vivo antitumor activity was evaluated by using the nude mouse xenograft model. Our results demonstrated that triptolide potently inhibits the growth of both human and murine mast cells harboring not only imatinib-sensitive KIT mutation but also imatinib-resistant D816V KIT. Triptolide markedly inhibited KIT mRNA levels and strikingly reduced the levels of phosphorylated and total Stat3, Akt, and Erk1/2, downstream targets of KIT. Triptolide triggered apoptosis by inducing depolarization of mitochondrial potential and release of cytochrome c, downregulation of Mcl-1 and XIAP. Furthermore, triptolide significantly abrogated the growth of imatinib-resistant HMC-1.2 cell xenografts in nude mice and decreased KIT expression in xenografts. Our data demonstrate that triptolide inhibits imatinib-resistant mast cells harboring D816V KIT. Further investigation of triptolide for treatment of human neoplasms driven by gain-of-function KIT mutations is warranted. 	Cancer_Sci.	D016428 D013485
11531932	20010905	Ras mutations are rare in solitary cold and toxic thyroid nodules.	Activation of ras proto-oncogenes as a result of point mutations is detectable in a significant percentage of most types of tumour. Similar to neoplasms of other organs, mutations of all three ras genes can be found in thyroid tumours. H-, K- and N-ras mutations have been detected in up to 20% of follicular adenomas and adenomatous nodules which were not functionally characterized. This raises the question as to whether ras mutations are specific for hypofunctional nodules and TSH receptor mutations for hyperfunctioning nodules. To investigate ras and TSH receptor mutations with respect to functional differentiation we studied 41 scintigraphically cold nodules and 47 toxic thyroid nodules. To address the likelihood of a somatic mutation we also studied the clonal origin of these tumours. Genomic DNA was extracted from nodular and surrounding tissue. Mutational hot spots in exons 1 and 2 of the H- and K-ras gene were PCR amplified and sequenced using big dye terminator chemistry. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to verify sequencing results for the H-ras gene and to analyse the N-ras gene because its greater sensitivity in detecting somatic mutations. Clonality of nodular thyroid tissue was evaluated using X-Chromosome inactivation based on PCR amplification of the human androgen receptor locus. Monoclonal origin was detectable in 14 of 23 informative samples from cold thyroid nodules. In toxic thyroid nodules the frequency of clonal tissue was 20 in 30 informative cases. Only one point mutation could be found in the N-ras gene codon 61 (Gly to Arg) in a cold adenomatous nodule which was monoclonal. In toxic thyroid nodules no ras mutation was detectable. Our study suggests that ras mutations are rare in solitary cold and toxic thyroid nodules and that the frequent monoclonal origin of these tumours implies somatic mutations in genes other than H-, K- and N-ras.

25045207	20140722	Role of training and detraining on inflammatory and metabolic profile in infarcted rats: influences of cardiovascular autonomic nervous system.	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of exercise training (ET, 50-70% of VO2 max, 5 days/week) and detraining (DT) on inflammatory and metabolic profile after myocardial infarction (MI) in rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into control (C, n = 8), sedentary infarcted (SI, n = 9), trained infarcted (TI, n = 10; 3 months of ET), and detrained infarcted (DI, n = 11; 2 months of ET + 1 month of DT). After ET and DT protocols, ventricular function and inflammation, cardiovascular autonomic modulation (spectral analysis), and adipose tissue inflammation and lipolytic pathway were evaluated. ET after MI improved cardiac and vascular autonomic modulation, and these benefits were correlated with reduced inflammatory cytokines on the heart and adipose tissue. These positive changes were sustained even after 1 month of detraining. No expressive changes were observed in oxidative stress and lipolytic pathway in experimental groups. In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that the autonomic improvement promoted by ET, and maintained even after the detraining period, was associated with reduced inflammatory profile in the left ventricle and adipose tissue of rats subjected to MI. These data encourage enhancing cardiovascular autonomic function as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of inflammatory process triggered by MI. 	Mediators_Inflamm.	D016428 D013485

Eight zidovudine-experienced subjects received zidovudine and didanosine for 30 weeks followed by 30 weeks of didanosine monotherapy. At study entry, plasma from 4 subjects had human immunodeficiency virus RNA pol T215Y/F mutant and 4 had codon 215 wild type. All 8 subjects had non-syncytium-inducing virus phenotype. Sustained 10-fold decreases in plasma RNA levels were seen only in subjects who initially had 215 wild type RNA, despite the development of a T215Y/F mutation during combination therapy. Virologic and immunologic benefits were maintained in this group with didanosine monotherapy. No subject developed a pol L74V codon mutation. Significant differences in plasma virus load and CD4 cell responses were seen in this zidovudine-didanosine combination pilot study relative to codon 215 genotype. 	J._Infect._Dis.	D016428 D013485
23982433	20130829	Prevalence of PIK3CA mutations and the SNP rs17849079 in Arab breast cancer patients.	Carcinomas initiate and progress due to genetic and epigenetic alterations in epithelial cells. However, recently, these alterations have also been reported in stromal fibroblasts. The gain-of-function mutations in the PI3K p110 catalytic subunit (PIK3CA) have been identified in many cancers with a current global incidence of 26% (18-40%) in breast carcinomas. We analyzed the mutational frequency of PIK3CA of three hotspots (exons 1, 9, and 20) in 81 primary invasive breast cancers (BC) and 25 cultured breast cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) samples by Sanger sequencing in Arab breast cancer patients. Associations between the incidence of any PIK3CA mutation and several clinicopathologic characteristics were assessed using chi-square tests for categorical or t test for continuous variables. Furthermore, survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log rank test to evaluate the significance of their differences. We identified a total of 21 PIK3CA missense mutations with a frequency of 25.9%. The majority of the mutations, 17 out of 21 (81%), were in exon 20 (p.His1047Arg, p.His1047Lys, p.Thr1025Ala, p.Gly1049Arg, p.Asp1056Asn) while the remainder, 4 out of 21 (19%) were in exon 9 (p.Glu545Lys). PIK3CA mutations were significantly associated with lower grade and hormone receptor positivity. Although there was a favorable trend in overall survival for patients whose tumor harbored PIK3CA mutations, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.10). However, we did not detect any somatic mutations in CAFs. Furthermore, we have shown a high prevalence (8.2-fold) of a silent variant (SNP, rs17849079) in the Arab breast cancer population compared with disease-free individuals. 	Cancer_Biol._Ther.

21556788	20110511	Lack of association between the TGF-?(1) gene and development of COPD in Asians: a case-control study and meta-analysis.	Abnormalities in the transforming growth factor-?(1) (TGF-?(1)) gene are thought to be linked to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We investigated the association between the single nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) of TGF-?(1) and the risk of COPD in a case-control study and meta-analysis. We genotyped 160 cases and 177 control subjects in a local hospital using the Mass-Array(TM) Technology Platform and then tested the association of four SNPs in TGF-?(1) (rs6957, rs1800469, rs2241712, and rs2241718) with COPD. Plasma TGF-?(1) level measurement was performed later. A database covering all papers published up to October 30, 2010, was then reviewed. Statistical analysis was performed using Revman 5.0 and STATA 11.0 software. No association was found between TGF-?(1) gene SNPs and an increased risk of COPD in Asians. By meta-analysis, the link of two polymorphisms, rs1800469 and rs1982073, was investigated in seven and eight studies, respectively, involving 1,508 COPD patients and 2,608 control subjects. The results showed that there was no significant association between an increased risk of COPD in carriers of the T allele (TT+TC) versus the CC genotype in rs1800469 and rs1982073. In ethnic subgroup analysis, the risk of COPD associated with the rs1800469 T allele was not significantly elevated among Asians. TGF-?(1) gene polymorphisms are not associated with an increased risk of COPD in the Asian population. 	Lung	D016428 D017418 D013485 D016454
7698325	19950320	Expression in Escherichia coli, purification and functional activity of recombinant human chaperonin 10.	We have recently reported the cloning of a cDNA coding for a stress inducible human chaperonin 10. The protein was shown to possess 100% identity with the bovine homologue and a single amino acid replacement (glycine to serine at position 52) compared to rat chaperonin 10. Here we report the heterologous expression of human chaperonin 10 in Escherichia coli, its purification and its functional characterization. The recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity as judged by different analytical techniques, and mass spectrometry analysis showed a MW of 10,801 Da in agreement with the predicted sequence. This molecular weight accounts for a protein which is not modified post-translationally. In fact, natural rat chaperonin 10 has been shown to be acetylated at the N-terminus, a feature suggested to be important for targeting and functional activity. Here we show that recombinant human chaperonin 10 is fully active in assisting the chaperonin 60 GroEL in the refolding of denatured yeast enolase, thereby showing that, at least in the present system, post-translational acetylation is not necessary for its activity.

25663379	20150210	Identification and spectroscopic characterization of nonheme iron(III) hypochlorite intermediates.	Fe(III)-hypohalite complexes have been implicated in a wide range of important enzyme-catalyzed halogenation reactions including the biosynthesis of natural products and antibiotics and post-translational modification of proteins. The absence of spectroscopic data on such species precludes their identification. Herein, we report the generation and spectroscopic characterization of nonheme Fe(III)-hypohalite intermediates of possible relevance to iron halogenases. We show that Fe(III)-OCl polypyridylamine complexes can be sufficiently stable at room temperature to be characterized by UV/Vis absorption, resonance Raman and EPR spectroscopies, and cryo-ESIMS. DFT?methods rationalize the pathways to the formation of the Fe(III)-OCl, and ultimately Fe(IV)=O, species and provide indirect evidence for a short-lived Fe(II)-OCl intermediate.

Stearoyl-ACP Delta9 desaturase (Delta9D) catalyzes the NADPH- and O(2)-dependent insertion of a cis double bond between the C9 and C10 positions of stearoyl-ACP (18:0-ACP) to produce oleoyl-ACP (18:1-ACP). This work revealed the ability of reduced [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin (Fd) to act as a catalytically competent electron donor during the rapid conversion of 18:0-ACP into 18:1-ACP. Experiments on the order of addition for substrate and reduced Fd showed high conversion of 18:0-ACP to 18:1-ACP (approximately 95% per Delta9D active site in a single turnover) when 18:0-ACP was added prior to reduced Fd. Reactions of the prereduced enzyme-substrate complex with O(2) and the oxidized enzyme-substrate complex with reduced Fd were studied by rapid-mix and chemical quench methods. For reaction of the prereduced enzyme-substrate complex, an exponential burst phase (k(burst) = 95 s(-1)) of product formation accounted for approximately 90% of the turnover expected for one subunit in the dimeric protein. This rapid phase was followed by a slower phase (k(linear) = 4.0 s(-1)) of product formation corresponding to the turnover expected from the second subunit. For reaction of the oxidized enzyme-substrate complex with excess reduced Fd, a slower, linear rate (k(obsd) = 3.4 s(-1)) of product formation was observed over approximately 1.5 turnovers per Delta9D active site potentially corresponding to a third phase of reaction. An analysis of the deuterium isotope effect on the two rapid-mix reaction sequences revealed only a modest effect on k(burst) ((D)k(burst) approximately 1.5) and k(linear) (D)k(linear) approximately 1.4), indicating C-H bond cleavage does not contribute significantly to the rate-limiting steps of pre-steady-state catalysis. These results were used to assemble and evaluate a minimal kinetic model for Delta9D catalysis. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013487
19947948	20091202	GIT1 is a novel MEK1-ERK1/2 scaffold that localizes to focal adhesions.	Cell polarity is critical for cell migration and requires localized signal transduction in subcellular domains. Recent evidence demonstrates that activation of ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2) in focal adhesions is essential for cell migration. GIT1 (G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein 1) has been shown to bind paxillin and regulate focal-adhesion disassembly. We have previously reported that GIT1 binds to MEK1 [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK kinase 1] and acts as a scaffold to enhance ERK1/2 activation in response to EGF (epidermal growth factor). In the present study we show that GIT1 associates with ERK1/2 in focal adhesions and this association increases after EGF stimulation. The CC (coiled-coil) domain of ERK1/2 is required for association with GIT1, translocation to focal adhesions, and cell spreading and migration. Immunofluorescent staining showed that, after EGF stimulation, GIT1 co-localized with pERK1/2 (phosphorylated ERK1/2) in focal adhesions. The binding of GIT1 and ERK1/2 was functionally important, since transfecting an ERK2 mutant lacking the CC domain [ERK2(del CC)] significantly decreased pERK1/2 translocation to focal adhesions, cell spreading and migration induced by EGF. In summary, the CC domain of ERK1/2 is necessary for binding to GIT1, for ERK1/2 activation in focal adhesions, and for cell spreading and migration. 	Cell_Biol._Int.	D016428 D052061 D013485
20615342	20100710	Microbial stability and safety of traditional Greek Graviera cheese: characterization of the lactic acid bacterial flora and culture-independent detection of bacteriocin genes in the ripened cheeses and their microbial consortia.	The microflora of four batches of traditional Greek Graviera cheese was studied at 5 weeks of ripening, and 200 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates were phenotypically characterized and screened for antilisterial bacteriocins. The cheeses were also analyzed for organic acids by high-performance liquid chromatography and for the potential presence of 25 known LAB bacteriocin genes directly in cheese and their microbial consortia by PCR. All batches were safe according to the European Union regulatory criteria for Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, enterobacteria, and coagulase-positive staphylococci. The cheese flora was dominated by nonstarter Lactobacillus casei/paracasei (67.5%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (16.3%) strains, whereas few Streptococcus thermophilus (3.8%), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (0.6%), and Leuconostoc (1.9%) organisms were present. Enterococcus faecium (9.4%) and Enterococcus durans (0.6%) were isolated among the dominant LAB from two batches; however, enterococci were present in all batches at 10- to 100-fold lower populations than mesophilic lactobacilli. Sixteen E. faecium isolates produced antilisterial enterocins. In accordance, enterocin B gene was detectable in all cheeses and enterocin P gene was present in one cheese, whereas the consortia of all cheeses contained at least two of the enterocin A, B, P, 31, L50A, and L50B genes. Plantaricin A gene was also amplified from all cheeses. Mean concentrations of lactic, acetic, citric, and propionic acids in the ripened cheeses exceeded 1.5% in total, of which approximately 0.9% was lactate. Thus, organic acid contents constitute an important hurdle factor for inhibiting growth of pathogens in traditional Graviera cheese products, with LAB bacteriocins, mainly enterocins, potentially contributing to increased cheese safety.

23285242	20130104	The clinically-tested S1P receptor agonists, FTY720 and BAF312, demonstrate subtype-specific bradycardia (S1P?) and hypertension (S1P?) in rat.	Sphingosine-1-phospate (S1P) and S1P receptor agonists elicit mechanism-based effects on cardiovascular function in vivo. Indeed, FTY720 (non-selective S1P(X) receptor agonist) produces modest hypertension in patients (2-3 mmHg in 1-yr trial) as well as acute bradycardia independent of changes in blood pressure. However, the precise receptor subtypes responsible is controversial, likely dependent upon the cardiovascular response in question (e.g. bradycardia, hypertension), and perhaps even species-dependent since functional differences in rodent, rabbit, and human have been suggested. Thus, we characterized the S1P receptor subtype specificity for each compound in vitro and, in vivo, the cardiovascular effects of FTY720 and the more selective S1P?,? agonist, BAF312, were tested during acute i.v. infusion in anesthetized rats and after oral administration for 10 days in telemetry-instrumented conscious rats. Acute i.v. infusion of FTY720 (0.1, 0.3, 1.0 mg/kg/20 min) or BAF312 (0.5, 1.5, 5.0 mg/kg/20 min) elicited acute bradycardia in anesthetized rats demonstrating an S1P? mediated mechanism-of-action. However, while FTY720 (0.5, 1.5, 5.0 mg/kg/d) elicited dose-dependent hypertension after multiple days of oral administration in rat at clinically relevant plasma concentrations (24-hr mean blood pressure?=?8.4, 12.8, 16.2 mmHg above baseline vs. 3 mmHg in vehicle controls), BAF312 (0.3, 3.0, 30.0 mg/kg/d) had no significant effect on blood pressure at any dose tested suggesting that hypertension produced by FTY720 is mediated S1P? receptors. In summary, in vitro selectivity results in combination with studies performed in anesthetized and conscious rats administered two clinically tested S1P agonists, FTY720 or BAF312, suggest that S1P? receptors mediate bradycardia while hypertension is mediated by S1P? receptor activation.

17389771	20070329	'Striking the Right Balance' in Targeting PPARgamma in the Metabolic Syndrome: Novel Insights from Human Genetic Studies.	At a time when the twin epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes threaten to engulf even the most well-resourced Western healthcare systems, the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) has emerged as a bona fide therapeutic target for treating human metabolic disease. The novel insulin-sensitizing antidiabetic thiazolidinediones (TZDs, e.g., rosiglitazone, pioglitazone), which are licensed for use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, are high-affinity PPARgamma ligands, whose beneficial effects extend beyond improvement in glycaemic control to include amelioration of dyslipidaemia, lowering of blood pressure, and favourable modulation of macrophage lipid handling and inflammatory responses. However, a major drawback to the clinical use of exisiting TZDs is weight gain, reflecting both enhanced adipogenesis and fluid retention, neither of which is desirable in a population that is already overweight and prone to cardiovascular disease. Accordingly, the &quot;search is on&quot; to identify the next generation of PPARgamma modulators that will promote maximal clinical benefit by targeting specific facets of the metabolic syndrome (glucose intolerance/diabetes, dyslipidaemia, and hypertension), while simultaneously avoiding undesirable side effects of PPARgamma activation (e.g., weight gain). This paper outlines the important clinical and laboratory observations made in human subjects harboring genetic variations in PPARgamma that support such a therapeutic strategy. 	PPAR_Res	D016428
11042180	20001024	The Cdc42p GTPase and its regulators Nrf1p and Scd1p are involved in endocytic trafficking in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.	Nrf1p was first identified in a screen for negative regulators of the Cdc42p GTPase. Overexpression of Nrf1p resulted in dose-dependent lethality, with cells exhibiting an ellipsoidal morphology and abnormal vacuolar phenotypes including an increase in vacuolar fusion. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Cdc42p and GFP-Nrf1p colocalized to vacuolar membranes and GFP-Nrf1p vacuolar localization depended on Scd1p, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe homolog of the Cdc24p guanine nucleotide exchange factor. In this study, site-directed mutagenesis was conducted on Nrf1p to determine its functional domains. Mutations in the three putative transmembrane domains resulted in mislocalization of GFP-Nrf1p and an inability to induce lethality, suggesting a loss of function. Mutations in the second extramembranous loop of Nrf1p also resulted in a loss of function and altered the ability of GFP-Nrf1p to localize to vacuolar membranes. Analysis of Deltanrf1 and Deltascd1 mutants revealed defects in endocytosis. In addition, overexpression of constitutively active Cdc42(G12V)p resulted in an increase in endocytosis and an ability to rescue the endocytic defects in Deltanrf1 and Deltascd1 cells. These data are consistent with Nrf1p and Scd1p being necessary for efficient endocytosis, possibly through the regulation of Cdc42p. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
27436510	20160721	Quantification of Somatic Chromosomal Rearrangements in Circulating Cell-Free DNA from Ovarian Cancers.	Recently, the use of a liquid biopsy has shown promise in monitoring tumor burden. While point mutations have been extensively studied, chromosomal rearrangements have demonstrated greater tumor specificity. Such rearrangements can be identified in the tumor and subsequently detected in the plasma of patients using quantitative PCR (qPCR). In this study we used a whole-genome mate-pair protocol to characterize a landscape of genomic rearrangements in the primary tumors of ten ovarian cancer patients. Individualized tumor-specific primer panels of aberrant chromosomal junctions were identified for each case and detected by qPCR within the cell-free DNA. Selected chromosomal junctions were detected in pre-surgically drawn blood in eight of the ten patients. Of these eight, three demonstrated the continued presence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) post-surgery, consistent with their documented presence of disease, and in five ctDNA was undetectable in the post-surgical blood collection, consistent with their lack of detectable disease. The ctDNA fraction was calculated using a novel algorithm designed for the unique challenges of quantifying ctDNA using qPCR to allow observations of real-time tumor dynamics. In summary, a panel of individualized junctions derived from tumor DNA could be an effective way to monitor cancer patients for relapse and therapeutic efficacy using cfDNA. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
20459822	20100513	The promoter for intestinal cell kinase is head-to-head with F-Box 9 and contains functional sites for TCF7L2 and FOXA factors.	Intestinal cell kinase (ICK; GeneID 22858) is a conserved MAPK and CDK-like kinase that is widely expressed in human tissues. Data from the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project indicated ICK mRNA is increased in cancer, and that its expression correlated with expression of mRNA for an uncharacterized F-box protein, FBX9 (GeneID: 26268). ICK and FBX9 genes are arranged head-to-head on opposite strands, with start sites for transcription separated by approximately 3.3 kb. We hypothesized ICK and FBX9 are potentially important genes in cancer controlled by a bidirectional promoter. We assessed promoter activity of the intergenic region in both orientations in cancer cell lines derived from breast (AU565, SKBR3), colon (HCT-15, KM12), and stomach (AGS) cancers, as well as in embryonic human kidney (HEK293T) cells. The intergenic segment was active in both orientations in all of these lines, and ICK promoter activity was greater than FBX9 promoter activity. Results from deletions and truncations defined a minimal promoter for ICK, and revealed that repressors and enhancers differentially regulate ICK versus FBX9 promoter activity. The ICK promoter contains consensus motifs for several FOX-family transcription factors that align when mouse and human are compared using EMBOSS. FOXA1 and FOXA2 increase luciferase activity of a minimal promoter 10-20 fold in HEK293T cells. Consensus sites for TCF7L2 (TCF4) (Gene Id: 6934) are also present in both mouse and human. The expression of beta-catenin increased activity of the minimal promoter approximately 10 fold. ICK reference mRNAs (NM_014920.3, NM_016513) are expressed in low copy number and increased in some breast cancers, using a ten base tag 5'-TCAACCTTAT-3' specific for both ICK transcripts. ICK and FBX9 are divergently transcribed from a bidirectional promoter that is GC-rich and contains a CpG island. A minimal promoter for ICK contains functional sites for beta-catenin/TCF7L2 and FOXA. These data are consistent with functions that have been proposed for ICK in development and in proliferation or survival of some breast and colon cancers. 	Mol._Cancer	D016428 D052061 D013485
22795785	20120717	Prenatal hypoxia may aggravate the cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease neuropathology in APPSwe/PS1A246E transgenic mice.	Most cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) arise through interactions between genetic and environmental factors. It is believed that hypoxia is an important environmental factor influencing the development of AD. Our group has previously demonstrated that hypoxia increased ?-amyloid (A?) generation in aged AD mice. Here, we further investigate the pathological role of prenatal hypoxia in AD. We exposed the pregnant APP(Swe)/PS1(A246E) transgenic mice to high-altitude hypoxia in a hypobaric chamber during days 7-20 of gestation. We found that prenatal hypoxic mice exhibited a remarkable deficit in spatial learning and memory and a significant decrease in synapses. We also documented a significantly higher level of amyloid precursor protein, lower level of the A?-degrading enzyme neprilysin, and increased A? accumulation in the brain of prenatal hypoxic mice. Finally, we demonstrated striking neuropathologic changes in prenatal hypoxic AD mice, showing increased phosphorylation of tau, decreased hypoxia-induced factor, and enhanced activation of astrocytes and microglia. These data suggest that although the characteristic features of AD appear later in life, hypoxemia in the prenatal stage may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease, supporting the notion that environmental factors can trigger or aggravate AD.

19007919	20081115	Molecular analysis of DMP1 mutants causing autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets.	We previously demonstrated that the mutations Met1Val (M1V) and the deletion of nucleotides 1484-1490 (1484-1490del) in Dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP1) cause the novel disorder autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR), which is associated with elevated fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23). To further understand the role of DMP1 in ARHR, we undertook molecular genetic and in vitro expression studies. First, we examined a kindred with a severe hypophosphatemic rickets phenotype and recessive inheritance. Analyses of this family demonstrated that the affected members had elevated serum FGF23 and carried a large, biallelic deletion that removed the majority of DMP1. At a minimum, this deletion encompassed 49 kb between DMP1 exon 3 and an intergenic region 5' to the next telomeric gene, integrin-binding sialoprotein (IBSP). We next performed immunofluorescent studies in cells to understand the effects of the known ARHR mutations on DMP1 cellular processing. These analyses showed that the M1V DMP1 mutant was not sorted to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and secretory pathway, but filled the entire cytoplasm. In contrast, the 1484-1490del mutant localized to the TGN and was secreted, similar to wild type DMP1. The 1484-1490del mutation replaces the DMP1 18 C-terminal amino acids with 33 non-native residues. Truncation of wild type DMP1 by these native 18 residues followed by Western blot and confocal microscopic analyses demonstrated a wild type expression pattern when compared with the 1484-1490del mutant, indicating that the last 18 residues are not critical for cellular trafficking, but that the 33 additional residues arising from the 1484-1490del mutation likely compromise DMP1 processing. The relationship between DMP1 and FGF23 is unclear. To test endogenous DMP1 response to serum metabolites that also regulate FGF23, UMR-106 cells were treated with 1,25(OH)(2) vitamin D (1x10(-7) M) and showed a 12-fold increase in DMP1 mRNA and protein at 24 h. In summary, we have identified a novel DMP1 deletion as the cause of ARHR, as well as demonstrated that the ARHR mutations alter DMP1 cellular processing, and that DMP1 can be regulated by vitamin D. Taken together, this work expands our understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms associated with DMP1 alterations causing ARHR. 	Bone	D016428 D052061 D013485
19322808	20090327	Manganese-enhanced MRI visualizes V1 in the non-human primate visual cortex.	MRI at 7 Tesla has been used to investigate the accumulation of manganese in the occipital cortex of common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) after administering four fractionated injections of 30 mg/kg MnCl(2) . 4H(2)O in the tail vein. We found a statistically significant decrease in T(1) in the primary (V1) and secondary (V2) areas of the visual cortex caused by an accumulation of manganese. The larger T(1) shortening in V1 (DeltaT(1) = 640 ms) relative to V2 (DeltaT(1) = 490 ms) allowed us to robustly detect the V1/V2 border in vivo using heavily T(1)-weighted MRI. Furthermore, the dorso-medial (DM) and middle-temporal (MT) areas of the visual pathway could be identified by their T(1)-weighted enhancement. We showed by comparison to histological sections stained for cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity that the extent of V1 is accurately identified throughout the visual cortex by manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI). This provides a means of visualizing functional cortical regions in vivo and could be used in longitudinal studies of phenomena such as cortical plasticity, and for non-destructive localization of cortical regions to guide in the implementation of functional techniques.

20636826	20100720	Association of the HLA-G gene polymorphism with multiple sclerosis in a Polish population.	Summary In this study, three polymorphic sites in the HLA-G gene: -725C&gt;G&gt;T, -716T&gt;G and 14bp(indel) were genotyped. Significant differences were found between patients and controls in the alleles and genotypes for -725C&gt;G&gt;T and in three-point haplotypes. We observed also a significant difference in the age of disease onset between patients positive and negative for 14bp(ins). The results suggest that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter of the HLA-G gene (mainly -725C&gt;G&gt;T), and 14bp(indel), or some genetic marker in tight linkage disequilibrium with them are associated with multiple sclerosis.

16171405	20050921	Importance of the GP dipeptide of the antiporter motif and other membrane-embedded proline and glycine residues in tetracycline efflux protein Tet(L).	Proline and glycine residues are well represented among functionally important residues in hydrophobic domains of membrane transport proteins, and several critical roles have been suggested for them. Here, the effects of mutational changes in membrane-embedded proline and glycine residues of Tet(L) were examined, with a focus on the conserved GP(155,156) dipeptide of motif C, a putative &quot;antiporter motif&quot;. Mutation of Gly155 to cysteine resulted in a mutant Tet(L) that bound its tetracycline-divalent metal (Tc-Me2+) substrate but did not catalyze efflux or exchange of Tc-Me2+ or catalyze uptake or exchange of Rb+ which was used to monitor the coupling ion. These results support suggestions that this region is involved in the conformational changes required for translocation. Mutations in Pro156 resulted in reduction (P156G) or loss (P156A or P156C) of Tc-Me2+ efflux capacity. All three Pro156 mutants exhibited a K+ leak (monitored by 86Rb+ fluxes) that was not observed in wild-type Tet(L). A similar leak was observed in a mutant in a membrane-embedded proline residue elsewhere in the Tet(L) protein (P175C) as well as in a P156C mutant of related antiporter Tet(K). These findings are consistent with roles proposed for membrane-embedded prolines in tight helix packing. Patterns of Tc resistance conferred by additional Tet(L) mutants indicate important roles for another GP dipeptide in transmembrane segment (TMS) X as well as for membrane-embedded glycine residues in TMS XIII.

8784083	19960901	The role of luteinizing hormone-beta gene polymorphism in the onset and progression of puberty in healthy boys.	An immunologically anomalous LH with two point mutations in its beta-subunit gene (Trp8Arg and Ile15Thr) has recently been described. This polymorphism is common in Finland; 28% of the population are homo- or heterozygous for the variant allele. To assess the effect of the LH variant on LH action, we correlated its presence in a group of 49 healthy boys with the onset and progression of puberty. This group was followed-up longitudinally from a mean age of 11.7 +/- 0.1 yr for 3 yr at 3-month intervals. In addition, we studied the prevalence of the variant LH in boys with constitutional pubertal delay (testicular volume &lt; or = 4 mL after 13.5 yr of age). The LH beta gene status of each subject in this study was judged from a single venous blood sample using two immunofluorometric LH assays with different combinations of monoclonal antibodies: one detecting both the variant and wild-type LH, and the other detecting only wild-type hormone. Of the boys with pubertal onset at a normal age, 36 (74%) were homozygous for the wild-type LH beta allele, 12 (24%) were heterozygous, and 1 (2%) was homozygous for the variant LH beta allele. Clear differences in pubertal parameters were found between the boys with normal and mutated (homo- or heterozygous) LH genotypes. During the follow-up, the boys with the mutated genotype had smaller testicular volumes (P &lt; 0.03), were shorter (P &lt; 0.02), had slower growth rates (P &lt; 0.04), and had lower serum insulin-like growth factor I-binding protein-3 levels (P &lt; 0.03) than the boys with the normal LH genotype. In the boys with delayed onset of puberty, the frequency of the variant LH beta allele did not differ from that in the reference population, indicating that the variant LH is not associated with conditions due to disturbed control of the reactivation of GnRH secretion. We conclude that during the progression of puberty, the variant LH may be less active in stimulating testicular growth than wild-type LH. Thus, the gene may affect tempo, contributing to the wide normal variation in pubertal progression in healthy boys. Our results also suggest that the variant LH not only affects the course of puberty, but is already involved in the regulation of the GH-insulin-like growth factor I axis during childhood.

27071483	20160414	Clonality analysis of multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma by using genetic profiles.	Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common adult thyroid malignancy and often presents with multiple anatomically distinct foci within the thyroid, known as multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma (MPTC). The widespread application of the next-generation sequencing technologies in cancer genomics research provides novel insights into determining the clonal relationship between multiple tumours within the same thyroid gland. For eight MPTC patients, we performed whole-exome sequencing and targeted region sequencing to identify the non-synonymous point mutations and gene rearrangements of distinct and spatially separated tumour foci. Among these eight MPTCs, completely discordant mutational spectra were observed in the distinct cancerous nodules of patients MPTC1 and 5, suggesting that these nodules originated from independent precursors. In another three cases (MPTC2, 6, and 8), the distinct MPTC foci of these patients had no other shared mutations except BRAF V600E, also indicating likely independent origins. Two patients (MPTC3 and 4) shared almost identical mutational spectra amongst their separate tumour nodules, suggesting a common clonal origin. MPTC patient 7 had seven cancer foci, of which two foci shared 66.7% of mutations, while the remaining cancer foci displayed no common non-synonymous mutations, indicating that MPTC7 has multiple independent origins accompanied by intraglandular disease dissemination. In this study, we found that 75% of MPTC cases arose as independent tumours, which supports the field cancerization hypothesis describing multiple malignant lesions. MPTC may also arise from intrathyroidal metastases from a single malignant clone, as well as multiple independent origins accompanied by intrathyroidal metastasis. 	J._Pathol.	D016428 D013485
25337271	20141023	The impact of pri-miR-218 rs11134527 on the risk and prognosis of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.	MicroRNA-218 (miR-218) acts as a tumor suppressor in numerous types of cancer by regulation of the expression of target genes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether polymorphisms in miR-218 LAMB3 pathway were associated with the risk and prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Pri-mir-218 rs11134527 and LAMB3 rs2566 were genotyped in ESCC patients and 745 controls to assess their associations with cancer risk and overall survival. Pri-mir-218 rs11134527 was significantly associated with a decreased risk of ESCC under codominant, recessive and additive models. Although there was a significant association between rs11134527 and better survival of ESCC patients under codominant, recessive and additive models, the association disappeared after adjustment for TNM and LNM. However, further stratified analysis revealed that the association remained significant in patients with TNM stages I and II or non-LNM. Our data suggest that pri-miR-218 rs11134527 may contribute to the genetic susceptibility and prognosis for ESCC in Chinese Han population. 	Int_J_Clin_Exp_Pathol	D016428 D013485
25882842	20150418	CRL3IBTK Regulates the Tumor Suppressor Pdcd4 through Ubiquitylation Coupled to Proteasomal Degradation.	The human inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase isoform ? (IBtk?) is a BTB protein encoded by the IBTK gene, which maps to chromosomal locus 6q14.1, a mutational hot spot in lymphoproliferative disorders. Here, we demonstrate that IBtk? forms a CRL3(IBTK) complex promoting its self-ubiquitylation. We identified the tumor suppressor Pdcd4 as IBtk? interactor and ubiquitylation substrate of CRL3(IBTK) for proteasomal degradation. Serum-induced degradation of Pdcd4 required both IBtk? and Cul3, indicating that CRL3(IBTK) regulated the Pdcd4 stability in serum signaling. By promoting Pdcd4 degradation, IBtk? counteracted the suppressive effect of Pdcd4 on translation of reporter luciferase mRNAs with stem-loop structured or unstructured 5'-UTR. IBtk? depletion by RNAi caused Pdcd4 accumulation and decreased the translation of Bcl-xL mRNA, a well known target of Pdcd4 repression. By characterizing CRL3(IBTK) as a novel ubiquitin ligase, this study provides new insights into regulatory mechanisms of cellular pathways, such as the Pdcd4-dependent translation of mRNAs.

12130735	20020720	Cocaine metabolism accelerated by a re-engineered human butyrylcholinesterase.	Plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is important in the metabolism of cocaine, but natural human BChE has limited therapeutic potential for detoxication because of low catalytic efficiency with cocaine. Here we report pharmacokinetics of cocaine in rats treated with A328W/Y332A BChE, an excellent cocaine hydrolase designed with the aid of molecular modeling. Compared with wild-type BChE, this enzyme hydrolyzes cocaine with 40-fold improved k(cat) (154 min(-1) versus 4.1 min(-1)) and only slightly increased K(M) (18 microM versus 4.5 microM). In rats given this hydrolase (3 mg/kg i.v.) 10 min before cocaine challenge (6.8 mg/kg i.v.), cocaine half-life was reduced from 52 min to 18 min. Mirroring the reductions of plasma cocaine were large increases in benzoic acid, a product of BChE-mediated cocaine hydrolysis. All other pharmacokinetic parameters confirmed a large, dose-dependent acceleration of cocaine removal by the injected cocaine hydrolase. These results show that A328W/Y332A, an efficient cocaine hydrolase in vivo as well as in vitro, might promote cocaine detoxication in a clinical setting. 	J._Pharmacol._Exp._Ther.	D016428
24801911	20140508	Essential role of amino acid position 226 in oligosaccharide elongation by amylosucrase from Neisseria polysaccharea.	Amylosucrase from Neisseria polysaccharea is a remarkable transglucosylase that synthesizes an insoluble amylose-like polymer from sole substrate sucrose. One particular amino acid, Arg226, was proposed from molecular modeling studies to play an important role in the formation of the active site topology and in the accessibility of ligands to the catalytic site. The systematic mutation of this Arg residue by all 19 other possible amino acids revealed that all single-mutants had a higher activity on sucrose compared to the wild-type enzyme. An extensive kinetic investigation showed that catalytic efficiencies are greatly impacted by the presence of natural acceptors in the reaction media, their chain length and the nature of the amino acid at position 226. Compared to the wild-type enzyme, the R226N mutant showed a 10-fold enhancement in the catalytic efficiency and a nearly twofold higher production of an insoluble amylose-like polymer that can be of interest for biotechnological applications.

16789830	20060623	Genome-wide analysis of gene expression during early Arabidopsis flower development.	Detailed information about stage-specific changes in gene expression is crucial for the understanding of the gene regulatory networks underlying development. Here, we describe the global gene expression dynamics during early flower development, a key process in the life cycle of a plant, during which floral patterning and the specification of floral organs is established. We used a novel floral induction system in Arabidopsis, which allows the isolation of a large number of synchronized floral buds, in conjunction with whole-genome microarray analysis to identify genes with differential expression at distinct stages of flower development. We found that the onset of flower formation is characterized by a massive downregulation of genes in incipient floral primordia, which is followed by a predominance of gene activation during the differentiation of floral organs. Among the genes we identified as differentially expressed in the experiment, we detected a significant enrichment of closely related members of gene families. The expression profiles of these related genes were often highly correlated, indicating similar temporal expression patterns. Moreover, we found that the majority of these genes is specifically up-regulated during certain developmental stages. Because co-expressed members of gene families in Arabidopsis frequently act in a redundant manner, these results suggest a high degree of functional redundancy during early flower development, but also that its extent may vary in a stage-specific manner.

26721804	20160102	Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism on Exon 17 of Insulin Receptor Gene Influences Insulin Resistance in PCOS: A Pilot Study on North Indian Women.	Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a major cause of infertility, is also strongly associated with insulin resistance. Defects in insulin receptor signaling are considered as one of the major molecular pathogeneses for insulin resistance. To investigate the possible mechanism of this signaling defect at genetic level, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) [His 1085 C/T] at the exon 17 of insulin receptor gene (INSR) was studied in this pilot study. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on leucocytic DNA of women diagnosed with PCOS, selected from the outpatient department of Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi, using suitable primer to amplify a region on INSR. An equal number of age-matched healthy women were selected as controls. SNP analysis was performed with restriction enzyme length polymorphism technique using Pm II enzyme. Serum insulin level was measured by ELISA kit and HOMA-IR was calculated mathematically. A higher frequency of the CC genotype was observed in PCOS women than in controls. Also, HOMA-IR, a tool for estimating insulin resistance, was significantly high in PCOS women with the CC genotype. C1008T SNP at exon 17 of INSR is associated with insulin resistance in Indian women with PCOS. Presence of CC genotype (C1085T) could be developed as a marker for insulin resistance and metabolic complications in PCOS women. 	Biochem._Genet.	D016428 D013485

21371335	20110305	Virulence of H5N1 virus in mice attenuates after in vitro serial passages.	The virulence of A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (VN1194) in mice attenuated after serial passages in MDCK cells and chicken embryos, because the enriched large-plaque variants of the virus had significantly reduced virulence. In contrast, the small-plaque variants of the virus and the variants isolated from the brain of mice that were infected with the parental virus VN1194 had much higher virulence in mice. The virulence attenuation of serially propagated virus may be caused by the reduced neurotropism in mice. Our whole genome sequence analysis revealed substitutions of a total of two amino acids in PB1, three in PB2, two in PA common for virulence attenuated variants, all or part of which may be correlated with the virulence attenuation and reduced neurotropism of the serially propagated VN1194 in mice. Our study indicates that serial passages of VN1194 in vitro lead to adaptation and selection of variants that have markedly decreased virulence and neurotropism, which emphasizes the importance of direct analysis of original or less propagated virus samples.

24347546	20131219	c-di-GMP heterogeneity is generated by the chemotaxis machinery to regulate flagellar motility.	Individual cell heterogeneity is commonly observed within populations, although its molecular basis is largely unknown. Previously, using FRET-based microscopy, we observed heterogeneity in cellular c-di-GMP levels. In this study, we show that c-di-GMP heterogeneity in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is promoted by a specific phosphodiesterase partitioned after cell division. We found that subcellular localization and reduction of c-di-GMP levels by this phosphodiesterase is dependent on the histidine kinase component of the chemotaxis machinery, CheA, and its phosphorylation state. Therefore, individual cell heterogeneity in c-di-GMP concentrations is regulated by the activity and the asymmetrical inheritance of the chemotaxis organelle after cell division. c-di-GMP heterogeneity results in a diversity of motility behaviors. The generation of diverse intracellular concentrations of c-di-GMP by asymmetric partitioning is likely important to the success and survival of bacterial populations within the environment by allowing a variety of motility behaviors.

27473166	20160731	Streptococcusmarmotae sp. nov., isolated from the respiratory tract of Marmota himalayana.	Five strains of a Gram-stain-positive, catalase-negative, ?-haemolytic, coccus-shaped chain-forming organism were isolated separately from the lower respiratory tracts of five animals of Marmota himalayana in the endemic area of plague, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China. Based on their morphological characteristics, biochemical features and molecular phylogenetic studies, the strains were placed as representing a new member of the genus Streptococcus. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence studies indicated that strain HTS5T shared 96.5, 96.2 and 96.0?% similarity with Streptococcus gallinaceus CCUG 42692T, Streptococcus parasanguinis ATCC 15912T and Streptococcus suis ATCC 43765T, respectively. Sequence analysis of its rpoB and sodA genes showed that strain HTS5T was most closely related to Streptococcus cuniculi CCUG 65085T with 9.2 and 10.9?% interspecies divergence, respectively. The whole genome phylogenetic tree based on 339 core genes of 65 Streptococcus genomes confirmed that HTS5T belongs to a distinct lineage that is well separated from recognized species of the genus Streptococcus. In silico DNA-DNA hybridization using 65 available genomes from GenBank showed that HTS5T displayed less than 70?% DNA-DNA relatedness with the other 65 species of the genus Streptococcus deposited in the GenBank database. The genome of strain HTS5T (2?322?791 bp) contained 2377 genes and had a G+C content of 41.6 mol%. Therefore, the five strains are considered to represent a novel species of the genus Streptococcus for which the name Streptococcusmarmotae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is HTS5T (=DSM 101995T=CGMCC 1.15534T). 	Int._J._Syst._Evol._Microbiol.	D016428
22429480	20120321	Genetic association study of individual symptoms in depression.	The heritability of some individual depressive symptoms has been well established. However, the causal genes related to individual depressive symptoms and genetic effects on the courses of individual depressive symptoms are still unclear. We examined these issues in 241 Korean patients who met the DSM-IV-TR criteria for major depression. Patients entered a 12-week clinical trial with antidepressants. A total of 1399 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 79 candidate genes were assessed. The rs557762 and the TT haplotype in the 11th haplotype block of the GRIA3 gene were associated with feelings of guilt in females. The GGCCGGGC haplotype in the first haplotype block of TPH1 was significantly associated with middle insomnia. The ACAG haplotype in the 13th haplotype block of the GRIK2 gene was associated with somatic anxiety. Moreover, the effect of the rs557762 on guilt significantly varied across times. Our results indicate that there are associations between particular gene polymorphisms and some individual depressive symptoms. These results could contribute to understanding the biological mechanisms of depression. 	Psychiatry_Res	D016430 D016428 D013485
17561960	20070615	Studies of the ATPase activity of the ABC protein SUR1.	The ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel couples glucose metabolism to insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells. It comprises regulatory sulfonylurea receptor 1 and pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits. Binding and/or hydrolysis of Mg-nucleotides at the nucleotide-binding domains of sulfonylurea receptor 1 stimulates channel opening and leads to membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of insulin secretion. We report here the first purification and functional characterization of sulfonylurea receptor 1. We also compared the ATPase activity of sulfonylurea receptor 1 with that of the isolated nucleotide-binding domains (fused to maltose-binding protein to improve solubility). Electron microscopy showed that nucleotide-binding domains purified as ring-like complexes corresponding to approximately 8 momomers. The ATPase activities expressed as maximal turnover rate [in nmol P(i).s(-1).(nmol protein)(-1)] were 0.03, 0.03, 0.13 and 0.08 for sulfonylurea receptor 1, nucleotide-binding domain 1, nucleotide-binding domain 2 and a mixture of nucleotide-binding domain 1 and nucleotide-binding domain 2, respectively. Corresponding K(m) values (in mm) were 0.1, 0.6, 0.65 and 0.56, respectively. Thus sulfonylurea receptor 1 has a lower K(m) than either of the isolated nucleotide-binding domains, and a lower maximal turnover rate than nucleotide-binding domain 2. Similar results were found with GTP, but the K(m) values were lower. Mutation of the Walker A lysine in nucleotide-binding domain 1 (K719A) or nucleotide-binding domain 2 (K1385M) inhibited the ATPase activity of sulfonylurea receptor 1 by 60% and 80%, respectively. Beryllium fluoride (K(i) 16 microm), but not MgADP, inhibited the ATPase activity of sulfonylurea receptor 1. In contrast, both MgADP and beryllium fluoride inhibited the ATPase activity of the nucleotide-binding domains. These data demonstrate that the ATPase activity of sulfonylurea receptor 1 differs from that of the isolated nucleotide-binding domains, suggesting that the transmembrane domains may influence the activity of the protein.

2975600	19881201	Characterization of the human type I interferon receptor by ligand blotting.	The human type I interferon (IFN) receptor was characterized by ligand blotting. In this method, plasmalemma proteins or detergent-lysed whole-cell extracts from human Burkitt lymphoma cell lines were separated on polyacrylamide gels and subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose sheets. Probing the blots with 3 x 10(-10) M 125I-labeled recombinant IFN-alpha A (125I-rIFN-alpha A) revealed an IFN-alpha-binding protein with an apparent molecular mass of 95 kDa (p95). Performing the electrophoretic run under reducing conditions completely abrogated the signal on the blot, indicating that the type I IFN receptor contains a disulfide bond essential for IFN binding. Optimal binding of 125I-rIFN-alpha A occurred at pH 9. The specificity of the binding reaction was established by simultaneously adding an excess of unlabeled IFN during incubation of the blots with 125I-rIFN-alpha A. The addition of either unlabeled IFN-alpha or IFN-beta, but not IFN-gamma, abolished the binding of 125I-rIFN-alpha A to p95. 125I-IFN-gamma at 1.25 x 10(-11) M bound to two proteins distinct from p95 with apparent molecular mass of 92 and 87 kDa, respectively. Saturability of 125I-rIFN-alpha A binding was demonstrated by probing a constant amount of membrane proteins with increasing amounts of 125I-rIFN-alpha A. Scatchard analysis of the binding data yielded an apparent Kd of 5.4 x 10(-10) M for the immobilized type I IFN receptor. The expression of p95 on IFN-alpha-resistant and -sensitive cells was indistinguishable. We conclude that p95 is the IFN-alpha/beta receptor and that two proteins (p92 and p87) can specifically bind IFN-gamma. These results indicate that ligand blotting is a versatile method for characterization of unmodified IFN receptors and IFN-receptor interaction and could also provide a new investigational approach for other cytokine receptor systems.

11903735	20020321	Helicobacter pylori alters n-6 fatty acid metabolism and prostaglandin E2 synthesis in rat gastric mucosal cells.	Little is known about whether Helicobacter pylori infection alters fatty acid metabolism in gastric mucosal cells. By using cultured rat gastric mucosal cells (RGM-1), we investigated the effect of H. pylori broth culture filtrates on this point. Furthermore, our study aimed to find out whether n-6 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids from linoleic acid are formed in RGM-1 cells. Rat gastric mucosal cells were incubated with 10, 20 and 40 microg/mL of linoleic acid or medium alone. Phosphatidylcholine content extracted from whole RGM-1 cells was quantitated by using a densitometer, and its fatty acid composition was analyzed by using gas chromatography. Prostaglandin E2 concentration in the culture medium was measured by using radioimmunoassay. The expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 was examined by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In addition, after incubation with [1-14C] linoleic acid, radioactivities of both linoleic acid and arachidonic acid components of the PC fraction were counted. The effects of H. pylori broth culture filtrates on PC content, its fatty acid composition and prostaglandin (PG)E2 synthesis were also assessed. Linoleic acid addition caused an increase in the composition of arachidonic acid, as well as linoleic acid, and also in PGE2 concentration. Cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression was induced in RGM-1 cells by the addition of linoleic acid. In addition, [1-14C] linoleic acid added to the culture medium was converted to [1-14C] arachidonic acid in RGM-1 cells. Helicobacter pylori broth culture filtrates decreased linoleic acid composition and increased arachidonic acid composition. Moreover, after incubation with H. pylori broth culture filtrates, PGE2 concentrations were higher than that of the controls. These findings suggest the presence of fatty acid elongase and Delta5- and Delta6-desaturases synthesize arachidonic acid from linoleic acid in RGM-1 cells. Thus, H. pylori infection may enhance PGE2 synthesis and accelerate n-6 fatty acid metabolism in gastric mucosal cells, which could make the gastric mucosal barrier more fragile.

17031610	20061013	Association of variants of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in the Dutch Breda cohort.	A strong association between susceptibility to type 2 diabetes and common variants of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), encoding an enteroendocrine transcription factor involved in glucose homeostasis, has been reported in three different populations (Iceland, Denmark and USA) by Grant et al. We aimed to replicate these findings in a Dutch cohort. We analysed the genotypes of two intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TCF7L2 gene in 502 unrelated type 2 diabetes patients and in a set of healthy controls (n = 920). The two SNPs showed almost complete linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.91). We were able to replicate the previously reported association in our Breda cohort. The minor alleles of both variants were significantly over-represented in cases (odds ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.09-1.52, [Formula: see text] for rs12255372; OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.19-1.66, [Formula: see text] for rs7903146). In addition, TCF7L2 haplotypes were analysed for association with the disease. The analysis of haplotypes did not reveal any strong association beyond that expected from analysing individual SNPs. The TT haplotype carrying the minor alleles was more frequent among cases (OR 1.38, [Formula: see text]). Our data strongly confirm that variants of the TCF7L2 gene contribute to the risk of type 2 diabetes. The population-attributable risk from this factor in the Dutch type 2 diabetes population is 10%. 	Diabetologia	D016428 D013485
22749033	20120704	Role of CYP1A2 polymorphisms on lung cancer risk in a prospective study.	Cytochrome P4501A2 (CYP1A2) is a key enzyme for lung carcinogen activation and lung inflammation. We studied the interactions of the CYP1A2 functional variants -3860G/A(rs2069514),-2467T/delT(rs3569413),-163C/A(rs762551)] with occupational/environmental carcinogenic exposures in the development of lung cancer in a case-control study nested in the Danish prospective cohort &quot;Diet, Cancer and Health.&quot; At enrollment (1993-1997), blood samples for genotype analyses and information on lifestyle were collected 5 (mean value) years before the onset of the disease. The study population included 425 lung cancer cases and 786 subcohort members, who were gender- and age-matched. We found that -163A carriers were at increased risk of lung cancer (P=0.035) in a multivariate COX regression model, which was adjusted for personal habits (i.e., cumulative smoking, passive smoke at home, alcohol intake, and fruit intake) and occupational exposure. Additionally, the interaction between -2467delT and smoking increases lung cancer risk in males, especially light smokers (&lt;21.5 pack-years, P=0.004). The increased lung cancer risk found in -163C carriers, independent of smoking status, and in -2467delT male smokers, suggests that these variants could influence lung cancer development through different mechanisms (i.e. lung carcinogen activation and lung inflammation).

22918945	20120825	Role of mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system in protein biogenesis of the mitochondrial outer membrane.	Mitochondria contain two membranes, the outer membrane and the inner membrane with folded cristae. The mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system (MINOS) is a large protein complex required for maintaining inner membrane architecture. MINOS interacts with both preprotein transport machineries of the outer membrane, the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) and the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM). It is unknown, however, whether MINOS plays a role in the biogenesis of outer membrane proteins. We have dissected the interaction of MINOS with TOM and SAM and report that MINOS binds to both translocases independently. MINOS binds to the SAM complex via the conserved polypeptide transport-associated domain of Sam50. Mitochondria lacking mitofilin, the large core subunit of MINOS, are impaired in the biogenesis of ?-barrel proteins of the outer membrane, whereas mutant mitochondria lacking any of the other five MINOS subunits import ?-barrel proteins in a manner similar to wild-type mitochondria. We show that mitofilin is required at an early stage of ?-barrel biogenesis that includes the initial translocation through the TOM complex. We conclude that MINOS interacts with TOM and SAM independently and that the core subunit mitofilin is involved in biogenesis of outer membrane ?-barrel proteins. 	Mol._Biol._Cell	D016428 D013485
27069954	20160413	A regulatable AAV vector mediating GDNF biological effects at clinically-approved sub-antimicrobial doxycycline doses.	Preclinical and clinical data stress the importance of pharmacologically-controlling glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) intracerebral administration to treat PD. The main challenge is finding a combination of a genetic switch and a drug which, when administered at a clinically-approved dose, reaches the brain in sufficient amounts to induce a therapeutic effect. We describe a highly-sensitive doxycycline-inducible adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector. This vector allowed for the first time a longitudinal analysis of inducible transgene expression in the brain using bioluminescence imaging. To evaluate the dose range of GDNF biological activity, the inducible AAV vector (8.0???10(9) viral genomes) was injected in the rat striatum at four delivery sites and increasing doxycycline doses administered orally. ERK/Akt signaling activation as well as tyrosine hydroxylase downregulation, a consequence of long-term GDNF treatment, were induced at plasmatic doxycycline concentrations of 140 and 320?ng/ml respectively, which are known not to increase antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in patients. In these conditions, GDNF covered the majority of the striatum. No behavioral abnormalities or weight loss were observed. Motor asymmetry resulting from unilateral GDNF treatment only appeared with a 2.5-fold higher vector and a 13-fold higher inducer doses. Our data suggest that using the herein-described inducible AAV vector, biological effects of GDNF can be obtained in response to sub-antimicrobial doxycycline doses.

21957463	20110930	Phylogenomic analysis of Odyssella thessalonicensis fortifies the common origin of Rickettsiales, Pelagibacter ubique and Reclimonas americana mitochondrion.	The evolution of the Alphaproteobacteria and origin of the mitochondria are topics of considerable debate. Most studies have placed the mitochondria ancestor within the Rickettsiales order. Ten years ago, the bacterium Odyssella thessalonicensis was isolated from Acanthamoeba spp., and the 16S rDNA phylogeny placed it within the Rickettsiales. Recently, the whole genome of O. thessalonicensis has been sequenced, and 16S rDNA phylogeny and more robust and accurate phylogenomic analyses have been performed with 65 highly conserved proteins. The results suggested that the O. thessalonicensis emerged between the Rickettsiales and other Alphaproteobacteria. The mitochondrial proteins of the Reclinomonas americana have been used to locate the phylogenetic position of the mitochondrion ancestor within the Alphaproteobacteria tree. Using the K tree score method, nine mitochondrion-encoded proteins, whose phylogenies were congruent with the Alphaproteobacteria phylogenomic tree, have been selected and concatenated for Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenies. The Reclinomonas americana mitochondrion is a sister taxon to the free-living bacteria Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique, and together, they form a clade that is deeply rooted in the Rickettsiales clade. The Reclinomonas americana mitochondrion phylogenomic study confirmed that mitochondria emerged deeply in the Rickettsiales clade and that they are closely related to Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique.

18628568	20080717	Risk factors related to inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in the DCCT/EDIC cohort and their relationship with nephropathy and macrovascular complications.	Because endothelial cell dysfunction and inflammation are key contributors to the development of complications in type 1 diabetes, we studied risk factors related to endothelial dysfunction and inflammation (C-reactive protein and fibrinogen, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin, and fibrinolytic markers) in a subgroup of patients from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)/Epidemiology of Diabetes Intervention and Complications (EDIC) study cohort. We determined which of these risk factors or clusters thereof are associated with the presence of and subsequent development of nephropathy and macrovascular complications (reflected by carotid intima-media thickness [IMT]). After adjustment for conventional risk factors (age, sex, DCCT treatment group, diabetes duration, A1C, systolic blood pressure, waist-to-hip ratio, total and HDL cholesterol, and smoking status), fibrinogen remained strongly associated with progression of internal and common carotid IMT (P &lt; 0.01) and soluble E-selectin had a strong association with nephropathy (P &lt; 0.01). The best predictor for IMT progression in the DCCT/EDIC cohort was plasma fibrinogen, and the levels of soluble E-selectin discriminate patients with albuminuria better than conventional risk factors.

21865169	20110826	Characterization of the activities of the CpeY, CpeZ, and CpeS bilin lyases in phycoerythrin biosynthesis in Fremyella diplosiphon strain UTEX 481.	When grown in green light, Fremyella diplosiphon strain UTEX 481 produces the red-colored protein phycoerythrin (PE) to maximize photosynthetic light harvesting. PE is composed of two subunits, CpeA and CpeB, which carry two and three phycoerythrobilin (PEB) chromophores, respectively, that are attached to specific Cys residues via thioether linkages. Specific bilin lyases are hypothesized to catalyze each PEB ligation. Using a heterologous, coexpression system in Escherichia coli, the PEB ligation activities of putative lyase subunits CpeY, CpeZ, and CpeS were tested on the CpeA and CpeB subunits from F. diplosiphon. Purified His(6)-tagged CpeA, obtained by coexpressing cpeA, cpeYZ, and the genes for PEB synthesis, had absorbance and fluorescence emission maxima at 566 and 574 nm, respectively. CpeY alone, but not CpeZ, could ligate PEB to CpeA, but the yield of CpeA-PEB was lower than achieved with CpeY and CpeZ together. Studies with site-specific variants of CpeA(C82S and C139S), together with mass spectrometric analysis of trypsin-digested CpeA-PEB, revealed that CpeY/CpeZ attached PEB at Cys(82) of CpeA. The CpeS bilin lyase ligated PEB at both Cys(82) and Cys(139) of CpeA but very inefficiently; the yield of PEB ligated at Cys(82) was much lower than observed with CpeY or CpeY/CpeZ. However, CpeS efficiently attached PEB to Cys(80) of CpeB but neither CpeY, CpeZ, nor CpeY/CpeZ could ligate PEB to CpeB. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013486

Single-agent regorafenib administered as a 160-mg daily dose for the first 21 days of a 28-day cycle is approved for use in patients with pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) progressing on imatinib and sunitinib, following publication of data from the phase III CORRECT and GRID studies respectively. Regorafenib is currently under phase III investigation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and is in several phase II studies in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) tumors. This review describes the clinical development of regorafenib in patients with GI cancers, and highlights the key issues important for the modern day clinical pharmacist who forms part of the multidisciplinary team ensuring safe and effective delivery of the drug to the patient. This information is considered of particular importance to the clinical pharmacist for the future development of regorafenib in this treatment setting. 	Target_Oncol	D016428 D013485 D016454
19451186	20090520	Jasmonic acid-induced volatiles of Brassica oleracea attract parasitoids: effects of time and dose, and comparison with induction by herbivores.	Caterpillar feeding induces direct and indirect defences in brassicaceous plants. This study focused on the role of the octadecanoid pathway in induced indirect defence in Brassica oleracea. The effect of induction by exogenous application of jasmonic acid (JA) on the responses of Brussels sprouts plants and on host-location behaviour of associated parasitoid wasps was studied. Feeding by the biting-chewing herbivores Pieris rapae and Plutella xylostella resulted in significantly increased endogenous levels of JA, a central component in the octadecanoid signalling pathway that mediates induced plant defence. The levels of the intermediate 12-oxophyto-dienoic acid (OPDA) were significantly induced only after P. rapae feeding. Three species of parasitoid wasps, Cotesia glomerata, C. rubecula, and Diadegma semiclausum, differing in host range and host specificity, were tested for their behavioural responses to volatiles from herbivore-induced, JA-induced, and non-induced plants. All three species were attracted to volatiles from JA-induced plants compared with control plants; however, they preferred volatiles from herbivore-induced plants over volatiles from JA-induced plants. Attraction of C. glomerata depended on both timing and dose of JA application. JA-induced plants produced larger quantities of volatiles than herbivore-induced and control plants, indicating that not only quantity, but also quality of the volatile blend is important in the host-location behaviour of the wasps.

20739944	20100827	Carrier frequency of GJB2 gene mutations c.35delG, c.235delC and c.167delT among the populations of Eurasia.	Hearing impairment is one of the most common disorders of sensorineural function and the incidence of profound prelingual deafness is about 1 per 1000 at birth. GJB2 gene mutations make the largest contribution to hereditary hearing impairment. The spectrum and prevalence of some GJB2 mutations are known to be dependent on the ethnic origin of the population. This study presents data on the carrier frequencies of major GJB2 mutations, c.35delG, c.167delT and c.235delC, among 2308 healthy persons from 18 various populations of Eurasia: Russians, Bashkirs, Tatars, Chuvashes, Udmurts, Komi-Permyaks and Mordvins (Volga-Ural region of Russia); Belarusians and Ukrainians (East Europe); Abkhazians, Avars, Cherkessians and Ingushes (Caucasus); Kazakhs, Uighurs and Uzbeks (Central Asia); and Yakuts and Altaians (Siberia). The data on c.35delG and c.235delC mutation prevalence in the studied ethnic groups can be used to investigate the prospective founder effect in the origin and prevalence of these mutations in Eurasia and consequently in populations around the world.

22509405	20120418	The GPI anchor signal sequence dictates the folding and functionality of the Als5 adhesin from Candida albicans.	Proteins destined to be Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored are translocated into the ER lumen completely before the C-terminal GPI anchor attachment signal sequence (SS) is removed by the GPI-transamidase and replaced by a pre-formed GPI anchor precursor. Does the SS have a role in dictating the conformation and function of the protein as well? We generated two variants of the Als5 protein without and with the SS in order to address the above question. Using a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques, we show that in the case of Als5, an adhesin of C. albicans, the C-terminal deletion of 20 amino acids (SS) results in a significant alteration in conformation and function of the mature protein. We propose that the locking of the conformation of the precursor protein in an alternate conformation from that of the mature protein is one probable strategy employed by the cell to control the behaviour and function of proteins intended to be GPI anchored during their transit through the ER.

19364400	20090415	A human polymorphism affects NEDD4L subcellular targeting by leading to two isoforms that contain or lack a C2 domain.	Ubiquitination serves multiple cellular functions, including proteasomal degradation and the control of stability, function, and intracellular localization of a wide variety of proteins. NEDD4L is a member of the HECT class of E3 ubiquitin ligases. A defining feature of NEDD4L protein isoforms is the presence or absence of an amino-terminal C2 domain, a class of subcellular, calcium-dependent targeting domains. We previously identified a common variant in human NEDD4L that generates isoforms that contain or lack a C2 domain. To address the potential functional significance of the NEDD4L common variant on NEDD4L subcellular localization, NEDD4L isoforms that either contained or lacked a C2 domain were tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein, transfected into Xenopus laevis kidney epithelial cells, and imaged by performing confocal microscopy on live cells. We report that the presence or absence of this C2 domain exerts differential effects on the subcellular distribution of NEDD4L, the ability of C2 containing and lacking NEDD4L isoforms to mobilize in response to a calcium stimulus, and the intracellular transport of subunits of the NEDD4L substrate, ENaC. Furthermore, the ability of the C2-containing isoform to influence beta-ENaC mobilization from intracellular pools involves the NEDD4L active site for ubiquitination. We propose a model to account for the potential impact of this common genetic variant on protein function at the cellular level. NEDD4L isoforms that contain or lack a C2 domain target different intracellular locations. Additionally, whereas the C2-containing NEDD4L isoform is capable of shuttling between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments in response to calcium stimulus the C2-lacking isoform can not. The C2-containing isoform differentially affects the mobilization of ENaC subunits from intracellular pools and this trafficking step requires NEDD4L ubiquitin ligase activity. This observation suggests a new mechanism for the requirement for the PY motif in cAMP-mediated exocytosis of ENaC. We have elucidated how a common genetic variant can underlie significant functional diversity in NEDD4L at the cellular level. We propose a model that describes how that functional variation may influence blood pressure. Moreover, our observations regarding differential function of the NEDD4L isoforms may impact other aspects of physiology that involve this ubiquitin ligase. 	BMC_Cell_Biol.	D016428 D052061 D013485
17313366	20070223	High-affinity binding by the periplasmic iron-binding protein from Haemophilus influenzae is required for acquiring iron from transferrin.	The periplasmic iron-binding protein, FbpA (ferric-ion-binding protein A), performs an essential role in iron acquisition from transferrin in Haemophilus influenzae. A series of site-directed mutants in the metal-binding amino acids of FbpA were prepared to determine their relative contribution to iron binding and transport. Structural studies demonstrated that the mutant proteins crystallized in an open conformation with the iron atom associated with the C-terminal domain. The iron-binding properties of the mutant proteins were assessed by several assays, including a novel competitive iron-binding assay. The relative ability of the proteins to compete for iron was pH dependent, with a rank order at pH 6.5 of wild-type, Q58L, H9Q&gt;H9A, E57A&gt;Y195A, Y196A. The genes encoding the mutant FbpA were introduced into H. influenzae and the resulting strains varied in the level of ferric citrate required to support growth on iron-limited medium, suggesting a rank order for metal-binding affinities under physiological conditions comparable with the competitive binding assay at pH 6.5 (wild-type=Q58L&gt;H9Q&gt;H9A, E57A&gt;Y195A, Y196A). Growth dependence on human transferrin was only obtained with cells expressing wild-type, Q58L or H9Q FbpAs, proteins with stability constants derived from the competition assay &gt;2.0x10(18) M(-1). These results suggest that a relatively high affinity of iron binding by FbpA is required for removal of iron from transferrin and its transport across the outer membrane. 	Biochem._J.

27703550	20161006	Serum Interleukin-18 and Its Gene Haplotypes Profile as Predictors in Patients with Diabetic Nephropathy.	Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is known as an acute microvascular complexity as a subsequence progression in diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2. Many evidence pointed that the proinflammatory cytokine Interleukin (IL)-18 might be involved in the pathogenesis of DN. The current study aimed to evaluate the association of serum IL-18 and its promoter gene polymorphisms with diabetic nephropathy. This study included 62 diabetic nephropathy patients (DN group) compared to 52 diabetes mellitus patients (DM group). The two groups were subjected to anthropometry assessment, molecular studies including SNP genotyping by RFLP and finally statistical analysis. The assessment of the serum IL-18 level and the frequencies of its allele and haplotype:-137G/C,-607C/Aand-656G/Tamong the DN and DM subjects revealed that -137G allele has significant variation between DN and DM subjects (about 80.8%, P = 0.05) but, no significant variation in-607or-656allelesIL-18 genepromoter. These data confirm the impact of high serum IL-18 and the haplotype of the polymorphism located in the promoter region of theIL-18 genewith the DN. 	Open_Access_Maced_J_Med_Sci	D016428
15992527	20050705	No association between the putative functional ZDHHC8 single nucleotide polymorphism rs175174 and schizophrenia in large European samples.	It has been recently reported that a functional variant in the ZDHHC8 gene encoding a putative palmitoyltransferase directly confers susceptibility to schizophrenia in females (). We investigated the putative risk allele (rs175174) in four schizophrenia association samples including a Bulgarian proband and parent sample (474 trios) and three case-control panels of European origin (1028 patients/1253 control subjects) in an attempt to replicate these findings. Our results do not support the hypothesis that genetic variation at rs175174 is associated with increased risk for schizophrenia nor do they suggest the presence of gender-specific differences. Our data suggest that the reported genetic association by either represents type I error resulting from sampling variance or that rs175174 is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the functional variant for schizophrenia and different LD patterns obscure the detection of association.

27793194	20161030	Activation of the unfolded protein response and granulovacuolar degeneration are not common features of human prion pathology.	Human prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders with a genetic, sporadic or infectiously acquired aetiology. Neuropathologically, human prion diseases are characterized by deposition of misfolded prion protein and neuronal loss. In post-mortem brain tissue from patients with other neurodegenerative diseases characterized by protein misfolding, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau pathology (FTLD-tau), increased activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) has been observed. The UPR is a cellular stress response that copes with the presence of misfolded proteins. Recent studies have indicated that UPR activation is also involved in experimental models of prion disease and have suggested intervention in the UPR as a therapeutic strategy. On the other hand, it was previously shown that the active form of the UPR stress sensor dsRNA-activated protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK) is not increased in post-mortem brain tissue samples from human prion disease cases. In the present study, we assessed the active form of another UPR stress sensor, inositol-requiring enzyme 1? (IRE1?), in human post-mortem frontal cortex of a large cohort of sporadic, inherited and acquired prion disease patients (n?=?47) and non-neurological controls. Immunoreactivity for phosphorylated IRE1? was not increased in prion disease cases compared with non-neurological controls. In addition, immunoreactivity for phosphorylated PERK was unaltered in human prion disease cases included in the current cohort. Moreover, no difference in the extent of granulovacuolar degeneration, a pathological feature associated with the presence of UPR activation markers, was detected. Our data indicate that, in contrast to AD and primary tauopathies, activation of the UPR is not a common feature of human prion pathology. 	Acta_Neuropathol_Commun	D016428 D013485
23527295	20130326	Rectal transmission of transmitted/founder HIV-1 is efficiently prevented by topical 1% tenofovir in BLT humanized mice.	Rectal microbicides are being developed to prevent new HIV infections in both men and women. We focused our in vivo preclinical efficacy study on rectally-applied tenofovir. BLT humanized mice (n = 43) were rectally inoculated with either the primary isolate HIV-1JRCSF or the MSM-derived transmitted/founder (T/F) virus HIV-1THRO within 30 minutes following treatment with topical 1% tenofovir or vehicle. Under our experimental conditions, in the absence of drug treatment we observed 50% and 60% rectal transmission by HIV-1JRCSF and HIV-1THRO, respectively. Topical tenofovir reduced rectal transmission to 8% (1/12; log rank p = 0.03) for HIV-1JRCSF and 0% (0/6; log rank p = 0.02) for HIV-1THRO. This is the first demonstration that any human T/F HIV-1 rectally infects humanized mice and that transmission of the T/F virus can be efficiently blocked by rectally applied 1% tenofovir. These results obtained in BLT mice, along with recent ex vivo, Phase 1 trial and non-human primate reports, provide a critically important step forward in the development of tenofovir-based rectal microbicides.

27196668	20160520	Overcoming Resistance of Cancer Cells to PARP-1 Inhibitors with Three Different Drug Combinations.	Inhibitors of poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARPis) show promise for treatment of cancers which lack capacity for homologous recombination repair (HRR). However, new therapeutic strategies are required in order to overcome innate and acquired resistance to these drugs and thus expand the array of cancers that could benefit from them. We show that human cancer cell lines which respond poorly to ABT-888 (a PARPi), become sensitive to it when co-treated with vorinostat (a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi)). Vorinostat also sensitized PARPis insensitive cancer cell lines to 6-thioguanine (6-TG)-a drug that targets PARPis sensitive cells. The sensitizing effect of vorinostat was associated with increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2? which in and of itself increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to ABT-888. Importantly, these drug combinations did not affect survival of normal fibroblasts and breast cells, and significantly increased the inhibition of xenograft tumor growth relative to each drug alone, without affecting the mice weight or their liver and kidney function. Our results show that combination of vorinostat and ABT-888 could potentially prove useful for treatment of cancer with innate resistance to PARPis due to active HRR machinery, while the combination of vorinostat and 6-TG could potentially overcome innate or acquired resistance to PARPis due to secondary or reversal BRCA mutations, to decreased PARP-1 level or to increased expression of multiple drug resistant proteins. Importantly, drugs which increase phosphorylation of eIF2? may mimic the sensitizing effect of vorinostat on cellular response to PARPis or to 6-TG, without activating all of its downstream effectors.

26579496	20151119	Putative Breast Cancer Driver Mutations in TBX3 Cause Impaired Transcriptional Repression.	The closely related T-box transcription factors TBX2 and TBX3 are frequently overexpressed in melanoma and various types of human cancers, in particular, breast cancer. The overexpression of TBX2 and TBX3 can have several cellular effects, among them suppression of senescence, promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and invasive cell motility. In contrast, loss of function of TBX3 and most other human T-box genes causes developmental haploinsufficiency syndromes. Stephens and colleagues (1), by exome sequencing of breast tumor samples, identified five different mutations in TBX3, all affecting the DNA-binding T-domain. One in-frame deletion of a single amino acid, p.N212delN, was observed twice. Due to the clustering of these mutations to the T-domain and for statistical reasons, TBX3 was inferred to be a driver gene in breast cancer. Since mutations in the T-domain generally cause loss of function and because the tumorigenic action of TBX3 has generally been attributed to overexpression, we determined whether the putative driver mutations had loss- or gain-of-function properties. We tested two in-frame deletions, one missense, and one frameshift mutant protein for DNA-binding in vitro, and for target gene repression in cell culture. In addition, we performed an in silico analysis of somatic TBX mutations in breast cancer, collected in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Both the experimental and the in silico analysis indicate that the observed mutations predominantly cause loss of TBX3 function. 	Front_Oncol	D016428
26231040	20150801	Registered report: Oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate is a competitive inhibitor of ?-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases.	The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology seeks to address growing concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology. The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and Altmetric scores (Errington et al., 2014). This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from 'Oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate is a competitive inhibitor of ?-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases' by Xu and colleagues, published in Cancer Cell in 2011 (Xu et al., 2011). The key experiments being replicated include Supplemental Figure 3I, which demonstrates that transfection with mutant forms of IDH1 increases levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), Figures 3A and 8A, which demonstrate changes in histone methylation after treatment with 2-HG, and Figures 3D and 7B, which show that mutant IDH1 can effect the same changes as treatment with excess 2-HG. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange, and the results of the replications will be published by eLife.

26576156	20151118	Profiling ? Thalassemia Mutations in Consanguinity and Nonconsanguinity for Prenatal Screening and Awareness Programme.	Mutation spectrum varies significantly in different parts and different ethnic groups of India. Social factors such as preference to marry within the community and among 1st degree relatives (consanguinity) play an important role in impeding the gene pool of the disease within the community and so in society by and large. The present paper discusses the role of consanguinity in profiling of beta thalassemia mutation, and thus the approach for prenatal screening and prevention based awareness programme. Clinically diagnosed 516 cases of beta thalassemia were screened at molecular level. A detailed clinical Proforma was recorded with the information of origin of the family, ethnicity, and consanguinity. The present study reports that subjects originating from Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, and Jharkhand have c.92+5G&gt;C and c.124_127delTTCT mutation as the commonest mutation compared to the subjects hailing from Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and Nepal where sickle mutation was found more common. In 40 consanguineous unions more common and specific beta mutations with higher rate of homozygosity have been reported. This consanguinity-based data helps not only in deciding target oriented prenatal diagnostic strategies but also in objective based awareness programmes in prevention of thalassemia major birth.

26345782	20150909	Influence of interleukin-17 gene polymorphisms on the development of pulmonary tuberculosis.	We conducted a case-control study in a Chinese population to examine the correlations between interleukin (IL)-17 gene polymorphisms and tuberculosis (TB) development. The study population included 336 TB subjects and 351 control subjects who were enrolled between June 2012 and June 2014. Genotyping analyses of IL-17A rs2275913 and rs3748067 and IL-17F rs763780 were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length of polymorphism. The genotype distributions of IL-17 rs2275913 were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the controls, while the IL-17 rs3748067 and rs763780 were not. Based on unconditional logistic regression, individuals carrying the AA genotype and GA + AA genotype of rs2275913 were more likely to have a significantly increased risk of TB compared to subjects with the GG genotype. The ORs (95%CI) for the AA genotype and GA + AA genotype were 2.20 (1.35-3.60) and 1.52 (1.11-2.09), respectively. The CC genotype and TC + CC genotype of rs763780 were associated with increased risk of TB when compared with the TT genotype. The ORs (95%CI) for the CC genotype and TC + CC genotype were 1.99 (1.05-3.87) and 1.58 (1.07-2.33), respectively. In conclusion, rs763780 may play a critical role in the etiology of TB.

8863826	19961001	Vasopressin V2 receptor mutants that cause X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus: analysis of expression, processing, and function.	We investigated the biochemical and functional properties of five vasopressin V2 receptor mutants (L44F, L44P, W164S, S167L, and S167T) that were recently described in families with a history of X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. COS.M6 cells transfected with cDNA encoding these mutants acquired &lt; 4% specific [3H]arginine vasopressin (AVP) binding sites on the cell surface in comparison with cells transfected with cDNA coding for the wild-type receptor. Membrane preparations from COS.M6 cells or human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing these mutants did not respond with an increase in adenylyl cyclase activity in response to AVP, which is in contrast to membranes from cells expressing the wild-type. By analyzing fusion proteins of the V2 receptor and Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase attached to the carboxyl terminus of the receptor moiety, we found that the mutants L44P, W164S, S167L, and S167T lacked complex glycosylation and were expressed at low levels. The data suggest that the mutants L44P, W164S, S167T, and S167L are misfolded and therefore retained within the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded. In contrast, the fusion proteins carrying the mutant L44F and the in vitro mutant S167A were expressed in their mature form at wild-type levels; however, only the mutant S167A was functionally active. Site-directed mutagenesis of S167 revealed that elimination of the endogenous hydroxyl group (S167A) yielded a protein with properties identical to those of the wild-type receptor, whereas both the introduction of a methyl group (S167T) and the replacement of the hydroxyl group by an isopropyl group (S167L) profoundly disturbed receptor processing. The data show that minute changes at codon 167 nearly abolish expression of a mature protein, thus defining structural requirements of this codon. 	Mol._Pharmacol.	D016428 D013485
10662876	20000209	Genotype-phenotype correlation in a large group of Turkish patients with familial mediterranean fever: evidence for mutation-independent amyloidosis.	Differences in clinical manifestations of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) between different ethnic groups have been documented. The FMF gene was recently cloned and four missense mutations (Met694Val, Met680Ile, Val726Ala, and Met694Ile) that account for a large percentage of the patients were identified. The results of initial mutation studies have led to the hypothesis that phenotypic variation of the disease may be attributable to the existence of some of these mutations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether this phenotypic variation is associated with the existence of particular mutations in Turkish FMF patients living in Turkey. Four missense mutations and genotype-phenotype correlation were investigated in 167 Turkish FMF patients. The patients were grouped according to the presence of the Met694Val and the Met680Ile mutations, and 12 clinical parameters were compared between the groups. The presence of the Met694Val mutation was not found to be associated with a severe form of the disease or the development of amyloidosis. Arthritis frequency was found to be lower in the patients with homozygous Met680Ile mutation. None of the four missense mutations is associated with a severe disease or the development of amyloidosis in Turkish FMF patients living in Turkey. The influence of unknown environmental factors and/or the presence of other genetic changes are necessary to explain the phenotypic variation of the disease and the development of amyloidosis.

Patients with hemochromatosis may suffer organ damage from iron overload, often with serious clinical consequences. To assess prevalences of self-reported symptoms and clinical signs and conditions in persons homozygous for the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutation (C282Y) identified by screening. Participants were adults 25 years of age or older enrolled in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study. C282Y homozygotes (n=282) were compared with control participants without the HFE C282Y or H63D alleles (ie, wild type/wild type; n=364). Previously diagnosed C282Y homozygotes and newly diagnosed homozygotes with elevated serum ferritin levels had higher prevalences of certain symptoms such as chronic fatigue (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.34 to 5.95, and OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.07 to 3.75, respectively), and had more hyperpigmentation on physical examination (OR 4.7; 95% CI 1.50 to 15.06, and OR 3.7; 95% CI 1.10 to 12.16, respectively) and swelling or tenderness of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints (OR 4.2; 95% CI 1.37 to 13.03, and OR 3.3; 95% CI 1.17 to 9.49, respectively) than control subjects. Joint stiffness was also more common among newly diagnosed C282Y homozygotes with elevated serum ferritin than among control subjects (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.38 to 5.30). However, the sex- and age-adjusted prevalences of self-reported symptoms and signs of liver disease, heart disease, diabetes and most other major clinical manifestations of hemochromatosis were similar in C282Y homozygotes and control subjects. Some symptoms and conditions associated with hemochromatosis were more prevalent among C282Y homozygotes identified by screening than among control subjects, but prevalences of most outcomes were similar in C282Y homozygotes and controls in this primary care-based study.

23772378	20130618	Ephexin4-mediated promotion of cell migration and anoikis resistance is regulated by serine 897 phosphorylation of EphA2.	EphA2 is activated through phosphorylation on serine 897 (S897) by Akt to promote cancer cell motility and invasion, independently of stimulation by ephrin, its ligand. Here we show that S897 phosphorylation of EphA2 strengthens the interaction between EphA2 and Ephexin4, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPase RhoG. S897A mutation of EphA2 abolished the EphA2/Ephexin4-mediated RhoG activation, promotion of cell migration, and resistance to anoikis. Our results suggest that S897-phosphorylated EphA2 recruits Ephexin4 to promote cell migration and anoikis resistance, providing a molecular link between S897 phosphorylation of EphA2 and tumor progression.

24049523	20130920	Association of CD36 gene polymorphisms with echo- and electrocardiographic parameters in patients with early onset coronary artery disease.	CD36 plays an important role in long-chain fatty acid homeostasis in skeletal muscle and the myocardium. CD36 deficiency may lead to reduced myocardial uptake of long-chain fatty acid. Therefore, different mutations of the CD36 gene may contribute to the clinical heterogeneity of cardiac hypertrophy. The objective of the study was to investigate whether there is an association between the sequence changes in CD36 and echocardiographic and electrocardiographic parameters in Caucasian patients with early onset coronary artery disease. The study group comprised 100 patients. Electrocardiography and echocardiography were performed in all patients. Amplicons of exons 4 to 6 including fragments of introns were studied using the denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography technique. IVS3-6TC (rs3173798) heterozygotes had impaired left ventricle diastolic function. 573GA heterozygotes (rs5956) had higher frequency of pseudonormal left ventricular diastolic function and it was confirmed by the increase in wave A' in the tissue Doppler. 591AT genotype was associated with borderline higher posterior wall end-diastolic thickness and lower E/A ratio. These results are consistent with electrocardiography parameters which could reflect left ventricular hypertrophy (higher RV5(6) and RV5(6) + SV1(2) parameters, depressed ST segments and tendency to longer Qtc II interval) in 591AT heterozygotes. Detected variant alleles of CD36 may be associated with features of left ventricular hypertrophy and impaired diastolic function. 	Arch_Med_Sci	D016428
26535635	20151105	Role of proteinase-activated receptor-1 gene polymorphisms in susceptibility to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	We conducted a case-control study to investigate the association between PAR1 gene polymorphisms and the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A total of 270 patients with COPD and 270 control subjects were consecutively recruited between March 2012 and March 2014. A polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism assay was used to assess the polymorphisms PAR1 IVS-14 A/T rs168753 and -506 I/D rs11267092. The frequency of the AA genotype in PAR1 IVS-14 A/T rs168753 was significantly higher than in the controls (?(2) = 7.23, P = 0.03). By logistic regression analysis, we found that the AA genotype of PAR1 IVS-14 A/T rs168753 was associated with increased risk of COPD compared with the GG genotype. The adjusted OR (95%CI) was 2.00 (1.15-3.50) for the AA genotype. In conclusion, we found that the PAR1 IVS-14 A/T rs168753 polymorphism was associated with the development of COPD. 	Genet._Mol._Res.

19296553	20090320	The COMT Val158Met polymorphism and cognition in depressed and nondepressed older adults.	The objective of the current study was to examine the relationship between the COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism and neuropsychological performance in depressed and nondepressed older adults. One hundred and twenty-six clinically depressed older adults and 105 nondepressed comparison participants were compared on neuropsychological performance and COMT Val(158)Met (Val/Val, Val/Met, Met/Met). Based on multivariate regression models, the COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism was not associated with cognitive performance among depressed or nondepressed individuals, nor did this polymorphism account for the fact that depressed individuals performed worse than nondepressed individuals on several neuropsychological tests that are typically affected by depression. There was also no difference in frequency of the COMT Val(158)Met alleles between depressed and nondepressed individuals. Although the current study found no association between COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism on a number of clinical neuropsychological tests that are typically found to be sensitive to depression, differential effects of the COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism on dopamine transmission in psychiatric and non-psychiatric populations may be further clarified by clinical research with neuroscience-based paradigms that segregate cognitive tasks into component processes with precise neural substrates, particularly with respect to the complex functions of the prefrontal cortex. Negative results can be important to narrowing down target processes and understanding the influence of clinical and demographic characteristics in studies of psychiatric genetics.

24859272	20140527	Genetic variations of IL-12B, IL-12R?1, IL-12R?2 in Behcet's disease and VKH syndrome.	To investigate the associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of three genes (IL-12B, IL-12R?1 and IL-12R?2) in Behcet's disease (BD) and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome in a Chinese Han population. A total of 806 BD cases, 820 VKH patients, and 1600 healthy controls were involved in this study. The first investigation included 400 BD patients, 400 VKH cases, and 600 healthy individuals. A second confirmatory study included a separate set of 406 BD patients, 420 VKH cases and another 1000 normal controls. Genotyping was carried out by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay and results were validated by using direct sequencing. The ?2 test was performed to compare the allele and genotype frequencies between cases and healthy controls. This study comprised two phases. In the first phase study, a significantly increased frequency of the rs3212227/IL-12B genotype CC and C allele was found in BD patients as compared to controls (Bonferroni corrected p value (pc)?=?0.009, OR 1.8; pc?=?0.024, OR 1.3, respectively). Moreover, the frequency of the C allele of rs3212227/IL-12B was also significantly increased in VKH patients (pc?=?0.012, OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.6). No associations were found for the other seven tested SNPs either in BD or VKH disease. The second study as well as the combined data confirmed the significant association of rs3212227/IL-12B with BD (CC genotype: combined pc?=?6.3?10(-7), OR?=?1.8; C allele: combined pc?=?2.0?10(-5), OR?=?1.3, respectively) and the C allele frequency of rs3212227/IL-12B as the risk factor to VKH patients (combined pc?=?2.5?10(-5), OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.5). Our study revealed that the IL-12B gene is involved both in the susceptibility to BD as well as VKH syndrome. 	PLoS_ONE	D016430 D016428 D013485
16585267	20060406	Antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis is associated with HLA-DR molecules that bind a Borrelia burgdorferi peptide.	An association has previously been shown between antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis, the human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR4 molecule, and T cell recognition of an epitope of Borrelia burgdorferi outer-surface protein A (OspA163-175). We studied the frequencies of HLA-DRB1-DQA1-DQB1 haplotypes in 121 patients with antibiotic-refractory or antibiotic-responsive Lyme arthritis and correlated these frequencies with in vitro binding of the OspA163-175 peptide to 14 DRB molecules. Among the 121 patients, the frequencies of HLA-DRB1-DQA1-DQB1 haplotypes were similar to those in control subjects. However, when stratified by antibiotic response, the frequencies of DRB1 alleles in the 71 patients with antibiotic-refractory arthritis differed significantly from those in the 50 antibiotic-responsive patients (log likelihood test, P = 0.006; exact test, P = 0.008; effect size, Wn = 0.38). 7 of the 14 DRB molecules (DRB1*0401, 0101, 0404, 0405, DRB5*0101, DRB1*0402, and 0102) showed strong to weak binding of OspA163-175, whereas the other seven showed negligible or no binding of the peptide. Altogether, 79% of the antibiotic-refractory patients had at least one of the seven known OspA peptide-binding DR molecules compared with 46% of the antibiotic-responsive patients (odds ratio = 4.4; P &lt; 0.001). We conclude that binding of a single spirochetal peptide to certain DRB molecules is a marker for antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis and might play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.

18200441	20080118	Genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 CYP1A1 (*2A) and microsomal epoxide hydrolase gene, interactions with tobacco-users, and susceptibility to bladder cancer: a study from North India.	The role of low penetrance genes and environmental factors in the etiology of bladder cancer (CaB) is unclear, but may involve genetic and environmental factors. Most environmental pro-carcinogens require metabolic activation by phase I enzymes (CYP450s), However, phase II enzyme (i.e., microsomal epoxide hydrolase: mEH) is mainly involved in the detoxification of wide variety of endogenous or exogenous carcinogens. Genetic differences in CYP1A1 gene and the mEH gene polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with susceptibility to various cancers. In our case-control study, we assess whether Msp1 polymorphism of CYP1A1 (CYP1A1*2A), and His(113) in exon 3 and Arg(139) in exon 4 of the mEH susceptibility genotypes, tobacco-use and age factors contribute to bladder cancer risk among Indians. A case-control study was conducted in 106 bladder cancer (CaB) patients and 160 age matched controls from similar ethnic background. The CYP1A1*2A and mEH genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism method from DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples. Binary logistic regression model was used for assessing differences in genotype prevalence between patients and the controls. The Arlequin software package was used to compute haplotype frequencies. We observed non-significant association in T/C polymorphism of the CYP1A1 gene (CYP1A1*2A); however, the exon 3 His genotype of the mEH gene polymorphism alone (odds ratio = 2.67, P = 0.001) or in combination with tobacco-users were significantly associated with the risk of bladder cancer. No associations were observed with stage or grade of bladder tumor with these genotypes. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that exon 3 His genotype of the mEH are more prone to the risk of sporadic bladder cancer in North India. 	Arch._Toxicol.	D016428 D013485
26678048	20151219	The Inflammatory Transcription Factors NF?B, STAT1 and STAT3 Drive Age-Associated Transcriptional Changes in the Human Kidney.	Human kidney function declines with age, accompanied by stereotyped changes in gene expression and histopathology, but the mechanisms underlying these changes are largely unknown. To identify potential regulators of kidney aging, we compared age-associated transcriptional changes in the human kidney with genome-wide maps of transcription factor occupancy from ChIP-seq datasets in human cells. The strongest candidates were the inflammation-associated transcription factors NF?B, STAT1 and STAT3, the activities of which increase with age in epithelial compartments of the renal cortex. Stimulation of renal tubular epithelial cells with the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 (a STAT3 activator), IFN? (a STAT1 activator), or TNF? (an NF?B activator) recapitulated age-associated gene expression changes. We show that common DNA variants in RELA and NFKB1, the two genes encoding subunits of the NF?B transcription factor, associate with kidney function and chronic kidney disease in gene association studies, providing the first evidence that genetic variation in NF?B contributes to renal aging phenotypes. Our results suggest that NF?B, STAT1 and STAT3 underlie transcriptional changes and chronic inflammation in the aging human kidney. 	PLoS_Genet.	D016428 D052061
24119066	20131015	Large-scale polymorphism discovery in macaque G-protein coupled receptors.	G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) play an inordinately large role in human health. Variation in the genes that encode these receptors is associated with numerous disorders across the entire spectrum of disease. GPCRs also represent the single largest class of drug targets and associated pharmacogenetic effects are modulated, in part, by polymorphisms. Recently, non-human primate models have been developed focusing on naturally-occurring, functionally-parallel polymorphisms in candidate genes. This work aims to extend those studies broadly across the roughly 377 non-olfactory GPCRs. Initial efforts include resequencing 44 Indian-origin rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), 20 Chinese-origin rhesus macaques, and 32 cynomolgus macaques (M. fascicularis). Using the Agilent target enrichment system, capture baits were designed for GPCRs off the human and rhesus exonic sequence. Using next generation sequencing technologies, nearly 25,000 SNPs were identified in coding sequences including over 14,000 non-synonymous and more than 9,500 synonymous protein-coding SNPs. As expected, regions showing the least evolutionary constraint show greater rates of polymorphism and greater numbers of higher frequency polymorphisms. While the vast majority of these SNPs are singletons, roughly 1,750 non-synonymous and 2,900 synonymous SNPs were found in multiple individuals. In all three populations, polymorphism and divergence is highly concentrated in N-terminal and C-terminal domains and the third intracellular loop region of GPCRs, regions critical to ligand-binding and signaling. SNP frequencies in macaques follow a similar pattern of divergence from humans and new polymorphisms in primates have been identified that may parallel those seen in humans, helping to establish better non-human primate models of disease.

25101777	20140808	Crystal structure confirmation of JHP933 as a nucleotidyltransferase superfamily protein from Helicobacter pylori strain J99.	Helicobacter pylori is a well-known pathogen involved in the development of peptic ulcer, gastric adenocarcinoma and other forms of gastric cancer. Recently, there has been more considerable interest in strain-specific genes located in plasticity regions with great genetic variability. However, little is known about many of these genes. Studies suggested that certain genes in this region may play key roles in the pathogenesis of H. pylori-associated gastroduodenal diseases. JHP933, a conserved putative protein of unknown function, is encoded by the gene in plasticity region of H. pylori strain J99. Here we have determined the structure of JHP933. Our work demonstrates that JHP933 is a nucleotidyltransferase superfamily protein with a characteristic ??????? topology. A superposition demonstrates overall structural homology of the JHP933 N-terminal fragment with lincosamide antibiotic adenylyltransferase LinA and identifies a possible substrate-binding cleft of JHP933. Furthermore, through structural comparison with LinA and LinB, we pinpoint conservative active site residues which may contribute to divalent ion coordination and substrate binding.

22073120	20111111	In vivo systematic analysis of Candida albicans Zn2-Cys6 transcription factors mutants for mice organ colonization.	The incidence of fungal infections in immuno-compromised patients increased considerably over the last 30 years. New treatments are therefore needed against pathogenic fungi. With Candida albicans as a model, study of host-fungal pathogen interactions might reveal new sources of therapies. Transcription factors (TF) are of interest since they integrate signals from the host environment and participate in an adapted microbial response. TFs of the Zn2-Cys6 class are specific to fungi and are important regulators of fungal metabolism. This work analyzed the importance of the C. albicans Zn2-Cys6 TF for mice kidney colonization. For this purpose, 77 Zn2-Cys6 TF mutants were screened in a systemic mice model of infection by pools of 10 mutants. We developed a simple barcoding strategy to specifically detect each mutant DNA from mice kidney by quantitative PCR. Among the 77 TF mutant strains tested, eight showed a decreased colonization including mutants for orf19.3405, orf19.255, orf19.5133, RGT1, UGA3, orf19.6182, SEF1 and orf19.2646, and four an increased colonization including mutants for orf19.4166, ZFU2, orf19.1685 and UPC2 as compared to the isogenic wild type strain. Our approach was validated by comparable results obtained with the same animal model using a single mutant and the revertant for an ORF (orf19.2646) with still unknown functions. In an attempt to identify putative involvement of such TFs in already known C. albicans virulence mechanisms, we determined their in vitro susceptibility to pH, heat and oxidative stresses, as well as ability to produce hyphae and invade agar. A poor correlation was found between in vitro and in vivo assays, thus suggesting that TFs needed for mice kidney colonization may involve still unknown mechanisms. This large-scale analysis of mice organ colonization by C. albicans can now be extended to other mutant libraries since our in vivo screening strategy can be adapted to any preexisting mutants.

23050958	20121012	Cancer prevention as biomodulation: targeting the initiating stimulus and secondary adaptations.	In a medical sense, biomodulation could be considered a biochemical or cellular response to a disease or therapeutic stimulus. In cancer pathophysiology, the initial oncogenic stimulus leads to cellular and biochemical changes that allow cells, tissue, and organism to accommodate and accept the oncogenic insult. In epithelial cell cancer development, the process of carcinogenesis is frequently characterized by sequential cellular and biochemical adaptations as cells transition through hyperplasia, dysplasia, atypical dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, and invasive cancer. In some cases, the adaptations may persist after the initial oncogenic stimulus is gone in a type of &quot;hit-and-run&quot; oncogenesis. These pathophysiological changes may interfere with cancer prevention therapies targeted solely to the initial oncogenic insult, perhaps contributing to resistance development. Characterization of these accommodating adaptations could provide insight for the development of cancer preventive regimens that might more effectively biomodulate preneoplastic cells toward a more normal state.

28510946	20170517	Aluminum induces rapidly mitochondria-dependent programmed cell death in Al-sensitive peanut root tips.	Although many studies suggested that aluminum (Al) induced programmed cell death (PCD) in plants, the mechanism of Al-induced PCD and its effects in Al tolerance is limited. This study was to investigate the mechanism and type of Al induced PCD and the relationship between PCD and Al tolerance. In this study, two genotypes of peanut 99-1507 (Al tolerant) and ZH2 (Al sensitive) were used to investigate Al-induced PCD. Peanut root growth inhibition induced by AlCl3was concentration and time-dependent in two peanut varieties. AlCl3at 100 ?M could induce rapidly peanut root tip PCD involved in DNA cleavage, typical apoptotic chromatin condensation staining with DAPI, apoptosis related gene Hrs203j expression and cytochrome C (Cyt c) release from mitochondria to cytosol. Caspase3-like protease was activated by Al; it was higher in ZH2 than in 99-1507. Al increased the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), decreased inner membrane potential (??m) of mitochondria. Compared with the control, Al stress increased O2?-and H2O2production in mitochondria. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst was produced at Al treatment for 4 h. Al-induced PCD is earlier and faster in Al-sensitive peanut cultivar than in Al-tolerant cultivar. There is a negative relationship between PCD and Al resistance. Mitochondria- dependence PCD was induced by Al and ROS was involved in this process. The mechanism can be explained by the model of acceleration of senescence under Al stress. 	Bot_Stud	D016428

In the title compound, C(11)H(12)N(2)O(2)?C(7)H(5)NO(4)?C(2)H(6)O, the (2S*)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propionic acid is present in the zwitterionic form. In the crystal structure, 2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propionic acid mol-ecules and pyridine-2,4-dicarb-oxylic acid mol-ecules are linked through strong inter-molecular O-H?O and N-H?O hydrogen bonds, forming layers parallel to (100). The layers are linked through the ethanol mol-ecules via somewhat weaker inter-molecular O-H?O and N-H?O hydrogen bonds, forming thus a three-dimensional network. Weak C-H?O and N-H?N hydrogen bonding and ?-? inter-actions between the aromatic rings are also present. 	Acta_Crystallogr_Sect_E_Struct_Rep_Online	D016428
23892632	20130730	Glutathione and the antioxidant potential of binary mixtures with flavonoids: synergisms and antagonisms.	Polyphenols are able to trap free radicals, which contributes to their known antioxidant capacity. In plant extracts, these secondary metabolites may act in concert, in a way that their combined activities will be superior to their individual effects (synergistic interaction). Several polyphenols have demonstrated clear antioxidant properties in vitro, and many of their biological actions have been attributed to their intrinsic reducing capabilities. As so, the intake of these compounds at certain concentrations in the diet and/or supplementation may potentiate the activity of reduced form glutathione (GSH), thus better fighting oxidative stress. The aim of this work was to predict a structure-antioxidant activity relationship using different classes of flavonoids and to assess, for the first time, possible synergisms and antagonisms with GSH. For these purposes a screening microassay involving the scavenging of DPPH? was applied. In general, among the tested compounds, those lacking the catechol group in B ring showed antagonistic behaviour with GSH. Myricetin displayed additive effect, while quercetin, fisetin, luteolin, luteolin-7-O-glucoside, taxifolin and (+)-catechin demonstrated synergistic actions. Furthermore, adducts formed at C2' and C5' of the B ring seem to be more important for the antioxidant capacity than adducts formed at C6 and C8 of the A ring. 	Molecules	D016428 D013485
9548748	19980516	Single amino acid substitutions at the N-terminus of a recombinant cytotoxic ribonuclease markedly influence biochemical and biological properties.	Onconase is a cytotoxic ribonuclease with antitumor properties. A semisynthetic gene encoding the entire protein sequence was constructed by fusing oligonucleotides coding for the first 15 and the last 6 of the 104 amino acids to a genomic clone that encoded the remaining amino acid residues [Newton, D. L., et al. (1997) Protein Eng. 10, 463-470]. The resulting protein product expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited little enzymatic or cytotoxic activity due to the unprocessed N-terminal Met amino acid residue. In this study, we demonstrate that modification of the 5'-region of the gene to encode [Met-(-1)]Ser or [Met-(-1)]Tyr instead of the native pyroglutamate results in recombinant onconase derivatives with restored activities. [Met-(-1)]rOnc(E1S) was more active than [Met-(-1)]rOnc(E1Y) in all assays tested. Consistent with the action of native onconase, [Met-(-1)]rOnc(E1S) was a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis in the cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate assay, degrading tRNA at concentrations that correlated with inhibition of protein synthesis. An interesting difference between the recombinant onconase derivatives and the native protein was their susceptibility to inhibition by the major intracellular RNase inhibitor, PRI (onconase is refractory to PRI inhibition). [Met-(-1)]rOnc(E1S) and [Met-(-1)]rOnc(E1Y) inhibited protein synthesis in intact SF539 neuroblastoma cells with IC50's very similar to that of onconase (IC50 3.5, 10, and 10 microg/mL after 1 day and 0.16, 0.35, and 2.5 microg/mL after 5 days for onconase, [Met-(-1)]rOnc(E1S), and [Met-(-1)]rOnc(E1Y), respectively). Similar to that of onconase, cytotoxic activity of the recombinant derivatives was potentiated by monensin, NH4Cl, and retinoic acid. Brefeldin A completely blocked the enhancement of cytotoxicity caused by retinoic acid with all three proteins. Thus, drug-induced alterations of the intracellular trafficking of the recombinant derivatives also resembles that of onconase. Stability studies as assessed in serum-containing medium in the presence or absence of cells at 37 degreesC showed that the recombinant proteins were as stable to temperature and cell culture conditions as the native protein. Therefore, exchanging the Glu amino acid residue at the amino terminus of onconase with an amino acid residue containing a hydroxyl group produces recombinant proteins with ribonuclease and cytotoxic properties similar to native onconase.

20629186	20100715	Implication of Akt-dependent Prp19 alpha/14-3-3beta/Cdc5L complex formation in neuronal differentiation.	PRP19alpha and CDC5L are major components of the active spliceosome. However, their association process is still unknown. Here, we demonstrated that PRP19 alpha/14-3-3beta/CDC5L complex formation is regulated by Akt during nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. Analysis of PRP19 alpha mutants revealed that the phosphorylation of PRP19 alpha at Thr 193 by Akt was critical for its binding with 14-3-3beta to translocate into the nuclei and for PRP19 alpha/14-3-3beta/CDC5L complex formation in neuronal differentiation. Forced expression of either sense PRP19 alpha or sense 14-3-3beta RNAs promoted NGF-induced neuronal differentiation, whereas down-regulation of these mRNAs showed a suppressive effect. The nonphosphorylation mutant PRP19 alpha T193A lost its binding ability with 14-3-3beta and acted as a dominant-negative mutant in neuronal differentiation. These results imply that Akt-dependent phosphorylation of PRP19 alpha at Thr193 triggers PRP19 alpha/14-3-3beta/CDC5L complex formation in the nuclei, likely to assemble the active spliceosome against neurogenic pre-mRNAs.

25793273	20150321	M?ller glia activation in response to inherited retinal degeneration is highly varied and disease-specific.	Despite different aetiologies, most inherited retinal disorders culminate in photoreceptor loss, which induces concomitant changes in the neural retina, one of the most striking being reactive gliosis by M?ller cells. It is typically assumed that photoreceptor loss leads to an upregulation of glial fibrilliary acidic protein (Gfap) and other intermediate filament proteins, together with other gliosis-related changes, including loss of integrity of the outer limiting membrane (OLM) and deposition of proteoglycans. However, this is based on a mix of both injury-induced and genetic causes of photoreceptor loss. There are very few longitudinal studies of gliosis in the retina and none comparing these changes across models over time. Here, we present a comprehensive spatiotemporal assessment of features of gliosis in the degenerating murine retina that involves M?ller glia. Specifically, we assessed Gfap, vimentin and chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan (CSPG) levels and outer limiting membrane (OLM) integrity over time in four murine models of inherited photoreceptor degeneration that encompass a range of disease severities (Crb1rd8/rd8, Prph2+/?307, Rho-/-, Pde6brd1/rd1). These features underwent very different changes, depending upon the disease-causing mutation, and that these changes are not correlated with disease severity. Intermediate filament expression did indeed increase with disease progression in Crb1rd8/rd8 and Prph2+/?307, but decreased in the Prph2+/?307 and Pde6brd1/rd1 models. CSPG deposition usually, but not always, followed the trends in intermediate filament expression. The OLM adherens junctions underwent significant remodelling in all models, but with differences in the composition of the resulting junctions; in Rho-/- mice, the adherens junctions maintained the typical rod-M?ller glia interactions, while in the Pde6brd1/rd1 model they formed predominantly between M?ller cells in late stage of degeneration. Together, these results show that gliosis and its associated processes are variable and disease-dependent. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
25834802	20150403	Combined treatment with silibinin and either sorafenib or gefitinib enhances their growth-inhibiting effects in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.	Silibinin, the main component of silymarin, is used as a hepatoprotectant and exhibits anticancer effects against various cancer cells. This study evaluated the effects of a combination of silibinin with either gefitinib or sorafenib on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Several different human HCC cell lines were used to test the growth-inhibiting effects and cell toxicity of silibinin both alone and in combination with either gefitinib or sorafenib. The cell viability and growth inhibition were assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, trypan blue staining, and a colony-forming assay. Furthermore, changes in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-related signals were evaluated by Western blot analysis. Gefitinib, sorafenib, and silibinin individually exhibited dose-dependent antiproliferative effects on HCC cells. Combined treatment with silibinin enhanced the gefitinib-induced growth-inhibiting effects in some HCC cell lines. The combination effect of gefitinib and silibinin was synergistic in the SNU761 cell line, but was only additive in the Huh-BAT cell line. The combination effect may be attributable to inhibition of EGFR-dependent Akt signaling. Enhanced growth-inhibiting effects were also observed in HCC cells treated with a combination of sorafenib and silibinin. Combined treatment with silibinin enhanced the growth-inhibiting effects of both gefitinib and sorafenib. Therefore, the combination of silibinin with either sorafenib or gefitinib could be a useful treatment approach for HCC in the future. 	Clin_Mol_Hepatol	D016428 D013485
23609544	20130424	Exploring mRNA 3'-UTR G-quadruplexes: evidence of roles in both alternative polyadenylation and mRNA shortening.	Guanine-rich RNA sequences can fold into non-canonical, four stranded helical structures called G-quadruplexes that have been shown to be widely distributed within the mammalian transcriptome, as well as being key regulatory elements in various biological mechanisms. That said, their role within the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA remains to be elucidated and appreciated. A bioinformatic analysis of the 3'-UTRs of mRNAs revealed enrichment in G-quadruplexes. To shed light on the role(s) of these structures, those found in the LRP5 and FXR1 genes were characterized both in vitro and in cellulo. The 3'-UTR G-quadruplexes were found to increase the efficiencies of alternative polyadenylation sites, leading to the expression of shorter transcripts and to possess the ability to interfere with the miRNA regulatory network of a specific mRNA. Clearly, G-quadruplexes located in the 3'-UTRs of mRNAs are cis-regulatory elements that have a significant impact on gene expression. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D013485
9636669	19980624	Identification of the catalytic triad of the protein D2 protease in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	We reported recently that protein D2 (OprD) porin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bears protease activity (FEBS Letters 394, 179-182, 1996). To identify the catalytic residues of OprD, we introduced the site-directed mutations replacing the putative catalytic triad His156, Asp208, and Ser296 with glutamine, asparagine, and alanine, respectively. The OprD proteins purified from the chromosomal oprD-deficient mutants harboring the plasmids encoding the site-directed mutations showed protease activity less than 0.1% of that of the wild-type OprD. These site-directed mutageneses caused undetectable changes in the pore-forming activity of OprD as measured by single-channel conductance by the planar lipid bilayer. The minimum inhibitory concentration of imipenem in mutants having the replaced catalytic triads was identical with that in the wild-type strain. On the other hand, introduction of the mutation at His367 replacing with glutamine, the site that is supposed to be unrelated to the catalytic sites, showed the unchanged protease activity. These results unequivocally demonstrate that OprD is the protease bearing porin and catalyzes the reaction at His156, Asp208, and Ser296 residues. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.	D016428 D013485
21276306	20110201	Performance comparison of four methods for detecting multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains.	National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory, Kuwait. To compare Genotype MTBDRplus (gMTBDR(+)), INNO-LiPA Rif.TB (INNO-LiPA), polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and DNA sequencing for detecting rifampicin (RMP) and/or isoniazid (INH) resistance-associated mutations in the rpoB hot-spot region (HSR-rpoB), the katG codon 315 (katG315) and the inhA regulatory region (inhA-RR) among multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates. A total of 82 MDR-TB and 43 pansusceptible M.tuberculosis BACTEC 460-characterised isolates were processed using molecular techniques and the Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) 960 system. All susceptible strains contained wild-type sequences in target genes. RMP resistance was detected in respectively 78, 77 and 79 MDR-TB strains by gMTBDR(+), INNO-LiPA and HSR-rpoB sequencing. Two isolates with Ins514TTC mutation were detected as RMP-resistant by gMTBDR(+) but as RMP-susceptible by INNO-LiPA. One isolate with L533P mutation, detected as RMP-susceptible by gMTBDR(+), was detected as RMP-resistant by INNO-LiPA. Two of three isolates detected as RMP-susceptible by gMTBDR(+), INNO-LiPA, HSR-rpoB sequencing and the MGIT 960 system contained a I572F mutation that is outside HSR-rpoB. INH resistance was detected in respectively 76, 60, 60 and 22 MDR-TB strains by gMTBDR(+), katG315 PCR-RFLP, katG315 sequencing and inhA-RR sequencing. Although gMTBDR(+) accurately detected ? 88% of MDR-TB strains, some rpoB mutations were either missed or were outside the region of analysis of the gMTBDR(+) assay. 	Int._J._Tuberc._Lung_Dis.

28459101	20170502	Innate immunity and chronic rhinosinusitis: What we have learned from animal models.	Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous and multifactorial disease characterized by dysregulated inflammation. Abnormalities in innate immune function including sinonasal epithelial cell barrier function, mucociliary clearance, response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), and the contribution of innate immune cells will be highlighted in this review. PubMed literature review. A review of the literature was conducted to determine what we have learned from animal models in relation to innate immunity and chronic rhinosinusitis. Dysregulation of innate immune mechanisms including sinonasal barrier function, mucociliary clearance, PAMPs, and innate immune cells such as eosinophils, mast cells, and innate lymphoid cells may contribute to CRS pathogenesis. Sinonasal inflammation has been studied using mouse, rat, rabbit, pig, and sheep explant orin vivomodels. Study using these models has allowed for analysis of experimental therapeutics and furthered our understanding of the aforementioned aspects of the innate immune mechanism as it relates to sinonasal inflammation. These include augmenting mucociliary clearance through activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and study of drug toxicity on ciliary beat frequency. Knockout models of Toll-like receptors (TLR) have demonstrated the critical role these PRRs play in allergic inflammation as loss of TLR2 and TLR4 leads to decreased lower airway inflammation. Mast cell deficient mice are less susceptible to ovalbumin-induced sinonasal inflammation. Animal models have shed light as to the potential contribution of dysregulated innate immunity in chronic sinonasal inflammation. 	Laryngoscope_Investig_Otolaryngol	D016428
8462765	19930301	Islet amyloid polypeptide in the rabbit and European hare: studies on its relationship to amyloidogenesis.	In this study, we determined the cDNA-predicted amino acid sequence of positions 9-31 of islet amyloid polypeptide from the rabbit and European hare. A synthetic rabbit/hare islet amyloid polypeptide 20-29 peptide was subsequently shown to be strongly fibrillogenic in vitro even though the putative amyloidogenic AILS sequence at positions 25-28 of human and cat islet amyloid polypeptide is modified in the rabbit and hare by a substitution of phenylalanine for leucine at position 27 (i.e. AIFS). Although islet amyloid polypeptide of both the rabbit and hare has an amyloidogenic sequence and is in fact amyloidogenic in vitro, the apparent lack of in vivo islet amyloidosis in rabbits and hares may be related to relatively low levels of islet amyloid polypeptide production by the islet beta cells in these species. This was supported by our findings that there is no substantial immunoreactivity in either rabbit or hare islets, and no measurable amount either in extracts of rabbit pancreases, or in rabbit plasma. This study supports the need for at least two prerequisites for the development of islet amyloidosis in vivo: an inherent fibrillogenic sequence within the islet amyloid polypeptide molecule and an adequate local concentration of islet amyloid polypeptide to promote self aggregation and formation of islet amyloid.

25286842	20141008	Solving the RNA polymerase I structural puzzle.	Knowing the structure of multi-subunit complexes is critical to understand basic cellular functions. However, when crystals of these complexes can be obtained they rarely diffract beyond 3?? resolution, which complicates X-ray structure determination and refinement. The crystal structure of RNA polymerase I, an essential cellular machine that synthesizes the precursor of ribosomal RNA in the nucleolus of eukaryotic cells, has recently been solved. Here, the crucial steps that were undertaken to build the atomic model of this multi-subunit enzyme are reported, emphasizing how simple crystallographic experiments can be used to extract relevant biological information. In particular, this report discusses the combination of poor molecular replacement and experimental phases, the application of multi-crystal averaging and the use of anomalous scatterers as sequence markers to guide tracing and to locate the active site. The methods outlined here will likely serve as a reference for future structural determination of large complexes at low resolution. 	Acta_Crystallogr._D_Biol._Crystallogr.	D016428 D013485
22057349	20111108	Glu-108 is essential for subunit assembly and dimer stability of D-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase from Entamoeba histolytica.	D-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase catalyses the first step of phosphorylated serine biosynthesis pathway by oxidizing 3-phosphoglycerate, a glycolysis intermediate into phosphohydroxsy pyruvate. For Entamoeba histolytica this pathway is an integral part of the cysteine metabolism, which is considered to be vital for growth and survival of the parasite. Entamoeba histolytica D-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (EhPGDH) exists as a homodimer at pH 7. Mild acidic conditions induce significant changes in the functional and structural features of the protein as observed by enzymatic activity, spectropolarimetric measurements and fluorescence spectroscopy. Most interestingly the oligomeric status of the protein was lost and a functionally inactive monomer was stabilized at pH 5. Computational modeling and molecular dynamic simulations show that dimeric assembly of EhPGDH was stabilized with the help of several inter-subunit non-covalent interactions and subunit dissociation at pH 5 can be attributed to protonation of acidic amino acid residues present at the dimer interface. Site directed mutagenesis studies suggest that Glu-108 is essential for subunit assembly as the E108A mutant existed as monomer even at pH 7. The studies unequivocally show that the electrostatic interactions at the dimer interface play a crucial role in the stability of the protein and a complete dimer is essentially required for optimal enzymatic activity.

17854308	20070915	JAK2-V617F mutation analysis of granulocytes and platelets from patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders: advantage of studying platelets.	There have been conflicting reports over the JAK2-V617F mutation status of platelets in chronic myeloproliferative diseases (CMPDs). The aim of this study was to analyse JAK2-V617F status, not only in granulocytes but also in platelets. The JAK2-V617F mutation was analysed in both granulocytes and platelets in 115 patients with CMPDs using direct sequencing. JAK2-V617F was detected in granulocytes from 71 of those patients, all 71 of whom also had platelet JAK2-V617F expression. The remaining 44 patients showed negative JAK2-V617F expression on granulocytes, but positive JAK2-V617F expression was detected on the platelets from nine of the 33 essential thrombocythaemia (ET) patients, one of the eight polycythaemia vera patients, and two of the three primary myelofibrosis patients. When ET patients were divided into three groups according to granulocyte and platelet JAK2-V617F status (both-positive, platelets-only positive and both-negative), the both-positive and platelets-only positive groups shared the clinical features of higher white blood cell count and frequent thrombosis. These results suggest that analysis of platelets is a more sensitive approach for detecting JAK2-V617F in CMPD patients than analysis of granulocytes. They also suggest that previous reports of the incidence of JAK2-V617F in CMPD patients, obtained using only analysis of granulocytes, could be underestimations. 	Br._J._Haematol.

16565361	20060328	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 3 delays human lens epithelial cells in metaphase.	Ubc3/Cdc34 is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Ubc) with well established functions in the G1-to-S-phase transition. Expecting to find similar effects in human lens epithelial cells (HLECs), the authors explored roles for this ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in regulation of the HLEC cycle. Catalytically incompetent Ubc3 (C88S, L97S), wild-type (wt)Ubc3, and mutant (mt)Ubc2 (C93A) were expressed in HLECs, by using an adenoviral vector, and cell cycle progression was assessed. Expression of mt- and wtUbc3, but not empty virus or mtUbc2, delayed the cell cycle in metaphase, rather than the expected G1 phase. Expression of both Ubc3s also stabilized M-phase regulators, cyclin A, cyclin B, and securin. Thus, it appeared that the Ubc3 enzymes were playing roles different from canonical proteolytic functions in targeting G1/S regulators for degradation. We also directly investigated the effect of inhibiting the proteasome on the cell cycle of HLECs. When the proteasome inhibitor was added to S-phase cells, the M-phase regulators were stabilized, and the cells were arrested in the G2/M phase. In contrast, if the proteasome inhibitor was added before the cells entered the S phase, stabilization of the G1 kinase inhibitors p21WAF and p27KIP was observed and the cells were arrested in the G1 phase. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in regulation of transitions between all phases of the HLEC cycle. However, in contrast with previously described roles for Ubc3 in governing G1/S transitions, expression of Ubc3 delays the HLEC cycle in metaphase. The data suggest novel roles for Ubc3 that do not involve the transfer of ubiquitin in the M phase in the HLEC cell cycle. 	Invest._Ophthalmol._Vis._Sci.	D016428 D052061 D013485 D013486

21994697	20111014	Cyclophilin inhibitors as a novel HCV therapy.	A critical role of Cyclophilins, mostly Cyclophilin A (CyPA), in the replication of HCV is supported by a growing body of in vitro and in vivo evidence. CyPA probably interacts directly with nonstructural protein 5A to exert its effect, through its peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity, on maintaining the proper structure and function of the HCV replicase. The major proline substrates are located in domain II of NS5A, centered around a &quot;DY&quot; dipeptide motif that regulates CyPA dependence and CsA resistance. Importantly, Cyclosporine A derivatives that lack immunosuppressive function efficiently block the CyPA-NS5A interaction and inhibit HCV in cell culture, an animal model, and human trials. Given the high genetic barrier to development of resistance and the distinctness of their mechanism from that of either the current standard of care or any specifically targeted antiviral therapy for HCV (STAT-C), CyP inhibitors hold promise as a novel class of anti-HCV therapy.

17887955	20070925	Prototype chicken galectins revisited: characterization of a third protein with distinctive hydrodynamic behaviour and expression pattern in organs of adult animals.	Prototype galectins are versatile modulators of cell adhesion and growth via their reactivity to certain carbohydrate and protein ligands. These functions and the galectins' marked developmental regulation explain their attractiveness as models to dissect divergent evolution after gene duplication. Only two members have so far been assumed to constitute this group in chicken, namely the embryonic muscle/liver form {C-16 or CLL-I [16 kDa; chicken lactose lectin, later named CG-16 (chicken galectin-16)]} and the embryonic skin/intestine form (CLL-II or C-14; later named CG-14). In the present study, we report on the cloning and expression of a third prototype CG. It has deceptively similar electrophoretic mobility compared with recombinant C-14, the protein first isolated from embryonic skin, and turned out to be identical with the intestinal protein. Hydrodynamic properties unusual for a homodimeric galectin and characteristic traits in the proximal promoter region set it apart from the two already known CGs. Their structural vicinity to galectin-1 prompts their classification as CG-1A (CG-16)/CG-1B (CG-14), whereas sequence similarity to mammalian galectin-2 gives reason to refer to the intestinal protein as CG-2. The expression profiling by immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies discerned non-overlapping expression patterns for the three CGs in several organs of adult animals. Overall, the results reveal a network of three prototype galectins in chicken. 	Biochem._J.	D016428 D013485
22412900	20120314	Genetic biomarkers for ALS disease in transgenic SOD1(G93A) mice.	The pathophysiological mechanisms of both familial and sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) are unknown, although growing evidence suggests that skeletal muscle tissue is a primary target of ALS toxicity. Skeletal muscle biopsies were performed on transgenic SOD1(G93A) mice, a mouse model of ALS, to determine genetic biomarkers of disease longevity. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and three biopsy samples were obtained per animal at the three main stages of the disease. Transcriptional expression levels of seventeen genes, Ankrd1, Calm1, Col19a1, Fbxo32, Gsr, Impa1, Mef2c, Mt2, Myf5, Myod1, Myog, Nnt, Nogo A, Pax7, Rrad, Sln and Snx10, were tested in each muscle biopsy sample. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol, and variations in gene expression were assayed by real-time PCR for all of the samples. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the linear correlation between transcriptional expression levels throughout disease progression and longevity. Consistent with the results obtained from total skeletal muscle of transgenic SOD1(G93A) mice and 74-day-old denervated mice, five genes (Mef2c, Gsr, Col19a1, Calm1 and Snx10) could be considered potential genetic biomarkers of longevity in transgenic SOD1(G93A) mice. These results are important because they may lead to the exploration of previously unexamined tissues in the search for new disease biomarkers and even to the application of these findings in human studies.

20693977	20100810	Regulation of DNA-damage responses and cell-cycle progression by the chromatin remodelling factor CHD4.	The chromatin remodelling factor chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) is a catalytic subunit of the NuRD transcriptional repressor complex. Here, we reveal novel functions for CHD4 in the DNA-damage response (DDR) and cell-cycle control. We show that CHD4 mediates rapid poly(ADP-ribose)-dependent recruitment of the NuRD complex to DNA-damage sites, and we identify CHD4 as a phosphorylation target for the apical DDR kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated. Functionally, we show that CHD4 promotes repair of DNA double-strand breaks and cell survival after DNA damage. In addition, we show that CHD4 acts as an important regulator of the G1/S cell-cycle transition by controlling p53 deacetylation. These results provide new insights into how the chromatin remodelling complex NuRD contributes to maintaining genome stability. 	EMBO_J.	D016428 D013485
7191991	19800901	Molecular specificity of tubular reabsorption of L-proline. A microperfusion study in rat kidney.	In microperfusion experiments the reabsorption of 3H and 14C labelled L-proline by two recently defined transport systems (one with high capacity and low affinity, the other one having the opposite characteristics) was measured in vivo et situ on addition of several amino acids and some N-methylated derivatives. The high capacity system is apparently an unspecific system for neutral amino acids. The methylation of the amino group does not change the affinity to the system. The affinity decreases in the order phenylalanine &gt; glutamine &gt; alanine &gt; proline, hydroxyproline &gt; glycine. The low capacity system seems to be a specific reabsorption mechanism for imino acids like proline, hydroxyproline, sarcosine an N-methylalanine. Common neutral amino acids are not accepted. The different characteristics of both transport systems are also demonstrated by the finding that the affinity of phenylalanine for the high capacity system is about 5 times higher but its affinity for the low capacity system is about 50 times lower than the affinity for proline.

26029710	20150602	Copy number variation in the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCC6 gene and ABCC6 pseudogenes in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum.	Single mutations in the ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCC6) gene (OMIM 603234) are known to cause the rare autosomal recessive disease pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). Recently, we have found that copy number variations (CNVs) in pseudogenes of the ABCC6 gene are quite common. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and possible contribution of CNV in ABCC6 and its pseudogenes in PXE. Genomic DNA from 212 PXE individuals were examined for copy number by pyrosequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and compared with healthy individuals. The frequency of PXE individuals with any CNV was higher than in healthy individuals. The majority of variation comprised known and possibly new deletions in the ABCC6 gene and duplications of the ABCC6P1 and ABCC6P2 genes. ABCC6 deletions and ABCC6P2 duplications were not observed in 142 healthy individuals. In conclusion, by pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR, we were able to detect known and possibly new deletions in the ABCC6 gene that may have caused the PXE phenotype. Pyrosequencing may be used in PXE patients who have obtained incomplete genotype from conventional techniques. The frequency of ABCC6P2 pseudogene duplication was more common in PXE patients than healthy individuals and may affect the PXE phenotype. 	Mol_Genet_Genomic_Med	D016428

27706724	20161006	Clinical study of the correlation between complement factor H polymorphism and age-related macular degeneration.	This study aimed to investigate the correlation between age-related macular degeneration (AMD) of the liver-kidney yin-deficiency type and complement factor H (CFH) polymorphism, and to determine whether the C allele of the T1277C (Y402H) variant is a risk factor for this condition. We performed a case-control investigation of 60 patients with liver-kidney yin-deficiency AMD and 60 normal control subjects. Peripheral blood was collected from each participant for DNA extraction. Following amplification by polymerase chain reaction, the DNA samples were sequenced, and polymorphism of the CFH gene was examined. Data were analyzed with the chi-square test, with P &lt; 0.05 signifying statistical significance. The frequency of the C allele was significantly higher in the wet than in the dry AMD group (P = 0.044). In addition, the TC and CC genotypes were markedly more common in the former than in the control group (P = 0.013), and there was a significant difference in the distribution of the T and C alleles between wet AMD patients and control subjects (P &lt; 0.05). Based on this, we conclude that liver-kidney yin-deficiency AMD is associated with the C allele and TC and CC genotypes of the CFH Y402H polymorphism. Among patients with this condition, CFH genotypes were normally distributed. The principal CFH genotypes that induce liver-kidney yin-deficiency AMD are the mutant homozygote CC and heterozygote TC forms. Moreover, C allele carriers are at higher risk of developing this disease. 	Genet._Mol._Res.	D016428
22808208	20120719	Ipomoelin, a jacalin-related lectin with a compact tetrameric association and versatile carbohydrate binding properties regulated by its N terminus.	Many proteins are induced in the plant defense response to biotic stress or mechanical wounding. One group is lectins. Ipomoelin (IPO) is one of the wound-inducible proteins of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas cv. Tainung 57) and is a Jacalin-related lectin (JRL). In this study, we resolved the crystal structures of IPO in its apo form and in complex with carbohydrates such as methyl ?-D-mannopyranoside (Me-Man), methyl ?-D-glucopyranoside (Me-Glc), and methyl ?-D-galactopyranoside (Me-Gal) in different space groups. The packing diagrams indicated that IPO might represent a compact tetrameric association in the JRL family. The protomer of IPO showed a canonical ?-prism fold with 12 strands of ?-sheets but with 2 additional short ?-strands at the N terminus. A truncated IPO (?N10IPO) by removing the 2 short ?-strands of the N terminus was used to reveal its role in a tetrameric association. Gel filtration chromatography confirmed IPO as a tetrameric form in solution. Isothermal titration calorimetry determined the binding constants (K(A)) of IPO and ?N10IPO against various carbohydrates. IPO could bind to Me-Man, Me-Glc, and Me-Gal with similar binding constants. In contrast, ?N10IPO showed high binding ability to Me-Man and Me-Glc but could not bind to Me-Gal. Our structural and functional analysis of IPO revealed that its compact tetrameric association and carbohydrate binding polyspecificity could be regulated by the 2 additional N-terminal ?-strands. The versatile carbohydrate binding properties of IPO might play a role in plant defense. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
20605779	20100708	Binding of the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB to the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) regulates phosphorylation of NCAM and NCAM-dependent neurite outgrowth.	Recognition molecules and neurotrophins play important roles during development and maintenance of nervous system functions. In this study, we provide evidence that the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and the neurotrophin receptor TrkB directly interact via sequences in their intracellular domains. Stimulation of TrkB by brain-derived neurotrophic factor leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of NCAM at position 734. Mutation of this tyrosine to phenylalanine completely abolishes tyrosine phosphorylation of NCAM by TrkB. Moreover, the knockdown of TrkB in hippocampal neurons leads to a reduction of NCAM-induced neurite outgrowth. Transfection of NCAM-deficient hippocampal neurons with mutated NCAM carrying an exchange of tyrosine by phenylalanine at position 734 leads to promotion of NCAM-induced neurite outgrowth in comparison with that observed after transfection with wild-type NCAM, whereas a reduction of neurite outgrowth was observed after transfection with mutated NCAM, which carries an exchange of tyrosine by glutamate that mimics the phosphorylated tyrosine. Our observations indicate a functional relationship between TrkB and NCAM. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
27000416	20160323	Thioredoxin-1 Attenuates Ventricular and Mitochondrial Postischemic Dysfunction in the Stunned Myocardium of Transgenic Mice.	We evaluated the effect of thioredoxin1 (Trx1) system on postischemic ventricular and mitochondrial dysfunction using transgenic mice overexpressing cardiac Trx1 and a dominant negative (DN-Trx1) mutant (C32S/C35S) of Trx1. Langendorff-perfused hearts were subjected to 15?min of ischemia followed by 30?min of reperfusion (R). We measured left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP, mmHg), left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP, mmHg), and t63 (relaxation index, msec). Mitochondrial respiration, SERCA2a, phospholamban (PLB), and phospholamban phosphorylation (p-PLB) Thr17 expression (Western blot) were also evaluated. At 30?min of reperfusion, Trx1 improved contractile state (LVDP: Trx1: 57.4???4.9 vs. Wt: 27.1???6.3 and DN-Trx1: 29.2???7.1, p?&lt;?0.05); decreased myocardial stiffness (LVEDP: Wt: 24.5???4.8 vs. Trx1: 11.8???2.9, p?&lt;?0.05); and improved the isovolumic relaxation (t63: Wt: 63.3???3.2 vs. Trx1: 51.4???1.9, p?&lt;?0.05). DN-Trx1 mice aggravated the myocardial stiffness and isovolumic relaxation. Only the expression of p-PLB Thr17 increased at 1.5?min R in Wt and DN-Trx1 groups. At 30?min of reperfusion, state 3 mitochondrial O2 consumption was impaired by 13% in Wt and by 33% in DN-Trx1. ADP/O ratios for Wt and DN-Trx1 decrease by 25% and 28%, respectively; whereas the Trx1 does not change after ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). Interestingly, baseline values of complex I activity were increased in Trx1 mice; they were 24% and 47% higher than in Wt and DN-Trx1 mice, respectively (p?&lt;?0.01). These results strongly suggest that Trx1 ameliorates the myocardial effects of I/R by improving the free radical-mediated damage in cardiac and mitochondrial function, opening the possibility of new therapeutic strategies in coronary artery disease.

21157371	20101216	A pharmacogenetic analysis of determinants of hypertension and blood pressure response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in patients with vascular disease and healthy individuals.	To investigate whether genetic variation in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and kallikrein-bradykinin pathways is related to hypertension and blood pressure (BP) response to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy in stable coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. In 8907 stable CAD patients from the EUROPA trial, 52 haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 12 candidate genes within the RAAS and kallikrein-bradykinin pathways were investigated for association with hypertension (defined as BP ?160/95 mmHg or use of antihypertensives) and BP response to ACE inhibitors, during a 4-week run-in period. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index and creatinine clearance and corrected for multiple testing. Hypertension was present in 28.3% of the patients (n = 2526); median BP reduction after perindopril was 10/4 mmHg. Four polymorphisms, located in the ACE (rs4291), angiotensinogen (rs5049) and (pro)renin receptor (rs2968915; rs5981008) genes were significantly associated with hypertension in two vascular disease populations of CAD (EUROPA) and cerebrovascular disease (PROGRESS; n = 3571). A cumulative profile demonstrated a stepwise increase in the prevalence of hypertension, mounting to a 2-3-fold increase (P for trend &lt;0.001). Similar associations on hypertension were observed for angiotensinogen in a healthy population (n = 2197). In addition, genetic polymorphisms were identified that significantly modified the BP reduction by ACE inhibitor therapy; however, the observed BP differences were small and did not remain significant after permutation analysis. This large genetic association study identified genetic determinants of hypertension in three cohorts of patients with vascular disease and healthy individuals. 	J._Hypertens.	D016428 D013485

The tachykinin receptor 1 (TACR1) gene is a promising candidate gene in the search for the genetic basis of alcohol dependence (AD); TACR1 antagonists improve symptomology not only in preclinical models of AD but also in a clinical sample of detoxified alcoholics (George et al., Science 319:1536, 2008). The purpose of the current study was to determine whether TACR1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with (i) blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation in response to gustatory alcohol cues in a sample of heavy drinkers and (ii) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) AD symptom count in a large, publicly available data set-the Study of Addictions: Genetics and Environment Genome Wide Association study (SAGE GWAS) (Bierut et al., 2010). First, we examined relationships between TACR1 genotypes and neural responses during a craving task in 326 individuals with alcohol use disorders. Next, correlational analyses between 69 TACR1 SNPs and DSM-IV-TR AD symptoms were performed on the SAGE data set. rs3771863, rs3755459, and rs1106855 predicted BOLD activation in response to alcohol cues in those same reward and reinforcement brain areas, especially in the medial prefrontal cortex, striatum, and insula. rs3771863 also predicted AD symptom count in the SAGE data set and BOLD activation in the mesocorticolimbic pathway response to alcohol cues. Each of the 5 SNPs in the TACR1 gene that was significantly related to AD severity in the SAGE data set and/or the BOLD response to the craving task is near the 3' or 5' areas of the gene and may therefore be near mutations with potential functional significance. In particular, the potential functional significance of rs1106855 should be explored because of its location within a stop codon. 	Alcohol._Clin._Exp._Res.	D016428 D016449 D052061
16815691	20060704	Associations between COMTVal158Met polymorphism and cognition: direct or indirect effects?	Previous work suggests that reaction time variability (RTV) in attentional tasks, as a measure of cognitive stability, is associated with degree of Val loading in COMT Val(158)Met genotype, and that this association may be relevant for the aetiology of schizophrenia. This study examined (i) to what degree RTV pertaining to tasks of varying cognitive complexity would be associated with increased risk for schizophrenia and (ii) to what degree this would be mediated by Val loading. COMT genotyping was investigated in a sample of 23 patients with schizophrenia, 33 first-degree relatives, and 21 controls. All participants performed the Flanker continuous performance test. Schizophrenia liability was associated with number of correct trials of the Flanker test, but not with RTV, and this association was not mediated by COMT Val(158)Met genotype. Similarly, Met loading was associated with number of correct trials and with RTV, but this was not mediated by schizophrenia liability. Associations between COMT Val(158)Met genotype and RTV do not appear to reflect transmission of schizophrenia liability in families. Differential associations with Val and Met alleles across studies suggest indirect effects through gene-gene interactions or the influence of a functional polymorphism near COMT Val(158)Met.

14992574	20040303	Fluorinated aminoglycosides and their mechanistic implication for aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferases from Gram-negative bacteria.	Aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferases [APH(3')s] are important bacterial resistance enzymes for aminoglycoside antibiotics. These enzymes phosphorylate the 3'-hydroxyl of these antibiotics, a reaction that inactivates the drug. A series of experiments were carried out to shed light on the details of the turnover chemistry by these enzymes. Quench-flow pre-steady-state kinetic analyses of the reactions of Gram-negative APH(3') types Ia and IIa with kanamycin A, neamine, and their respective difluorinated analogues 4'-deoxy-4',4'-difluorokanamycin A and 4'-deoxy-4',4'-difluoroneamine were carried out, in conjunction with measurements of thio effect and viscosity studies. The fluorinated analogues were shown to be severely impaired as substrates for these enzymes. The magnitude of the effect of the impairment of the fluorinated substrates was in the same range as when the D198A mutant APH(3')-Ia was studied with nonfluorinated substrates. Residue 198 is the proposed active site base that promotes the aminoglycoside hydroxyl for phosphorylation. These findings collectively argue that the Gram-negative APH(3')s show significant nucleophilic participation in the transition state for the phosphate transfer reaction.

20463075	20100514	Splicing diversity of the human OCLN gene and its biological significance for hepatitis C virus entry.	Persistent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a primary etiological factor for the development of chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and cancer. A recent study identified occludin (OCLN), an integral tight junction protein, as one of the key factors for HCV entry into cells. We explored the splicing diversity of OCLN in normal human liver and observed variable expression of alternative splice variants, including two known forms (WT-OCLN and OCLN-ex4del) and six novel forms (OCLN-ex7ext, OCLN-ex3pdel, OCLN-ex3del, OCLN-ex3-4del, OCLN-ex3p-9pdel, and OCLN-ex3p-7pdel). Recombinant protein isoforms WT-OCLN and OCLN-ex7ext, which retained the HCV-interacting MARVEL domain, were expressed on the cell membrane and were permissive for HCV infection in in vitro infectivity assays. All other forms lacked the MARVEL domain, were expressed in the cytoplasm, and were nonpermissive for HCV infection. Additionally, we observed variable expression of OCLN splicing forms across human tissues and cell lines. Our study suggests that the remarkable natural splicing diversity of OCLN might contribute to HCV tissue tropism and possibly modify the outcome of HCV infection in humans. Genetic factors crucial for regulation of OCLN expression and susceptibility to HCV infection remain to be elucidated. 	J._Virol.	D016428 D052061 D013485
19197353	20090207	Genetic mechanisms in Apc-mediated mammary tumorigenesis.	Many components of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway also play critical roles in mammary tumor development, yet the role of the tumor suppressor gene APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) in breast oncongenesis is unclear. To better understand the role of Apc in mammary tumorigenesis, we introduced conditional Apc mutations specifically into two different mammary epithelial populations using K14-cre and WAP-cre transgenic mice that express Cre-recombinase in mammary progenitor cells and lactating luminal cells, respectively. Only the K14-cre-mediated Apc heterozygosity developed mammary adenocarcinomas demonstrating histological heterogeneity, suggesting the multilineage progenitor cell origin of these tumors. These tumors harbored truncation mutation in a defined region in the remaining wild-type allele of Apc that would retain some down-regulating activity of beta-catenin signaling. Activating mutations at codons 12 and 61 of either H-Ras or K-Ras were also found in a subset of these tumors. Expression profiles of acinar-type mammary tumors from K14-cre; Apc(CKO/+) mice showed luminal epithelial gene expression pattern, and clustering analysis demonstrated more correlation to MMTV-neu model than to MMTV-Wnt1. In contrast, neither WAP-cre-induced Apc heterozygous nor homozygous mutations resulted in predisposition to mammary tumorigenesis, although WAP-cre-mediated Apc deficiency resulted in severe squamous metaplasia of mammary glands. Collectively, our results suggest that not only the epithelial origin but also a certain Apc mutations are selected to achieve a specific level of beta-catenin signaling optimal for mammary tumor development and explain partially the colon- but not mammary-specific tumor development in patients that carry germline mutations in APC.

25371270	20141106	Molecular mechanisms of survival strategies in extreme conditions.	Today, one of the major challenges in biophysics is to disclose the molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes. In such a frame, the understanding of the survival strategies in extreme conditions received a lot of attention both from the scientific and applicative points of view. Since nature provides precious suggestions to be applied for improving the quality of life, extremophiles are considered as useful model-systems. The main goal of this review is to present an overview of some systems, with a particular emphasis on trehalose playing a key role in several extremophile organisms. The attention is focused on the relation among the structural and dynamic properties of biomolecules and bioprotective mechanisms, as investigated by complementary spectroscopic techniques at low- and high-temperature values.

17046271	20061019	Binding interaction of quercetin-3-beta-galactoside and its synthetic derivatives with SARS-CoV 3CL(pro): structure-activity relationship studies reveal salient pharmacophore features.	The 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is one of the most promising targets for discovery of drugs against SARS, because of its critical role in the viral life cycle. In this study, a natural compound called quercetin-3-beta-galactoside was identified as an inhibitor of the protease by molecular docking, SPR/FRET-based bioassays, and mutagenesis studies. Both molecular modeling and Q189A mutation revealed that Gln189 plays a key role in the binding. Furthermore, experimental evidence showed that the secondary structure and enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) were not affected by the Q189A mutation. With the help of molecular modeling, eight new derivatives of the natural product were designed and synthesized. Bioassay results reveal salient features of the structure-activity relationship of the new compounds: (1) removal of the 7-hydroxy group of the quercetin moiety decreases the bioactivity of the derivatives; (2) acetoxylation of the sugar moiety abolishes inhibitor action; (3) introduction of a large sugar substituent on 7-hydroxy of quercetin can be tolerated; (4) replacement of the galactose moiety with other sugars does not affect inhibitor potency. This study not only reveals a new class of compounds as potential drug leads against the SARS virus, but also provides a solid understanding of the mechanism of inhibition against the target enzyme.

24548536	20140220	The risk of recurrence in women with venous thromboembolism while using estrogens: a prospective cohort study.	The optimal duration of anticoagulation for women who had venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with estrogen use is unknown. To test the hypothesis that women who had a first VTE while using estrogens have a low risk of recurrence. A Prospective cohort study of 630 women (333 estrogen users, 297 non-users) with a first VTE, who were followed for an average of 69 months after anticoagulation withdrawal. Women with a previous or secondary VTE, coagulation inhibitor deficiency, lupus anticoagulant, cancer, pregnancy, requirement of long-term antithrombotic therapy or homozygosity or double heterozygosity for factor V Leiden and/or the G20210A prothrombin mutation were excluded. The endpoint was objectively documented symptomatic recurrent VTE. VTE recurred in 22 (7%) estrogen users and in 49 (17%) non-users. After 1, 2 and 5 years, the cumulative probability of recurrence was 1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0-2), 1% (95% CI, 0-2) and 6% (95% CI, 3-9) among estrogen users and 5% (95% CI, 2-7), 9% (95% CI, 6-13) and 17% (95% CI, 12-22) among non-users. Compared with non-users, estrogen users had an adjusted relative risk (RR) of recurrent VTE of 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.8). Compared with non-users in the respective age groups, the RR of recurrence was 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.8) among estrogen-containing-contraceptive users and 0.7 (95% CI, 0.3-1.5) among women using estrogen-containing menopausal hormone therapy. Women who had their first VTE while using estrogens have a low risk of recurrent VTE. These women might not benefit from extended anticoagulant therapy. 	J._Thromb._Haemost.	D016428 D013485
26813086	20160128	Variability of tropism and replicative capacity of two naturally occurring influenza A H9N2 viruses in cell cultures from different tissues.	Studies carried out on cell permissivity are of great interest to understand virus replication and pathogenicity. We described the results of a comparative analysis of replication efficiency of two naturally occurring influenza A H9N2 variants isolated from poultry and wild birds, differing by only two substitutions Q226L and T384N, in the receptor-binding site of haemagglutinin and the 380 loop region of NA proteins, respectively. Considering the overall growth of both viruses, lung cultures ensured the most efficient growth of TUN12L226N384 strain with titres up to 10(9) TCID50/ml whereas small intestine culture was highly susceptible to the TUN51Q226T384 virus reaching a titre of 10(6) TCID50/ml. The lowest replication was shown in liver cells. The addition of trypsin was essential for the replication of either virus in primary fibroblasts, but it had a marginal positive effect on virus replication in the four other culture types with maximum titres of 10(8) TCID50/ml. This means that in chicken, the proteolytic activation of the H9N2 viruses with the cleavage motif RSSR may be mediated by other endoproteases than trypsin. Further investigations should concentrate on the production of the appropriate set of viruses by a reverse genetics approach and the examination of cellular protease expression in chicken tissues. This would lead to a more complete understanding of the tropism of low-pathogenic Influenza A viruses. 	Avian_Pathol.	D016428 D013485
23637810	20130503	Vertical transmission of respiratory syncytial virus modulates pre- and postnatal innervation and reactivity of rat airways.	Environmental exposure to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of respiratory infections in infants, but it remains unknown whether this infection is transmitted transplacentally from the lungs of infected mothers to the offspring. We sought to test the hypothesis that RSV travels from the respiratory tract during pregnancy, crosses the placenta to the fetus, persists in the lung tissues of the offspring, and modulates pre- and postnatal expression of growth factors, thereby predisposing to airway hyperreactivity. Pregnant rats were inoculated intratracheally at midterm using recombinant RSV expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP). Viral RNA was amplified by RT-PCR and confirmed by sequencing. RFP expression was analyzed by flow cytometry and viral culture. Developmental and pathophysiologic implications of prenatal infection were determined by analyzing the expression of genes encoding critical growth factors, particularly neurotrophic factors and receptors. We also measured the expression of key neurotransmitters and postnatal bronchial reactivity in vertically infected lungs, and assessed their dependence on neurotrophic signaling using selective biological or chemical inhibition. RSV genome was found in 30% of fetuses, as well as in the lungs of 40% of newborns and 25% of adults. RFP expression was also shown by flow cytometry and replicating virus was cultured from exposed fetuses. Nerve growth factor and its TrkA receptor were upregulated in RSV- infected fetal lungs and co-localized with increased cholinergic innervation. Acetylcholine expression and smooth muscle response to cholinergic stimulation increased in lungs exposed to RSV in utero and reinfected after birth, and blocking TrkA signaling inhibited both effects. Our data show transplacental transmission of RSV from mother to offspring and persistence of vertically transmitted virus in lungs after birth. Exposure to RSV in utero is followed by dysregulation of neurotrophic pathways predisposing to postnatal airway hyperreactivity upon reinfection with the virus. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061 D013485
25222487	20140916	Exposure to a northern contaminant mixture (NCM) alters hepatic energy and lipid metabolism exacerbating hepatic steatosis in obese JCR rats.	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), defined by the American Liver Society as the buildup of extra fat in liver cells that is not caused by alcohol, is the most common liver disease in North America. Obesity and type 2 diabetes are viewed as the major causes of NAFLD. Environmental contaminants have also been implicated in the development of NAFLD. Northern populations are exposed to a myriad of persistent organic pollutants including polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, flame retardants, and toxic metals, while also affected by higher rates of obesity and alcohol abuse compared to the rest of Canada. In this study, we examined the impact of a mixture of 22 contaminants detected in Inuit blood on the development and progression of NAFLD in obese JCR rats with or without co-exposure to 10% ethanol. Hepatosteatosis was found in obese rat liver, which was worsened by exposure to 10% ethanol. NCM treatment increased the number of macrovesicular lipid droplets, total lipid contents, portion of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids in the liver. This was complemented by an increase in hepatic total cholesterol and cholesterol ester levels which was associated with changes in the expression of genes and proteins involved in lipid metabolism and transport. In addition, NCM treatment increased cytochrome P450 2E1 protein expression and decreased ubiquinone pool, and mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit ATP5A and Complex IV activity. Despite the changes in mitochondrial physiology, hepatic ATP levels were maintained high in NCM-treated versus control rats. This was due to a decrease in ATP utilization and an increase in creatine kinase activity. Collectively, our results suggest that NCM treatment decreases hepatic cholesterol export, possibly also increases cholesterol uptake from circulation, and promotes lipid accumulation and alters ATP homeostasis which exacerbates the existing hepatic steatosis in genetically obese JCR rats with or without co-exposure to ethanol.

1546447	19920411	V3 loop region of the HIV-1 gp120 envelope protein is essential for virus infectivity.	The mechanism by which HIV-1 mediates cell fusion and penetrates target cells, subsequent to receptor (CD4) binding, is not well understood. However, neutralizing antibodies, which recognize the principal neutralizing determinants of the gp120 envelope protein (the V3 loop region, residues 296 to 331), have been shown to effectively block cell fusion and virus infectivity independent of the initial gp120-CD4 binding. To investigate the role of the V3 loop in an HIV infection, a series of site-specific mutations were introduced into the HIV-1 envelope gene. Specifically, each residue (312 to 315) in the strongly conserved tetrapeptide sequence, GPGR, which is positioned in the center of the V3 loop domain was individually altered. The processing, transport, and CD4 binding properties of the mutant envelope proteins were comparable to those of the wild-type protein, however, none of the mutants were able to form syncytia in the HeLa-T4 assay. Molecular HIV-1 clones containing mutations altering the G312, G314, or R315 residues produced noninfectious virions, whereas a clone with a P313A mutation was found to be infectious. These results demonstrate that certain V3 loop mutations can be lethal and clearly indicate that this region of the HIV-1 gp120 protein is essential for virus infectivity. 	Virology	D016428
26467894	20151016	Serotonin transporter gene polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) L allele interacts with stress to increase anxiety symptoms in Chinese adolescents: a multiwave longitudinal study.	Previous studies of the interaction between a functional polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene-linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR) and stress in anxiety-related phenotypes have produced inconsistent results. The aim of the current study was to examine the effect of the 5-HTTLPR???stress interaction on anxiety symptoms in Chinese adolescents. A total of 651 healthy adolescents [323 females and 328 males; age 14-17 (mean = 16.27, standard deviation = 0.77)] participated in this study. At the initial assessment, participants completed self-report measures assessing anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms and stressful life events. Additionally, anxiety symptoms and stressful life events were assessed once every 3 months for the subsequent 9 months. A hierarchical linear model (HLM) was used to investigate the 5-HTTLPR???stress interaction. The HLM indicated no main effect of 5-HTTLPR on anxiety symptoms. Significant 5-HTTLPR???stress interaction effect in predicting anxiety symptoms was found. Specifically, individuals with the 5-HTTLPR L allele exhibited more anxiety symptoms related to stressful life events. The association between stress and anxiety symptoms is moderated by 5-HTTLPR. The 5-HTTLPR L allele increases individuals' vulnerability to anxiety under stress situations. 	BMC_Psychiatry	D016428 D013485
16361706	20051220	Up-regulation of AMP-activated kinase by dysfunctional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells mitigates excessive inflammation.	AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) is a ubiquitous metabolic sensor that inhibits the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). To determine whether CFTR reciprocally regulates AMPK function in airway epithelia and whether such regulation is involved in lung inflammation, AMPK localization, expression, and activity and cellular metabolic profiles were compared as a function of CFTR status in CF and non-CF primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. As compared with non-CF HBE cells, CF cells had greater and more diffuse AMPK staining and had greater AMPK activity than their morphologically matched non-CF counterparts. The cellular [AMP]/[ATP] ratio was higher in undifferentiated than in differentiated non-CF cells, which correlated with AMPK activity under these conditions. However, this nucleotide ratio did not predict AMPK activity in differentiating CF cells. Inhibiting channel activity in non-CF cells did not affect AMPK activity or metabolic status, but expressing functional CFTR in CF cells reduced AMPK activity without affecting cellular [AMP]/[ATP]. Therefore, lack of functional CFTR expression and not loss of channel activity in CF cells appears to up-regulate AMPK activity in CF HBE cells, presumably through non-metabolic effects on upstream regulatory pathways. Compared with wild-type CFTR-expressing immortalized CF bronchial epithelial (CFBE) cells, DeltaF508-CFTR-expressing CFBE cells had greater AMPK activity and greater secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and the interleukins IL-6 and IL-8. Further pharmacologic AMPK activation inhibited inflammatory mediator secretion in both wild type- and DeltaF508-expressing cells, suggesting that AMPK activation in CF airway cells is an adaptive response that reduces inflammation. We propose that therapies to activate AMPK in the CF airway may be beneficial in reducing excessive airway inflammation, a major cause of CF morbidity. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D052061 D013485
22412966	20120314	You are what you eat: within-subject increases in fruit and vegetable consumption confer beneficial skin-color changes.	Fruit and vegetable consumption and ingestion of carotenoids have been found to be associated with human skin-color (yellowness) in a recent cross-sectional study. This carotenoid-based coloration contributes beneficially to the appearance of health in humans and is held to be a sexually selected cue of condition in other species. Here we investigate the effects of fruit and vegetable consumption on skin-color longitudinally to determine the magnitude and duration of diet change required to change skin-color perceptibly. Diet and skin-color were recorded at baseline and after three and six weeks, in a group of 35 individuals who were without makeup, self-tanning agents and/or recent intensive UV exposure. Six-week changes in fruit and vegetable consumption were significantly correlated with changes in skin redness and yellowness over this period, and diet-linked skin reflectance changes were significantly associated with the spectral absorption of carotenoids and not melanin. We also used psychophysical methods to investigate the minimum color change required to confer perceptibly healthier and more attractive skin-coloration. Modest dietary changes are required to enhance apparent health (2.91 portions per day) and attractiveness (3.30 portions). Increased fruit and vegetable consumption confers measurable and perceptibly beneficial effects on Caucasian skin appearance within six weeks. This effect could potentially be used as a motivational tool in dietary intervention. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
20360992	20100403	TGFBI gene mutation analysis in a Chinese pedigree of Reis-B?cklers corneal dystrophy.	To analyze transforming growth factor beta-induced (TGFBI) gene mutations in a Chinese pedigree with Reis-B?cklers dystrophy (RBCD). In a four-generation Chinese family with Reis-B?cklers dystrophy, six members were patients and the rest were unaffected. All members of the family underwent complete ophthalmologic examinations. Exons of TGFBI were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, sequenced, and compared with a reference database. The sequencing results were reconfirmed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). A single heterozygous C&gt;T (R124C) point mutation was found in exon 4 of TGFBI in all six members of the pedigree affected with RBCD, but not in the unaffected members. Within this pedigree, RBCD segregates with the R124C variance, which is a known mutation for lattice corneal dystrophy type I. Therefore, along with G623D and R124L, the R124C mutation in TGFBI is also found to be responsible for RBCD. 	Mol._Vis.	D016428
21628991	20110602	Genome-wide scan of granular corneal dystrophy, type II: confirmation of chromosome 5q31 and identification of new co-segregated loci on chromosome 3q26.3.	Granular corneal dystrophy, type II (CGD2; Avellino corneal dystrophy) is the most common corneal dystrophy among Koreans, but its pathophysiology is still poorly understood. Many reports showed that even though the causative mutation is the same TGFBI R124H mutation, there are severe and mild phenotypes of the corneal dystrophy. We also observed the phenotype differences in our samples. For this reason, we focused our effort on the identification of unknown genetic factor related to phenotype variation. A total 551 individuals from 59 families were genotyped with SNP chip and used in genome-wide linkage analysis. From single-point linkage analyses, we confirmed the known 5q31 region for TGFBI gene, and selected novel nine candidate loci for CGD2. In simulation analysis, the only 3q26.3 region including neuroligin 1 gene (NLGN1) was supported by empirical statistic significance. To investigate the effect of genetic heterogeneity in linkage analysis, we classified CGD2 families into two subgroups. Although we could not find a significant evidence for correlation between the 3q26.3 region and CGD2 phenotypes, this first genome-wide analysis with CGD2 families in Korea has a very important value for offering insights in genetics of CGD2. In addition, the co-segregating loci with CGD2 including 3q26.3 would be a good target for further study to understand the pathophysiology of CGD2. 	Exp._Mol._Med.	D016428 D013485

The present study aimed at characterizing the oil extracted from Bertholletia excelsa H.B.K. almond, a native species from the Amazon region. Analytical methods used for oils and fats were employed through pharmacopoeia assays, AOCS (American Oil Chemists Society) standard methods as well as those recommended by ANVISA (National Health Surveillance Agency) such as acidity, peroxide value, saponification index, iodine value and refractive index, pH and relative density, and also thermoanalytical analyses (thermogravimetry, differential thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis) as well as chromatographic analysis (gas chromatography). The characterization assessments of B. excelsa oil showed results indicating that the oil contains polyunsaturated fatty acids in large proportion. The termoanalytical tests indicated that B.excelsa oil showed thermal stability up to 220 ?C, These results showed that the oil extracted from B. excelsa has acceptable characteristics and is of good quality.

24375193	20131231	Associations between polymorphisms of the XPC gene and lung cancer susceptibility: a meta-analysis.	Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C (XPC) gene plays a critical role in DNA damage recognition, and its functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may alter DNA repair capacity and cancer susceptibility. Numerous epidemiological studies have investigated the associations between XPC Lys939Gln and Ala499Val polymorphisms and lung cancer susceptibility, but the conclusions are inconclusive. We searched three electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and EBSCO) for eligible publications and performed a meta-analysis assessing the associations between XPC Lys939Gln and Ala499Val polymorphisms and lung cancer risk. We also analysed the genotype-mRNA expression correlation using the data of HapMap phase II release 23 with 270 individuals from 4 ethnicities for exploring biological plausibility of our findings. We included ten published studies of 3,882 cases and 5,219 controls for Lys939Gln, and five studies with 2,605 cases and 3,329 controls for Ala499Val. When all studies were pooled, we found a significantly increased overall lung cancer risk for Lys939Gln polymorphism (recessive model: OR = 1.14, 95 % CI = 1.01-1.29, P = 0.218 for heterogeneity). Stratification analysis also showed a higher lung cancer risk in Asian populations (recessive model: OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.04-1.52, P = 0.263 for heterogeneity). Interestingly, we found significant correlation between Lys939Gln genotypes and XPC mRNA expression for Asian populations as well. However, we did not observe any association between Ala499Val polymorphism and overall lung cancer risk, nor in further stratification analysis. This meta-analysis suggests that XPC Lys939Gln polymorphism may contribute to lung cancer risk, which needs further validation in single larger studies. 	Tumour_Biol.	D016428 D017418
21185752	20101228	Pharmacogenomics of warfarin dose requirements in Hispanics.	While Hispanics are the largest and most rapidly growing minority population in the United States, they are underrepresented in pharmacogenomic studies with warfarin. We sought to determine the combination of clinical and genetic influences of warfarin dose requirements in Hispanics. In addition, we tested the performance of published warfarin dosing algorithms derived from largely non-Hispanic cohorts in an inner-city U.S. Hispanic population. Genetic samples and clinical data were obtained from 50 Hispanics on a stable dose of warfarin. The contribution of cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) and vitamin K epoxide reductase complex-1 (VKORC1) genotypes and clinical factors to warfarin dose requirements was determined. The correlation between the predicted dose using published algorithms and therapeutic dose was also assessed. Compared to the VKORC1-1639 GG genotype, warfarin dose requirements were 30% and 62% lower with the GA and AA genotypes, respectively (p=0.001). The combination of the VKORC1-1639G&gt;A and CYP2C9 genotypes and clinical factors explained 56% of the inter-patient variability in warfarin dose. Warfarin dose predicted using algorithms derived from mostly non-Hispanic cohorts was significantly correlated with the therapeutic dose in our Hispanic cohort (r(2)=0.43 to 0.49; p&lt;0.001); the predicted dose was within 1.0 mg/day of the therapeutic dose for 40% to 50% of patients. Our data suggest that factors influencing warfarin dose requirements in Hispanic Caucasians are similar to those previously described in European Caucasians and that dosing algorithms derived from non-Hispanic Caucasian cohorts are applicable to Hispanics living in the U.S. 	Blood_Cells_Mol._Dis.

23167420	20121122	Association between XRCC1 gene polymorphisms and risk of glioma development: a meta-analysis.	Previous studies of the association between X-ray cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) gene polymorphisms and the gliomas risk have yielded conflicting results, and thus a meta-analysis was performed to provide a more accurate estimation. A computerized literature search of 5 electronic databases was conducted to identify the relevant studies. Fixed or random effect models were selected based on the heterogeneity test. Publication bias was estimated using Begg's funnel plots and Egger's regression test. A total of 11 studies (3,810 cases and 6,079 controls), 7 studies (2,928 cases and 5,048 controls), and 4 studies (1,461 cases and 2,593 controls) were finally included in the analyses of the association between XRCC1 Arg399Gln, Arg194Trp, and Arg280His polymorphisms and glioma risk, respectively. The pooled results showed that GlnGln carriage was associated with moderately increased risk of gliomas in Asians (GlnGln vs. ArgArg, OR=1.490, 95%CI 1.031-2.153; GlnGln/ArgGln vs. ArgArg, OR=1.321, 95%CI 1.037- 1.684), whereas a marginal association was revealed in Caucasians. For the Arg194Trp polymorphism, although a significant association was shown in the homozygous genotype comparisons (TrpTrp vs. ArgArg, OR = 2.209, 95%CI 1.398- 2.945), no significant link was found on subgroup analysis stratified by ethnicity. With regard to the Arg280His polymorphism, no significant association was found in each comparison. No particular study was found to significantly influence the pooled results, and no potential publication bias was detected. This meta-analysis suggested that the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism is moderately associated with increased risk of gliomas in Asians, while Arg194Trp and Arg280His polymorphisms demonstrated no significant influence. Due to the limited studies and the potential confounders, further studies are needed to confirm these results. 	Asian_Pac._J._Cancer_Prev.	D016428 D017418
25300205	20141011	Association between acquired resistance to PLX4032 (vemurafenib) and ATP-binding cassette transporter expression.	Various kinase inhibitors are known to be ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter substrates and resistance acquisition to kinase inhibitors has been associated to increased ABC transporter expression. Here, we investigated the role of the ABC transporters ABCB1, ABCC1, and ABCG2 during melanoma cell resistance acquisition to the V600-mutant BRAF inhibitors PLX4032 (vemurafenib) and PLX4720. PLX4032 had previously been shown to interfere with ABCB1 and ABCG2. PLX4720 had been demonstrated to interact with ABCB1 but to a lower extent than PLX4032. PLX4032 and PLX4720 affected ABCC1- and ABCG2-mediated drug transport in a similar fashion. In a panel of 16 V600E BRAF-mutated melanoma cell lines consisting of four parental cell lines and their sub-lines with acquired resistance to PLX4032, PLX4720, vincristine (cytotoxic ABCB1 and ABCC1 substrate), or mitoxantrone (cytotoxic ABCG2 substrate), we detected enhanced ABC transporter expression in 4/4 cytotoxic ABC transporter substrate-resistant, 3/4 PLX4720-resistant, and 1/4 PLX4032-resistant melanoma cell lines. PLX4032 has the potential to induce ABC transporter expression but this potential is lower than that of PLX4720 or cytotoxic ABC transporter substrates. Since ABC transporters confer multi-drug resistance, this is of relevance for the design of next-line therapies. 	BMC_Res_Notes	D003160 D016428 D013485
22614344	20120523	Lack of association of the G22A polymorphism of the ADA gene in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.	Genes located outside the HLA region (6p21) have been considered as candidates for susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis. We tested the hypothesis that the G22A polymorphism of the adenosine deaminase gene (ADA; 20q13.11) is associated with ankylosing spondylitis in 166 Brazilian subjects genotyped for the HLA*27 gene (47 patients and 119 controls matched for gender, age and geographic origin). The HLA-B*27 gene and the G22A ADA polymorphism were identified by PCR with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes and PCR-RFLP, respectively. There were no significant differences in frequencies of ADA genotypes [odds ratio (OR) = 1.200, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.3102-4.643, P &gt; 0.8] and ADA*01 and ADA*02 alleles (OR = 1.192, 95%CI = 0.3155-4.505, P &gt; 0.8) in patients versus controls. We conclude that the G22A polymorphism is not associated with ankylosing spondylitis. 	Genet._Mol._Res.	D016428 D013485
18723511	20080830	Avian sarcoma virus and human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 use different subsets of ESCRT proteins to facilitate the budding process.	Members of the Nedd4 family of E3 ubiquitin ligases bind the L domain in avian sarcoma virus (ASV) Gag and facilitate viral particle release. Translational fusion of ASV Gag with an L domain deletion (Deltap2b) to proteins that comprise ESCRT-I, -II, and -III (the endocytic sorting complexes required for transport) rescued both Gag ubiquitination and particle release from cells. The ESCRT-I factors Vps37C or Tsg101 were more effective in rescue of Gag/Deltap2b budding than the ESCRT-II factor Eap20 or the ESCRT-III component CHMP6. Thus ESCRT components can substitute for Nedd4 family members in ASV Gag release. Unlike wild type, ASV Gag/Deltap2b -ESCRT chimeras failed to co-immunoprecipitate with co-expressed hemagglutinin-tagged Nedd4, indicating that Nedd4 was not stably associated with these Gag fusions. Release of the Gag-ESCRT-I or -II fusions was inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of Vps4 ATPase similar to wild type ASV Gag. In contrast to ASV Gag, HIV-1 Gag containing an L domain inactivating mutation (P7L) was efficiently rescued by fusion to a component of ESCRT-III (Chmp6) but not ESCRT-II (Eap20). Depletion of the endogenous pool of Eap20 (ESCRT-II) had little effect on HIV-1 Gag release but blocked ASV Gag release. In contrast, depletion of the endogenous pool of Vps37C (ESCRT-I) had little effect on ASV but blocked HIV-1 Gag release. Furthermore, an N-terminal fragment of Chmp6 inhibited both HIV-1 and ASV Gag release in a dominant negative manner. Taken together, these results indicate that ASV and HIV-1 Gag utilize different combinations of ESCRT proteins to facilitate the budding process, although they share some common elements.

27507987	20160811	Genetic Diversity and Molecular Evolution of a Violaxanthin De-epoxidase Gene in Maize.	Violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE) has a critical role in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, which is involved in protecting the photosynthesis apparatus from damage caused by excessive light. Here, a VDE gene in maize, ZmVDE1, was cloned and shown to have functional domains in common with the gramineous VDE protein. Candidate gene association analysis indicated that no polymorphic sites in ZmVDE1 were significant association with any of the examined carotenoid-related traits at P = 0.05 in an association panel containing 155 maize inbred lines. Nucleotide diversity analysis of VDE1 in maize and teosinte indicated that its exon had less genetic variation, consistent with the conserved function of VDE1 in plants. In addition, dramatically reduced nucleotide diversity, fewer haplotypes and a significantly negative parameter deviation for Tajima's D test of ZmVDE1 in maize and teosinte suggested that a potential selective force had acted across the ZmVDE1 locus. We further identified a 4.2 Mb selective sweep with low recombination surrounding the ZmVDE1 locus that resulted in severely reduced nucleotide diversity on chromosome 2. Collectively, natural selection and the conserved domains of ZmVDE1 might show an important role in the xanthophyll cycle of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. 	Front_Genet	D016428
26869025	20160213	Differentiation of human gingival mesenchymal stem cells into neuronal lineages in 3D bioconjugated injectable protein hydrogel construct for the management of neuronal disorder.	The success of regeneration attempt is based on an ideal combination of stem cells, scaffolding and growth factors. Tissue constructs help to maintain stem cells in a required area for a desired time. There is a need for easily obtainable cells, potentially autologous stem cells and a biologically acceptable scaffold for use in humans in different difficult situations. This study aims to address these issues utilizing a unique combination of stem cells from gingiva and a hydrogel scaffold, based on a natural product for regenerative application. Human gingival mesenchymal stem cells (HGMSCs) were, with due induction, differentiated to neuronal lineages to overcome the problems associated with birth tissue-related stem cells. The differentiation potential of neuronal lineages was confirmed with suitable specific markers. The properties of mesenchymal stem cells in encapsulated form were observed to be similar to free cells. The encapsulated cells (3D) were then subjected to differentiation into neuronal lineages with suitable inducers, and the morphology and gene expression of transient cells were analyzed. HGMSCs was differentiated into neuronal lineages as both free and encapsulated forms without any significant differences. The presence of Nissl bodies and the neurite outgrowth confirm the differentiation. The advantages of this new combination appear to make it a promising tissue construct for translational application. 	Exp._Mol._Med.	D016428
11916615	20020328	Two novel variants in the thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) gene behind the diagnosis of TBG deficiency.	Search for germline mutations in the thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) gene of two unrelated Portuguese females of Caucasian origin in whom the diagnosis of TBG deficiency was suspected because of suppressed TSH despite marginally low total thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine. Screening for germline mutations was conducted by non-radioactive PCR-SSCP analysis. The variants documented by this approach were characterized by sequencing. Moreover, in order to define whether they were mutations or polymorphisms we looked for the same variants analysing 100 alleles at random. To achieve this goal we used, alternatively, restriction analysis and the minisequencing method with an automated capillary electrophoresis system and fluorescent-labelled dideoxynucleotides. Two novel variants, one in each patient, were identified. One, involved codon 23 (TCA--&gt;TAA) and the other, codon 223 (CAA--&gt;TAA). Analysis of 50 DNA samples, randomly chosen, revealed that all were homozygous for the wild variant at codon 23. One of them was heterozygous for the variant CAA--&gt;TAA at codon 223. This sample was found to correspond to a Caucasian female in whom serum TBG proved to be not detected. Since both variants identified result in stop codons likely to induce truncated TBG proteins, they are probably responsible for the TBG phenotype observed in the individuals studied.

25745426	20150307	Localization of causal locus in the genome of the brown macroalga Ectocarpus: NGS-based mapping and positional cloning approaches.	Mutagenesis is the only process by which unpredicted biological gene function can be identified. Despite that several macroalgal developmental mutants have been generated, their causal mutation was never identified, because experimental conditions were not gathered at that time. Today, progresses in macroalgal genomics and judicious choices of suitable genetic models make mutated gene identification possible. This article presents a comparative study of two methods aiming at identifying a genetic locus in the brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus: positional cloning and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based mapping. Once necessary preliminary experimental tools were gathered, we tested both analyses on an Ectocarpus morphogenetic mutant. We show how a narrower localization results from the combination of the two methods. Advantages and drawbacks of these two approaches as well as potential transfer to other macroalgae are discussed.

21457773	20110405	Characterization of human breast cancer cell lines for the studies on p53 in chemical carcinogenesis.	To know whether the molecular responses to chemical carcinogens reflect only cell line specific molecular responses, or whether they can be regarded as characteristic of breast tissue, we have characterized four human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, T47-D, ZR-75-1). The activation of benzo(a)pyrene (BP), a model compound of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, to its genotoxic BP-diolepoxide (BPDE) and p53 response and cell viability after BP exposure, and the p53 status in these cell lines were analyzed. Both TP53 (exons 5-8) mutations and total and phospho-p53 were analyzed. Three of the four cell lines clearly activated BP to BPDE-DNA adducts (MDA-MB-468, T47-D, ZR-75-1) and three had a mutation in the TP53 gene (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, T47-D). After BP-treatment the strongest p53 protein induction and phosphorylation at serine 392 was found in ZR-75-1 cells with a wt TP53 gene. Viability decreased dramatically only in ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-468 cells although the relative cell number was reduced in all the cell lines suggesting that BP affects cell proliferation. In conclusion, a TP53 mutation does not necessarily lead to a loss of p53 protein response. This study stresses the importance of characterization of all human cancer cell lines for the intended targets of study. 	Toxicol_In_Vitro	D016428 D013485
26376292	20150917	Prognostic value of BRAF and KRAS mutation status in stage II and III microsatellite instable colon cancers.	Microsatellite instability (MSI) has been associated with favourable survival in early stage colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC. The BRAF V600E mutation has been associated with worse survival in MSS CRC. This mutation occurs in 40% of MSI CRC and it is unclear whether it confers worse survival in this setting. The prognostic value of KRAS mutations in both MSS and MSI CRC remains unclear. We examined the effect of BRAF and KRAS mutations on survival in stage II and III MSI colon cancer patients. BRAF exon 15 and KRAS exon 2-3 mutation status was assessed in 143 stage II (n?=?85) and III (n?=?58) MSI colon cancers by high resolution melting analysis and sequencing. The relation between mutation status and cancer-specific (CSS) and overall survival (OS) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis. BRAF V600E mutations were observed in 51% (n?=?73) and KRAS mutations in 16% of cases (n?=?23). Patients with double wild-type cancers (dWT; i.e., BRAF and KRAS wild-type) had a highly favourable survival with 5-year CSS of 93% (95% CI 84-100%), while patients with cancers harbouring mutations in either BRAF or KRAS, had 5-year CSS of 76% (95% CI 67-85%). In the subgroup of stage II patients with dWT cancers no cancer-specific deaths were observed. On multivariate analysis, mutation in either BRAF or KRAS vs. dWT remained significantly prognostic. Mutations in BRAF as well as KRAS should be analyzed when considering these genes as prognostic markers in MSI colon cancers. 	Int._J._Cancer	D016428 D013485
15983311	20050629	Web-based care management in patients with poorly controlled diabetes.	To assess the effects of web-based care management on glucose and blood pressure control over 12 months in patients with poorly controlled diabetes. For this study, 104 patients with diabetes and HbA(1c) (A1C) &gt; or =9.0% who received their care at a Department of Veterans Affairs medical center were recruited. All participants completed a diabetes education class and were randomized to continue with their usual care (n = 52) or receive web-based care management (n = 52). The web-based group received a notebook computer, glucose and blood pressure monitoring devices, and access to a care management website. The website provided educational modules, accepted uploads from monitoring devices, and had an internal messaging system for patients to communicate with the care manager. Participants receiving web-based care management had lower A1C over 12 months (P &lt; 0.05) when compared with education and usual care. Persistent website users had greater improvement in A1C when compared with intermittent users (-1.9 vs. -1.2%; P = 0.051) or education and usual care (-1.4%; P &lt; 0.05). A larger number of website data uploads was associated with a larger decline in A1C (highest tertile -2.1%, lowest tertile -1.0%; P &lt; 0.02). Hypertensive participants in the web-based group had a greater reduction in systolic blood pressure (P &lt; 0.01). HDL cholesterol rose and triglycerides fell in the web-based group (P &lt; 0.05). Web-based care management may be a useful adjunct in the care of patients with poorly controlled diabetes. 	Diabetes_Care	D016430 D016428 D016449 D052061 D013486 D013487
16497624	20060225	Mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor: a new genetic risk factor for chronic pancreatitis?	In 2003 we identified a family with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) (heterozygous CASR gene mutation L173P) and a mutation in the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor gene (SPINK1) (N34S). While family members with an isolated calcium-sensing receptor gene (CASR) mutation remained healthy, a combination of the CASR and SPINK1 gene mutation caused chronic pancreatitis (CP). We thus speculate that the combination of two genetic defects affecting calcium homeostasis and pancreatic enzyme activation might represent a novel approach in chronic inherited pancreatic disease. We therefore sought to explore whether CASR gene mutations were prevalent in a cohort of patients with CP and confirmed SPINK1 mutations. A cohort of 19 families (n=170) with a history of idiopathic CP (ICP) was screened for mutations within the CASR gene; 104 members of that cohort had a mutation (N34S) within the SPINK1 gene and 66 of those were suffering from CP. The entire CASR gene was screened for single strand conformation polymorphism under varying polyacrylamide gel conditions and subjected to direct dideoxy nucleotide sequencing of amplified cDNA. Single-strand conformation polymorphisms were observed in 59 samples, clustering of exons 3, 4 and 7. DNA sequence analysis revealed a yet unreported missense mutation in exon 7 (R896H) and two conservative mutations in exon 4 (F391F) and exon 7 (E790E). Furthermore, an intronic polymorphism in nucleotide position 493-19 G&gt;A was detected in 19 out of 170 members of that cohort. We identified three novel calcium-sensing receptor gene mutations (1 missense mutation, 2 silent mutations and 1 intronic polymorphism) in a cohort of 19 families with ICP. In particular, the kindred with the R896H mutation presenting with a similar pedigree to the family described above may indicate a role for CASR gene mutations in SPINK1-related CP. Again, only the patient with the combination of both CASR and N34S SPINK1 gene mutation developed pancreatitis, whereas in the healthy parents and children only an isolated CASR or N34S SPINK1 gene mutation could be detected. We suggest that the CASR gene is a novel yet undetected co-factor in a multifactorial genetic setting of SPINK1-related pancreatitis that alters the susceptibility for pancreatitis in these patients.

18196539	20080116	TNF polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk.	Inflammation has been hypothesized to increase prostate cancer risk. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important mediator of the inflammatory process, but the relationship between TNF variants and prostate cancer remains unclear. We examined associations between six TNF single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1799964, rs1800630, rs1799724, rs1800629, rs361525, rs1800610) and prostate cancer risk among 2,321 cases and 2,560 controls from two nested case-control studies within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO, n = 2,561, 5 SNPs) and the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort (Nutrition Cohort, n = 2,320, 6 SNPs). Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated for individual SNPs and haplotypes in each cohort separately and in pooled analyses. No TNF SNP was associated with prostate cancer risk in PLCO (P-trend &gt; or = 0.16), while in the Nutrition Cohort, associations were significant for 2 highly correlated variants (rs1799724, 1800610, r2 = 0.95; P-trend = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively). In pooled analyses, no single SNP was associated with prostate cancer risk (P-trend &gt; or = 0.08). After adjustment for multiple testing, no SNP was associated with prostate cancer risk in either cohort individually or in the pooled analysis (P-trend all &gt; or = 0.10). Haplotypes based on 5 TNF SNPs did not vary by case/control status in PLCO, but showed marginal associations in the Nutrition Cohort (global P = 0.06) and the pooled analysis (global P = 0.05). Despite somewhat suggestive haplotype results, overall our study does not support an association between TNF variants and prostate cancer risk. 	Prostate	D016428 D052061 D052060
26057672	20150610	Structure of the bovine COPI ? subunit ? homology domain at 2.15 ? resolution.	The heptameric COPI coat (coatomer) plays an essential role in vesicular transport in the early secretory system of eukaryotic cells. While the structures of some of the subunits have been determined, that of the ?-COP subunit has not been reported to date. The ?-COP subunit is part of a subcomplex with structural similarity to tetrameric clathrin adaptors (APs), where ?-COP is the structural homologue of the AP ? subunit. Here, the crystal structure of the ? homology domain (MHD) of ?-COP (?-MHD) obtained by phasing using a combined SAD-MR method is presented at 2.15 ? resolution. The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains two monomers that exhibit short sections of disorder, which may allude to flexible regions of the protein. The ?-MHD is composed of two subdomains connected by unstructured linkers. Comparison between this structure and those of known MHD domains from the APs shows significant differences in the positions of specific loops and ?-sheets, as well as a more general change in the relative positions of the protein subdomains. The identified difference may be the major source of cargo-binding specificity. Finally, the crystal structure is used to analyze the potential effect of the I422T mutation in ?-COP previously reported to cause a neurodegenerative phenotype in mice.

10433494	19990805	The effect of site-directed mutagenesis of two transmembrane serine residues on agonist-specific coupling of a cloned human alpha2A-adrenoceptor to adenylyl cyclase.	1. The effects of substitution of the Ser200 and Ser204 residues with alanine on the signalling properties of the cloned human alpha2A-adrenoceptor, stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines, have been investigated using noradrenaline and the structural isomers of octopamine. 2. The Ser--&gt;Ala200 or the Ser--&gt;Ala204 mutant forms of the alpha2A-adrenoceptor, when expressed in cells in the absence of pertussis toxin pretreatment, are two orders of magnitude more sensitive to inhibition of cyclic AMP production by (+/-)-para-octopamine and (+/-)-meta-octopamine, respectively, than cells expressing the wild-type receptor. Binding studies indicate that the effects are not due to an increased agonist affinity for the mutant receptors and that they are likely to be due to agonist-mediated conformational changes in receptor structure. 3. After incubation with pertussis toxin, (+/-)-meta-octopamine (100 microM and above) produced a stimulation of cyclic AMP levels in cells expressing the Ser--&gt;Ala204 mutant form of the alpha2A-adrenoceptor but showed no stimulation in cells expressing the Ser--&gt;Ala200 mutant receptor. Under these conditions (+/-)-para-octopamine did not produce any increases in cyclic AMP production in cells expressing either of the mutant receptor forms or the wild-type receptor. 4. The results emphasise the importance of the Ser200 and Ser204 residues of the alpha2A-adrenoceptor in exerting an inhibitory influence on the ability of (+/-)-para-octopamine and (+/-)-meta-octopamine respectively, to induce a receptor-agonist conformation capable of inhibiting forskolin-stimulation of cyclic AMP levels. 5. It is clear that Ser204 also prevents meta-octopamine from generating a receptor-agonist conformation that can increase cyclic AMP levels, emphasising the importance of this residue in the agonist-specific coupling of this receptor to different second messenger systems.

10488699	19990917	Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and iron: increased prevalence of mutations of the HFE gene in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.	Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is increasingly recognized, and its pathogenesis is believed to involve increased oxidative stress. Elevated levels of serum ferritin and positive liver iron stains are often observed in patients with NASH, and the pathogenesis of liver injury due to iron is also thought to involve oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an association of NASH and mutations in the HFE gene associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC). Clinical, laboratory, and histopathological data on all 57 subjects with a final diagnosis of NASH seen between August 1990 and August 1997 at our Liver Center were analyzed. Thirty-six Caucasian subjects (23 men) with NASH underwent mutational analyses of HFE gene mutations performed. The prevalence of HFE gene mutations was compared to that in 348 Caucasian normal controls. Data were analyzed by both parameteric and non-parametric methods with similar results. One subject (2.8%) with NASH was homozygous for the C282Y mutation and six (16.7%) were heterozygous, compared with 0%, and 11.2%, respectively, of controls. Two (5.6%) subjects with NASH were homozygous for the H63D mutation and 16 (44.4%) were heterozygous, whereas 2.9% and 26.4%, respectively, of controls had these genotypes. The prevalence of heterozygosity (61.1%) for either mutation was significantly higher in subjects with NASH than in controls (38%) (p = 0.008), and the prevalence of homozygosity or heterozygosity combined in NASH subjects (69.4%) was significantly higher than for controls (40.5%, p = 0.001). Sex (63-67% male) and age at diagnosis of NASH did not differ between those with or without HFE mutations, but men with NASH were significantly more likely than women to have the H63D mutation (15/23 vs. 3/13, p&lt;0.05) Levels of serum ferritin, iron, transferrin saturation levels, and the degree of hepatic iron staining were significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) in subjects with NASH who carried an HFE mutation than in those without. Differences in hepatic iron concentrations or hepatic iron indices between NASH subjects with and without HFE mutations were not significant. Those with C282Y mutations had significantly more hepatic fibrosis than those without (p&lt;0.05). Those with HFE mutations had significantly higher levels of serum ALT (90+/-11 [mean +/- SE]) than those without (55+/-6; p = 0.02). The prevalences of the HFE gene mutations associated with hereditary hemochromatosis are increased among North American subjects with NASH. 	J._Hepatol.	D003160 D016428 D013487
16172598	20050921	[PTPN11 gene mutation in LEOPARD syndrome].	The multiple lentigines/LEOPARD syndrome (ML/LS) is a rare and complex genetic syndrome. It is an autosomal dominant disorder with a variable expressivity. The syndrome is mainly characterised by growth retardation, multiple lentigines, and congenital heart diseases with electrocardiographic anomalies, dysmorphia of the face and deafness. The incidence of this pathology is still unknown and a familial inheritance is present in 70% of cases. Some of the ML/LS clinical features are the same as those of the Noonan syndrome (NS), such as congenital cardiac abnormalities, dysmorphia and growth retardation. NS and ML/LS are caused by allele mutations of the PTPN11 gene. We report the case of a 3-year-old girl, who was observed for the presence of widespread lentigines, a 1/6-protosystolic murmur at the mesocardium and growth retardation. The diagnosis of ML/LS was made and thus a molecular analysis of the PTPN11 gene was carried out, directly sequencing the codifying region. The molecular analysis revealed a missense mutation (A836G) in hexone 7 (TYR279CYS) of the PTPNII gene. This mutation is has been observed, at present, in a few cases of ML/LS and Noonan syndrome.

17028399	20061010	[Hutchinson-Gilford progeria in the light of contemporary genetics].	Hutchinson-Gilford progeria causing premature aging of children is a genetic disease and according to most authors has an autosomal dominant inheritance. It has been regarded as a model of the process of aging. In 2003 mutations in the LMNA gene, localized f in chromosome 1, responsible for the disease, were identified. The most frequent mutation is located in exon 11, C1824T and does not change glycin in position 608 of protein chain, but activates cryptic splice site. This results in shortened lamin A synthesis which is named progerin. Point mutations in other exons of LMNA, found in progeria patients, are responsible for atypical phenotypes.

20671028	20100731	Deconstructing nucleotide binding activity of the Mdm2 RING domain.	Mdm2, a central negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor, possesses a Really Interesting New Gene (RING) domain within its C-terminus. In addition to E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, the Mdm2 RING preferentially binds adenine base nucleotides, and such binding leads to a conformational change in the Mdm2?C-terminus. Here, we present further biochemical analysis of the nucleotide-Mdm2 interaction. We have found that MdmX, an Mdm2 family member with high sequence homology, binds adenine nucleotides with similar affinity and specificity as Mdm2, suggesting that residues involved in nucleotide binding may be conserved between the two proteins and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding may have similar functional consequences for both Mdm family members. By generating and testing a series of proteins with deletions and substitution mutations within the Mdm2 RING, we mapped the specific adenine nucleotide binding region of Mdm2 to residues 429-484, encompassing the minimal RING domain. Using a series of ATP derivatives, we demonstrate that phosphate coordination by the Mdm2 P-loop contributes to, but is not primarily responsible for, ATP binding. Additionally, we have identified the 2' and 3' hydroxyls of the ribose and the C6 amino group of the adenine base moiety as being essential for binding. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D052061 D013486
24009720	20130907	PI3K p110? is expressed by gp38(-)CD31(+) and gp38(+)CD31(+) spleen stromal cells and regulates their CCL19, CCL21, and LT?R mRNA levels.	The role of p110? PI3K in lymphoid cells has been studied extensively, showing its importance in immune cell differentiation, activation and development. Altered T cell localization in p110?-deficient mouse spleen suggested a role for p110? in non-hematopoietic stromal cells, which maintain hematopoietic cell segregation. We tested this hypothesis using p110?(WT/WT) mouse bone marrow to reconstitute lethally irradiated p110?(WT/WT) or p110?(D910A/D910A) (which express catalytically inactive p110?) recipients, and studied localization, number and percentage of hematopoietic cell subsets in spleen and lymph nodes, in homeostatic conditions and after antigen stimulation. These analyses showed diffuse T cell areas in p110?(D910A/D910A) and in reconstituted p110?(D910A/D910A) mice in homeostatic conditions. In these mice, spleen CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell numbers did not increase in response to antigen, suggesting that a p110?(D910A/D910A) stroma defect impedes correct T cell response. FACS analysis of spleen stromal cell populations showed a decrease in the percentage of gp38(-)CD31(+) cells in p110?(D910A/D910A) mice. qRT-PCR studies detected p110? mRNA expression in p110?(WT/WT) spleen gp38(-)CD31(+) and gp38(+)CD31(+) subsets, which was reduced in p110?(D910A/D910A) spleen. Lack of p110? activity in these cell populations correlated with lower LT?R, CCL19 and CCL21 mRNA levels; these molecules participate in T cell localization to specific spleen areas. Our results could explain the lower T cell numbers and more diffuse T cell areas found in p110?(D910A/D910A) mouse spleen, as well as the lower T cell expansion after antigen stimulation in p110?(D910A/D910A) compared with p110?(WT/WT) mice.

25161523	20140828	Redetermination of di-aqua-tris-(4-oxo-pent-2-en-2-olato-?(2) O,O')lanthanum(III).	The structure of the title compound, [La(C5H7O2)3(H2O)2], has been redetermined to modern standards with anisotropic displacement parameters for all non-H atoms and the hydrogen-bonding pattern unambiguously established [for the previous study, see Phillips et al. (1968 ?). Inorg. Chem. 7, 2295-2299]. The La(3+) ion is coordinated by three O,O'-bidentate acetyl-acetate (acac(-)) ligands and two water mol-ecules, resulting in a fairly regular square-anti-prismatic LaO8 coordination geometry, with both aqua ligands part of the same square face. In the crystal, the neutral complex mol-ecules are linked into [110] chains by O-H?O hydrogen bonds. 	Acta_Crystallogr_Sect_E_Struct_Rep_Online	D016428
19067670	20081211	A toll-like receptor 4 variant is associated with fatal outcome in children with invasive meningococcal disease.	Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is the major endotoxin signalling receptor of the innate immune system and is required for efficient recognition of bacterial infections. Here, we analysed a possible association between the TLR4 variant Asp299Gly and disease outcome in children with invasive meningococcal disease. In total, 197 children with invasive meningococcal disease were analysed for the TLR4 Asp299Gly variant. Genotyping results were correlated with mortality, the frequency of ventilation support, application of inotropic substances, skin grafting, and limb loss. The overall Asp299Gly allele frequency was 9.4%. Detection of a heterozygous Asp299Gly TLR4 mutation was significantly associated with fatal outcome (non-survivor group: 31.6% vs. survivor group: 12.1%; p = 0.021) and was even more pronounced in patients with disease onset less than 24 months of age (non-survivor group: 42.8% vs. survivor group: 10.2%; p = 0.006). In this age group, ventilation support was also more frequent in patients with the Asp299Gly genotype (37.5% vs. 6.2%). Our data suggest that the heterozygous TLR4 Asp299Gly genotype is associated with an increased mortality in children with invasive meningococcal disease. 	Acta_Paediatr.	D016428 D016448
27895633	20161130	sdh</i>B Gene Mutations in SDHI-Resistant Isolates of<i>Botrytis cinerea</i>Using High Resolution Melting (HRM) Analysis.	 Botrytis cinerea , is a high risk pathogen for fungicide resistance development. Pathogen' resistance to SDHIs is associated with several mutations insdhgene. The diversity of mutations and their differential effect on cross-resistance patterns among SDHIs and the fitness of resistant strains necessitate the availability of a tool for their rapid identification. This study was initiated to develop and validate a high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis for the identification of P225H/F/L//T, N230I, and H272L/R/Y mutations. Based on the sequence ofsdhB subunit of resistant and sensitive isolates, a universal primer pair was designed. The specificity of the HRM analysis primers was verified to ensure against the cross-reaction with other fungal species and its sensitivity was evaluated using concentrations of known amounts of mutant's DNA. The melting curve analysis generated nine distinct curve profiles, enabling the discrimination of all the four mutations located at codon 225, the N230I mutation, the three mutations located in codon 272, and the non-mutated isolates (isolates of wild-type sensitivity). Similar results were obtained when DNA was extracted directly from artificially inoculated strawberry fruit. The method was validated by monitoring the presence ofsdhB mutations in samples of naturally infected strawberry fruits and stone fruit rootstock seedling plants showing damping-off symptoms. HRM analysis data were compared with a standard PIRA-PCR technique and an absolute agreement was observed suggesting that in both populations the H272R mutation was the predominant one, while H272Y, N230I, and P225H were detected in lower frequencies. The results of the study suggest that HRM analysis can be a useful tool for sensate, accurate, and rapid identification of severalsdhB mutations inB. cinereaand it is expected to contribute in routine fungicide resistance monitoring or assessments of the effectiveness of anti-resistance strategies implemented in crops heavily treated with botryticides.

25978841	20150516	Association between Gastroenterological Malignancy and Diabetes Mellitus and Anti-Diabetic Therapy: A Nationwide, Population-Based Cohort Study.	The relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM) and cancer incidence has been evaluated in limited kinds of cancer. The effect of anti-diabetic therapy (ADT) on carcinogenesis among diabetic patients is also unclear. Using population-based representative insurance claims data in Taiwan, 36,270 DM patients and 145,080 comparison subjects without DM were identified from claims from 2005 to 2010. The association between the top ten leading causes of cancer-related death in Taiwan and DM was evaluated. Whether ADT altered the risk of developing cancer was also investigated. Incidence of cancer at any site was significantly higher in patients with DM than in those without (p&lt;0.001). The risk of carcinogenesis imparted by DM was greatest in gastroenterological malignancies (liver, pancreas, and colorectal cancer) as well as lung, breast and oral cancer (p&lt;0.001). Among the oral types of ADT, metformin decreased the risk of lung and liver cancer, but had less effect on reducing the risk of colorectal cancer. ?-glucosidase inhibitor decreased the risk of developing liver, colorectal, and breast cancer. Apart from intermediate-acting insulin, rapid-acting, long-acting, and combination insulin treatment significantly reduced the overall cancer risk among all DM patients. In subgroup analysis, long-acting insulin treatment significantly decreased the risk of lung, liver, and colorectal cancer. Our results supported the notion that pre-existing DM increases the incidence of gastroenterological cancer. ADT, especially metformin, ?-glucosidase inhibitor, and long-acting insulin treatment, may protect patients with DM against these malignancies. It is crucial that oncologists should closely collaborate with endocrinologists to provide an optimal cancer-specific therapy and diabetic treatment to patients simultaneously with cancer and DM.

19273531	20090311	Identification and characterization of a novel testis-specific gene CKT2, which encodes a substrate for protein kinase CK2.	Protein kinase CK2 is a serine/threonine kinase known to phosphorylate numerous substrates. CK2 is implicated in several physiologic and pathologic processes, particularly in cancer biology. CK2 is comprised of several subunits, including CK2alpha, CK2alpha' and CK2beta. Inactivation of CK2alpha' leads to chromatin degeneration of germ cells, resulting in male sterility. To identify additional targets of CK2alpha' in testes and to determine the role of CK2alpha' in germ cell nuclear integrity, GST pull-down and protein-protein interaction assays were conducted. A novel testis-specific gene, CKT2 (CK2 Target protein 2), was found whose product interacts with and is phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro and in vivo. CKT2 is a 30.2 kDa protein with one coiled-coil domain and six putative phosphorylation sites. High expression of CKT2 correlated with chromatin condensation of spermatids in murine testes. Findings reported herein demonstrate that CKT2 is a target protein of native CK2alpha' in testes and suggest that CKT2 plays a role in chromatin regulation of male germ cells. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.

23559680	20130406	Candidate gene analysis of arteriovenous fistula failure in hemodialysis patients.	Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) failure remains an important cause of morbidity in hemodialysis patients. The exact underlying mechanisms responsible for AVF failure are unknown but processes like proliferation, inflammation, vascular remodeling, and thrombosis are thought to be involved. The current objective was to investigate the association between AVF failure and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to these pathophysiologic processes in a large population of incident hemodialysis patients. A total of 479 incident hemodialysis patients were included between January 1997 and April 2004. Follow-up lasted 2 years or until AVF failure, defined as surgery, percutaneous endovascular intervention, or abandonment of the vascular access. Forty-three SNPs in 26 genes, related to proliferation, inflammation, endothelial function, vascular remodeling, coagulation, and calcium/phosphate metabolism, were genotyped. Relations were analyzed using Cox regression analysis. In total, 207 (43.2%) patients developed AVF failure. After adjustment, two SNPs were significantly associated with an increased risk of AVF failure. The hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of LRP1 rs1466535 was 1.75 (1.15 to 2.66) and patients with factor V Leiden had a hazard ratio of 2.54 (1.41 to 4.56) to develop AVF failure. The other SNPs were not associated with AVF failure. In this large cohort of hemodialysis patients, only 2 of the 43 candidate SNPs were associated with an increased risk of AVF failure. Whether other factors, like local hemodynamic circumstances, are more important or other SNPs play a role in AVF failure remains to be elucidated. 	Clin_J_Am_Soc_Nephrol	D016428 D013485

25593988	20150117	Modeling the influence of stromal microenvironment in the selection of ENU-induced BCR-ABL1 mutants by tyrosine kinase inhibitors.	Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have profoundly changed the natural history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, acquired resistance to imatinib, dasatinib or nilotinib (1(st) and 2(nd) generation TKIs), due in part to BCR-ABL1 kinase mutations, has been largely described. These drugs are ineffective on the T315I gatekeeper substitution, which remains sensitive to 3(rd) generation TKI ponatinib. It has recently been suggested that the hematopoietic niche could protect leukemic cells from targeted therapy. In order to investigate the role of a stromal niche in mutation-related resistance, we developed a niche-based cell mutagenesis assay. For this purpose, ENU (N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea)-exposed UT-7 cells expressing non-mutated or T315I-mutated BCR-ABL1 were cultured with or without murine MS-5 stromal cells and in the presence of imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, or ponatinib. In the assays relative to 1(st) and 2(nd) generation TKIs, which were performed on non-mutated BCR-ABL1 cells, our data highlighted the increasing efficacy of the latter, but did not reveal any substantial effect of the niche. In ponatinib assays performed on both non-mutated and T315I-mutated BCR-ABL1 cells, an increased number of resistant clones were observed in the presence of MS-5. Present data suggested that T315I mutants need either compound mutations (e.g. E255K/T315I) or a stromal niche to escape from ponatinib. Using array-comparative genomic hybridization experiments, we found an increased number of variations (involving some recurrent chromosome regions) in clones cultured on MS-5 feeder. Overall, our study suggests that the hematopoietic niche could play a crucial role in conferring resistance to ponatinib, by providing survival signals and favoring genetic instability.

1929375	19910101	Synthesis and properties of lignin peroxidase from Streptomyces viridosporus T7A.	The production of lignin peroxidase by Streptomyces viridosporus T7A was studied in shake flasks and under aerobic conditions in a 7.5-L batch fermentor. Lignin peroxidase synthesis was found to be strongly affected by catabolite repression. Lignin peroxidase was a non-growth-associated, secondary metabolite. The maximum lignin peroxidase activity was 0.064 U/mL at 36 h. In order to maximize lignin peroxidase activity, optimal conditions were determined. The optimal incubation temperature, pH, and substrate (2,4-dichlorophenol) concentration for the enzyme assays were 45 degrees C, 6, and 3 mM, respectively. Stability of lignin peroxidase was determined at 37, 45, and 60 degrees C, and over the pH range 4-9. 	Appl._Biochem._Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485 D013486
20356718	20100402	A coding variant of the novel serotonin receptor subunit 5-HT3E influences sustained attention in schizophrenia patients.	Sustained attention as measured by the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) has proved a valuable endophenotype for schizophrenia. Recently pharmacological studies suggested a role of the serotonin (5-HT) 3 receptor in schizophrenia. The 5-HT3 receptors are the only ligand-gated ion channels within the 5-HT receptor family. Applying an endophenotype approach, we investigated a potential impact of the genes of the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits as well as the novel 5-HT3C, 5-HT3D, and 5-HT3E subunits on CPT performance in subjects with schizophrenia. The study included 196 patients with schizophrenia, 113 of their parents, and 205 healthy controls recruited from community registers. Sustained attention was assessed with the Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs (CPT-IP). Assessing functional and coding variants of the 5-HT3 receptor subunit genes, we found the GG genotype of the 5-HT3E subunit gene (rs7627615; Thr86Ala) to be associated with better attentional capacities in subjects with schizophrenia and healthy controls. This study provides additional evidence for a role of the serotonergic system and the 5-HT3 receptor in schizophrenia. 	Eur_Neuropsychopharmacol	D016428 D013485
8059980	19940601	Occurrence and localization of calbindin-D28K in kidney and cerebellum of the slider turtle, Trachemys scripta.	Since its initial discovery in the avian intestine, calbindin-D28K has been reported to occur in various species and tissues. Although calbindin-D28K binds calcium ions in the physiologically relevant range of intracellular calcium, its functional role in the various cell types where it has been localized remains unknown. We examined the occurrence of calbindin-D28K in the brain and kidney of the testudine reptile, Trachemys scripta, by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry using rabbit anti-sera directed against rat renal calbindin-D28K and chicken intestinal calbindin-D28K. Immunoblotting revealed the presence of calbindin-D28K in the turtle tissues. A single immunoreactive band in the 28,000 relative molecular mass region was visualized in cerebellar and renal homogenates. Immunocytochemistry revealed reaction product for the presence of calbindin-D28K in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, and in the distal tubular cells of the nephron. Processes as well as the perikaryon of the Purkinje cell were immunoreactive. This study describes the occurrence and cellular localization of calbindin-D28K in a reptilian cerebellum, and confirms the phylogenetic distribution of renal calbindin-D28K to the oldest major reptilian group.

23334419	20130122	OTUD7B controls non-canonical NF-?B activation through deubiquitination of TRAF3.	The non-canonical NF-?B pathway forms a major arm of NF-?B signalling that mediates important biological functions, including lymphoid organogenesis, B-lymphocyte function, and cell growth and survival. Activation of the non-canonical NF-?B pathway involves degradation of an inhibitory protein, TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), but how this signalling event is controlled is still unknown. Here we have identified the deubiquitinase OTUD7B as a pivotal regulator of the non-canonical NF-?B pathway. OTUD7B deficiency in mice has no appreciable effect on canonical NF-?B activation but causes hyperactivation of non-canonical NF-?B. In response to non-canonical NF-?B stimuli, OTUD7B binds and deubiquitinates TRAF3, thereby inhibiting TRAF3 proteolysis and preventing aberrant non-canonical NF-?B activation. Consequently, the OTUD7B deficiency results in B-cell hyper-responsiveness to antigens, lymphoid follicular hyperplasia in the intestinal mucosa, and elevated host-defence ability against an intestinal bacterial pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. These findings establish OTUD7B as a crucial regulator of signal-induced non-canonical NF-?B activation and indicate a mechanism of immune regulation that involves OTUD7B-mediated deubiquitination and stabilization of TRAF3.

22868082	20120808	Association between XRCC1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and infertility with idiopathic azoospermia in northern Chinese Han males.	X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) is a scaffold protein that plays a critical role in DNA base excision repair. To explore the association between XRCC1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and infertility with idiopathic azoospermia in a northern Chinese Han population, PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to genotype a SNP locus (rs25487) of XRCC1 in 112 patients with idiopathic azoospermia and 156 healthy controls. Furthermore, nucleotide sequences were sequenced. The results showed that, compared with GG genotype, the GA and GA+AA genotypes showed a significant association with an increased risk of idiopathic azoospermia (OR 2.119, 95% CI 1.245-3.606, P=0.005), (OR 2.052, 95% CI 1.227-3.431, P=0.006) respectively. Meanwhile, the A allele frequency was significantly higher in azoospermic patients than that in controls (OR 1.472, 95% CI 1.029-2.105, P=0.034). The substitutions bring about an amino acid alteration: G?A changes the arginine residue into glutamine. In conclusion, the SNP locus rs25487 of XRCC1 could be a marker for genetic susceptibility to idiopathic azoospermia and the A allele might be a risk gene of idiopathic azoospermia in the northern Chinese Han population.

26091525	20150620	Oncogenic BRAF(V600E) Induces Clastogenesis and UVB Hypersensitivity.	The oncogenic BRAF(V600E) mutation is common in melanomas as well as moles. The roles that this mutation plays in the early events in the development of melanoma are poorly understood. This study demonstrates that expression of BRAF(V600E) is not only clastogenic, but synergizes for clastogenesis caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation in the 300 to 320 nM (UVB) range. Expression of BRAF(V600E) was associated with induction of Chk1 pS280 and a reduction in chromatin remodeling factors BRG1 and BAF180. These alterations in the Chk1 signaling pathway and SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling pathway may contribute to the clastogenesis and UVB sensitivity. These results emphasize the importance of preventing sunburns in children with developing moles. 	Cancers_(Basel)	D016428
6275961	19820101	Delta opiate receptors are involved in the endopioid-induced myoclonic contractions.	Morphine, the prototype mu opiate receptor agonist, decreased the spontaneous and [D-Ala2]-Met-enkephalinamide (DALA)-induced myoclonic contractions (MC) of submandibular muscles in the anaesthetized rat. The proposed kappa receptor agonists ketocyclazocine, ethylketocyclazocine and bremazocine failed to induce MC. In addition, bremazocine inhibited the spontaneous and DALA induced MC. Cyclazocine, the so-called sigma opiate receptor agonist, had a weak potency in generation of MC, but without step dose response tendency. The most potent opioid peptide in inducing the MC and electrocortical (ECoG) epileptic pattern was the delta opiate receptor agonist [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]-enkephalin (DADL). All drugs were administered intraventricularly. The results indicate that myoclonic phenomena induced by DADL and probably by other endopioids are mediated by delta opiate receptors in the rat brain. It is suggested that the combined ECoG and EMG method used in this study offers an opportunity to define further the biological role of opiate receptors and to identify the potential delta opiate receptor acting drugs, which might provide a new approach to the therapy of some seizure disorders.

8037659	19940701	The catalytic role of aspartate in the active site of glutamate dehydrogenase.	A putative catalytic aspartyl residue, Asp-165, in the active site of clostridial glutamate dehydrogenase has been replaced with serine by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant enzyme is efficiently overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a soluble protein and can be successfully purified by the dye-ligand chromatographic procedure normally employed for the wild-type enzyme. By several criteria, including circular dichroism spectrum, sulphydryl reactivity with Ellman's reagent, crystallization and mobility in non-denaturing electrophoresis, the enzyme appears to be correctly folded. NAD+ protects the D165S mutant against modification by Ellman's reagent, suggesting unimpaired binding of coenzyme. In standard assays the specific activity is decreased 10(3)-fold in the reductive amination reaction and 10(5)-fold for oxidative deamination. Kinetic studies show that apparent Km values for NADH and 2-oxoglutarate are almost unchanged. The large reduction in the reaction rate coincides with a weakening of the affinity for ammonium ion (Km &gt; 300 mM, compared with 60 mM for the wild-type). The data are entirely consistent with the direct involvement of D165 in catalysis rather than in the binding of coenzyme or 2-oxoglutarate. 	Biochem._J.	D016428 D013485
16807358	20060630	Y(4) receptors mediate the inhibitory responses of pancreatic polypeptide in human and mouse colon mucosa.	The antisecretory effects of several Y agonists, including pancreatic polypeptide (PP), indicate the presence of Y(1), Y(2), and Y(4) receptors in mouse and human (h) colon mucosae. Here, we used preparations from human and from wild-type (WT), Y(4), and Y(1) receptor knockout ((-/-)) mice, alongside Y(4) receptor-transfected cells to define the relative functional contribution of the Y(4) receptor. First, rat (r) PP antisecretory responses were lost in murine Y(4)(-/-) preparations, but hPP and Pro(34) peptide YY (PYY) costimulated Y(4) and Y(1) receptors in WT mucosa. The Y(1) antagonist/Y(4) agonist GR231118 [(Ile,Glu,Pro,Dpr,Tyr,Arg,Leu,Arg,Try-NH(2))-2-cyclic(2,4'),(2',4)-diamide] elicited small Y(4)-mediated antisecretory responses in human tissues pretreated with the Y(1) antagonist, BIBO3304 [(R)-N-[[4-(aminocarbonylaminomethyl)-phenyl]methyl]-N(2)-(diphenylacetyl)-argininamide trifluoroacetate)], and attenuated Y(4)-mediated hPP responses in mouse and human mucosa. GR231118 and rPP were also antisecretory in hY(4)-transfected epithelial monolayers but were partial agonists compared with hPP at this receptor. In Y(4)-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, Y(4) ligands displaced [(125)I]hPP binding with orders of affinity (pK(i)) at human (hPP = rPP &gt; GR231118 &gt; Pro(34)PYY = PYY) and mouse (rPP = hPP &gt; GR231118 &gt; Pro(34)PYY &gt; PYY) Y(4) receptors. GR231118- and rPP-stimulated guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding through hY(4) receptors with significantly lower efficacy than hPP. GR231118 marginally increased basal but abolished further PP-induced hY(4) internalization to recycling (transferrin-labeled) pathways in HEK293 cells. Taken together, these findings show that Y(4) receptors play a definitive role in attenuating colonic anion transport and may be useful targets for novel antidiarrheal agents due to their limited peripheral expression.

10548037	19991105	Differences in the roles of conserved glutamic acid residues in the active site of human class 3 and class 2 aldehyde dehydrogenases.	Although the three-dimensional structure of the dimeric class 3 rat aldehyde dehydrogenase has recently been published (Liu ZJ et al., 1997, Nature Struct Biol 4:317-326), few mechanistic studies have been conducted on this isoenzyme. We have characterized the enzymatic properties of recombinant class 3 human stomach aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is very similar in amino acid sequence to the class 3 rat aldehyde dehydrogenase. We have determined that the rate-limiting step for the human class 3 isozyme is hydride transfer rather than deacylation as observed for the human liver class 2 mitochondrial enzyme. No enhancement of NADH fluorescence was observed upon binding to the class 3 enzyme, while fluorescence enhancement of NADH has been previously observed upon binding to the class 2 isoenzyme. It was also observed that binding of the NAD cofactor inhibited the esterase activity of the class 3 enzyme while activating the esterase activity of the class 2 enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis of two conserved glutamic acid residues (209 and 333) to glutamine residues indicated that, unlike in the class 2 enzyme, Glu333 served as the general base in the catalytic reaction and E209Q had only marginal effects on enzyme activity, thus confirming the proposed mechanism (Hempel J et al., 1999, Adv Exp Med Biol 436:53-59). Together, these data suggest that even though the subunit structures and active site residues of the isozymes are similar, the enzymes have very distinct properties besides their oligomeric state (dimer vs. tetramer) and substrate specificity.

26383589	20150919	Supportive evidence for FOXP1, BARX1, and FOXF1 as genetic risk loci for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.	The Barrett's and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium (BEACON) recently performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and Barrett's esophagus. They identified genome-wide significant association for variants at three genes, namely CRTC1, FOXP1, and BARX1. Furthermore, they replicated an association at the FOXF1 gene that has been previously found in a GWAS on Barrett's esophagus. We aimed at further replicating the association at these and other loci that showed suggestive association with P &lt; 10(-4) in the BEACON sample. In total, we tested 88 SNPs in an independent sample consisting of 1065 EAC cases and 1019 controls of German descent. We could replicate the association at FOXP1, BARX1, and FOXF1 with nominal significance and thereby confirm that genetic variants at these genes confer EAC risk. In addition, we found association of variants near the genes XRCC2 and GATA6 that were strongly (P &lt; 10(-5) ) although not genome-wide significantly associated with the BEACON GWAS. Therefore, both variants and corresponding genes represent promising candidates for future EAC association studies on independent samples. 	Cancer_Med	D016428 D013485
19428765	20090512	A glycine-leucine-rich peptide structurally related to the plasticins from skin secretions of the frog Leptodactylus laticeps (Leptodactylidae).	A glycine-leucine-rich peptide was isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the Sante Fe frog Leptodactylus laticeps (Leptodactylidae) whose primary structure (Gly-Leu-Val-Asn-Gly-Leu-Leu-Ser-Ser-Val-Leu-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gln-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Leu-Leu-Gly-Gly-Ile-Leu) contains the (GXXXG)(3) motif found in the plasticins, previously identified only in phyllomedusid frogs (Hylidae). Circular dichroism studies showed that the secondary structure of the peptide, termed plasticin-L1, was markedly solvent-dependent displaying a random coil conformation in water, a beta-sheet structure in methanol, and an alpha-helical conformation in 50% trifluoroethanol-water. A synthetic replicate of the peptide did not inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus or lyse human erythrocytes at concentrations up to 500 microM. At relatively high concentrations (&gt;or=1 microM), the peptide produced a significant (P&lt;0.05), although modest (139% of basal rate at 3 microM), increase in the rate of glucose-induced release of insulin from rat clonal BRIN-BD11 beta cells without increasing the rate of release of lactate dehydrogenase. A peptide, termed ocellatin-L2 was also identified in the skin secretion that was identical to the previously described ocellatin-L1 except for the substitution Asn(23)--&gt;Asp. Ocellatin-L2 was devoid of antimicrobial and hemolytic activity but also showed significant activity in stimulating insulin release from BRIN-BD11 cells (181% of basal rate at 3 microM).

25144382	20140822	Size and surface functionalization of iron oxide nanoparticles influence the composition and dynamic nature of their protein corona.	Nanoparticles (NPs) adsorb proteins when in the biological matrix, and the resulted protein corona could affect NP-cell interactions. The corona has a dynamic nature with the adsorbed proteins constantly exchanging with the free proteins in the matrix at various rates. The rapidly exchanging proteins compose the soft corona, which responds more dynamically to environment changes than the hard corona established by the ones with slow exchange rates. In the present study, the corona formed on the superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs (SPIONs) in human serum was studied by flow field-flow fractionation and ultracentrifugation, which rapidly differentiated the corona proteins based on their exchange rates. By varying the surface hydrophobicity of the SPIONs with a core size around 10 nm, we found out that, the more hydrophobic surface ligand attracted proteins with higher surface hydrophobicity and formed a more dynamic corona with a larger portion of the involved proteins with fast exchange rates. Increasing the core diameter of the SPIONs but keeping the surface ligand the same could also result in a more dynamic corona. A brief investigation of the effect on the cellular uptake of SPIONs using one selected corona protein, transferrin, was conducted. The result showed that, only the stably bound transferrin could significantly enhance cellular uptake, while transferrin bound in a dynamic nature had negligible impact. Our study has led to a better understanding of the relationship between the particle properties and the dynamic nature of the corona, which can help with design of nanomaterials with higher biocompatibility and higher efficacy in biosystems for biomedical applications.

24865988	20140529	Genetic variants associated with susceptibility of Ashkenazi Jews to West Nile virus infection.	The epidemiology of West Nile virus (WNV) in Israel is different from other neighbouring countries in the Middle East where disease burden has been minimal. We analysed a cohort of Ashkenazi Jewish patients with symptomatic WNV infection (n = 39), and WNV-negative controls (n = 61), for nine genetic variants that has been suggested to be associated with susceptibility to WNV. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms were significantly more frequent in WNV-infected than non-infected individuals, rs7280422 (MX1) [odds ratio (OR) 4?05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2?04-8?03, P &lt; 0?001] and rs3213545 (OASL) (OR 1?85, 95% CI 1?03-3?3, P = 0?03). Genetic polymorphism may play a significant role in susceptibility to WNV infection in Ashkenazi Jews. 	Epidemiol._Infect.	D016428 D013485
21201408	20110105	(m-Phenyl-enedimethyl-ene)diammonium p-nitro-phenyl-phosphate perchlorate.	The title compound, C(8)H(14)N(2) (2+)?C(12)H(8)N(2)O(8)P(-)?ClO(4) (-), was formed by the reaction of ?,?-bis-m-xylenediamine and sodium bis-p-nitro-phenyl-phosphate in the presence of Zn(ClO(4))?6H(2)O in methanol solution. The two amine groups of the m-xylenediammonium ion are each protonated and each hydrogen-bonded to two O atoms of the phosphate anion, which acts as a 1,3-bridge. The ammonium groups are arranged matched face to face and each pair is doubly bridged by two perchlorate ions through hydrogen bonding. In addition, there are also weak C-H?O inter-actions. Both the N-H?O and C-H?O inter-actions are contained in a channel down the a axis. The perchlorate oxygen atoms are disordered over two positions with site occupancy factors of ca 0.7 and 0.3.

25820198	20150331	Association of body mass index with chromosome damage levels and lung cancer risk among males.	Epidemiological studies have shown an etiological link between body mass index (BMI) and cancer risk, but evidence supporting these observations is limited. This study aimed to investigate potential associations of BMI with chromosome damage levels and lung cancer risk. First, we recruited 1333 male workers from a coke-oven plant to examine their chromosome damage levels; and then, a cohort study of 12,052 males was used to investigate the association of BMI with lung cancer incidence. We further carried out a meta-analysis for BMI and male lung cancer risk based on cohort studies. We found that men workers with excess body weight (BMI ? 25?kg/m(2)) had lower levels of MN frequencies than men with normal-weight (BMI: 18.5-24.9). Our cohort study indicated that, the relative risk (RR) for men with BMI ? 25 to develop lung cancer was 35% lower than RR for normal-weight men. Further meta-analysis showed that, compared to normal-weight men, men with BMI ? 25 had decreased risk of lung cancer among both the East-Asians and others populations. These results indicate that men with excess body weight had significant decreased chromosome damage levels and lower risk of lung cancer than those with normal-weight. However, further biological researches were needed to validate these associations. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D017418 D013485
10860360	20000622	[Genetic characterization of Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) detected in Japan from 1989 to 1998 and establishment of consensus primers].	By means of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using various pairs of primers, 902 strains of Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) were detected during 10 years from 1989 to 1998 in the nationwide area of Japan including Hokkaido and Okinawa. Nucleotide sequencing was done on 177 strains, and we found that 153 strains (86%) of them belonged to geno-group II (GII). GII could be classified into five subgroups (G2A, G2B, G2C, G2D and G2E) based on the amino acid sequences showing a similarity of more than 91%. Among them G2C and G2D (named JP1) as well as G2E (named JP2), which were occasionally identified in Japan (detection rate of 17%) but rarely detected in the other countries, revealed to form new subgroups. From the above analysis, three pairs of new primers were established as consensus primers for NLVs. All the three sets of primers, P1/P2,P1/P3 and Y1/Y2, amplified both GI and GII equally and efficiently. 	Kansenshogaku_Zasshi	D004740 D016428
18023463	20071121	Dynamics of saxitoxin binding to saxiphilin c-lobe reveals conformational change.	Thermodynamic parameters (DeltaG, DeltaH, DeltaS, DeltaC(p)) have been determined to evaluate the dynamics of binding of saxitoxin to the c-lobe of saxiphilin. We have developed an improved method to rapidly express and purify recombinant saxiphilin c-lobe, and fully characterized it by mass spectrometry for the first time. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to characterize the interaction between saxitoxin and immobilized c-lobe. At 298 K, c-lobe binds saxitoxin with K(D)=1.2 nM, DeltaH degrees =-11.7+/-0.8 kcal/mol, and DeltaS degrees =1.17+/-0.07 cal/molK. Analysis of DeltaC(p) of toxin association at several temperatures suggests that hydrophobic forces contribute to the binding event. Additionally, changes in 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANS) fluorescence upon binding to c-lobe in the presence and absence of saxitoxin support a conformational change in c-lobe upon saxitoxin binding.

27647936	20160921	Effects of heterologous expression of human cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 3A (hPDE3A) on redox regulation in yeast.	Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes; however, the roles of protein kinase A (PKA) and human phosphodiesterase 3A (hPDE3A) remain unknown. Here, we show that yeast expressing wild-type (WT) hPDE3A or K13R hPDE3A (putative ubiquitinylation site mutant) exhibited resistance or sensitivity to exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), respectively. H2O2-stimulated ROS production was markedly increased in yeast expressing K13R hPDE3A (Oxidative stress Sensitive 1, OxiS1), compared with yeast expressing WT hPDE3A (Oxidative stress Resistant 1, OxiR1). In OxiR1, YAP1 and YAP1-dependent antioxidant genes were up-regulated, accompanied by a reduction in thioredoxin peroxidase. In OxiS1, expression of YAP1 and YAP1-dependent genes was impaired, and the thioredoxin system malfunctioned. H2O2increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-hydrolyzing activity of WT hPDE3A, but not K13R hPDE3A, through PKA-dependent phosphorylation of hPDE3A, which was correlated with its ubiquitinylation. The changes in antioxidant gene expression did not directly correlate with differences in cAMP-PKA signaling. Despite differences in their capacities to hydrolyze cAMP, total cAMP levels among OxiR1, OxiS1, and mock were similar; PKA activity, however, was lower in OxiS1 than in OxiR1 or mock. During exposure to H2O2, however, Sch9p activity, a target of Rapamycin complex 1-regulated Rps6 kinase and negative-regulator of PKA, was rapidly reduced in OxiR1, and Tpk1p, a PKA catalytic subunit, was diffusely spread throughout the cytosol, with PKA activation. In OxiS1, Sch9p activity was unchanged during exposure to H2O2, consistent with reduced activation of PKA. These results suggest that, during oxidative stress, TOR-Sch9 signaling might regulate PKA activity, and that post-translational modifications of hPDE3A are critical in its regulation of cellular recovery from oxidative stress.

10377247	19990623	A monomer-dimer equilibrium modulates the interaction of the sunflower homeodomain leucine-zipper protein Hahb-4 with DNA.	We have analysed the interaction of the sunflower homeodomain leucine-zipper (Hd-Zip) protein Hahb-4 with DNA. The complete Hd-Zip domain from Hahb-4 was able to select specific sequences from a random oligonucleotide mixture that contained a 9-bp core with four fixed and five degenerate positions. Analysis of the binding of some of the selected sequences suggests that Hahb-4 preferentially binds the dyad-symmetrical sequence CAAT(A/T)ATTG. Single-nucleotide replacements at positions 1, 5 or 9 of this sequence produced a decrease in binding of 2-4-fold. DNA binding as a function of protein concentration was non-hyperbolic. This behaviour could be explained by an equation in which dimer formation is a pre-requisite for DNA binding. A global dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.31x10(-14) M2 could be calculated. The removal of the leucine zipper promoted a change in specificity and a decrease in binding affinity (Kd=5. 03x10(-5) M). Mutation of Phe-20 of the homeodomain into Leu completely abolished DNA binding. The mutant protein, however, was able to inhibit DNA binding by the non-mutant form, presumably through the formation of heterodimers. The analysis of this inhibitory effect at different mutant concentrations allowed the estimation of the Kd for the dimer-monomer equilibrium [about (2-4)x10(-6) M]; from this, a Kd of 3-6x10(-9) M for the dimer-DNA complex could be estimated. The results obtained indicate that the formation of dimers is the main factor influencing the interaction of Hahb-4 with DNA. It is proposed that shifts in a dimer-monomer equilibrium could be used within the cell to modulate the interaction of this protein with target genes. 	Biochem._J.	D016428 D013485
23776546	20130619	Meta-analysis indicates that the European GWAS-identified risk SNP rs1344706 within ZNF804A is not associated with schizophrenia in Han Chinese population.	Recent genetic association studies have implicated several candidate susceptibility variants for schizophrenia among general populations. Rs1344706, an intronic SNP within ZNF804A, was identified as one of the most compelling candidate risk SNPs for schizophrenia in Europeans through genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and replications as well as large-scale meta-analyses. However, in Han Chinese, the results for rs1344706 are inconsistent, and whether rs1344706 is an authentic risk SNP for schizophrenia in Han Chinese is inconclusive. Here, we conducted a systematic meta-analysis of rs1344706 with schizophrenia in Chinese population by combining all available case-control samples (N?=?12), including a total of 8,982 cases and 12,342 controls. The results of our meta-analysis were not able to confirm an association of rs1344706 A-allele with schizophrenia (p?=?0.10, odds ratio?=?1.06, 95% confidence interval?=?0.99-1.13). Such absence of association was further confirmed by the non-superiority test (p?=?0.0003), suggesting that rs1344706 is not a risk SNP for schizophrenia in Han Chinese. Detailed examinations of individual samples revealed potential sampling bias in previous replication studies in Han Chinese. The absence of rs1344706 association in Han Chinese suggest a potential genetic heterogeneity in the susceptibility of schizophrenia on this locus and also demonstrate the difficulties in replicating genome-wide association findings of schizophrenia across different ethnic populations.

25419514	20141125	Lysinuric Protein Intolerance Presenting with Multiple Fractures.	Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism caused by mutations inSLC7A7, which encodes a component of the dibasic amino acid transporter found in intestinal and renal tubular cells. Patients typically present with vomiting, diarrhea, irritability, failure to thrive, and symptomatic hyperammonemia after protein-rich meals. Long-term complications may include pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, renal disease, and osteoporosis. We present a 5-year-old male who was followed in our skeletal dysplasia clinic for 3 years for multiple fractures, idiopathic osteoporosis, and short stature in the absence of typical features of LPI. Whole exome sequencing performed to determine the etiology of the osteoporosis and speech delay identified a nonsense mutation inSLC7A7. Chromosome microarray analysis identified a deletion involving the second allele of the same gene, and biochemical analysis supported the diagnosis of LPI. Our patient's atypical presentation underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for LPI in patients with unexplained fractures and idiopathic osteoporosis, even in the absence of clinical symptoms of hyperammonemia after protein rich meals or other systemic features of classical LPI. This case further demonstrates the utility of whole exome sequencing in diagnosis of unusual presentations of rare disorders for which early intervention may modify the clinical course.

15951963	20050614	A comparison of the phenotype and genotype in adenomatous polyposis patients with and without a family history.	Adenomatous polyposis of the colon is often secondary to an inherited mutation in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, however, approximately one third of patients have no family history of the disease. We studied the phenotype and genotype of adenomatous polyposis in patients without a family history. A cohort of 57 unrelated adenomatous polyposis patients were evaluated. Seventeen patients with no family history were compared with 40 patients who had a positive family history of the disease. Family history and medical records were collected and analyzed. Germline APC and Mut Y homologue (MYH) testing was undertaken. Patients without a family history were diagnosed with polyposis at an older age (41 years vs. 32 years) and presenting more frequently with symptoms (76 vs 20, P &lt; 0.05). The number of colonic polyps and frequency of extracolonic manifestation associated with adenomatous polyposis did not differ between the two groups. APC mutations were detected less frequently among patients without a family history of the disease (4 out of 17 vs 25 out of 40, P=0.007), even among those with greater than 100 colorectal adenomas (4 out of 12 versus 21 out of 29, P=0.03). One homozygous MYH mutation carrier (G382D) was detected among the six patients without a family history and without a germline APC mutation who were tested. Adenomatous polyposis patients without a family history are usually diagnosed with symptoms, and at a later age. Phenotypically, they are similar to those with a family history. However, germline APC mutations are detected far less frequently in patients without a family history. A small percentage of these cases may be secondary to biallelic germline MYH mutations.

15805549	20050405	Genome-wide linkage analyses and candidate gene fine mapping for HDL3 cholesterol: the Framingham Study.	High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is inversely associated with coronary heart disease and has a genetic component; however, linkage to HDL-C is not conclusive. Subfractions of HDL, such as HDL(3)-C, may be better phenotypes for linkage studies. Using HDL(3)-C levels measured on 907 Framingham Heart Study subjects from 330 families around 1987, we conducted a genome-wide variance components linkage analysis with 401 microsatellite markers spaced approximately 10 centimorgan (cM) apart. Nine candidate genes were identified and annotated using a bioinformatics approach in the region of the highest linkage peak. Twenty-eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected from these candidate genes, and linkage and family-based association fine mapping were conducted using these SNPs. The highest multipoint log-of-the-odds (LOD) score from the initial linkage analysis was 3.7 at 133 cM on chromosome 6. Linkage analyses with additional SNPs yielded the highest LOD score of 4.0 at 129 cM on chromosome 6. Family-based association analysis revealed that SNP rs2257104 in PLAGL1 at approximately 143 cM was associated with multivariable adjusted HDL(3) (P = 0.03). Further study of the linkage region and exploration of other variants in PLAGL1 are warranted to define the potential functional variants of HDL-C metabolism. 	J._Lipid_Res.

27935319	20161210	Haplotype association and synergistic effect of human aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) gene polymorphisms causing susceptibility to essential hypertension in Indian patients.	Aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) is a key enzyme involved in the terminal steps of aldosterone biosynthesis. Genetic variability in CYP11B2 gene has been associated with heterogeneous aldosterone production, which can affect sodium homeostasis and thereby regulation of blood pressure. Hence, the present study was aimed to explore the single-locus variations, haplotype and epistasis patterns of CYP11B2 (C-344T, intron-2 gene conversion and Lys173Arg) gene polymorphisms, and the risk contributed by them to the development of essential hypertension (EHT). A total of 279 hypertensive patients and 200 normotensive controls were enrolled in this study. C-344T and Lys173Arg polymorphisms of CYP11B2 gene were genotyped by PCR-RFLP method and intron-2 gene conversion (IC) polymorphism by allele-specific PCR analysis. Single-locus analysis revealed significant association of CYP11B2 C-344T and Lys173Arg polymorphisms with EHT (p &lt; 0.05). Considering the sexes, Lys173 allele was found to be at risk for hypertension in males (OR 1.40; 95% CI = 1.01-1.96). Unphased haplotype analysis revealed H1 (T-Conv-Lys; p = 0.0017) to have significant risk for EHT, while haplotype H4 (T-Wt-Arg) had a significant protective effect. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) interaction analysis found the overall best model with C-344T and IC polymorphisms exhibiting strong synergistic effect. The present study revealed a strong synergistic effect of CYP11B2 C-344T and IC polymorphisms causing susceptibility to EHT and haplotype H1 (-344T-Conv-Lys173) as the risk-conferring factor for hypertension predisposition.

24324463	20131211	Sorbic acid stress activates the Candida glabrata high osmolarity glycerol MAP kinase pathway.	Weak organic acids such as sorbic acid are important food preservatives and powerful fungistatic agents. These compounds accumulate in the cytosol and disturb the cellular pH and energy homeostasis. Candida glabrata is in many aspects similar to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, with regard to confrontation to sorbic acid, two of the principal response pathways behave differently in C. glabrata. In yeast, sorbic acid stress causes activation of many genes via the transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4. The C. glabrata homologs CgMsn2 and CgMsn4 are apparently not activated by sorbic acid. In contrast, in C. glabrata the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway is activated by sorbic acid. Here we show that the MAP kinase of the HOG pathway, CgHog1, becomes phosphorylated and has a function for weak acid stress resistance. Transcript profiling of weak acid treated C. glabrata cells suggests a broad and very similar response pattern of cells lacking CgHog1 compared to wild type which is over lapping with but distinct from S. cerevisiae. The PDR12 gene was the highest induced gene in both species and it required CgHog1 for full expression. Our results support flexibility of the response cues for general stress signaling pathways, even between closely related yeasts, and functional extension of a specific response pathway.

15138293	20040513	The Abl-related gene (Arg) requires its F-actin-microtubule cross-linking activity to regulate lamellipodial dynamics during fibroblast adhesion.	Microtubules (MTs) help establish and maintain cell polarity by promoting actin-dependent membrane protrusion at the leading edge of the cell, but the molecular mechanisms that mediate cross-talk between actin and MTs during this process are unclear. We demonstrate that the Abl-related gene (Arg) nonreceptor tyrosine kinase is required for dynamic lamellipodial protrusions after adhesion to fibronectin. arg-/- fibroblasts exhibit reduced lamellipodial dynamics as compared with wild-type fibroblasts, and this defect can be rescued by reexpression of an Arg-yellow fluorescent protein fusion. We show that Arg can bind MTs with high affinity and cross-link filamentous actin (F-actin) bundles and MTs in vitro. MTs concentrate and insert into Arg-induced F-actin-rich cell protrusions. Arg requires both its F-actin-binding domains and its MT-binding domain to rescue the defects in lamellipodial dynamics of arg-/- fibroblasts. These findings demonstrate that Arg can mediate physical contact between F-actin and MTs at the cell periphery and that this cross-linking activity is required for Arg to regulate lamellipodial dynamics in fibroblasts.

24952594	20140623	Structural insights into the stabilization of MALAT1 noncoding RNA by a bipartite triple helix.	Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) is a highly abundant nuclear long noncoding RNA that promotes malignancy. A 3'-stem-loop structure is predicted to confer stability by engaging a downstream A-rich tract in a triple helix, similar to the expression and nuclear retention element (ENE) from the KSHV polyadenylated nuclear RNA. The 3.1-?-resolution crystal structure of the human MALAT1 ENE and A-rich tract reveals a bipartite triple helix containing stacks of five and four U?A-U triples separated by a C+?G-C triplet and C-G doublet, extended by two A-minor interactions. In vivo decay assays indicate that this blunt-ended triple helix, with the 3' nucleotide in a U?A-U triple, inhibits rapid nuclear RNA decay. Interruption of the triple helix by the C-G doublet induces a 'helical reset' that explains why triple-helical stacks longer than six do not occur in nature. 	Nat._Struct._Mol._Biol.

24324575	20131211	Heat-stress and light-stress induce different cellular pathologies in the symbiotic dinoflagellate during coral bleaching.	Coral bleaching is a significant contributor to the worldwide degradation of coral reefs and is indicative of the termination of symbiosis between the coral host and its symbiotic algae (dinoflagellate; Symbiodinium sp. complex), usually by expulsion or xenophagy (symbiophagy) of its dinoflagellates. Herein, we provide evidence that during the earliest stages of environmentally induced bleaching, heat stress and light stress generate distinctly different pathomorphological changes in the chloroplasts, while a combined heat- and light-stress exposure induces both pathomorphologies; suggesting that these stressors act on the dinoflagellate by different mechanisms. Within the first 48 hours of a heat stress (32?C) under low-light conditions, heat stress induced decomposition of thylakoid structures before observation of extensive oxidative damage; thus it is the disorganization of the thylakoids that creates the conditions allowing photo-oxidative-stress. Conversely, during the first 48 hours of a light stress (2007 ?moles m(-2) s(-1) PAR) at 25?C, condensation or fusion of multiple thylakoid lamellae occurred coincidently with levels of oxidative damage products, implying that photo-oxidative stress causes the structural membrane damage within the chloroplasts. Exposure to combined heat- and light-stresses induced both pathomorphologies, confirming that these stressors acted on the dinoflagellate via different mechanisms. Within 72 hours of exposure to heat and/or light stresses, homeostatic processes (e.g., heat-shock protein and anti-oxidant enzyme response) were evident in the remaining intact dinoflagellates, regardless of the initiating stressor. Understanding the sequence of events during bleaching when triggered by different environmental stressors is important for predicting both severity and consequences of coral bleaching.

27213691	20160524	Id2 reinforces TH1 differentiation and inhibits E2A to repress TFH differentiation.	The differentiation of helper T cells into effector subsets is critical to host protection. Transcription factors of the E-protein and Id families are important arbiters of T cell development, but their role in the differentiation of the TH1 and TFH subsets of helper T cells is not well understood. Here, TH1 cells showed more robust Id2 expression than that of TFH cells, and depletion of Id2 via RNA-mediated interference increased the frequency of TFH cells. Furthermore, TH1 differentiation was blocked by Id2 deficiency, which led to E-protein-dependent accumulation of effector cells with mixed characteristics during viral infection and severely impaired the generation of TH1 cells following infection with Toxoplasma gondii. The TFH cell-defining transcriptional repressor Bcl6 bound the Id2 locus, which provides a mechanism for the bimodal Id2 expression and reciprocal development of TH1 cells and TFH cells.

21449914	20110401	Influence of ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of risperidone in healthy subjects with CYP2D6*10/*10.	The objective of this study was to investigate the combined influence of genetic polymorphisms in ABCB1 and CYP2D6 genes on risperidone pharmacokinetics. Seventy-two healthy Korean volunteers receiving a single oral dose of 2 mg risperidone were included in this study. Significant differences were observed between the ABCB1 3435C&gt;T genotypes for the pharmacokinetic parameters (peak serum concentration) of risperidone and the active moiety (risperidone and its main metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone). There were no significant differences in the area under the serum concentration-time curves of risperidone and the active moiety among the ABCB1 2677G&gt;T/A and 3435C&gt;T genotypes. However, the peak serum concentration and area under the serum concentration-time curves were significantly different among the ABCB1 3435C&gt;T genotypes in CYP2D6*10/*10. These findings indicate that polymorphisms of ABCB1 3435C&gt;T in individuals with CYP2D6*10/*10, which has low metabolic activity, could play an important role in the potential adverse effects or toxicity of risperidone.

The effects of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) on an unfolding step of human cyanomet myoglobin (Mb) were examined for wild-type and three L--&gt;A mutant Mbs. The unfolding was induced at acidic pH (3.6-4.5) with various concentrations of MgSO4 (0-2 M). The monophasic process was monitored by visible absorption spectroscopy. We observed quite nonlinear delta G not equal to-[MgSO4] relations for all the Mbs. delta G not equal to-[MgCl2] relations were also determined for a comparative study. Thermodynamic evaluation of the results indicated that an upward reflection of delta G not equal to-[MgSO4] relations in high [MgSO4] is caused by the strong Hofmeister effect of the salt. Results obtained for three mutants (L29A, L72A, and L104A) at pH 4.0 and 4.5 were consistent with our previous observation that the structure of the transition state is determined by the stability of Mb cores in the balance with the pH conditions of unfolding (T. Konno and I. Morishima. 1993. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1162:93-98). 	Biophys._J.	D016428
26706916	20151229	Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young: What Do Clinicians Need to Know?	Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic form of diabetes that is characterized by an early onset, autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and a primary defect in pancreatic ?-cell function. MODY represents less than 2% of all diabetes cases and is commonly misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. At least 13 MODY subtypes with distinct genetic etiologies have been identified to date. A correct genetic diagnosis is important as it often leads to personalized treatment for those with diabetes and enables predictive genetic testing for their asymptomatic relatives. Next-generation sequencing may provide an efficient method for screening mutations in this form of diabetes as well as identifying new MODY genes. In this review, I discuss a current update on MODY in the literatures and cover the studies that have been performed in Korea. 	Diabetes_Metab_J	D016428 D016454
27924309	20161208	Engineering the Dynamic Properties of Protein Networks through Sequence Variation.	The dynamic behavior of macromolecular networks dominates the mechanical properties of soft materials and influences biological processes at multiple length scales. In hydrogels prepared from self-assembling artificial proteins, stress relaxation and energy dissipation arise from the transient character of physical network junctions. Here we show that subtle changes in sequence can be used to program the relaxation behavior of end-linked networks of engineered coiled-coil proteins. Single-site substitutions in the coiled-coil domains caused shifts in relaxation time over 5 orders of magnitude as demonstrated by dynamic oscillatory shear rheometry and stress relaxation measurements. Networks with multiple relaxation time scales were also engineered. This work demonstrates how time-dependent mechanical responses of macromolecular materials can be encoded in genetic information.

27920797	20161207	Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>).	Fillet yield (FY, %) is an economically-important trait in rainbow trout aquaculture that affects production efficiency. Despite that, FY has received little attention in breeding programs because it is difficult to measure on a large number of fish and cannot be directly measured on breeding candidates. The recent development of a high-density SNP array for rainbow trout has provided the needed tool for studying the underlying genetic architecture of this trait. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted for FY, body weight at 10 (BW10) and 13 (BW13) months post-hatching, head-off carcass weight (CAR), and fillet weight (FW) in a pedigreed rainbow trout population selectively bred for improved growth performance. The GWAS analysis was performed using the weighted single-step GBLUP method (wssGWAS). Phenotypic records of 1447 fish (1.5 kg at harvest) from 299 full-sib families in three successive generations, of which 875 fish from 196 full-sib families were genotyped, were used in the GWAS analysis. A total of 38,107 polymorphic SNPs were analyzed in a univariate model with hatch year and harvest group as fixed effects, harvest weight as a continuous covariate, and animal and common environment as random effects. A new linkage map was developed to create windows of 20 adjacent SNPs for use in the GWAS. The two windows with largest effect for FY and FW were located on chromosome Omy9 and explained only 1.0-1.5% of genetic variance, thus suggesting a polygenic architecture affected by multiple loci with small effects in this population. One window on Omy5 explained 1.4 and 1.0% of the genetic variance for BW10 and BW13, respectively. Three windows located on Omy27, Omy17, and Omy9 (same window detected for FY) explained 1.7, 1.7, and 1.0%, respectively, of genetic variance for CAR. Among the detected 100 SNPs, 55% were located directly in genes (intron and exons). Nucleotide sequences of intragenic SNPs were blasted to theMus musculusgenome to create a putative gene network. The network suggests that differences in the ability to maintain a proliferative and renewable population of myogenic precursor cells may affect variation in growth and fillet yield in rainbow trout.

15046747	20040330	Rectified photocurrent in a protein based molecular photo-diode consisting of a cytochrome b562-green fluorescent protein chimera self-assembled monolayer.	We fabricated a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of a chimeric protein created as a novel model protein for an artificial light-harvesting complex (LHC) composed of two proteins, cytochrome b(562) (cytb(562)) mutated for SAM fabrication (cytb(562), N22C, G82C) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The SAM formation of chimeric protein on a single-crystalline Au(111) substrate was confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement. The rectified photocurrent of the chimeric protein SAM on a gold substrate was detected by light-illumination scanning tunneling microscopy (LI-STM) co-operated with a lock-in technique. The photocurrent generation of the chimeric protein SAM was wavelength-specific to the light-illumination (488 nm), which indicated that the EGFP part of the chimera plays a role as a sensitizer in the photo-induced electron transfer process.

27476701	20160802	The ability of apolipoprotein E fragments to promote intraneuronal accumulation of amyloid beta peptide 42 is both isoform and size-specific.	The apolipoprotein (apo) E4 isoform is the strongest risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). ApoE4 is more susceptible to proteolysis than apoE2 and apoE3 isoforms and carboxyl-terminal truncated apoE4 forms have been found in AD patients' brain. We have previously shown that a specific apoE4 fragment, apoE4-165, promotes amyloid-peptide beta 42 (A?42) accumulation in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species formation, two events considered to occur early in AD pathogenesis. Here, we show that these effects are allele-dependent and absolutely require the apoE4 background. Furthermore, the exact length of the fragment is critical since longer or shorter length carboxyl-terminal truncated apoE4 forms do not elicit the same effects. Structural and thermodynamic analyses showed that apoE4-165 has a compact structure, in contrast to other carboxyl-terminal truncated apoE4 forms that are instead destabilized. Compared however to other allelic backgrounds, apoE4-165 is structurally distinct and less thermodynamically stable suggesting that the combination of a well-folded structure with structural plasticity is a unique characteristic of this fragment. Overall, our findings suggest that the ability of apoE fragments to promote A?42 intraneuronal accumulation is specific for both the apoE4 isoform and the particular structural and thermodynamic properties of the fragment.

26985176	20160318	A study of the activity and effectiveness of recombinant fibroblast growth factor (Q40P/S47I/H93G rFGF-1) in anti-aging treatment.	Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1) is a powerful mitogen involved in the stimulation of DNA synthesis and the proliferation of a wide variety of cell types. Fibroblast growth factor 1 was genetically modified to improve its thermal stability and resistance to protease degradation without losing its biological activity. To study the impact of Q40P/S47I/H93G rFGF-1 on skin cells, its penetration through the skin and the evaluation of the rFGF-1-cosmetic product properties. In vitro studies included the examination of primary fibroblast and keratinocyte viability after the incubation with rFGF-1. The penetration abilities of rFGF-1 in various formulations and carrier systems were examined ex vivo by the Raman spectroscopy. In vivo studies - HF Ultrasound and 3D Imaging System - were used to evaluate the anti-aging properties of creams containing rFGF-1. In vitro studies demonstrated that rFGF-1 strongly enhanced the viability of the treated cells. The Raman Spectroscopy analysis indicated that rFGF-1 encapsulated in lipid spheres penetrate through the stratum corneum to the depth of 60 ?m, and added to the o/w formulation - could penetrate to a depth of 90 ?m. The results obtained from Primos revealed the reduction of the volume and the depth of the wrinkles. Changes in the skin structure in the analyzed areas were evaluated by HF Ultrasonography. Recombinant FGF-1 strongly stimulated fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation. However, the transition of this protein through the SC required an appropriate carrier system - lipid spheres. All tests - in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo - have proved that rFGF-1 is a substance with a potentially wide spectrum of use. 	Postepy_Dermatol_Alergol	D016428
18467334	20080510	Juxtaposition of the steroid binding domain-like I and II regions constitutes a ligand binding site in the sigma-1 receptor.	sigma-1 receptors represent unique binding sites that are capable of interacting with a wide range of compounds to mediate different cellular events. The composition of the ligand binding site of this receptor is unclear, since no NMR or crystal structures are available. Recent studies in our laboratory using radiolabeled photoreactive ligands suggested that the steroid binding domain-like I (SBDLI) (amino acids 91-109) and the steroid binding domain-like II (SBDLII) (amino acids 176-194) regions are involved in forming the ligand binding site(s) ( Chen, Y., Hajipour, A. R., Sievert, M. K., Arbabian, M., and Ruoho, A. E. (2007) Biochemistry 46, 3532-3542 ; Pal, A., Hajipour, A. R., Fontanilla, D., Ramachandran, S., Chu, U. B., Mavlyutov, T., and Ruoho, A. E. (2007) Mol. Pharmacol. 72, 921-933 ). In this report, we have further addressed this issue by utilizing our previously developed sulfhydryl-reactive, cleavable, radioiodinated photocross-linking reagent: methanesulfonothioic acid, S-((4-(4-amino-3-[125I]iodobenzoyl) phenyl)methyl) ester (Guo, L. W., Hajipour, A. R., Gavala, M. L., Arbabian, M., Martemyanov, K. A., Arshavsky, V. Y., and Ruoho, A. E. (2005) Bioconjugate Chem. 16, 685-693). This photoprobe was shown to derivatize the single cysteine residues as mixed disulfides at position 94 in the SBDLI region of the wild type guinea pig sigma-1 receptor (Cys94) and at position 190 in the SBDLII region of a mutant guinea pig sigma-1 receptor (C94A,V190C), both in a sigma-ligand (haloperidol or (+)-pentazocine)-sensitive manner. Significantly, photocross-linking followed by Endo Lys-C cleavage under reducing conditions and intramolecular radiolabel transfer from the SBDLI to the SBDLII region in the wild type receptor and, conversely, from the SBDLII to the SBDLI region in the mutant receptor were observed. These data support a model in which the SBDLI and SBDLII regions are juxtaposed to form, at least in part, a ligand binding site of the sigma-1 receptor. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D052061
11076998	20001115	Oxidative damage and induced mutations in m13mp2 phage DNA exposed to N-nitrosopyrrolidine with UVA radiation.	N:-Nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) is carcinogenic in rodents and undergoes alpha-hydroxylation upon microsomal CYP450 metabolism, giving rise to mutations. Previously, we reported the direct mutagenicity of NPYR, under ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation, towards Salmonella typhimurium and phage M13mp2. In the present study, we measured the formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo) in a replicative form of M13mp2 DNA exposed to NPYR plus UVA. Formation of 5-hydroxy-2'-deoxycytidine in calf thymus DNA treated with NPYR plus UVA was also observed. Singlet oxygen is likely to account for the formation of 8-oxodGuo. We analyzed the spectrum of mutations in lacZalpha of M13mp2 phages produced on transfecting Escherichia coli with the replicative form of phage DNA that had been treated with NPYR plus UVA. The role of oxidative DNA damage in mutagenesis was explored using mutM-proficient and -deficient E.coli strains as the hosts. A higher level of mutation was observed with the mutM-deficient host than with the -proficient host. Base substitutions at GC pairs predominated in both mutM-proficient and -deficient hosts. With the mutM-deficient host, we observed an overall increase in the percentage of GC--&gt;TA transversions. In addition we noted that there were fewer GC--&gt;AT transitions than in the mutM-proficient host. With these hosts, different hot spots were observed and a new GC--&gt;TA hot spot was produced. The formation of 8-oxodGuo in DNA, which is known to induce GC--&gt;TA transversion, may contribute to mutagenesis by NPYR plus UVA. 	Mutagenesis	D016428 D013485
26101265	20150624	Identification of phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous mouse mucosal-associated invariant T cells using MR1 tetramers.	Studies on the biology of mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT cells) in mice have been hampered by a lack of specific reagents. Using MR1-antigen (Ag) tetramers that specifically bind to the MR1-restricted MAIT T cell receptors (TCRs), we demonstrate that MAIT cells are detectable in a broad range of tissues in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. These cells include CD4(-)CD8(-), CD4(-)CD8(+), and CD4(+)CD8(-) subsets, and their frequency varies in a tissue- and strain-specific manner. Mouse MAIT cells have a CD44(hi)CD62L(lo) memory phenotype and produce high levels of IL-17A, whereas other cytokines, including IFN-?, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, and GM-CSF, are produced at low to moderate levels. Consistent with high IL-17A production, most MAIT cells express high levels of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor ?t (ROR?t), whereas ROR?t(lo) MAIT cells predominantly express T-bet and produce IFN-?. Most MAIT cells express the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) transcription factor, and their development is largely PLZF dependent. These observations contrast with previous reports that MAIT cells from V?19 TCR transgenic mice are PLZF(-) and express a naive CD44(lo) phenotype. Accordingly, MAIT cells from normal mice more closely resemble human MAIT cells than previously appreciated, and this provides the foundation for further investigations of these cells in health and disease.

26557247	20151112	Exploring the origins of asthma: Lessons from twin studies.	This thesis explores the contribution of twin studies, particularly those studies originating from the Danish Twin Registry, to the understanding of the aetiology of asthma. First, it is explored how twin studies have established the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to the variation in the susceptibility to asthma, and to the variation in several aspects of the clinical expression of the disease such as its age at onset, its symptomatology, its intermediate phenotypes, and its relationship with other atopic diseases. Next, it is explored how twin studies have corroborated theories explaining asthma's recent increase in prevalence, and last, how these fit with the explanations of the epidemiological trends in other common chronic diseases of modernity.

20735825	20100826	Association of genetic polymorphisms in the interleukin-10 promoter with risk of prostate cancer in Chinese.	Recent studies identified an increased risk of prostate cancer (PCa) in Caucasian men harboring polymorphisms of genes involved in innate immunity and inflammation. This study was designed to assess whether single nucleotide polymorphisms in the IL-10 promoter play a role in predisposing individuals to PCa in a Chinese population. We genotyped three SNPs of the IL-10 promoter (-1082A/G, -819T/C and -592A/C) using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 262 subjects with PCa and 270 age-matched healthy controls. Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were determined by logistic regression for the associations between IL-10 genotypes and haplotypes with the risk of PCa and advanced PCa grade. No significant differences in allele frequency or genotype distribution were observed for any of the IL-10 SNPs between PCa patients and control subjects. Significantly higher frequencies of -1082G, -819C and -592C allele and GCC haplotype were observed, however, in early stage patients in comparison to advanced PCa patients (for -1082 G, 13.9% vs 6.1%, OR = 2.48, P = 0.005; for -819 C 40.3% vs 30.8%, OR = 1.51, P = 0.043; for -512C, 40.3% vs 30.8%, OR = 1.51, P = 0.043; and for haplotype GCC 11.1%vs 5.1%, OR = 2.66, P = 0.008, respectively). Our results identify that IL-10 promoter polymorphisms might not be a risk factor for PCa in Chinese cohorts, but rather incidence of polymorphisms associates with PCa grade, suggesting that IL-10 expression may impact PCa progression.

15116307	20040430	Mutations in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase potentially associated with hypersusceptibility to nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors: effect on response to efavirenz-based therapy in an urban observational cohort.	Hypersusceptibility to nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was described in association with reverse-transcriptase (RT) mutations conferring resistance to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). We evaluated the effect of RT mutations associated with hypersusceptibility to NNRTIs on the response to efavirenz-based therapy. We analyzed an observational database of patients for whom highly active antiretroviral therapy failed and who received genotypic resistance testing-guided therapy, either efavirenz or protease inhibitor (PI) based. Study end points were achievement of virus load &lt;80 copies/mL, achievement of virus load &lt;80 copies/mL without rebound to &gt;500 copies/mL, and changes in CD4 cell counts. The baseline RT mutations M41L, M184V, L210W, and T215Y and the M41L/T215Y and M41L/T215Y/M184V combinations were associated with virological suppression for efavirenz-treated patients, whereas, for PI-treated patients, only the M184V mutation was associated with virological suppression, and the L210W mutation showed a negative correlation; no correlation was found between any mutation and virological response without rebound. The M41L, M184V, L210W, and T215Y mutations were associated with a better, although transient, virological outcome in patients treated with efavirenz-based regimens. 	J._Infect._Dis.

1279100	19921101	Identification of viral structural polypeptides of Thogoto virus (a tick-borne orthomyxo-like virus) and functions associated with the glycoprotein.	Thogoto (THO) virus is a tick-borne virus which shares morphological and genetic features with members of the Orthomyxoviridae family although the viral glycoprotein appears to be related to gp64 of baculoviruses. Characterization of THO virus was undertaken to clarify its taxonomic position. Purified virus preparations contained at least six virus-encoded polypeptides with apparent M(r) values ranging from 29K to 92K. A 75K polypeptide was identified as an envelope-associated glycoprotein by Triton X-100 and salt dissociation studies, and by proteolytic degradation of the exposed proteins of the virion. By the same criteria, the nucleoprotein and the matrix protein were identified as the 52K and 29K polypeptides, respectively. Immunofluorescence studies using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) located the glycoprotein on the external cell membrane and the nucleoprotein in the nucleus of infected cells indicating that virus replication involved a nuclear phase. In addition, the virus displayed haemagglutination and haemolytic activities with an optimum at pH 6. These activities are functions of the viral glycoprotein since they were inhibited by anti-glycoprotein MAbs. The data reported here support the notion that THO virus is a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family but that it should be classified in a group distinct from the other influenza viruses.

23061724	20121016	High prevalence of the c.74A&gt;C SPINK1 variant in miniature and standard Schnauzers.	Variants in the serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1) gene have been associated with pancreatitis in Miniature Schnauzers. Replication of the association in an independent population is necessary to determine if genetic screening for SPINK1 variants should be considered in clinical practice. An association between the SPINK1 exonic variant c.74A &gt; C and pancreatitis exists in Miniature Schnauzers. In addition, the variant is absent or rare in Standard Schnauzers, a related breed that is not reported to have an increased risk for pancreatitis. Case-control study. Seventeen Miniature Schnauzers with pancreatitis (cases), 60 mature Miniature Schnauzers with no substantial history of gastrointestinal signs in their lifetime (controls), and 31 Standard Schnauzers of unknown pancreatitis status. A PCR-RFLP assay was used to genotype dogs for the c.74A &gt; C SPINK1 variant. Allele and genotype frequencies were reported for Schnauzers and compared between case and control Miniature Schnauzers. The c.74A &gt; C variant was the major allele in both Schnauzer breeds with a frequency of 0.77 in Miniatures and 0.55 in Standards. The allele and genotype frequencies were similar between Miniature Schnauzers with and without a history of pancreatitis and did not impart an increased risk for pancreatitis. Genotyping a larger population of the Miniature Schnauzer breed than a previous study, along with a Standard Schnauzer cohort, demonstrated that the SPINK1 c.74A &gt; C variant is a common polymorphism in the Schnauzer lineage. Furthermore, we were unable to confirm a relationship between the variant and clinically detectable pancreatitis in Miniature Schnauzers. 	J._Vet._Intern._Med.	D016428
26894955	20160220	Registered report: Diverse somatic mutation patterns and pathway alterations in human cancers.	The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology seeks to address growing concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology. The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and Altmetric scores (Errington et al., 2014). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from &quot;Diverse somatic mutation patterns and pathway alterations in human cancers&quot; by Kan and colleagues published in Nature in 2010 (Kan et al., 2010). The experiments to be replicated are those reported in Figures 3D-F and 4C-F. Kan and colleagues utilized mismatch repair detection (MRD) technology to identify somatic mutations in primary human tumor samples and identified a previously uncharacterized arginine 243 to histidine (R243H) mutation in the G-protein ? subunit GNAO1 in breast carcinoma tissue. In Figures 3D-F, Kan and colleagues demonstrated that stable expression of mutant GNAO1(R243D) conferred a significant growth advantage in human mammary epithelial cells, confirming the oncogenic potential of this mutation. Similarly, expression of variants with somatic mutations in MAP2K4, a JNK pathway kinase (shown in Figures 4C-E) resulted in a significant increase in anchorage-independent growth. Interestingly, these mutants exhibited reduced kinase activity compared to wild type MAP2K4, indicating these mutations impose a dominant-negative influence to promote growth (Figure 4F). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange and the results of the replications will be published in eLife.

17980738	20071106	Oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis in a patient with a TTR Val30Gly mutation in the transthyretin gene.	To describe a patient with oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis associated with infiltration of the vitreous, elevated intraocular pressures (IOPs), and seizures caused by a TTR Val30Gly mutation in the transthyretin gene. Interventional clinicopathologic report. A 44-year-old man with refractory bilateral intermediate uveitis, elevated IOPs, and seizures. The patient underwent diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy in both eyes. Intraocular and intracerebral pressures were controlled by trabeculectomy and cerebroventricular shunt placement, respectively. Visual acuity, histopathologic analysis of vitreous and leptomeningeal tissue, genetic testing, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. After failure of the patient to respond to topical and periocular corticosteroid therapy, a pars plana vitrectomy was performed and revealed amorphous material that showed green birefringence and dichroism on Congo red staining, establishing the diagnosis of vitreous amyloidosis. A full medical workup, including genetic testing, revealed a TTR Val30Gly mutation in the transthyretin gene. The patient subsequently developed elevated IOPs requiring bilateral trabeculectomy surgery and episodic seizures associated with leptomeningeal enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging. Histopathological analysis of a leptomeningeal biopsy taken at the time of surgery revealed amyloid infiltration, confirming the diagnosis of oculoleptomeningeal involvement by his amyloidosis. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Amyloidosis should be considered in patients who present with vitritis that is unresponsive to corticosteroid therapy. Vitreous biopsy with histopathological analysis is recommended in these cases. Additionally, sequencing of the transthyretin gene should be considered in patients with vitreous amyloidosis to help establish known genetic syndromes and predict both ocular and systemic comorbidities. Although not described previously, elevated IOP may develop in patients with vitreous amyloidosis due to a TTR Val30Gly mutation in the transthyretin gene. 	Ophthalmology	D002363 D016428
27373592	20160705	Light-melt adhesive based on dynamic carbon frameworks in a columnar liquid-crystal phase.	Liquid crystal (LC) provides a suitable platform to exploit structural motions of molecules in a condensed phase. Amplification of the structural changes enables a variety of technologies not only in LC displays but also in other applications. Until very recently, however, a practical use of LCs for removable adhesives has not been explored, although a spontaneous disorganization of LC materials can be easily triggered by light-induced isomerization of photoactive components. The difficulty of such application derives from the requirements for simultaneous implementation of sufficient bonding strength and its rapid disappearance by photoirradiation. Here we report a dynamic molecular LC material that meets these requirements. Columnar-stacked V-shaped carbon frameworks display sufficient bonding strength even during heating conditions, while its bonding ability is immediately lost by a light-induced self-melting function. The light-melt adhesive is reusable and its fluorescence colour reversibly changes during the cycle, visualizing the bonding/nonbonding phases of the adhesive. 	Nat_Commun	D016428
23300178	20130110	JAK2 p.V617F allele burden in myeloproliferative neoplasms one month after allogeneic stem cell transplantation significantly predicts outcome and risk of relapse.	The risk profile and prognosis of patients with myelofibrosis is well described by the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System risk categorization. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is considered for intermediate-2/high risk disease. However, indicators of prognosis after transplantation are still lacking. Seventy simultaneously collected pairs of trephine and blood samples were quantified for JAK2 p.V617F allele burden to compare test sensitivity. The course of 30 patients with JAK2 p.V617F-positive myeloproliferative neoplasia was correlated with allele burden after transplantation. Monitoring can be performed on full blood samples as well as trephine biopsies, provided that techniques with ample sensitivity (0.01% to 0.001%) are available. Measurement of allele burden on day 28 after transplantation discriminates two prognostic groups: patients with a JAK2 p.V617F allele burden &gt;1% have a significantly higher risk of relapse of JAK2 p.V617F positive neoplasia (P=0.04) and a poorer overall survival (P&lt;0.01). In conclusion, measurement of JAK2 p.V617F allele burden early after transplantation is an important predictive parameter in monitoring patients following this treatment. As this might provide an important tool in early management of imminent early relapse it will be important to define consensus guidelines for optimal monitoring. 	Haematologica	D016428
24560990	20140225	Effects of SNP variants in the 17?-HSD2 and 17?-HSD7 genes and 17?-HSD7 copy number on gene transcript and estradiol levels in breast cancer tissue.	Breast cancers reveal elevated E2 levels compared to plasma and normal breast tissue. Previously, we reported intra-tumour E2 to be negatively correlated to transcription levels of 17?-HSD2 but positively correlated to 17?-HSD7. Here, we explored these mechanisms further by analysing the same breast tumours for 17?-HSD2 and -7 SNPs, as well as 17?-HSD7 gene copy number. Among the SNPs detected, we found the 17?-HSD2 rs4445895_T allele to be associated with lower intra-tumour mRNA (p=0.039) and an elevated intra-tumour E2 level (p=0.006). In contrast, we found the 17?-HSD7 rs1704754_C allele to be associated with elevated mRNA (p=0.050) but not to E2 levels in breast tumour tissue. Surprisingly, 17?-HSD7 - gene copy number was elevated in 19 out of 46 breast tumours examined. Elevated copy number was associated with an increased mRNA expression level (p=0.013) and elevated tumour E2 (p=0.025). Interestingly, elevated 17?-HSD7 - gene copy number was associated with increased expression not only of 17?-HSD7, but the 17?-HSD7_II pseudogene as well (p=0.019). Expression level of 17?-HSD7 and its pseudogene was significantly correlated both in tumour tissue (rs=0.457, p=0.001) and in normal tissue (rs=0.453, p=0.002). While in vitro transfection experiments revealed no direct impact of 17?-HSD7 expression on pseudogene level, the fact that 17?-HSD7 and 17?-HSD7_II share a 95.6% sequence identity suggests the two transcripts may be subject to common regulatory mechanisms. In conclusion, genetic variants of 17?-HSD2 and 17?-HSD7 may affect intra-tumour gene expression as well as breast cancer E2 levels in postmenopausal women. 	J._Steroid_Biochem._Mol._Biol.	D016428
25275492	20141003	Molecular pathology of rare bleeding disorders (RBDs) in India: a systematic review.	Though rare in occurrence, patients with rare bleeding disorders (RBDs) are highly heterogeneous and may manifest with severe bleeding diathesis. Due to the high rate of consanguinity in many caste groups, these autosomal recessive bleeding disorders which are of rare occurrence in populations across the world, may not be as rare in India. To comprehensively analyze the frequency and nature of mutations in Indian patients with RBDs. Pubmed search was used (www.pubmed.com) to explore the published literature from India on RBDs using the key words &quot;rare bleeding disorders&quot;, &quot;mutations&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;fibrinogen&quot;, &quot;afibrinogenemia&quot;, &quot;factor II deficiency&quot;, &quot;prothrombin&quot; &quot;factor VII deficiency&quot;, &quot;factor V deficiency&quot;, &quot;factor X deficiency&quot;, &quot;factor XI deficiency&quot;, &quot;combined factor V and VIII deficiency&quot;, &quot;factor XIII deficiency&quot;, &quot;Bernard Soulier syndrome&quot; and &quot;Glanzmanns thrombasthenia&quot; in different combinations. A total of 60 relevant articles could be retrieved. The distribution of mutations from India was compared with that of the world literature by referring to the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) (www.hgmd.org). Taken together, 181 mutations in 270 patients with different RBDs have been reported from India. Though the types of mutations reported from India and their percentage distribution with respect to the world data are largely similar, yet much higher percentage of small deletions, duplication mutations, insertions, indels were observed in this analysis. Besides the identification of novel mutations and polymorphisms, several common mutations have also been reported, which will allow to develop a strategy for mutation screening in Indian patients with RBDs. There is a need for a consortium of Institutions working on the molecular pathology of RBDs in India. This will facilitate a quicker and cheaper diagnosis of RBDs besides its utility in first trimester prenatal diagnosis of the affected families. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D017418 D013485 D016454
26135134	20150703	Insights into the Functional Roles of N-Terminal and C-Terminal Domains of Helicobacter pylori DprA.	DNA processing protein A (DprA) plays a crucial role in the process of natural transformation. This is accomplished through binding and subsequent protection of incoming foreign DNA during the process of internalization. DprA along with Single stranded DNA binding protein A (SsbA) acts as an accessory factor for RecA mediated DNA strand exchange. H. pylori DprA (HpDprA) is divided into an N-terminal domain and a C- terminal domain. In the present study, individual domains of HpDprA have been characterized for their ability to bind single stranded (ssDNA) and double stranded DNA (dsDNA). Oligomeric studies revealed that HpDprA possesses two sites for dimerization which enables HpDprA to form large and tightly packed complexes with ss and dsDNA. While the N-terminal domain was found to be sufficient for binding with ss or ds DNA, C-terminal domain has an important role in the assembly of poly-nucleoprotein complex. Using site directed mutagenesis approach, we show that a pocket comprising positively charged amino acids in the N-terminal domain has an important role in the binding of ss and dsDNA. Together, a functional cross talk between the two domains of HpDprA facilitating the binding and formation of higher order complex with DNA is discussed. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485

15060750	20040403	Two novel factor X gene mutations in a Chinese family with factor X deficiency.	We report a factor X (FX)-deficient Chinese family with two novel FX gene (F10) mutations. Two sibling probands had a bleeding tendency since childhood. Both had very low FX:C (&lt;0.01 IU/ml) and FX:Ag (5-6%) levels and were heterozygous for two novel F10 mutations, a 2-bp GC deletion involving nucleotides 33 and 34, leading to premature chain termination at residue 45, and a T237--&gt;C mutation, leading to Phe71--&gt;Ser. A family study confirmed that the mother had the 2-bp GC deletion and a type I FX deficiency. The father had the Phe71--&gt;Ser mutation. Interestingly, a type I FX deficiency was also observed, suggesting that Phe71--&gt;Ser, occurring at a site sandwiched between two Gla residues, might perturb FX protein stability. 	Ann._Hematol.

12623935	20030308	Association of coronary artery disease with glucocorticoid receptor N363S variant.	Overweight is associated with the N363S variant in the glucocorticoid receptor (encoded by nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1 gene: NR3C1). The present study examined whether the N363S polymorphism might also be associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). This involved 556 patients with CAD, of which 437 were analyzed, and 302 control subjects, all being of Anglo-Celtic descent residing in Sydney. An extensive range of phenotypic parameters was collected from the patients, and leukocyte DNA from all subjects was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis for the A1218G (N363S) variant. Frequency of the S363 allele was 0.04 in healthy normal-weight control subjects but was 0.15 in patients with CAD (P=2.0x10(-5)) and was also elevated in subjects with CAD who were not overweight (0.14) (P=2.6x10(-5)), supporting a primary association with CAD. Frequency of S363 allele carriers in subjects with CAD who had angina was particularly high: unstable angina (0.45), stable angina (0.29), and no angina (0.26) (P for trend=0.016). Elevated cholesterol (P=0.027), triglycerides (P=0.005), and total cholesterol/HDL ratio (P=0.011), after Bonferroni, tracked with the S363 allele, consistent with accentuation of mechanisms that predispose to atheroma formation in coronary vessels. The data suggest a role for glucocorticoid receptor variation in the underlying cause of CAD. 	Hypertension	D016428 D013485
26365242	20150915	The reverse transcription signature of N-1-methyladenosine in RNA-Seq is sequence dependent.	The combination of Reverse Transcription (RT) and high-throughput sequencing has emerged as a powerful combination to detect modified nucleotides in RNA via analysis of either abortive RT-products or of the incorporation of mismatched dNTPs into cDNA. Here we simultaneously analyze both parameters in detail with respect to the occurrence of N-1-methyladenosine (m(1)A) in the template RNA. This naturally occurring modification is associated with structural effects, but it is also known as a mediator of antibiotic resistance in ribosomal RNA. In structural probing experiments with dimethylsulfate, m(1)A is routinely detected by RT-arrest. A specifically developed RNA-Seq protocol was tailored to the simultaneous analysis of RT-arrest and misincorporation patterns. By application to a variety of native and synthetic RNA preparations, we found a characteristic signature of m(1)A, which, in addition to an arrest rate, features misincorporation as a significant component. Detailed analysis suggests that the signature depends on RNA structure and on the nature of the nucleotide 3' of m(1)A in the template RNA, meaning it is sequence dependent. The RT-signature of m(1)A was used for inspection and confirmation of suspected modification sites and resulted in the identification of hitherto unknown m(1)A residues in trypanosomal tRNA.

22470333	20120404	The hippocampus and inferential reasoning: building memories to navigate future decisions.	A critical aspect of inferential reasoning is the ability to form relationships between items or events that were not experienced together. This review considers different perspectives on the role of the hippocampus in successful inferential reasoning during both memory encoding and retrieval. Intuitively, inference can be thought of as a logical process by which elements of individual existing memories are retrieved and recombined to answer novel questions. Such flexible retrieval is sub-served by the hippocampus and is thought to require specialized hippocampal encoding mechanisms that discretely code events such that event elements are individually accessible from memory. In addition to retrieval-based inference, recent research has also focused on hippocampal processes that support the combination of information acquired across multiple experiences during encoding. This mechanism suggests that by recalling past events during new experiences, connections can be created between newly formed and existing memories. Such hippocampally mediated memory integration would thus underlie the formation of networks of related memories that extend beyond direct experience to anticipate future judgments about the relationships between items and events. We also discuss integrative encoding in the context of emerging evidence linking the hippocampus to the formation of schemas as well as prospective theories of hippocampal function that suggest memories are actively constructed to anticipate future decisions and actions.

27399000	20160712	A calcium-dependent acyltransferase that produces N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines.	More than 30 years ago, a calcium-dependent enzyme activity was described that generates N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs), which are precursors for N-acyl ethanolamine (NAE) lipid transmitters, including the endocannabinoid anandamide. The identity of this calcium-dependent N-acyltransferase (Ca-NAT) has remained mysterious. Here, we use activity-based protein profiling to identify the poorly characterized serine hydrolase PLA2G4E as a mouse brain Ca-NAT and show that this enzyme generates NAPEs and NAEs in mammalian cells.

18466903	20080510	Abcg5/8 independent biliary cholesterol excretion in Atp8b1-deficient mice.	ATP8B1 is a phosphatidylserine flippase in the canalicular membrane; patients with mutations in ATP8B1 develop severe chronic (PFIC1) or periodic (BRIC1) cholestatic liver disease. We have observed that Atp8b1 deficiency leads to enhanced biliary cholesterol excretion. It has been established that biliary cholesterol excretion depends on transport by the heterodimer Abcg5/Abcg8. We hypothesized that the increased cholesterol output was due to enhanced extraction from the altered canalicular membrane rather than to higher Abcg5/Abcg8 activity. We therefore studied the relation between Abcg5/Abcg8 expression and biliary cholesterol excretion in mice lacking Atp8b1, Abcg8, or both (GF mice). Bile formation was studied in LXR agonist-fed wild-type mice as well as mice lacking Atp8b1 or Abcg8, or in GF mice upon infusion of taurocholate. Bile samples were analyzed for cholesterol, bile salt, phospholipids, and ectoenzyme content. LXR agonist increased Abcg5/8 expression, and this was accompanied by increased biliary cholesterol output in both wild-type and Atp8b1(G308V/G308V) mice. However, Atp8b1(G308V/G308V) mice maintained higher cholesterol output. Although in Abcg8(-/-) mice biliary cholesterol output was severely reduced, GF mice displayed high biliary cholesterol output, which was comparable with wild-type mice. Bile of both Atp8b1(G308V/G308V) and GF mice displayed elevated levels of phosphatidylserine and sphingomyelin, indicating membrane stress. Our data demonstrate that the increased biliary cholesterol excretion in Atp8b1-deficient mice is independent of Abcg5/8 activity. This implicates that Atp8b1 deficiency leads to a decrease in the detergent resistance and subsequent nonspecific extraction of cholesterol from the canalicular membrane by bile salts.

25214962	20140913	TRAF6 polymorphisms not associated with the susceptibility to and severity of sepsis in a Chinese population.	The tumor necrosis factor recepter associated factor (TRAF) 6 is an important intracellular adapter protein that plays a pivotal role in activating multiple inflammatory and immune related processes induced by cytokines. TRAF6 represents a strong candidate susceptibility factor for sepsis. We investigated whether polymorphisms at the TRAF6 gene are associated with the susceptibility to and severity of sepsis. A hospital-based case-control study was conducted with 255 patients with sepsis and 260 controls who were recruited from Zhengzhou, China. Haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) were selected from the HapMap database and genotyped using the SNPstream genotyping platform. The associations with the susceptibility and disease severity of sepsis were estimated by logistic regression, and adjusted for age, sex, smoking, drinking, chronic diseases status, APACHEII score and critical illness status. A total of 13 TRAF6 SNPs were tagged by 7 htSNPs. Five htSNPs (rs5030490, rs5030411, rs5030416, rs5030445 and rs3740961) were genotyped in the case control study. Genotype frequencies of the htSNPs were conformed to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both patients and controls. No significant association was found between the 5 htSNPs and the susceptibility to and severity of sepsis. Compared with the main haplotype -11120A/-10688T/-9423A/805G/12967G, no certain haplotype was associated with the significantly susceptibility to or severity of sepsis. TRAF6 gene polymorphisms might not play a major role in mediating the susceptibility to and severity of sepsis in the Chinese population. A larger population-based case-control study is warranted.

9375849	19970101	Glucocerebrosidase genotype of Gaucher patients in The Netherlands: limitations in prognostic value.	Gaucher disease is a recessively inherited lysosomal storage disorder that is caused by a deficiency in glucocerebrosidase activity. The clinical expression is markedly heterogeneous with respect to age of onset, progression, severity, and neurological involvement. The relative incidence of glucocerebrosidase (GC) mutations has been studied extensively for Jewish but not for non-Jewish Caucasian patient populations. The present survey on mutant GC genotypes prevalent in Gaucher disease in The Netherlands was taken of 72 patients from different genetic backgrounds. This number is more than half the total number of affected Gaucher patients to be expected on the basis of the incidence of the disorder in this country. Analysis of nine GC mutations led to the identification of 74% of the mutant GC alleles in patients from 44 unrelated Dutch families (i.e., families that have lived in The Netherlands for at least several generations) and of 44% of the mutant GC alleles in patients from nine unrelated families that recently immigrated from both European and non-European countries. The N370S (cDNA 1226G) GC mutation proved to occur most frequently (41%) in the unrelated Dutch patients and less frequently (6%) in the unrelated immigrant patients and was always associated with the nonneuronopathic (Type 1) form of the disease. Apart from the association of the N370S mutation with Type 1 Gaucher disease, the prognostic value of GC genotyping was limited, since a particular GC genotype did not correlate closely to a specific clinical course, or to a specific relative responsiveness to enzyme-supplementation therapy.

22132121	20111202	Hypochlorous acid-induced heme degradation from lactoperoxidase as a novel mechanism of free iron release and tissue injury in inflammatory diseases.	Lactoperoxidase (LPO) is the major consumer of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in the airways through its ability to oxidize thiocyanate (SCN(-)) to produce hypothiocyanous acid, an antimicrobial agent. In nasal inflammatory diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, both LPO and myeloperoxidase (MPO), another mammalian peroxidase secreted by neutrophils, are known to co-localize. The aim of this study was to assess the interaction of LPO and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), the final product of MPO. Our rapid kinetic measurements revealed that HOCl binds rapidly and reversibly to LPO-Fe(III) to form the LPO-Fe(III)-OCl complex, which in turn decayed irreversibly to LPO Compound II through the formation of Compound I. The decay rate constant of Compound II decreased with increasing HOCl concentration with an inflection point at 100 ?M HOCl, after which the decay rate increased. This point of inflection is the critical concentration of HOCl beyond which HOCl switches its role, from mediating destabilization of LPO Compound II to LPO heme destruction. Lactoperoxidase heme destruction was associated with protein aggregation, free iron release, and formation of a number of fluorescent heme degradation products. Similar results were obtained when LPO-Fe(II)-O(2), Compound III, was exposed to HOCl. Heme destruction can be partially or completely prevented in the presence of SCN(-). On the basis of the present results we concluded that a complex bi-directional relationship exists between LPO activity and HOCl levels at sites of inflammation; LPO serve as a catalytic sink for HOCl, while HOCl serves to modulate LPO catalytic activity, bioavailability, and function.

7947779	19941122	A mutant rhodopsin photoproduct with a protonated Schiff base displays an active-state conformation: a Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy study.	In the rhodopsin mutant E113A/A117E the position of the protonated Schiff base counterion, Glu113, is moved by one helix turn from position 113 to 117. The photoreaction of this mutant pigment was studied by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy. At acidic pH, formation of a 474-nm absorbing photoproduct previously characterized biochemically as a species that activates transducin caused infrared absorption changes typical of metarhodopsin II (MII) formation in native rhodopsin. Specific spectral alterations revealed a localized perturbation near the protonated Schiff base in the dark state. In addition, an infrared band assigned to the C = O stretching vibration of Glu113 in MII of rhodopsin was abolished in the mutant. Absorption changes caused by Asp83 and Glu122 C = O stretching vibrations characteristic of rhodopsin MII formation were not affected. At alkaline pH, mutant E113A/A117E formed predominantly a 382-nm absorbing photoproduct. It displayed infrared-difference absorption bands significantly different from those of native MII over a large spectral range. These results support the conclusion that the 474-nm photoproduct of mutant E113A/A117E, despite a protonated Schiff base linkage, displays a predominantly MII-like conformation capable of catalyzing guanine-nucleotide exchange by transducin.

26317416	20150829	14-3-3 Proteins Buffer Intracellular Calcium Sensing Receptors to Constrain Signaling.	Calcium sensing receptors (CaSR) interact with 14-3-3 binding proteins at a carboxyl terminal arginine-rich motif. Mutations identified in patients with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, autosomal dominant hypocalcemia, pancreatitis or idiopathic epilepsy support the functional importance of this motif. We combined total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and biochemical approaches to determine the mechanism of 14-3-3 protein regulation of CaSR signaling. Loss of 14-3-3 binding caused increased basal CaSR signaling and plasma membrane levels, and a significantly larger signaling-evoked increase in plasma membrane receptors. Block of core glycosylation with tunicamycin demonstrated that changes in plasma membrane CaSR levels were due to differences in exocytic rate. Western blotting to quantify time-dependent changes in maturation of expressed wt CaSR and a 14-3-3 protein binding-defective mutant demonstrated that signaling increases synthesis to maintain constant levels of the immaturely and maturely glycosylated forms. CaSR thus operates by a feed-forward mechanism, whereby signaling not only induces anterograde trafficking of nascent receptors but also increases biosynthesis to maintain steady state levels of net cellular CaSR. Overall, these studies suggest that 14-3-3 binding at the carboxyl terminus provides an important buffering mechanism to increase the intracellular pool of CaSR available for signaling-evoked trafficking, but attenuates trafficking to control the dynamic range of responses to extracellular calcium.

19400965	20090430	Regulation of chk1.	Chk1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is the effector of the G2 DNA damage checkpoint. Chk1 homologs have a highly conserved N-terminal kinase domain, and a less conserved C-terminal regulatory domain of ~200 residues. In response to a variety of genomic lesions, a number of proteins collaborate to activate Chk1, which in turn ensures that the mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc2 remains in an inactive state until DNA repair is completed. Chk1 activation requires the phosphorylation of residues in the C-terminal domain, and this is catalyzed by the ATR protein kinase. How phosphorylation of the C-terminal regulatory domain activates the N-terminal kinase domain has not been elucidated, though some studies have suggested that this phosphorylation relieves an inhibitory intramolecular interaction between the N- and C-termini. However, recent studies in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe have revealed that there is more to Chk1 regulation than this auto-inhibition model, and we review these findings and their implication to the biology of this genome integrity determinant.

25033189	20140718	Research on a power management system for thermoelectric generators to drive wireless sensors on a spindle unit.	Thermoelectric energy harvesting is emerging as a promising alternative energy source to drive wireless sensors in mechanical systems. Typically, the waste heat from spindle units in machine tools creates potential for thermoelectric generation. However, the problem of low and fluctuant ambient temperature differences in spindle units limits the application of thermoelectric generation to drive a wireless sensor. This study is devoted to presenting a transformer-based power management system and its associated control strategy to make the wireless sensor work stably at different speeds of the spindle. The charging/discharging time of capacitors is optimized through this energy-harvesting strategy. A rotating spindle platform is set up to test the performance of the power management system at different speeds. The experimental results show that a longer sampling cycle time will increase the stability of the wireless sensor. The experiments also prove that utilizing the optimal time can make the power management system work more effectively compared with other systems using the same sample cycle.

27054015	20160408	Hearing Profile in Patients with Dilated and Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathies.	Cardiomyopathy may cause disruptions in the micro-vascular system of the stria vascularis in the cochlea, and, subsequently, may result in cochlear degeneration. Degeneration in the stria vascularis affects the physical and chemical processes in the organ of Corti, thereby causing a possible hearing impairment. The objective of this study was to assess the hearing profiles of patients with dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies to determine the relationship between the degree of hearing loss and the degree and duration of the disease and to compare the dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies as regards hearing profile. In this case control study, we studied 21 patients (cases/study group/group 1) and 15 healthy individuals (controls/group 2). Six patients (group 1a) had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and 15 patients (group 1b) had dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The data were analyzed using the t-test, chi-squared test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and the Multiple Mann-Whitney test. The results of this study showed that 80% of those patients with DCM (group 1b) had bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), and 100% of the patients with HCM (group 1a) had mild to severe bilateral sloping SNHL. Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAEs) were present in 14% of the study group and in 100 % of the control group. The results of the measurements of auditory brainstem response (ABR) showed that 50% of the study group had abnormal latencies compared to the control group, and there was no correlation between the duration of the disease and the degree of hearing loss or DPOAE. Fifty percent of the patients with HCM and 35% of the patients with DCM had positive family histories of similar conditions, and 35% of those with HCM had a positive family history of sudden death. The results of this study suggested that the link between heart disease and hearing loss and early identification of hearing loss in patients with cardiomyopathy may reduce morbidity since hearing deficits sometimes precede heart disease.

10199335	19990413	TNFA and TNFB polymorphisms in myasthenia gravis.	Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and TNF-beta are proinflammatory cytokines thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis (MG). To examine whether TNF polymorphisms are associated with MG, MG subgroups, and the presence of titin and ryanodine-receptor antibodies. We did genotyping on 30 patients with MG and 92 healthy blood donors for 2 biallelic TNFA polymorphisms (G to A at positions -238 and -308) and 1 TNFB polymorphism (NcoI digestive site) using methods based on the polymerase chain reaction. Patients with thymoma were typically homozygous for both the TNFA*T1 and the TNFB*2 alleles, but patients having an early onset of MG without thymoma were carriers of the TNFA*T2 and TNFB*1 alleles. Patients without thymoma who had the titin antibody had the same high frequency of TNFA*T1 and TNFB*2 as patients with thymoma, whereas patients without the titin antibody carried the same allele, TNFA*T2 and TNFB*1, regardless of age and thymic disease. No association was found with acetylcholine-receptor levels or disease severity for any of the TNFA or TNFB polymorphisms. Patients having MG, including those with thymoma, who have the titin antibody are most often homozygous for the TNFA*T1 and TNFB*2 alleles, whereas the presence of the TNFA*T2 and TNFB*1 alleles correlates with early-onset MG and the absence of titin antibodies.

8998887	19960401	Hydroxyapatite coated external fixation pins: an experimental study.	A sheep model was developed for the implantation of 84 bicylindrical stainless steel external fixation pins. One-half of the pins were coated with hydroxyapatite, and the rest remained uncoated. A set of 6 pins with the same coating was implanted in the lateral side of the left tibias of 14 sheep, the final insertion torque was measured, and a monolateral external fixator was assembled on the pins. The medial tibial middiaphysis then was exposed and a 5-mm resection osteotomy was done. Sheep were euthanized 6 weeks after surgery, radiographs were taken, and the initial extraction torque was measured on 4 pins from each sheep. Undecalcified sectioning and histologic and histomorphometric analyses were done on the remaining 2 pins. Radiographic pin tract rarefaction was significantly lower in the hydroxyapatite coated pins compared with the uncoated pins. Group average insertion torque was 960 +/- 959 Nmm in the hydroxyapatite coated pins and 709 +/- 585 Nmm in the uncoated pins. Group average initial extraction torque was 1485 +/- 1308 Nmm and 298 +/- 373 Nmm, respectively. Bone pin contact was 85.7% +/- 8.9% and 50.3% +/- 20.4%, respectively, in hydroxyapatite coated and uncoated pins. Bone between the threads was 95.6% +/- 5.7% and 80% +/- 8.7%, respectively, in hydroxyapatite coated and uncoated pins. Hydroxyapatite coating was effective for improving the bone-to-pin interface.

23527203	20130326	NUCLEAR FACTOR Y transcription factors have both opposing and additive roles in ABA-mediated seed germination.	In the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana the heterotrimeric transcription factor NUCLEAR FACTOR Y (NF-Y) has been shown to play multiple roles in facilitating plant growth and development. Although NF-Y itself represents a multi-protein transcriptional complex, recent studies have shown important interactions with other transcription factors, especially those in the bZIP family. Here we add to the growing evidence that NF-Y and bZIP form common complexes to affect many processes. We carried out transcriptional profiling on nf-yc mutants and through subsequent analyses found an enrichment of bZIP binding sites in the promoter elements of misregulated genes. Using NF-Y as bait, yeast two hybrid assays yielded interactions with bZIP proteins that are known to control ABA signaling. Accordingly, we find that plants mutant for several NF-Y subunits show characteristic phenotypes associated with the disruption of ABA signaling. While previous reports have shown additive roles for NF-YC family members in photoperiodic flowering, we found that they can have opposing roles in ABA signaling. Collectively, these results demonstrated the importance and complexity of NF-Y in the integration of environmental and hormone signals. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485 D013486

23431283	20130223	Therapeutic implications of targeting energy metabolism in breast cancer.	PPARs are ligand activated transcription factors. PPAR? agonists have been reported as a new and potentially efficacious treatment of inflammation, diabetes, obesity, cancer, AD, and schizophrenia. Since cancer cells show dysregulation of glycolysis they are potentially manageable through changes in metabolic environment. Interestingly, several of the genes involved in maintaining the metabolic environment and the central energy generation pathway are regulated or predicted to be regulated by PPAR?. The use of synthetic PPAR? ligands as drugs and their recent withdrawal/restricted usage highlight the lack of understanding of the molecular basis of these drugs, their off-target effects, and their network. These data further underscores the complexity of nuclear receptor signalling mechanisms. This paper will discuss the function and role of PPAR? in energy metabolism and cancer biology in general and its emergence as a promising therapeutic target in breast cancer. 	PPAR_Res	D016428
16804655	20060629	Piperacillin/tazobactam vs imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia--a double blind prospective multicentre study.	Piperacillin/tazobactam (P/T) with its broad spectrum of antibacterial activity is used widely for the treatment of moderate to severe polymicrobial nosocomial infections. The efficacy and safety of P/T was compared with imipenem/cilastatin (I/C) in patients with established nosocomial pneumonia. This multicentre study took place from January 1999 to December 2001. Due to difficulties in recruiting sufficient patients it was terminated prematurely. In all, 221 patients were randomly assigned to either P/T at 4 g/0.5 g (n = 110) or I/C at 1 g/1 g (n = 111). Additional aminoglycoside therapy was mandatory if Pseudomonas aeruginosa was present. The ITT population (107 P/T and 110 I/C patients) was used for the analysis of efficacy. The clinical efficacy was equally good for the P/T and I/C groups; 71% [95% CI 61.3, 79.2] vs 77.3% [95% CI 68.1, 84.5] at the end of therapy, 66.4% [95% CI 56.5, 75] vs 70% [95% CI 60.4, 78.2] on day 3, a nd 59.8% [95% CI 49.9, 69] vs 66.4% [95% CI 56.6, 74.9] on day 14 after therapy, respectively. Proven or assumed bacterial eradication at the end of therapy was 45.8% (P/T) and 52.7% (I/C). Treatment-related adverse events (AE) were recorded in 30% of P/T patients and 25.2% I/C patients. There were ten serious treatment-related AEs in the P/T group and five in the I/C group. Although numbers were inadequate for full statistical evaluation, P/T and I/C were similarly effective in the treatment of severe nosocomially acquired pneumonia. 	Infection	D016428 D016448 D016449
20837404	20100915	Genetic variation in DNA repair pathway genes and melanoma risk.	Reduced DNA repair capacity has been proposed as a predisposing factor for melanoma. We comprehensively evaluated 1463 genetic variants across 60 DNA repair-related pathway genes in relation to melanoma risk in a nested case-control study of 218 melanoma cases (20% on head and neck) and 218 matched controls within the Nurses' Health Study (NHS). We then genotyped the two variants with the smallest P value in two replication sets: 184 melanoma cases (28% on head and neck) and 184 matched controls in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS); and 183 melanoma cases (10% on head and neck) and 183 matched controls in the NHS. The SNP rs3219125 in the PARP1 gene was significantly associated with melanoma risk in the discovery set (odds ratio (OR) 3.14; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.70-5.80) and in the HPFS replication set (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.05-3.54) but not in the NHS replication set (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.58-1.97). In the joint analysis, the OR was 1.89 (95% CI, 1.34-2.68) for this polymorphism, and this increased risk was more pronounced among patients with lesions in head/neck (OR, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.77-5.73 for head/neck, and OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.03-2.30 for other sites, P value for heterogeneity test=0.036). Our findings suggest the possible involvement of the PARP1 variant in melanoma development, especially for sites with high sun exposure. Further work on fine-mapping and on the functional characterization of this and linked SNPs in this region is required. 	DNA_Repair_(Amst.)	D016428 D052061
23483386	20130314	Lineage tracing of hair follicle stem cells in epidermal whole mounts.	Lineage tracing of tissue stem cells represents a powerful tool to address fundamental questions of deve-lopment, differentiation and cellular renewal in a natural tissue environment. The Cre/lox site-specific recombination system is increasingly used to genetically label specific cell populations to perform cell lineage tracing or fate mapping experiments in sophisticated mouse models. Here we describe a method of labeling and subsequent tracking stem cells of the hair follicle bulge region in mouse skin. Hair follicle stem cells are specifically labeled by expressing the Cre recombinase under control of keratin15 (K15) regulatory sequences and by crossing the Cre-containing animals with Cre-sensitive Rosa26R (R26R) reporter mice. To achieve a temporal control of recombinase activity in stem cells, Cre is fused to a modified estrogen receptor (CreER(G)T2). In the K15CreER(G)T2/R26R mouse model, hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) are specifically labeled after Cre activation upon treatment of mice with tamoxifen. By analyzing the skin tissue at different time points following genetic labeling, important information on stem cell behavior and contribution of labeled stem cells to epidermal structures during tissue homeostasis and hair follicle regeneration are obtained. Combining the lineage tracing approach with the whole mount technique allows examining large areas of the epidermis containing many hair follicles and sebaceous glands and reveals the complex three-dimensional relationship of labeled stem cell clones within the tissue.

21234711	20110115	Cutting edge: the etiology of autoimmune thyroid diseases.	Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the mechanisms leading to autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD). For the first time, we are beginning to unravel these mechanisms at the molecular level. AITD, including Graves' disease (GD) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), are common autoimmune diseases affecting the thyroid. They have a complex etiology that involves genetic and environmental influences. Seven genes have been shown to contribute to the etiology of AITD. The first AITD gene discovered, HLA-DR3, is associated with both GD and HT. More recently, this association was dissected at the molecular level when it was shown that substitution of the neutral amino acids Ala or Gln with arginine at position beta 74 in the HLA-DR peptide binding pocket is the specific sequence change causing AITD. Non-MHC genes that confer susceptibility to AITD can be classified into two groups: (1) immune-regulatory genes (e.g., CD40, CTLA-4, and PTPN22); (2) thyroid-specific genes-thyroglobulin and TSH receptor genes. These genes interact with environmental factors, such as infection, likely through epigenetic mechanisms to trigger disease. In this review, we summarize the latest findings on disease susceptibility and modulation by environmental factors. 	Clin_Rev_Allergy_Immunol	D016428 D052061 D016454
26935887	20160304	Unconventional superconductivity and interaction induced Fermi surface reconstruction in the two-dimensional Edwards model.	We study the competition between unconventional superconducting pairing and charge density wave (CDW) formation for the two-dimensional Edwards Hamiltonian at half filling, a very general two-dimensional transport model in which fermionic charge carriers couple to a correlated background medium. Using the projective renormalization method we find that a strong renormalization of the original fermionic band causes a new hole-like Fermi surface to emerge near the center of the Brillouin zone, before it eventually gives rise to the formation of a charge density wave. On the new, disconnected parts of the Fermi surface superconductivity is induced with a sign-changing order parameter. We discuss these findings in the light of recent experiments on iron-based oxypnictide superconductors. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D013485

16175503	20050922	PTPN22 genetic variation: evidence for multiple variants associated with rheumatoid arthritis.	The minor allele of the R620W missense single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs2476601) in the hematopoietic-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase gene, PTPN22, has been associated with multiple autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These genetic data, combined with biochemical evidence that this SNP affects PTPN22 function, suggest that this phosphatase is a key regulator of autoimmunity. To determine whether other genetic variants in PTPN22 contribute to the development of RA, we sequenced the coding regions of this gene in 48 white North American patients with RA and identified 15 previously unreported SNPs, including 2 coding SNPs in the catalytic domain. We then genotyped 37 SNPs in or near PTPN22 in 475 patients with RA and 475 individually matched controls (sample set 1) and selected a subset of markers for replication in an additional 661 patients with RA and 1,322 individually matched controls (sample set 2). Analyses of these results predict 10 common (frequency &gt;1%) PTPN22 haplotypes in white North Americans. The sole haplotype found to carry the previously identified W620 risk allele was strongly associated with disease in both sample sets, whereas another haplotype, identical at all other SNPs but carrying the R620 allele, showed no association. R620W, however, does not fully explain the association between PTPN22 and RA, since significant differences between cases and controls persisted in both sample sets after the haplotype data were stratified by R620W. Additional analyses identified two SNPs on a single common haplotype that are associated with RA independent of R620W, suggesting that R620W and at least one additional variant in the PTPN22 gene region influence RA susceptibility.

24855337	20140524	Species-Specific Regulation of t-PA and PAI-1 Gene Expression in Human and Rat Astrocytes.	In recent years, the role and physiological regulation of the serine protease tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and its inhibitors, including plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), in the brain have received much attention. However, as studies focusing these issues are difficult to perform in humans, a great majority of the studies conducted to date have utilized rodent in vivo and/or in vitro models. In view of the species-specific structural differences present in both the t-PA and the PAI-1 promoters, we have compared the response of these genes in astrocytes of rat and human origin. We reveal marked quantitative and qualitative species-specific differences in gene induction following treatment with various physiological and pathological stimuli. Thus, our findings are of importance for the interpretation of previous and future results related to t-PA and PAI-1 expression. 	Gene_Regul_Syst_Bio	D016428
20976174	20101027	IKK? contributes to canonical NF-?B activation downstream of Nod1-mediated peptidoglycan recognition.	During pathogen infection, innate immunity is initiated via the recognition of microbial products by pattern recognition receptors and the subsequent activation of transcription factors that upregulate proinflammatory genes. By controlling the expression of cytokines, chemokines, anti-bacterial peptides and adhesion molecules, the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-?B) has a central function in this process. In a typical model of NF-?B activation, the recognition of pathogen associated molecules triggers the canonical NF-?B pathway that depends on the phosphorylation of Inhibitor of NF-?B (I?B) by the catalytic subunit I?B kinase ? (IKK?), its degradation and the nuclear translocation of NF-?B dimers. Here, we performed an RNA interference (RNAi) screen on Shigella flexneri-induced NF-?B activation to identify new factors involved in the regulation of NF-?B following infection of epithelial cells by invasive bacteria. By targeting a subset of the human signaling proteome, we found that the catalytic subunit IKK? is also required for complete NF-?B activation during infection. Depletion of IKK? by RNAi strongly reduces the nuclear translocation of NF-?B p65 during S. flexneri infection as well as the expression of the proinflammatory chemokine interleukin-8. Similar to IKK?, IKK? contributes to the phosphorylation of I?B? on serines 32 and 36, and to its degradation. Experiments performed with the synthetic Nod1 ligand L-Ala-D-?-Glu-meso-diaminopimelic acid confirmed that IKK? is involved in NF-?B activation triggered downstream of Nod1-mediated peptidoglycan recognition. Taken together, these results demonstrate the unexpected role of IKK? in the canonical NF-?B pathway triggered by peptidoglycan recognition during bacterial infection. In addition, they suggest that IKK? may be an important drug target for the development of treatments that aim at limiting inflammation in bacterial infection. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
27580550	20160902	Promising Effects of Afatinib on Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis Derived from Erlotinib-resistant Lung Adenocarcinoma.	We herein report a case of a 67-year-old woman previously treated with erlotinib for adenocarcinoma with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation in exon 19, which rapidly developed to progressive symptomatic leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. The primary tumor and lung metastases also worsened and the performance status (PS) score declined to 3. With a re-biopsy from the pulmonary metastases, the T790M mutation was detected by the cobas EGFR mutation test, but not the cycleave test, although an exon 19 deletion was detected by both of the tests. A week after afatinib initiation, the neurological symptoms disappeared and the PS improved to 1 with a radiological response in all disease sites. Chest physicians should consider the use of afatinib for patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis from 1st-generation EGFR-TKI resistant adenocarcinoma, regardless of the PS score and the presence of the T790M mutation in the extracranial lesion.

27630726	20160916	Prevalence of Serologic Hepatitis B Markers in Blood Donors From Puebla, Mexico: The Association of Relatively High Levels of Anti-Core Antibodies With the Detection of Surface Antigen and Genomic DNA.	The hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes chronic hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Surface antigen (HBsAg) detection is a definitive test that can confirm HBV infection, while the presence of antibodies against the core protein (anti-HBc) suggests either a previous or ongoing infection or occult hepatitis B infection (OBI). The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of anti-HBc and HBsAg in blood donors. Further, the study aimed to estimate the anti-HBc level at which HBV DNA is detected in putative OBI cases, as well as to search for mutations in the &quot;a&quot; determinant associated with the non-detection of HBsAg in serum. We conducted a cross-sectional study from 2003-2009. The study included 120,552 blood donors from the state of Puebla, Mexico. Different commercial systems based on microparticles (enzymatic (MEIA) or chemiluminescent (CMIA)) were used to determine the HBsAg and anti-HBc levels. For the detection of HBV DNA, a nested polymerase chain reaction (nested PCR) was used and the genotypes were determined using Sanger sequencing. Of the 120,552 blood donors, 1437 (1.19%, 95% CI: 1.12 - 1.26) were reactive to anti-HBc, while 82 (0.066%, 95% CI: 0.053 - 0.079) were reactive to HBsAg. Some 156 plasma samples collected in 2009 from anti-HBc-positive/HBsAg-negative blood donors were submitted for HBV DNA detection in a search for probable OBI. Viral DNA was detected in 27/156 (17.3%, 95% CI: 11.5 - 23.1). Our results show an association between HBV DNA or HBsAg and anti-HBc S/CO levels ? 4.0. All DNA samples were identified as genotype H and some &quot;a&quot; determinant mutations were identified, although none corresponded to mutations previously reported to hinder the detection of HBsAg by commercial immunoassays. We observed that as the anti-HBc levels increase, there is a higher prevalence of the viral protein HBsAg in blood donors. Samples testing positive for HBV-DNA were seen to exhibit a ten-fold higher presence of anti-HBc S/CO ? 4 than those with S/CO ? 1 and &lt; 4.0, which highlights the relevance of anti-HBc determination in blood donor samples.

24163131	20131029	Absence of cell surface expression of human ACE leads to perinatal death.	Renal tubular dysgenesis (RTD) is a recessive autosomal disease characterized most often by perinatal death. It is due to the inactivation of any of the major genes of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), one of which is the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is present as a tissue-bound enzyme and circulates in plasma after its solubilization. In this report, we present the effect of different ACE mutations associated with RTD on ACE intracellular trafficking, secretion and enzymatic activity. One truncated mutant, R762X, responsible for neonatal death was found to be an enzymatically active, secreted form, not inserted in the plasma membrane. In contrast, another mutant, R1180P, was compatible with life after transient neonatal renal insufficiency. This mutant was located at the plasma membrane and rapidly secreted. These results highlight the importance of tissue-bound ACE versus circulating ACE and show that the total absence of cell surface expression of ACE is incompatible with life. In addition, two missense mutants (W594R and R828H) and two truncated mutants (Q1136X and G1145AX) were also studied. These mutants were neither inserted in the plasma membrane nor secreted. Finally, the structural implications of these ACE mutations were examined by molecular modelling, which suggested some important structural alterations such as disruption of intra-molecular non-covalent interactions (e.g. salt bridges).

21567059	20110514	Mutations of p53 gene in hepatocellular-carcinoma (hcc) correlate with tumor progression and patient prognosis - a study of 138 patients with unifocal hcc.	The mutation spectrum of p53 gene and its biological significance were studied in 138 patients with unifocal primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Taiwan. The p53 mutations were detected in 51 cases (37%); 36 (71%) were missense mutations. The others (29%) included mutations at the intron-exon junctions (5 cases), deletion or insertion (4 cases), nonsense mutations (4 cases), and silent mutations (2 cases). The mutation sites were scattered from exons 4 to 10, predominantly (75%) in exons 5, 7, and 8. Of these mutations, 72% were transversions, mostly G:C --&gt; T:A change (46%); while only 28% were transitions. Mutation occurred at codon 249 only in 14 cases (10%), but accounted for 27% of the mutations. The p53 mutations correlated with allele loss of p53 locus (52% vs 17% p&lt;0.02), alpha-fetoprotein elevation (45% vs 28%, p&lt;0.04), and poorly differentiated HCC (46% vs 10%, p&lt;0.0001). The p53 mutation rate was two times higher in large than in small HCC (48% vs 26%, p&lt;0.008), and in more advanced tumor (stage 3 vs stages 1 and 2: 49% vs 21%, p&lt;0.0007). HCC patients with mutated p53 gene had a worse outcome (5-year survival; 18% vs 38%, p&lt;0.008). We conclude that p53 gene mutation is common in advanced HCC, occurs as a late event in HCC growth, correlates with tumor progression and aggression, and is a useful molecular prognostic parameter of HCC. The p53 mutation patterns did not correlate with HBV or HCV infection. The frequency of p53 mutations did not differ between Taiwanese patients and mainland Chinese in Taiwan. However, mutation at codon 249 was more common in Taiwanese patients (p&lt;0.05), while mutations of other types more frequent in the mainlanders (p&lt;0.03). Hence endogenous and exogenous factors other than aflatoxin may also play a role in p53 mutation in HCC. 	Int._J._Oncol.	D016428
2196280	19900701	H-ras protooncogene mutations in human thyroid neoplasms.	Structural alterations of protooncogene sequences may be involved in the pathogenesis of human neoplasms. We screened 54 thyroid tumors (36 benign and 18 malignant) for gene rearrangements of the protooncogenes c-myc, c-myb, c-fos, c-erb-B1, c-erb-B2, c-erb-A, N-ras, K-ras, and H-ras. Only mutations of H-ras were observed. None of the 15 colloid adenomas examined had detectable H-ras rearrangements. Of the remaining tumors, we observed mutations of H-ras in 4 benign and 4 malignant neoplasms. Gene amplification was found in 5 tumors. An aggressive recurrent papillary carcinoma had a marked amplification of one of the H-ras alleles. The amplified allele was truncated, in that the 3' variable tandem repeat was not a part of the amplification unit, and contained a codon 12 point mutation leading to a valine for glycine substitution. We also observed the association of low copy gene amplification with a codon 12 valine for glycine mutation in a follicular adenoma. Two tumors contained H-ras EcoRI polymorphisms not present in the DNA of normal thyroid from the same individuals, and one follicular carcinoma showed loss of an H-ras allele. Ras protooncogenes may become transforming by quantitative mutations, leading to increased expression, or qualitative mechanisms, through activating point mutations. Both of these appear to coexist in thyroid neoplasms, and it may be that a combination of both mechanisms is capable of inducing a more complete spectrum of neoplastic phenotypes.

7520054	19940801	Tissue-specific expression of calbindin-D28K gene during ontogeny of the chicken.	The vitamin D3-dependent calcium binding protein, calbindin-D28K (CaBP-D28K), plays an important role in transepithelial calcium translocation. To evaluate its role in chick embryonic calcium metabolism, steady-state levels of CaBP-D28K mRNA in various tissues of the chick embryo were determined by Northern blot and slot blot analyses, and CaBP-D28K concentrations in the examined tissues and plasma were estimated by RIA. High levels of CaBP-D28K mRNA were found in the embryonic kidney (mesonephros) on embryonic day (E) 10 and E12 and thereafter gradually decreased until hatching. CaBP-D28K mRNA levels were low in the yolk sac until E16 but increased on E18 and reached a maximum on E20. A steady increase in CaBP-D28K mRNA levels was observed in the cerebellum during the development from E10 to post-hatching. CaBP-D28K mRNA levels in the intestine were very low during the incubation period but significantly increased on days 1 and 7 after hatching. By Northern blot analysis, CaBP-D28K mRNA was barely detectable in liver, heart, and chorioallantoic membrane of the embryonic chick. Changes in immunoreactive CaBP-D28K of each tissue paralleled observed changes in mRNA levels. In plasma, measurable levels of CaBP-D28K were found as early as E8 and were stable until E18, when 6.5-fold increase was observed compared to E16. The highest level of CaBP-D28K in plasma was found on E20 and decreased after hatching. These temporal profiles of CaBP-D28K suggest that it may play an important role in the regulation of chick embryonic calcium homeostasis. 	J._Exp._Zool.	D016428 D013485
8512923	19930622	Molecular defect in factor IX Tokyo: substitution of valine-182 by alanine at position P2' in the second cleavage site by factor XIa resulting in impaired activation.	Utilizing polymerase chain reaction and directly sequencing the amplified exon 6 of the factor IX gene derived from a mild hemophilia Bm patient, we have identified a T to C mutation at nucleotide 20,525. This point mutation predicted a Val182 to Ala substitution in the abnormal factor IX molecule, designated as factor IX Tokyo. The patient manifested a low factor IX activity and a moderately prolonged ox-brain prothrombin time but a normal factor IX antigen level in plasma. Immunopurified factor IX derived from the patient was found to have a normal molecular weight but a reduced specific activity (23% of normal). Limited proteolysis by activated factor XI or by a snake venom-derived factor X-activating enzyme was considerably delayed, indicating the presence of structural alteration(s) most probably at or near the second enzyme-cleavage site. Once activated, however, factor IXa Tokyo was able to activate factor X normally and was inactivated by antithrombin III also in a normal fashion. The structural model of factor IXa and a docking model of factor IX and activated factor VII (factor VIIa) suggested that the Val182 to Ala substitution would not affect the local conformation of the catalytic domain. This mutation would rather loosen the fitness of the molecule into the substrate-binding pocket of factor VIIa due to a shorter side chain of the Ala substitution at the P2' position of the second cleavage site.

24273131	20131126	Murine norovirus protein NS1/2 aspartate to glutamate mutation, sufficient for persistence, reorients side chain of surface exposed tryptophan within a novel structured domain.	Compact viral genomes such as those found in noroviruses, which cause significant enteric disease in humans, often encode only a few proteins, but affect a wide range of processes in their hosts and ensure efficient propagation of the virus. Both human and mouse noroviruses (MNVs) persistently replicate and are shed in stool, a highly effective strategy for spreading between hosts. For MNV, the presence of a glutamate rather than an aspartate at position 94 of the NS1/2 protein was previously shown to be essential for persistent replication and shedding. Here, we analyze these critical sequences of NS1/2 at the structural level. Using solution nuclear magnetic resonance methods, we determined folded NS1/2 domain structures from a nonpersistent murine norovirus strain CW3, a persistent strain CR6, and a persistent mutant strain CW3(D94E). We found an unstructured PEST-like domain followed by a novel folded domain in the N-terminus of NS1/2. All three forms of the domain are stable and monomeric in solution. Residue 94, critical for determining persistence, is located in a reverse turn following an ?-helix in the folded domain. The longer side chain of glutamate, but not aspartate, allows interaction with the indole group of the nearby tryptophan, reshaping the surface of the domain. The discrimination between glutamyl and aspartyl residue is imposed by the stable tertiary conformation. These structural requirements correlate with the in vivo function of NS1/2 in persistence, a key element of norovirus biology and infection. 	Proteins	D016428 D052061

We summarised the clinical, biochemical and molecular genetic investigation of an international cohort of affected individuals with RMND1 mutations. In addition, we reviewed all the previously published cases to determine the genotype-phenotype correlates and performed survival analysis to identify prognostic factors. We identified 14 new cases from 11 pedigrees that harbour recessive RMND1 mutations, including 6 novel variants: c.533C&gt;A, p.(Thr178Lys); c.565C&gt;T, p.(Gln189*); c.631G&gt;A, p.(Val211Met); c.1303C&gt;T, p.(Leu435Phe); c.830+1G&gt;A and c.1317+1G&gt;T. Together with all previously published cases (n=32), we show that congenital sensorineural deafness, hypotonia, developmental delay and lactic acidaemia are common clinical manifestations with disease onset under 2?years. Renal involvement is more prevalent than seizures (66% vs 44%). In addition, median survival time was longer in patients with renal involvement compared with those without renal disease (6?years vs 8?months, p=0.009). The neurological phenotype also appears milder in patients with renal involvement. The clinical phenotypes and prognosis associated with RMND1 mutations are more heterogeneous than that were initially described. Regular monitoring of kidney function is imperative in the clinical practice in light of nephropathy being present in over 60% of cases. Furthermore, renal replacement therapy should be considered particularly in those patients with mild neurological manifestation as shown in our study that four recipients of kidney transplant demonstrate good clinical outcome to date.

11922614	20020402	Role of tryptophan hydroxylase phe313 in determining substrate specificity.	The active site residue phenylalanine 313 is conserved in the sequences of all known tryptophan hydroxylases. The tryptophan hydroxylase F313W mutant protein no longer shows a preference for tryptophan over phenylalanine as a substrate, consistent with a role of this residue in substrate specificity. A tryptophan residue occupies the homologous position in tyrosine hydroxylase. The tyrosine hydroxylase W372F mutant enzyme does not show an increased preference for tryptophan over tyrosine or phenylalanine, so that this residue cannot be considered the dominant factor in substrate specificity in this family of enzymes.

21447560	20110331	Identification of a methylated oligoribonucleotide as a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcription complex.	Upon HIV-1 infection of a target cell, the viral reverse transcriptase (RT) copies the genomic RNA to synthesize the viral DNA. The genomic RNA is within the incoming HIV-1 core where it is coated by molecules of nucleocapsid (NC) protein that chaperones the reverse transcription process. Indeed, the RT chaperoning properties of NC extend from the initiation of cDNA synthesis to completion of the viral DNA. New and effective drugs against HIV-1 continue to be required, which prompted us to search for compounds aimed at inhibiting NC protein. Here, we report that the NC chaperoning activity is extensively inhibited in vitro by small methylated oligoribonucleotides (mODN). These mODNs were delivered intracellularly using a cell-penetrating-peptide and found to impede HIV-1 replication in primary human cells at nanomolar concentrations. Extensive analysis showed that viral cDNA synthesis was severely impaired by mODNs. Partially resistant viruses with mutations in NC and RT emerged after months of passaging in cell culture. A HIV-1 molecular clone (NL4.3) bearing these mutations was found to replicate at high concentrations of mODN, albeit with a reduced fitness. Small, methylated ODNs such as mODN-11 appear to be a new type of highly potent inhibitor of HIV-1. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D013485
26986948	20160318	An Interleukin 13 Polymorphism Is Associated with Symptom Severity in Adult Subjects with Ever Asthma.	Different genes are associated with categorical classifications of asthma severity. However, continuous outcomes should be used to catch the heterogeneity of asthma phenotypes and to increase the power in association studies. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate gene regions and continuous measures of asthma severity, in adult patients from the general population. In the Gene Environment Interactions in Respiratory Diseases (GEIRD) study (www.geird.org), 326 subjects (aged 20-64) with ever asthma were identified from the general population in Verona (Italy) between 2007 and 2010. A panel of 236 SNPs tagging 51 candidate gene regions (including one or more genes) was analysed. A symptom and treatment score (STS) and pre-bronchodilator FEV1% predicted were used as continuous measures of asthma severity. The association of each SNP with STS and FEV1% predicted was tested by fitting quasi-gamma and linear regression models, respectively, with gender, body mass index and smoking habits as potential confounders. The Simes multiple-test procedure was used for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). SNP rs848 in the IL13 gene region (IL5/RAD50/IL13/IL4) was associated with STS (TG/GG vs TT genotype: uncorrected p-value = 0.00006, FDR-corrected p-value = 0.04), whereas rs20541 in the same gene region, in linkage disequilibrium with rs848 (r(2) = 0.94) in our sample, did not reach the statistical significance after adjusting for multiple testing (TC/CC vs TT: uncorrected p-value = 0.0003, FDR-corrected p-value = 0.09). Polymorphisms in other gene regions showed a non-significant moderate association with STS (IL12B, TNS1) or lung function (SERPINE2, GATA3, IL5, NPNT, FAM13A) only. After adjusting for multiple testing and potential confounders, SNP rs848 in the IL13 gene region is significantly associated with a continuous measure of symptom severity in adult subjects with ever asthma.

25730260	20150303	The association between three cyclooxygenase-2 polymorphisms and hepatocellular carcinoma risk: a meta-analysis.	A quantity of case-control studies have been performed to address the association between three cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2) polymorphisms (-1195G/A, -765G/C and +8473T/C) and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, previous research results are inconsistent. We conducted this meta-analysis to clarify the correlation between these COX-2 polymorphisms and HCC risk. The authors searched in PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, CNKI and WanFang database for relevant articles up to April 28, 2014. The data were extracted by two independent reviewers. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. A total of 8 studies consisting of 2182 cases and 3324 controls were included in this meta-analysis. For COX-2 polymorphism -1195G/A, an association with increased risk was observed under the heterogeneous, homozygous, dominant model. However, COX-2 polymorphisms (-765G/C and +8473T/C) were not related to HCC risk in this study. We also found a similar result in the subgroup analysis of Chinese population that -1195G/A polymorphism, instead of -765G/C or +8473T/C polymorphism, was correlated with the risk of HCC. Polymorphism -1195G/A of COX-2 might be associated with susceptibility to HCC, but no similar correlations were observed between polymorphisms (-765G/C and +8473T/C) and HCC risk. Further large and well-designed studies are required to validate this association. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D017418 D013485

In the crystal, the protonated N atom and the 2-amino group of the cation are hydrogen bonded to the carboxyl-ate O atoms of the anion via a pair of N-H?O hydrogen bonds with an R2(2)(8) ring motif, forming an approximately planar ion pair with a dihedral angle of 9.63?(4)? between the pyridinium and benzene rings. The ion pairs are further connected via N-H?O and weak C-H?O hydrogen bonds, forming a two-dimensional network parallel to the bc plane. 	Acta_Crystallogr_Sect_E_Struct_Rep_Online	D016428
19542745	20090623	Association of 1704G/T and G82S polymorphisms in the receptor for advanced glycation end products gene with diabetic retinopathy in Chinese population.	The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. The aim of this study is to investigate the association of the 1704 G/T and G82S polymorphisms in the RAGE gene with diabetic retinopathy (DR). The 1704G/T and G82S polymorphisms were genotyped in 340 Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) without DR subjects (DR- group); 166 T2DM with DR subjects (DR+ group), and 182 normal glucose tolerant subjects (NGT group). The genotypes were detected by the methods of ligase detection reaction coupled PCR. There was no evident difference in the 1704G/T and G82S genotypic and allelic frequencies distribution between NGT and T2DM subjects. However, the frequences of G/A+AA genotypes (60.6%) and A allele (36.4%) of G82S were significantly higher in DR+ group than those (38.4%; 20.9%, respectively) in DR- group (p=0.01and p=0.007, respectively). Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed that the frequency of G-A haplotype containing 1704G and 82S allele in DR+ group was significantly higher than that in DR- group (33.5% vs 19.6%, p=0.01). The multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the G82S polymorphism [odds ratio (OR): 2.964, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.013-5.46, p=0.029] and diabetes duration (OR: 1.013, 95% CI: 1.007-1.02, p&lt;0.001) were independent risk factors for DR. G82S polymorphism in the RAGE gene is associated with DR and G-A haplotype containing 1704G and 82S allele might be a genetic marker of DR in Chinese T2DM patients. 	J._Endocrinol._Invest.

26950145	20160308	An Increase in the Omega-6/Omega-3 Fatty Acid Ratio Increases the Risk for Obesity.	In the past three decades, total fat and saturated fat intake as a percentage of total calories has continuously decreased in Western diets, while the intake of omega-6 fatty acid increased and the omega-3 fatty acid decreased, resulting in a large increase in the omega-6/omega-3 ratio from 1:1 during evolution to 20:1 today or even higher. This change in the composition of fatty acids parallels a significant increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity. Experimental studies have suggested that omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids elicit divergent effects on body fat gain through mechanisms of adipogenesis, browning of adipose tissue, lipid homeostasis, brain-gut-adipose tissue axis, and most importantly systemic inflammation. Prospective studies clearly show an increase in the risk of obesity as the level of omega-6 fatty acids and the omega-6/omega-3 ratio increase in red blood cell (RBC) membrane phospholipids, whereas high omega-3 RBC membrane phospholipids decrease the risk of obesity. Recent studies in humans show that in addition to absolute amounts of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acid intake, the omega-6/omega-3 ratio plays an important role in increasing the development of obesity via both AA eicosanoid metabolites and hyperactivity of the cannabinoid system, which can be reversed with increased intake of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A balanced omega-6/omega-3 ratio is important for health and in the prevention and management of obesity. 	Nutrients	D016428 D016454
19574219	20090704	An in trans interaction at the interface of the helicase and primase domains of the hexameric gene 4 protein of bacteriophage T7 modulates their activities.	DNA helicase and primase are essential for DNA replication. The helicase unwinds the DNA to provide single-stranded templates for DNA polymerase. The primase catalyzes the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides for the initiation of lagging strand synthesis. The two activities reside in a single polypeptide encoded by gene 4 of bacteriophage T7. Their coexistence within the same polypeptide facilitates their coordination during DNA replication. One surface of helix E within the helicase domain is positioned to interact with the primase domain and the linker connecting the two domains within the functional hexamer. The interaction occurs in trans such that helix E interacts with the primase domain and the linker of the adjacent subunit. Most alterations of residues on the surface of helix E (Arg(404), Lys(408), Tyr(411), and Gly(415)) eliminate the ability of the altered proteins to complement growth of T7 phage lacking gene 4. Both Tyr(411) and Gly(415) are important in oligomerization of the protein. Alterations G415V and K408A simultaneously influence helicase and primase activities in opposite manners that mimic events observed during coordinated DNA synthesis. The results suggest that Asp(263) located in the linker of one subunit can interact with Tyr(411), Lys(408), or Arg(404) in helix E of the adjacent subunit depending on the oligomerization state. Thus the switch in contacts between Asp(263) and its three interacting residues in helix E of the adjacent subunit results in conformational changes that modulate helicase and primase activity.

12798016	20030612	Frequencies of 32 base pair deletion of the (Delta 32) allele of the CCR5 HIV-1 co-receptor gene in Caucasians: a comparative analysis.	The CCR5 gene encodes for the co-receptor for the major macrophage-tropics strains of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), and a mutant allele of this gene (Delta 32) provide to homozygotes a strong resistance against infection by HIV. The frequency of the Delta 32 allele was investigated in 40 populations of 8842 non-infected subjects coming from Europe, the Middle-East and North Africa. A clear north-south decreasing gradient was evident for Delta 32 frequencies, with a significant correlation coefficient (r=0.83). The main frequency value of Delta 32 for Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland (0.134) is significantly (chi(2)=63.818, P&lt;0.001) highest than the Delta 32 mean value, indicating that probably the Vikings might have been instrumental in disseminating the Delta 32 allele during the eighth to the tenth centuries during historical times. Possibly variola virus has discriminated the Delta 32 carriers in Europe since the eighth century AD, explaining the high frequency of the Delta 32 allele in Europe today. 	Infect._Genet._Evol.

16796708	20060627	Novel ADAMTS-13 mutations in an adult with delayed onset thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.	Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is associated with congenital and acquired deficiency of ADAMTS-13, a metalloprotease that cleaves von Willebrand factor (VWF) and reduces its adhesive activity. Mutations throughout the ADAMTS13 gene have been identified in congenital TTP patients, most of whom have initial episodes during infancy or in early childhood. We report the case of an adult male who was diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura at age 34, and with TTP 14 years later. The patient was compound heterozygous for an 18 bp in-frame deletion (C365del) in the disintegrin domain and a point mutation of R1060W in the seventh thrombospondin domain of the ADAMTS-13 gene. In vitro studies found that C365del and R1060W severely impair ADAMTS-13 synthesis in transfected Hela cells, whereas the deletion mutant also failed to cleave VWF under static and flow conditions.

20460128	20100513	Horse prion protein NMR structure and comparisons with related variants of the mouse prion protein.	The NMR structure of the horse (Equus caballus) cellular prion protein at 25 degrees C exhibits the typical PrP(C) [cellular form of prion protein (PrP)] global architecture, but in contrast to most other mammalian PrP(C)s, it contains a well-structured loop connecting the beta2 strand with the alpha2 helix. Comparison with designed variants of the mouse prion protein resulted in the identification of a single amino acid exchange within the loop, D167S, which correlates with the high structural order of this loop in the solution structure at 25 degrees C and is unique to the PrP sequences of equine species. The beta2-alpha2 loop and the alpha3 helix form a protein surface epitope that has been proposed to be the recognition area for a hypothetical chaperone, &quot;protein X,&quot; which would promote conversion of PrP(C) into the disease-related scrapie form and thus mediate intermolecular interactions related to the transmission barrier for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) between different species. The present results are evaluated in light of recent indications from in vivo experiments that the local beta2-alpha2 loop structure affects the susceptibility of transgenic mice to TSEs and the fact that there are no reports on TSE in horses.

22911797	20120823	Structure and dynamics of amyloid-? segmental polymorphisms.	It is believed that amyloid-beta (A?) aggregates play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. A? molecules form ?-sheet structures with multiple interaction sites. This polymorphism gives rise to differences in morphology, physico-chemical property and level of cellular toxicity. We have investigated the conformational stability of various segmental polymorphisms using molecular dynamics simulations and find that the segmental polymorphic models of A? retain a U-shaped architecture. Our results demonstrate the importance of inter-sheet side chain-side chain contacts, hydrophobic contacts among the strands (?1 and ?2) and of salt bridges in stabilizing the aggregates. Residues in ?-sheet regions have smaller fluctuation while those at the edge and loop region are more mobile. The inter-peptide salt bridges between Asp23 and Lys28 are strong compared to intra-chain salt bridge and there is an exchange of the inter-chain salt-bridge with intra-chain salt bridge. As our results suggest that A? exists under physiological conditions as an ensemble of distinct segmental polymorphs, it may be necessary to account in the development of therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease the differences in structural stability and aggregation behavior of the various A? polymorphic forms.

25848939	20150408	Variation at FCGR2A and functionally related genes is associated with the response to anti-TNF therapy in rheumatoid arthritis.	Anti-TNF therapies have been highly efficacious in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but 25-30% of patients do not show a significant clinical response. There is increasing evidence that genetic variation at the Fc receptor FCGR2A is associated with the response to anti-TNF therapy. We aimed to validate this genetic association in a patient cohort from the Spanish population, and also to identify new genes functionally related to FCGR2A that are also associated with anti-TNF response. A total of 348 RA patients treated with an anti-TNF therapy were included and genotyped for FCGR2A polymorphism rs1081274. Response to therapy was determined at 12 weeks, and was tested for association globally and independently for each anti-TNF drug (infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab). Using gene expression profiles from macrophages obtained from synovial fluid of RA patients, we searched for genes highly correlated with FCGR2A expression. Tag SNPs were selected from each candidate gene and tested for association with the response to therapy. We found a significant association between FCGR2A and the response to adalimumab (P=0.022). Analyzing the subset of anti-CCP positive RA patients (78%), we also found a significant association between FCGR2A and the response to infliximab (P=0.035). DHX32 and RGS12 were the most consistently correlated genes with FCGR2A expression in RA synovial fluid macrophages (P&lt;0.001). We found a significant association between the genetic variation at DHX32 (rs12356233, corrected P=0.019) and a nominally significant association between RGS12 and the response to adalimumab (rs4690093, uncorrected P=0.040). In the anti-CCP positive group of patients, we also found a nominally significant association between RGS12 and the response to infliximab (rs2857859, uncorrected P=0.042). In the present study we have validated the FCGR2A association in an independent population, and we have identified new genes associated with the response to anti-TNF therapy in RA.

25489943	20141210	Defective FANCI binding by a fanconi anemia-related FANCD2 mutant.	FANCD2 is a product of one of the genes associated with Fanconi anemia (FA), a rare recessive disease characterized by bone marrow failure, skeletal malformations, developmental defects, and cancer predisposition. FANCD2 forms a complex with FANCI (ID complex) and is monoubiquitinated, which facilitates the downstream interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair steps, such as ICL unhooking and nucleolytic end resection. In the present study, we focused on the chicken FANCD2 (cFANCD2) mutant harboring the Leu234 to Arg (L234R) substitution. cFANCD2 L234R corresponds to the human FANCD2 L231R mutation identified in an FA patient. We found that cFANCD2 L234R did not complement the defective ICL repair in FANCD2-/- DT40 cells. Purified cFANCD2 L234R did not bind to chicken FANCI, and its monoubiquitination was significantly deficient, probably due to the abnormal ID complex formation. In addition, the histone chaperone activity of cFANCD2 L234R was also defective. These findings may explain some aspects of Fanconi anemia pathogenesis by a FANCD2 missense mutation.

24465879	20140128	Isolation and characteristics of Shiga toxin 2f-producing Escherichia coli among pigeons in Kyushu, Japan.	An increasing number of Shiga toxin 2f-producing Escherichia coli (STEC2f) infections in humans are being reported in Europe, and pigeons have been suggested as a reservoir for the pathogen. In Japan, there is very little information regarding carriage of STEC2f by pigeons, prompting the need for further investigation. We collected 549 samples of pigeon droppings from 14 locations in Kyushu, Japan, to isolate STEC2f and to investigate characteristics of the isolates. Shiga toxin stx 2f gene fragments were detected by PCR in 16 (2.9%) of the 549 dropping samples across four of the 14 locations. We obtained 23 STEC2f-isolates from seven of the original samples and from three pigeon dropping samples collected in an additional sampling experiment (from a total of seven locations across both sampling periods). Genotypic and phenotypic characteristics were then examined for selected isolates from each of 10 samples with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles. Eight of the stx 2f gene fragments sequenced in this study were homologous to others that were identified in Europe. Some isolates also contained virulence-related genes, including lpfA O26, irp 2, and fyuA, and all of the 10 selected isolates maintained the eae, astA, and cdt genes. Moreover, five of the 10 selected isolates contained sfpA, a gene that is restricted to Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O165:H2 and sorbitol-fermenting Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O157:NM. We document serotypes O152:HNM, O128:HNM, and O145:H34 as STEC2f, which agrees with previous studies on pigeons and humans. Interestingly, O119:H21 was newly described as STEC2f. O145:H34, with sequence type 722, was described in a German study in humans and was also isolated in the current study. These results revealed that Japanese zoonotic STEC2f strains harboring several virulence-related factors may be of the same clonal complexes as some European strains. These findings provide useful information for public health-related disease management strategies in Japan. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
17960130	20071026	Association between primary open-angle glaucoma and WDR36 DNA sequence variants in Japanese.	To determine whether mutations in the WD repeat domain 36 gene (WDR36) are associated with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in Japanese. Subjects with high tension glaucoma (HTG) and normal tension glaucoma (NTG) were analyzed separately. One hundred and thirty-six unrelated Japanese patients with HTG and 103 unrelated patients with NTG were studied. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes, and all 23 exons were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and directly sequenced bidirectionally. Twenty sequence alterations were identified: 10 have already been reported (p.I264V, c.1494+90C&gt;T, c.1494+143A&gt;G, c.1609+89G&gt;A, c.1775+89C&gt;A, c.1965-30A&gt;G, p.V714V, c.2170+217C&gt;T, p.V727V, and c.2518+60G&gt;C) and 10 were novel (p.D179D, p.Q270Q, p.M283R, c.898+63C&gt;G, c.1074+20C&gt;T, p.G459G, c.1884+26C&gt;G, p.S664L, p.S664S, and p.P744P). One nonsynonymous amino acid change in exon 17, p.S664L, was identified in a patient with HTG. The frequency of the p.I264V variant was significantly higher in the HTG group than in the control group (p=0.01), but the frequency in the NTG group was not significantly different from the control group (p=0.12). The frequency of the c.1965-30A&gt;G variant was also significantly higher in the HTG group than in the control group (p=0.03), but the frequency in the NTG group was not significantly different from the control group (p=0.06). One nonsynonymous variant, p.S664L, and the association of the allelic variants (p.I264V and c.1965-30A&gt;G) in WDR36 and their prevalence in unrelated Japanese patients with HTG suggest that they are probably involved in the pathogenesis of HTG.

22802962	20120718	Structural interaction and functional regulation of polycystin-2 by filamin.	Filamins are important actin cross-linking proteins implicated in scaffolding, membrane stabilization and signal transduction, through interaction with ion channels, receptors and signaling proteins. Here we report the physical and functional interaction between filamins and polycystin-2, a TRP-type cation channel mutated in 10-15% patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down experiments demonstrated that the C-termini of filamin isoforms A, B and C directly bind to both the intracellular N- and C-termini of polycystin-2. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that endogenous polycystin-2 and filamins are in the same complexes in renal epithelial cells and human melanoma A7 cells. We then examined the effect of filamin on polycystin-2 channel function by electrophysiology studies with a lipid bilayer reconstitution system and found that filamin-A substantially inhibits polycystin-2 channel activity. Our study indicates that filamins are important regulators of polycystin-2 channel function, and further links actin cytoskeletal dynamics to the regulation of this channel protein.

16451596	20060203	Use of susceptibility scoring in conjunction with the genotypic transmission disequilibrium test.	We explored the utility of selecting a genetically predisposed subgroup to increase the finding of a genetic signal in the Genetic Analysis Workshop 14 Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism dataset. A subgroup of affected probands with low environmental risk exposures was defined using a susceptibility score calculated from an environmental risk model. Thirty-nine probands with highly positive scores were selected, along with their parents, for use in a genotypic transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) test. We compared the results of the genotypic TDT in this subgroup to the TDT results using all probands and their parents. For some markers, the susceptibility scoring approach resulted in smaller p-values, while for other markers, evidence for a genetic signal weakened. Further explorations into genetic and environmental population characteristics that benefit from this approach are warranted. 	BMC_Genet.	D016428
16491114	20060224	TIMP-2 upregulates RECK expression via dephosphorylation of paxillin tyrosine residues 31 and 118.	We previously demonstrated that TIMP-2 increases the association of Crk with C3G and via subsequent activation of Rap1 enhances the expression of RECK, a membrane-anchored MMP inhibitor. In the present study, we investigate the mechanism of how the TIMP-2 signal is transduced from the alpha3beta1 integrin receptor to the Crk-C3G-Rap1 molecular complex. TIMP-2 treatment of human microvascular endothelial cells (hMVECs) increased the phosphorylation levels of Src at Tyr-527, the negative regulatory site, through enhanced association of Src with Csk. This results in the reduction of Src kinase activity and dephosphorylation of paxillin at Tyr-31/118, the target sites for Src kinase phosphorylation and also the binding sites for the downstream effector Crk. Such TIMP-2 effects accompany the disassembly of paxillin-Crk-DOCK180 molecular complex and, in turn, Rac1 inactivation. On the contrary, levels of paxillin-Crk-C3G complex formation are not reduced, rather slightly increased, which is consistent with our previous finding. Therefore, TIMP-2-mediated inhibition of Src kinase activity leads to the signaling switch from Rac1 to Rap1, thereby leading to enhanced RECK expression. 	Oncogene	D016428 D052060
18926157	20081018	Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 A1075G polymorphism is associated with survival in an acute coronary syndromes cohort.	Polymorphisms of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene, which is located on the X chromosome, have been associated with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy in previous studies. We tested the hypothesis that the rare allele of an ACE2 gene polymorphism was associated with risk factors for and adverse outcome after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) events. Patients (n = 1,042) were recruited after admission for an ACS event and were genotyped for the A1075G polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 gene. This genetic marker was tested for association with baseline measurements, echocardiographic measurements, and clinical outcome, over a median 2.19 years follow-up. As the ACE2 gene is X-linked, analyses were performed separately for males and females. Patients were predominantly of European ethnicity (90.1%). The A1075 allele was significantly associated with covariate-adjusted mortality in male patients (hazard ratio 1.95, 95% CI 1.10-3.46, P = .047) but not unadjusted (hazard ratio 1.14, 95% CI 0.736-1.76, P = .56). The G1075 (P &lt; .035) allele was more frequent in patients of Maori compared to European ancestry. E/E', an echocardiographic index of left ventricular diastolic function and filling pressure, was higher in males in the A1075 group (G allele group 10.5 [95% CI 10.0-11.0], A allele group 11.4 [95% CI 10.8-12.1], P = .024). A1075 genotype was significantly associated with male survival in the absence of (mortality: A 12.8%, n = 39; G 29.2%, n = 48; P = .037) but not in the presence of beta-blocker treatment (mortality: A 13.5% n = 273; G 8.2% n = 304, P = nonsignificant). The A1075 allele was associated with covariate-adjusted mortality in male patients. 	Am._Heart_J.	D016428 D013485
15010841	20040311	Detection of (NAD(P)H:Quinone oxidoreductase-1, EC 1.6.99.2) 609C--&gt;T and 465C--&gt;T polymorphisms in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tumour tissue using PCR-RFLP.	NQO1 is a cytosolic flavoprotein that plays a dual role in the detoxification of potentially carcinogenic compounds and the bioreductive activation of quinone based anticancer drugs. Two polymorphic variants of NQO1 exist (NQO1*2 and NQO1*3) which cause significant phenotypic reductions in NQO1 protein content and activity. Current methods for detecting NQO1 polymorphisms commonly use PCR-RFLP techniques and have exclusively used DNA isolated from fresh tissues. This study describes a method that is suitable for analysing NQO1 polymorphisms in genomic DNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. The method utilises two rounds of PCR amplification using a nested primer strategy that generates specific PCR products followed by RFLP analysis using either Hinf1 (for NQO1*2) or Msp1 (for NQO1*3). Whilst existing methods proved unsatisfactory (low product yield and poor specificity), the nested primer strategy produced good quality PCR products suitable for RFLP analysis and genotyping of NQO1*2 and NQO1*3 in archival tissue samples. The ability to utilise the vast archives of human tissue held by pathology laboratories would be of considerable benefit as retrospective studies comparing NQO1 genotype status, patient history and treatment outcomes could be conducted.

9223293	19970722	Nuclear localization of basonuclin in human keratinocytes and the role of phosphorylation.	Basonuclin is a zinc-finger protein found in basal cells of the epidermis. In human keratinocyte cultures, basonuclin is susceptible to serine-phosphorylation and the addition of the phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, promotes accumulation of basonuclin in the cytoplasm. The region of basonuclin containing the nuclear localization signal of basonuclin is necessary for nuclear localization of the protein and Ser-541, located immediately C-terminal to the nuclear localization signal, is the principal phosphorylation site in vitro. A nearly complete basonuclin transiently expressed in cultured keratinocytes localizes predominantly in the nucleus, but substitution of aspartic acid for Ser-541 promotes cytoplasmic localization. The same substitution of Ser-537 has a similar but weaker effect. Substitution of both serine residues by alanine leads to nuclear localization. These results show that nuclear localization of basonuclin depends on serine dephosphorylation, primarily of Ser-541. Different subcellular locations of basonuclin in different keratinocyte subtypes are therefore most likely to be controlled by the state of phosphorylation of Ser-541. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.

16315267	20051130	GSK3B polymorphisms alter transcription and splicing in Parkinson's disease.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a combination of motor symptoms. We identified two functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in the glycogen synthase kinase-3beta gene (GSK3B). A promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (rs334558) is associated with transcriptional strength in vitro in which the T allele has greater activity. An intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (rs6438552) regulates selection of splice acceptor sites in vitro. The T allele is associated with altered splicing in lymphocytes and increased levels of GSK3B transcripts that lack exons 9 and 11 (GSKDeltaexon9+11). Increased levels of GSKDeltaexon9+11 correlated with enhanced phosphorylation of its substrate, Tau. In a comparison of PD and control brains, there was increased in frequency of T allele (rs6438552) and corresponding increase in GSKDeltaexon9+11 and Tau phosphorylation in PD brains. Conditional logistic regression indicated gene-gene interaction between T/T genotype of rs334558 and H1/H1 haplotype of microtubule-associated protein Tau (MAPT) gene (p = 0.009). There was association between a haplotype (T alleles of both GSK3B polymorphisms) and disease risk after stratification by Tau haplotypes ((H1/H2+H2/H2 individuals: odds ratio, 1.64; p = 0.007; (H1/H1 individuals: odds ratio, 0.68; p &lt; 0.001). Ours results suggest GSK3B polymorphisms alter transcription and splicing and interact with Tau haplotypes to modify disease risk in PD. 	Ann._Neurol.	D016428 D013485
15452196	20040929	New insights on the voltage dependence of the KCa3.1 channel block by internal TBA.	We present in this work a structural model of the open IKCa (KCa3.1) channel derived by homology modeling from the MthK channel structure, and used this model to compute the transmembrane potential profile along the channel pore. This analysis showed that the selectivity filter and the region extending from the channel inner cavity to the internal medium should respectively account for 81% and 16% of the transmembrane potential difference. We found however that the voltage dependence of the IKCa block by the quaternary ammonium ion TBA applied internally is compatible with an apparent electrical distance delta of 0.49 +/- 0.02 (n = 6) for negative potentials. To reconcile this observation with the electrostatic potential profile predicted for the channel pore, we modeled the IKCa block by TBA assuming that the voltage dependence of the block is governed by both the difference in potential between the channel cavity and the internal medium, and the potential profile along the selectivity filter region through an effect on the filter ion occupancy states. The resulting model predicts that delta should be voltage dependent, being larger at negative than positive potentials. The model also indicates that raising the internal K+ concentration should decrease the value of delta measured at negative potentials independently of the external K+ concentration, whereas raising the external K+ concentration should minimally affect delta for concentrations &gt;50 mM. All these predictions are born out by our current experimental results. Finally, we found that the substitutions V275C and V275A increased the voltage sensitivity of the TBA block, suggesting that TBA could move further into the pore, thus leading to stronger interactions between TBA and the ions in the selectivity filter. Globally, these results support a model whereby the voltage dependence of the TBA block in IKCa is mainly governed by the voltage dependence of the ion occupancy states of the selectivity filter.

26147350	20150707	The Protein Level of Rev1, a TLS Polymerase in Fission Yeast, Is Strictly Regulated during the Cell Cycle and after DNA Damage.	Translesion DNA synthesis provides an alternative DNA replication mechanism when template DNA is damaged. In fission yeast, Eso1 (pol?), Kpa1/DinB (pol?), Rev1, and Pol? (a complex of Rev3 and Rev7) have been identified as translesion synthesis polymerases. The enzymatic characteristics and protein-protein interactions of these polymerases have been intensively characterized; however, how these proteins are regulated during the cell cycle remains unclear. Therefore, we examined the cell cycle oscillation of translesion polymerases. Interestingly, the protein levels of Rev1 peaked during G1 phase and then decreased dramatically at the entry of S phase; this regulation was dependent on the proteasome. Temperature-sensitive proteasome mutants, such as mts2-U31 and mts3-U32, stabilized Rev1 protein when the temperature was shifted to the restrictive condition. In addition, deletion of pop1 or pop2, subunits of SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes, upregulated Rev1 protein levels. Besides these effects during the cell cycle, we also observed upregulation of Rev1 protein upon DNA damage. This upregulation was abolished when rad3, a checkpoint protein, was deleted or when the Rev1 promoter was replaced with a constitutive promoter. From these results, we hypothesize that translesion DNA synthesis is strictly controlled through Rev1 protein levels in order to avoid unwanted mutagenesis. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
22898703	20120818	Interleukin 28B genetic polymorphisms play a minor role in identifying optimal treatment duration in HCV genotype 1 slow responders to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin.	Pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 72 weeks improve sustained virological response (SVR) in HCV genotype 1 (HCV-1) slow viral responders. Whether interleukin 28B (IL28B) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes and on-treatment viral responses can identify non-rapid virological response (RVR) patients who benefit from 48 or 72 weeks of therapy remains unclear. Treatment-naive HCV-1 patients who failed to achieve RVR were randomly assigned to receive 48 (n=168) or 72 (n=167) weeks of therapy. Baseline factors and on-treatment virological responses at weeks 8 and 12 were evaluated for SVR in 289 compliant patients who received ?80% of drug dosages and treatment duration, and had end of follow-up viral response. The stratified SVR rates for independent factors were compared by treatment duration. Treatment duration, IL28B rs8099917 genotypes, cirrhosis, week-8 viral response (undetectable HCV RNA at treatment week 8) and complete early virological response (cEVR) predicted SVR. In week-8 viral response patients, the SVR rates of 72-week and 48-week treatment were similar (75-88%), regardless of IL28B SNP genotypes or cirrhosis. In non-week-8 viral response patients who achieved cEVR, the SVR rate of 72-week treatment was higher than that of 48-week treatment for non-cirrhotic patients, regardless of IL28B SNP genotypes (91-100% versus 13-44%; P=0.001). Although IL28B SNP genotypes predict SVR, they play a minor role when on-treatment viral responses are taken into consideration. On-treatment viral responses at weeks 8 and 12 are the key determinants to decide the optimal treatment duration in HCV-1 patients without RVR. 	Antivir._Ther._(Lond.)

9398335	19980131	Metal-catalyzed oxidation and mutagenesis studies on the iron(II) binding site of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase.	The final step in the biosynthesis of the plant signaling molecule ethylene is catalyzed by 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) oxidase, a member of the non-heme iron(II) dependent family of oxygenases and oxidases, which has a requirement for ascorbate as a co-substrate and carbon dioxide as an activator. ACC oxidase (tomato) has a particularly short half-life under catalytic conditions undergoing metal-catalyzed oxidative (MCO) fragmentation. Sequence comparisons of ACC oxidases with isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) and members of the 2-oxoglutarate Fe(II) dependent dioxygenases show an aspartate and two of six ACC oxidase conserved histidine residues are completely conserved throughout this subfamily of Fe(II) dependent oxygenases/oxidases. Previous mutagenesis, spectroscopic, and crystallographic studies on IPNS indicate that the two completely conserved histidine and aspartate residues act as Fe(II) ligands. To investigate the role of the conserved aspartate and histidine residues in ACC oxidase (tomato fruit), they were substituted via site-directed mutagenesis. Modified ACC oxidases produced were H39Q, H56Q, H94Q, H177Q, H177D, H177E, D179E, D179N, H177D&amp;D179E, H211Q, H234Q, H234D, and H234E. Among those histidine mutants replaced by glutamine, H39Q, H56Q, H94Q, and H211Q were catalytically active, indicating these histidines are not essential for catalysis. Mutant enzymes H177D, H177Q, D179N, H177D&amp;D179E, H234Q, H234D, and H234E were catalytically inactive consistent with the assignment of H177, D179, and H234 as iron ligands. Replacement of H177 with glutamate or D179 with glutamate resulted in modified ACC oxidases which still effected the conversion of ACC to ethylene, albeit at a very low level of activity, which was stimulated by bicarbonate. The H177D (inactive), H177E (low activity), D179E (low activity), and H234Q (inactive) modified ACC oxidases all underwent MCO fragmentation, indicating that they can bind iron, dioxygen, ACC, and ascorbate. The results suggest that MCO cleavage results from active site-mediated reactions and imply that, while H177, D179, and H234 are all involved in metal ligation during catalysis, ligation to H234 is not required for fragmentation. It is possible that MCO fragmentation results from reaction of incorrectly folded or &quot;primed&quot; ACC oxidase. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485
16843720	20060718	Fatty acids bound to human serum albumin and its structural variants modulate apolipoprotein B secretion in HepG2 cells.	Epidemiologic studies have shown an inverse relationship between human serum albumin (HSA) levels and coronary heart disease (CHD). However, no mechanisms have been identified to explain this relationship. We hypothesized that this relationship is due to differences in binding affinity of fatty acids to HSA and subsequent atherogenic lipoprotein synthesis and secretion from hepatocytes. To test our hypothesis we undertook the current study. Using HepG2 cells, we demonstrated that oleic acid (OA) bound to HSA in a molar ratio of 4:1 and after incubation for 24 h stimulated apolipoprotein B (apoB) secretion. We also tested whether mutant forms of HSA could alter the binding affinity for fatty acids and change the availability of substrate for lipoprotein secretion. Based on the results obtained in this study using 11 HSA mutant proteins complexed with OA, we were able to classify into three major mutant groups based on their effects on apoB secretion. One group in particular (R410Q/Y411W, R410A/Y411A, and W214L/Y411W) showed a significantly diminished effect on apoB secretion when compared to the wild type HSA/OA complex. Furthermore, the amount of free OA internalized in HepG2 cells in the presence of HSA mutant proteins was in good agreement with the effects seen on apoB secretion by the various HSA mutants. This suggests that some mutant forms of HSA might potentially bind fatty acids with a much higher binding affinity and thus deprive fatty acids available for lipoprotein assembly in hepatocytes. In conclusion, our data illustrate that certain HSA polymorphic forms may be protective against the development of CHD and warrants further investigation. 	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428
27306810	20160617	[Association between Efficacy of Pemetrexed and EGFR Mutation Status for EGFR Mutated Lung Carcinoma].	Subgroup analysis of Japanese patients in a LUX-Lung 3 trial showed different progression-free survival(PFS) after cisplatin (CDDP) plus pemetrexed (PEM) treatment between patients in the exon 21 L858R (L858R) group (8.3 months) and the exon 19 deletion (19 del) group (3.1 months). PEM may have different efficacies in patients with L858R or 19 del. Consecutive patients with advanced/recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)harboring activating EGFR mutations were treated with platinum combined with PEM at our institute. The primary endpoint was to compare PFS of L858R patients to that of 19 del patients, among all patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Thirty-two patients treated between 2009 and 2013 were included. The median age was 67 years (range: 40-78 years). Thirteen patients (41%) had L858R and 19 patients (59%) had 19 del. Patients were treated with CDDP(n=5)or carboplatin (n=27) combined with PEM. Compared with the 19 del group, the L858R group included more female patients(64% versus 47%, p=0.002), fewer patients treated with CDDP (8%versus 21%, p=0.018), and more patients with PEM maintenance therapy (50%versus 29%, p=0.003). The median number of cycles of platinum combined with PEM was 4(range: 1-6), and 13 patients received maintenance therapy. The response rate(RR)was 33.3% among L858R and 22.2% among 19 del (p=0.651). The median PFS was 5.13 months for L858R and 5.40 months for 19 del (p=0.824, HR=1.098, 95% CI: 0.48-2.50). The median overall survival (OS) was 29.17 months for L858R and 32.60 months for 19 del (p=0.232, HR=1.75, 95%CI: 0.69-4.45). This study did not show that PFS after platinum combined with PEM of L858R was superior to that of 19 del. RR and OS were consistent with PFS. A prospective trial is warranted to confirm the results of this study. 	Gan_To_Kagaku_Ryoho	D004740 D016428
21504625	20110421	Novel targeted therapeutics: inhibitors of MDM2, ALK and PARP.	We reviewed preclinical data and clinical development of MDM2 (murine double minute 2), ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) and PARP (poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase) inhibitors. MDM2 binds to p53, and promotes degradation of p53 through ubiquitin-proteasome degradation. JNJ-26854165 and RO5045337 are 2 small-molecule inhibitors of MDM2 in clinical development. ALK is a transmembrane protein and a member of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinases. EML4-ALK fusion gene is identified in approximately 3-13% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Early-phase clinical studies with Crizotinib, an ALK inhibitor, in NSCLC harboring EML4-ALK have demonstrated promising activity with high response rate and prolonged progression-free survival. PARPs are a family of nuclear enzymes that regulates the repair of DNA single-strand breaks through the base excision repair pathway. Randomized phase II study has shown adding PARP-1 inhibitor BSI-201 to cytotoxic chemotherapy improves clinical outcome in patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Olaparib, another oral small-molecule PARP inhibitor, demonstrated encouraging single-agent activity in patients with advanced breast or ovarian cancer. There are 5 other PARP inhibitors currently under active clinical investigation. 	J_Hematol_Oncol	D016428 D016454
27063057	20160412	Biallelic Mutations in GNB3 Cause a Unique Form of Autosomal-Recessive Congenital Stationary Night Blindness.	Congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) is a heterogeneous group of non-progressive inherited retinal disorders with characteristic electroretinogram (ERG) abnormalities. Riggs and Schubert-Bornschein are subtypes of CSNB and demonstrate distinct ERG features. Riggs CSNB demonstrates selective rod photoreceptor dysfunction and occurs due to mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in rod phototransduction cascade; night blindness is the only symptom and eye examination is otherwise normal. Schubert-Bornschein CSNB is a consequence of impaired signal transmission between the photoreceptors and bipolar cells. Schubert-Bornschein CSNB is subdivided into complete CSNB with an ON bipolar signaling defect and incomplete CSNB with both ON and OFF pathway involvement. Both subtypes are associated with variable degrees of night blindness or photophobia, reduced visual acuity, high myopia, and nystagmus. Whole-exome sequencing of a family screened negative for mutations in genes associated with CSNB identified biallelic mutations in the guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-3 gene (GNB3). Two siblings were compound heterozygous for a deletion (c.170_172delAGA [p.Lys57del]) and a nonsense mutation (c.1017G&gt;A [p.Trp339(?)]). The maternal aunt was homozygous for the nonsense mutation (c.1017G&gt;A [p.Trp339(?)]). Mutational analysis of GNB3 in a cohort of 58 subjects with CSNB identified a sporadic case individual with a homozygous GNB3 mutation (c.200C&gt;T [p.Ser67Phe]). GNB3 encodes the ? subunit of G protein heterotrimer (G???) and is known to modulate ON bipolar cell signaling and cone transducin function in mice. Affected human subjects showed an unusual CSNB phenotype with variable degrees of ON bipolar dysfunction and reduced cone sensitivity. This unique retinal disorder with dual anomaly in visual processing expands our knowledge about retinal signaling. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
23382314	20130206	Homocysteine plasma levels in patients treated with antiepileptic drugs depend on folate and vitamin B12 serum levels, but not on genetic variants of homocysteine metabolism.	Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are commonly used in the treatment of epilepsy, psychiatric diseases and pain disorders. Several of these drugs influence blood levels of folate and vitamin B12 and, consequently, homocysteine. This may be relevant for AED effects and side effects. However, not only folate and vitamin B12, but also genetic variants modify homocysteine metabolism. Here, we aimed to determine whether there is a pharmacogenetic interaction between folate, vitamin B12 and genetic variants and homocysteine plasma level in AED-treated patients. In this mono-center study, we measured homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12 plasma levels in a population of 498 AED-treated adult patients with epilepsy. In addition, we analyzed the genotypes of seven common genetic variants of homocysteine metabolism: methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) c.677C&gt;T and c.1298A&gt;C, methionine synthase (MTR) c.2756A&gt;G, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) c.594+59del19bp, cystathionine ?-synthase (CBS) c.844_855ins68, transcobalamin 2 (TC2) c.776C&gt;G and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) c.66G&gt;A. On multivariate logistic regression, folate and vitamin B12 levels, but none of the genetic variants, were predictive for homocysteine levels. These data suggest that, in AED-treated patients, folate and vitamin B12 play important roles in the development of hyperhomocysteinemia, whereas genetic variants of homocysteine metabolism do not and thus do not contribute to the risk of developing hyperhomocysteinemia during AED treatment.

25207168	20140911	Polymorphism in Integrin ITGA2 is Associated with Ischemic Stroke and Altered Serum Cholesterol in Chinese Individuals.	Recent studies have reported contrasting results regarding the association of polymorphisms in two integrin genes, ITGA2 and ITGB3, with ischemic stroke. The present study aimed to investigate the correlation between the ITGA2 C807T and ITGB3 T176C polymorphic loci with ischemic stroke, as well as plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels. Case control study. Human venous blood samples were collected from patients admitted for ischemic stroke (n=350, 'patients') and healthy individuals (n=300, 'controls'). Blood was genotyped at these loci by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels were measured by routine enzymatic, masking, and turbidimetry methods. As expected, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein were all significantly higher in patients than in controls (p&lt;0.05). Genotype and allele frequencies of ITGA2 C807T were significantly different between patients and controls (p&lt;0.05), but no difference was detected in genotype or allele frequencies for ITGA3 T176C. For ITGA-2, the T allele conferred a 1.226 times higher relative risk of ischemic stroke than the C allele (odds ratio=1.226, 95% confidence interval=1.053-1.428). Similarly, total cholesterol was higher in T allele carriers than in non-carriers (p&lt;0.05). ITGA2 C807T polymorphism is associated with ischemic stroke, with the T allele acting as a susceptibility allele that appears to confer increased cholesterol levels. 	Balkan_Med_J	D016428
21324902	20110218	Small ubiquitin-related modifier ligase activity of Mms21 is required for maintenance of chromosome integrity during the unperturbed mitotic cell division cycle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	The SUMO ligase activity of Mms21/Nse2, a conserved member of the Smc5/6 complex, is required for resisting extrinsically induced genotoxic stress. We report that the Mms21 SUMO ligase activity is also required during the unchallenged mitotic cell cycle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SUMO ligase-defective cells were slow growing and spontaneously incurred DNA damage. These cells required caffeine-sensitive Mec1 kinase-dependent checkpoint signaling for survival even in the absence of extrinsically induced genotoxic stress. SUMO ligase-defective cells were sensitive to replication stress and displayed synthetic growth defects with DNA damage checkpoint-defective mutants such as mec1, rad9, and rad24. MMS21 SUMO ligase and mediator of replication checkpoint 1 gene (MRC1) were epistatic with respect to hydroxyurea-induced replication stress or methyl methanesulfonate-induced DNA damage sensitivity. Subjecting Mms21 SUMO ligase-deficient cells to transient replication stress resulted in enhancement of cell cycle progression defects such as mitotic delay and accumulation of hyperploid cells. Consistent with the spontaneous activation of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway observed in the Mms21-mediated sumoylation-deficient cells, enhanced frequency of chromosome breakage and loss was detected in these mutant cells. A mutation in the conserved cysteine 221 that is engaged in coordination of the zinc ion in Loop 2 of the Mms21 SPL-RING E3 ligase catalytic domain resulted in strong replication stress sensitivity and also conferred slow growth and Mec1 dependence to unchallenged mitotically dividing cells. Our findings establish Mms21-mediated sumoylation as a determinant of cell cycle progression and maintenance of chromosome integrity during the unperturbed mitotic cell division cycle in budding yeast.

26227255	20150801	Secretory meningioma with KLF4 K409Q mutation in collision with glioma.	The simultaneous occurrence of two primary intracranial tumors is a rare event, especially if unrelated to radiotherapy or genetic disorders. We present two patients, both with two primary intracranial tumors simultaneously present at adjacent sites, in order to explore a possible mechanism of synchronous tumor formation. We performed a molecular analysis of the K409Q mutation of the KLF4 gene, in addition to conventional immunohistochemistry. Preoperative gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging revealed a necrotic mass with an irregular ring-like enhancement adjacent to a frontal meningioma in patient 1, and an infiltrative non-enhancing glial tumor with no evidence of another tumor in patient 2. Postoperative histological examination revealed the presence of two distinct tumors in both cases: secretory meningioma and glioblastoma in patient 1 and secretory meningioma and anaplastic astrocytoma in patient 2. Secretory meningiomas both showed the KLF4 K409Q mutation, while none of the glial tumors had it. To our knowledge, these are the first two cases reported of the simultaneous occurrence of secretory meningiomas with mutation of KLF4 in collision with a glioblastoma and an anaplastic astrocytoma, respectively. These collision tumors presumably have different molecular origins. 	Clin._Neuropathol.	D002363 D016428 D013485
10824039	20000529	Efflux and target mutations as quinolone resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae.	The aim of this study was to characterize quinolone resistance mechanisms in strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae with increased MICs of ofloxacin. These strains were also tested for their susceptibility to a battery of quinolone antimicrobial agents, including gemifloxacin. Of the S. pneumoniae isolates used, 27 were susceptible to ofloxacin, 18 intermediate and 48 resistant (ofloxacin MIC &lt;4, 4 and &gt;4 mg/L, respectively). In general, the ofloxacin-susceptible strains had no amino acid substitutions in GyrA, GyrB, ParC or ParE. Moderate increases in MIC were associated with substitutions in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of ParC, while the highest MICs were found for strains that also had substitutions in the QRDR of GyrA. The most common substitutions were Ser79--&gt;Phe in ParC and Ser81--&gt;Phe in GyrA. Other substitutions were identified within the QRDR of ParC and outside the QRDR of ParC and ParE; these did not appear to affect susceptibility. The effects of antimicrobial efflux pumps were studied by determining MICs of a range of quinolones in the presence and absence of reserpine, an inhibitor of Gram-positive efflux pumps. Our results indicated that high-level resistance, caused entirely by efflux, was seen in a minority of ofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Testing the susceptibility of quinolone-resistant strains to gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and trovafloxacin revealed that gemifloxacin was least affected by this large variety of resistance mechanisms and was the only quinolone with MICs of &lt; or =0.5 mg/L for all strains in this study. These results suggest that gemifloxacin is highly potent against S. pneumoniae and may also be effective against strains resistant to other quinolones. 	J._Antimicrob._Chemother.	D016428
23532817	20130328	Evidence for predictive role of BRCA1 and bTUBIII in gastric cancer.	Sensitivity of gastric cancer (GC) to conventional cytotoxic therapy may be at least in part attributed to molecular features of the tumor cells. We analyzed all patients with metastatic GC treated in the N.N. Petrov Institute of Oncology (St. Petersburg) within years 1999-2010 and identified 65 cases with evaluable treatment response and available biological material. Two of 65 patients (3 %) carried germ-line BRCA1 5382insC mutation and demonstrated particularly pronounced response to the treatment; both of their tumors showed loss of the remaining BRCA1 allele, thus confirming the causative role of BRCA1 heterozygosity in GC predisposition. RNA expression of TS, DPD, BRCA1, ERCC, TOP2A and bTUBIII was analyzed in the remaining 63 tumors. Low BRCA1 expression was associated with increased response rate [6/9 (67 %) vs. 17/54 (32 %), p = 0.04]. Low bTUBIII level correlated with the improved probability of tumor response [21/49 (43 %) vs. 1/13 (8 %), p = 0.02] and prolonged overall survival (10.5 vs. 7.1 months, p = 0.02); this trend was maintained both for taxane-containing and for taxane-free drug combinations. We conclude that GC should be considered as a part of BRCA1-related hereditary cancer syndrome. Tumors with BRCA1 inactivation and low bTUBIII expression demonstrate improved response to cytotoxic therapy. 	Med._Oncol.	D016428 D013485
24671188	20140328	Designing a high-throughput somatic mutation profiling panel specifically for gynaecological cancers.	Somatic mutations play a major role in tumour initiation and progression. The mutation status of a tumour may predict prognosis and guide targeted therapies. The majority of techniques to study oncogenic mutations require high quality and quantity DNA or are analytically challenging. Mass-spectrometry based mutation analysis however is a relatively simple and high-throughput method suitable for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour material. Targeted gene panels using this technique have been developed for several types of cancer. These current cancer hotspot panels are not focussed on the genes that are most relevant in gynaecological cancers. In this study, we report the design and validation of a novel, mass-spectrometry based panel specifically for gynaecological malignancies and present the frequencies of detected mutations. Using frequency data from the online Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer, we selected 171 somatic hotspot mutations in the 13 most important genes for gynaecological cancers, being BRAF, CDKN2A, CTNNB1, FBXW7, FGFR2, FGFR3, FOXL2, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA, PPP2R1A and PTEN. A total of 546 tumours (205 cervical, 227 endometrial, 89 ovarian, and 25 vulvar carcinomas) were used to test and validate our panel, and to study the prevalence and spectrum of somatic mutations in these types of cancer. The results were validated by testing duplicate samples and by allele-specific qPCR. The panel presented here using mass-spectrometry shows to be reproducible and high-throughput, and is usefull in FFPE material of low quality and quantity. It provides new possibilities for studying large numbers of gynaecological tumour samples in daily practice, and could be useful in guided therapy selection. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428
27245341	20160602	Co-lyophilized Aspirin with Trehalose Causes Less Injury to Human Gastric Cells and Gastric Mucosa of Rats.	Aspirin is one of the most popular NSAIDs worldwide because of its anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant effects, and however, gastrointestinal injury remains a major complication. We previously reported co-lyophilized aspirin/trehalose (Lyo A/T) decreased the aspirin-induced gastric lesions in dogs. This study investigated the mechanism of gastroprotective effects of trehalose in vitro and in vivo. The apoptotic assays were performed in a human gastric carcinoma cell line, which was treated with aspirin, mixed aspirin/trehalose (Mix A/T) or Lyo A/T. Gastric ulcer severity was examined after oral administration of drugs in rats. In addition, the mucosal tissue apoptotic status in drug-treated rats was evaluated. Molecular dynamics simulations and laser Raman spectroscopy were performed in order to examine the molecular properties of Lyo A/T. DNA fragmentation was detected in AGS cells that were treated with aspirin and Mix A/T, but not in the Lyo A/T-treated cells. There were fewer apoptotic cells in the Lyo A/T-treated cells than in the other cells. Gastric injury was reduced in rats that received oral Lyo A/T compared with the others, while PGE2 synthesis was equally decreased in all groups. TUNEL assay and immunohistochemistry of cleaved caspase-3 in the mucosal tissues also revealed that Lyo A/T treatment induced less apoptosis than the others. The Lyo A/T spectrum showed clear differences in several Raman bands compared with that of Mix A/T. Our data showed that co-lyophilization of aspirin with trehalose reduced gastric injury, potentially through suppression of aspirin-induced mucosal cell apoptosis while retaining its anti-inflammatory effects.

26464963	20151015	Nuclear Arc Interacts with the Histone Acetyltransferase Tip60 to Modify H4K12 Acetylation(1,2,3).	Arc is an immediate-early gene whose genetic ablation selectively abrogates long-term memory, indicating a critical role in memory consolidation. Although Arc protein is found at synapses, it also localizes to the neuronal nucleus, where its function is less understood. Nuclear Arc forms a complex with the ?-spectrin isoform ?SpIV?5 and associates with PML bodies, sites of epigenetic regulation of gene expression. We report here a novel interaction between Arc and Tip60, a histone-acetyltransferase and subunit of a chromatin-remodelling complex, using biochemistry and super-resolution microscopy in primary rat hippocampal neurons. Arc and ?SpIV?5 are recruited to nuclear Tip60 speckles, and the three proteins form a tight complex that localizes to nuclear perichromatin regions, sites of transcriptional activity. Neuronal activity-induced expression of Arc (1) increases endogenous nuclear Tip60 puncta, (2) recruits Tip60 to PML bodies, and (3) increases histone acetylation of Tip60 substrate H4K12, a learning-induced chromatin modification. These mechanisms point to an epigenetic role for Arc in regulating memory consolidation. 	eNeuro	D016428
7873934	19940801	Mutational analysis of the sugar-binding site of pea lectin.	Comparison of x-ray crystal structures of several legume lectins, co-crystallized with sugar molecules, showed a strong conservation of amino acid residues directly involved in ligand binding. For pea (Pisum sativum) lectin (PSL), these conserved amino acids can be classified into three groups: (I) D81 and N125, present in all legume lectins studied so far; (II) G99 and G216, conserved in almost all legume lectins; and (III) A217 and E218, which are only found in Vicieae lectins and are possibly determinants of sugar-binding specificity. Each of these amino acids in PSL was changed by site-directed mutagenesis, resulting in PSL molecules with single substitutions: for group I D81A, D81N, N125A; for group II G99R, G216L; and for group III A217L, E218Q, respectively. PSL double mutant Y124R; A126S was included as a control. The modified PSL molecules appeared not to be affected in their ability to form dimeric proteins, whereas the sugar-binding activity of each of the PSL mutants, with the exception of the control mutant (as shown by haemagglutination assays), was completely eliminated. These results confirm the model of the sugar-binding site of Vicieae lectins as deduced from X-ray analysis. 	Glycoconj._J.	D016428 D013485
9664610	19980717	Prenatal diagnosis of Apert syndrome.	Apert syndrome (AS) is clinically characterized by typical facial features and symmetrical syndactyly of the digits. AS is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Recently, a fibroblast growth factor receptors 2 (FGFR2) mutation, either C934G or C937G, was identified in exon IIIa. Our report documents an affected mother and son in whom one of the two mutations in AS had occurred sporadically in the mother. The diagnosed of AS was based on associated abnormal physical features and on molecular genetic analysis. A C-to-G transversion at position 937 of the cDNA resulting in a proline-to-arginine substitution at codon 259 was found in the mother. In her second pregnancy, prenatal diagnosis by both restriction analysis and direct sequencing was undertaken and this showed that the female fetus had not inherited the mutation. 	Prenat._Diagn.

24848695	20140523	Genetic variations and diseases in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: the ins and outs of expert manual curation.	During the last few years, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have accelerated the detection of genetic variants resulting in the rapid discovery of new disease-associated genes. However, the wealth of variation data made available by NGS alone is not sufficient to understand the mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis and manifestation. Multidisciplinary approaches combining sequence and clinical data with prior biological knowledge are needed to unravel the role of genetic variants in human health and disease. In this context, it is crucial that these data are linked, organized, and made readily available through reliable online resources. The Swiss-Prot section of the Universal Protein Knowledgebase (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot) provides the scientific community with a collection of information on protein functions, interactions, biological pathways, as well as human genetic diseases and variants, all manually reviewed by experts. In this article, we present an overview of the information content of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot to show how this knowledgebase can support researchers in the elucidation of the mechanisms leading from a molecular defect to a disease phenotype.

11320302	20010426	Structures of three diphtheria toxin repressor (DtxR) variants with decreased repressor activity.	The diphtheria toxin repressor (DtxR) from Corynebacterium diphtheriae regulates the expression of the gene on corynebacteriophages that encodes diphtheria toxin (DT). Other genes regulated by DtxR include those that encode proteins involved in siderophore-mediated iron uptake. DtxR requires activation by divalent metals and holo-DtxR is a dimeric regulator with two distinct metal-binding sites per three-domain monomer. At site 1, three side chains and a sulfate or phosphate anion are involved in metal coordination. In the DtxR-DNA complex this anion is replaced by the side chain of Glu170 provided by the third domain of the repressor. At site 2 the metal ion is coordinated exclusively by constituents of the polypeptide chain. In this paper, five crystal structures of three DtxR variants focusing on residues Glu20, Arg80 and Cys102 are reported. The resolution of these structures ranges from 2.3 to 2.8 A. The side chain of Glu20 provided by the DNA-binding domain forms a salt bridge to Arg80, which in turn interacts with the anion. Replacing either of the salt-bridge partners with an alanine reduces repressor activity substantially and it has been inferred that the salt bridge could possibly control the wedge angle between the DNA-binding domain and the dimerization domain, thereby modulating repressor activity. Cys102 is a key residue of metal site 2 and its substitution into a serine abolishes repressor activity. The crystal structures of Zn-Glu20Ala-DtxR, Zn-Arg80Ala-DtxR, Cd-Cys102Ser-DtxR and apo-Cys102Ser-DtxR in two related space groups reveal that none of these substitutions leads to dramatic rearrangements of the DtxR fold. However, the five crystal structures presented here show significant local changes and a considerable degree of flexibility of the DNA-binding domain with respect to the dimerization domain. Furthermore, all five structures deviate significantly from the structure in the DtxR-DNA complex with respect to overall domain orientation. These results confirm the importance of the hinge motion for repressor activity. Since the third domain has often been invisible in previous crystal structures of DtxR, it is also noteworthy that the SH3-like domain could be traced in four of the five crystal structures.

25785008	20150319	Contribution of glutathione S-transferase gene polymorphisms to development of skin cancer.	Glutathione S-transferase (GST) family genes are of vital importance in maintaining cellular defence systems, protecting cells against the toxic effects of reactive oxygen produced during the synthesis of melanin, and detoxifying environmental mutagens and chemical or synthetic drugs. As no previous meta-analyses have examined the association of polymorphisms at GSTT1, GSTP1 Ile105Val with skin cancer risk and independently published studies have produced inconsistent conclusions, we were promoted to estimate the associations in the largest study to date. Computer-assisted searches were carried out to systematically identify the studies of GST polymorphisms and skin cancer. The eligibility of studies was evaluated following the requirements of inclusion criteria. Risk of skin cancers (OR and 95% CI) was assessed with the fixed or random effects meta-analysis. The fixed effects meta-analysis of 15 studies suggested no overall association between GSTT1 null and skin cancer. Nor was there a significant association in any subgroup. However, in the stratified analysis by histologic type for GSTP1 Ile105Val, we found 1.56 times higher risk of malignant melanoma (MM) among people with the 105-Val/Val genotype (Val/Val vs. Ile/Ile: OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.05-2.32, pheterogeneity = 0.584). These statistical data demonstrate that Ile105Val polymorphism of the GSTP1 gene may have genetic contribution to the development of skin cancer, MM in particular. 	Int_J_Clin_Exp_Med	D016428
24409095	20140111	Exocytosis of ATP from astrocytes modulates phasic and tonic inhibition in the neocortex.	Communication between neuronal and glial cells is important for many brain functions. Astrocytes can modulate synaptic strength via Ca(2+)-stimulated release of various gliotransmitters, including glutamate and ATP. A physiological role of ATP release from astrocytes was suggested by its contribution to glial Ca(2+)-waves and purinergic modulation of neuronal activity and sleep homeostasis. The mechanisms underlying release of gliotransmitters remain uncertain, and exocytosis is the most intriguing and debated pathway. We investigated release of ATP from acutely dissociated cortical astrocytes using &quot;sniff-cell&quot; approach and demonstrated that release is vesicular in nature and can be triggered by elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) via metabotropic and ionotropic receptors or direct UV-uncaging. The exocytosis of ATP from neocortical astrocytes occurred in the millisecond time scale contrasting with much slower nonvesicular release of gliotransmitters via Best1 and TREK-1 channels, reported recently in hippocampus. Furthermore, we discovered that elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) in cortical astrocytes triggered the release of ATP that directly activated quantal purinergic currents in the pyramidal neurons. The glia-driven burst of purinergic currents in neurons was followed by significant attenuation of both synaptic and tonic inhibition. The Ca(2+)-entry through the neuronal P2X purinoreceptors led to phosphorylation-dependent down-regulation of GABAA receptors. The negative purinergic modulation of postsynaptic GABA receptors was accompanied by small presynaptic enhancement of GABA release. Glia-driven purinergic modulation of inhibitory transmission was not observed in neurons when astrocytes expressed dn-SNARE to impair exocytosis. The astrocyte-driven purinergic currents and glia-driven modulation of GABA receptors were significantly reduced in the P2X4 KO mice. Our data provide a key evidence to support the physiological importance of exocytosis of ATP from astrocytes in the neocortex. 	PLoS_Biol.	D016428
23970553	20130824	The epithelial calcium channel TRPV5 is regulated differentially by klotho and sialidase.	The transient receptor potential vanilloid type 5 (TRPV5) Ca(2+) channel facilitates transcellular Ca(2+) transport in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) of the kidney. The channel is glycosylated with a complex type N-glycan and it has been postulated that hydrolysis of the terminal sialic acid(s) stimulate TRPV5 activity. The present study delineates the role of the N-glycan in TRPV5 activity using biochemical assays in Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells expressing TRPV5, isoelectric focusing and total internal reflection fluorescent microscopy. The anti-aging hormone klotho and other glycosidases stimulate TRPV5-dependent Ca(2+) uptake. Klotho was found to increase the plasma membrane stability of TRPV5, via the TRPV5 N-glycan. Sialidase mimicked this stimulatory action. However, this effect was independent of the N-glycosylation state of TRPV5, since the N-glycosylation mutant (TRPV5(N358Q)) was activated to the same extent. We showed that the increased TRPV5 activity after sialidase treatment is caused by inhibition of lipid raft-mediated internalization. In addition, sialidase modified the N-glycan of transferrin, a model glycoprotein, differently from klotho. Previous studies showed that after klotho treatment, galectin-1 binds the TRPV5 N-glycan and thereby increases TRPV5 activity. However, galectin-3, but not galectin-1, was expressed in the DCT. Furthermore, an increase in TRPV5-mediated Ca(2+) uptake was detected after galectin-3 treatment. In conclusion, two distinct TRPV5 stimulatory mechanisms were demonstrated; a klotho-mediated effect that is dependent on the N-glycan of TRPV5 and a sialidase-mediated stimulation that is lipid raft-dependent and independent of the N-glycan of TRPV5.

10653790	20000202	A point mutation in domain 4-segment 6 of the skeletal muscle sodium channel produces an atypical inactivation state.	We compared wild-type rat skeletal muscle NaChs (micro1) and a mutant NaCh (Y1586K) that has a single amino acid substitution, lysine (K) for tyrosine (Y), at position 1586 in the S6 transmembrane segment of domain 4. In Y1586K, macroscopic current decay is faster, the V(1/2) of the activation curve is shifted in the depolarized direction, and the fast-inactivation curve is less steep compared with mu1. After an 8-ms depolarization pulse, Y1586K recovers from inactivation much more slowly than mu1. The recovery is double exponential, suggesting recovery from two inactivation states. Varying the depolarization protocols isolates entry into an additional, &quot;atypical&quot; inactivation state in Y1586K that is distinct from typical fast or slow inactivation. Substitution of positively charged arginine (R) at Y1586 produces an inactivation phenotype similar to that of Y1586K. Substitution by negatively charged aspartic acid (D) or uncharged alanine (A) at Y1586 produces an inactivation phenotype similar to mu1. Our results suggest that the positive charge of lysine (K) produces the atypical inactivation state in Y1586K. We propose that a conformational change during depolarization alters the relative position of the 1586K residue in the D4-S6 segment and that atypical inactivation in Y1586K occurs via an electrostatic interaction in or near the inner pore region.

21573226	20110517	Regional environmental breadth predicts geographic range and longevity in fossil marine genera.	Geographic range is a good indicator of extinction susceptibility in fossil marine species and higher taxa. The widely-recognized positive correlation between geographic range and taxonomic duration is typically attributed to either accumulating geographic range with age or an extinction buffering effect, whereby cosmopolitan taxa persist longer because they are reintroduced by dispersal from remote source populations after local extinction. The former hypothesis predicts that all taxa within a region should have equal probabilities of extinction regardless of global distributions while the latter predicts that cosmopolitan genera will have greater survivorship within a region than endemics within the same region. Here we test the assumption that all taxa within a region have equal likelihoods of extinction. We use North American and European occurrences of marine genera from the Paleobiology Database and the areal extent of marine sedimentary cover in North America to show that endemic and cosmopolitan fossil marine genera have significantly different range-duration relationships and that broad geographic range and longevity are both predicted by regional environmental breadth. Specifically, genera that occur outside of the focal region are significantly longer lived and have larger geographic ranges and environmental breadths within the focal region than do their endemic counterparts, even after controlling for differences in sampling intensity. Analyses of the number of paleoenvironmental zones occupied by endemic and cosmopolitan genera suggest that the number of paleoenvironmental zones occupied is a key factor of geographic range that promotes genus survivorship. Wide environmental tolerances within a single region predict both broad geographic range and increased longevity in marine genera over evolutionary time. This result provides a specific driving mechanism for the spatial and temporal distributions of marine genera at regional and global scales and is consistent with the niche-breadth hypothesis operating on macroevolutionary timescales.

3663617	19870728	Molecular mechanics and dynamics calculations on (dA)10.(dT)10 incorporating distance constraints derived from NMR relaxation measurements.	Structural constraints derived from proton NMR relaxation measurements on poly(dA).poly(dT) in the form of interproton separations and orientation have been combined with molecular mechanics and annealed molecular dynamics calculations to derive a model for the solution-state structure of this molecule. Three different possible starting configurations, including the standard A and B forms of Arnott and Hukins [Arnott, S., &amp; Hukins, D. W. L. (1972) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 47, 1506-1509] and the heteronomous (H) structure [Arnott, S., Chandrasekaran, R., Hall, I. H., &amp; Puigjaner, L. C. (1983) Nucleic Acids Res. 11, 4141-4155], were examined. Both the B- and H-DNA structures converged to the same B-like structure (approximately C2'-endo conformation on both the A and T sugars, glycosidic bond torsional angle of 63-73 degrees) with the same energies and average helical parameters that gave good fits of the NMR relaxation rates. This model also accounts for the experimental observation [Behling, R. W., &amp; Kearns, D. R. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 3335-3346] that the AH2 proton interacts more strongly with the H1' sugar proton on the T strand than on the A strand. Although the helix repeat angle (39 degrees) is larger than that for standard B-DNA (36 degrees), this does not result in a significantly smaller minor groove, as monitored by the interstrand P-P separation. Calculations starting with the A-DNA structure lead to a very high energy structure that gave a poorer fit of the NMR data. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013486

To study allelic frequency of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) of Han ethnicity in north China and to determine whether there is a specific allele of TNF-alpha associated with GDM susceptibility. By using PCR-RFLP, we detected the distribution of TNF-alpha promoter alleles frequency in GDM women and control normal pregnant women. Plasma TNF-alpha levels and insulin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. (1) There was a significant increase of A alleles frequency of TNF-alpha promoter -308 gene in GDM women compared with control group (61.4% vs 30.0%, P &lt; 0.05) and an increase of the AA + GA genotype was observed in GDM group (71.4% vs 37.1%, P &lt; 0.05).

15994751	20050705	Mutational spectrum of steroid 21-hydroxylase and the genotype-phenotype association in Middle European patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.	To analyze the mutational spectrum of steroid 21-hydroxylase (CYP21) and the genotype- phenotype correlation in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) registered in the Middle European Society for Pediatric Endocrinology CAH database, and to design a reliable and rational approach for CYP21 mutation detection in Middle European populations. Molecular analysis of the CYP21 gene was performed in 432 CAH patients and 298 family members. Low-resolution genotyping was performed to detect the eight most common point mutations. High-resolution genotyping, including Southern blotting and sequencing was performed to detect CYP21 gene deletions, conversions, point mutations or other sequence changes. CYP21 gene deletion and In2 and Ile172Asn mutation accounted for 72.7% of the affected alleles in the whole study group. A good genotype-phenotype correlation was observed, with the exception of Ile172Asn and Pro30Leu mutations. In 37% of patients low resolution genotyping could not identify the causative mutation or distinguish homozygosity from hemizygosity. Using high-resolution genotyping, the causative mutations could be identified in 341 out of 348 analyzed patients. A novel mutation Gln315Stop was found in one simple virilising CAH (SV-CAH) patient from Austria. In the remaining seven patients polymorphisms were identified as the leading sequence alteration. The presence of elevated basal and ACTH-stimulated 17-hydroxyprogesterone, premature pubarche, advanced bone age and clitoral hypertrophy directly implicated Asn493Ser polymorphism in the manifestation of nonclassical- (NC) and even SV-CAH. By genotyping for the most common point mutations, CYP21 gene deletion/conversion and the 8 bp deletion in exon 3, it should be possible to identify the mutation in 94-99% of the diseased alleles in any investigated Middle European population. In patients with a mild form of the disease and no detectable mutation CYP21 gene polymorphisms should be considered as a plausible disease-causing mutation. 	Eur._J._Endocrinol.	D016428 D013485
12530935	20030118	G-protein beta3 subunit 825T allele and hypertension.	The G-protein beta3 subunit (GNB3) C825T polymorphism was detected through a classical candidate gene approach using cell lines with enhanced G-protein activation from patients with essential hypertension. The 825T allele is associated with the expression of a shortened, functionally active splice variant of the G-protein beta3 subunit and enhanced intracellular signal transduction. Independent studies have confirmed an association of the 825T allele with hypertension in whites. Potential pathogenetic mechanisms comprise an increased susceptibility for obesity in 825T allele carriers and, potentially, increased responsiveness to vasoactive hormones. Both phenomena appear to be strongly influenced by lifestyle in the sense of a gene-environment interaction. Whether hypertensive 825T allele carriers are at increased risk for stroke and left ventricular hypertrophy remains controversial. Current studies try to define optimal therapy strategies for hypertensive 825T allele carriers. 	Curr._Hypertens._Rep.	D016428 D016454
23936409	20130813	Structural integrity of the Greek key motif in ??-crystallins is vital for central eye lens transparency.	We highlight an unrecognized physiological role for the Greek key motif, an evolutionarily conserved super-secondary structural topology of the ??-crystallins. These proteins constitute the bulk of the human eye lens, packed at very high concentrations in a compact, globular, short-range order, generating transparency. Congenital cataract (affecting 400,000 newborns yearly worldwide), associated with 54 mutations in ??-crystallins, occurs in two major phenotypes nuclear cataract, which blocks the central visual axis, hampering the development of the growing eye and demanding earliest intervention, and the milder peripheral progressive cataract where surgery can wait. In order to understand this phenotypic dichotomy at the molecular level, we have studied the structural and aggregation features of representative mutations. Wild type and several representative mutant proteins were cloned, expressed and purified and their secondary and tertiary structural details, as well as structural stability, were compared in solution, using spectroscopy. Their tendencies to aggregate in vitro and in cellulo were also compared. In addition, we analyzed their structural differences by molecular modeling in silico. Based on their properties, mutants are seen to fall into two classes. Mutants A36P, L45PL54P, R140X, and G165fs display lowered solubility and structural stability, expose several buried residues to the surface, aggregate in vitro and in cellulo, and disturb/distort the Greek key motif. And they are associated with nuclear cataract. In contrast, mutants P24T and R77S, associated with peripheral cataract, behave quite similar to the wild type molecule, and do not affect the Greek key topology. When a mutation distorts even one of the four Greek key motifs, the protein readily self-aggregates and precipitates, consistent with the phenotype of nuclear cataract, while mutations not affecting the motif display 'native state aggregation', leading to peripheral cataract, thus offering a protein structural rationale for the cataract phenotypic dichotomy &quot;distort motif, lose central vision&quot;.

24472686	20140130	Application of experimentally verified transcription factor binding sites models for computational analysis of ChIP-Seq data.	ChIP-Seq is widely used to detect genomic segments bound by transcription factors (TF), either directly at DNA binding sites (BSs) or indirectly via other proteins. Currently, there are many software tools implementing different approaches to identify TFBSs within ChIP-Seq peaks. However, their use for the interpretation of ChIP-Seq data is usually complicated by the absence of direct experimental verification, making it difficult both to set a threshold to avoid recognition of too many false-positive BSs, and to compare the actual performance of different models. Using ChIP-Seq data for FoxA2 binding loci in mouse adult liver and human HepG2 cells we compared FoxA binding-site predictions for four computational models of two fundamental classes: pattern matching based on existing training set of experimentally confirmed TFBSs (oPWM and SiteGA) and de novo motif discovery (ChIPMunk and diChIPMunk). To properly select prediction thresholds for the models, we experimentally evaluated affinity of 64 predicted FoxA BSs using EMSA that allows safely distinguishing sequences able to bind TF. As a result we identified thousands of reliable FoxA BSs within ChIP-Seq loci from mouse liver and human HepG2 cells. It was found that the performance of conventional position weight matrix (PWM) models was inferior with the highest false positive rate. On the contrary, the best recognition efficiency was achieved by the combination of SiteGA &amp; diChIPMunk/ChIPMunk models, properly identifying FoxA BSs in up to 90% of loci for both mouse and human ChIP-Seq datasets. The experimental study of TF binding to oligonucleotides corresponding to predicted sites increases the reliability of computational methods for TFBS-recognition in ChIP-Seq data analysis. Regarding ChIP-Seq data interpretation, basic PWMs have inferior TFBS recognition quality compared to the more sophisticated SiteGA and de novo motif discovery methods. A combination of models from different principles allowed identification of proper TFBSs. 	BMC_Genomics	D016428 D013485
21915195	20110915	A practical two-step procedure for the preparation of enantiopure pyridines: Multicomponent reactions of alkoxyallenes, nitriles and carboxylic acids followed by a cyclocondensation reaction.	A practical approach to highly functionalized 4-hydroxypyridine derivatives with stereogenic side chains in the 2- and 6-positions is described. The presented two-step process utilizes a multicomponent reaction of alkoxyallenes, nitriles and carboxylic acids to provide ?-methoxy-?-ketoenamides which are transformed into 4-hydroxypyridines in a subsequent cyclocondensation. The process shows broad substrate scope and leads to differentially substituted enantiopure pyridines in good to moderate yields. The preparation of diverse substituted lactic acid derived pyrid-4-yl nonaflates is described. Additional evidence for the postulated mechanism of the multicomponent reaction is presented.

24498133	20140206	Pleiotropic effects of Sox2 during the development of the zebrafish epithalamus.	The zebrafish epithalamus is part of the diencephalon and encompasses three major components: the pineal, the parapineal and the habenular nuclei. Using sox2 knockdown, we show here that this key transcriptional regulator has pleiotropic effects during the development of these structures. Sox2 negatively regulates pineal neurogenesis. Also, Sox2 is identified as the unknown factor responsible for pineal photoreceptor prepatterning and performs this function independently of the BMP signaling. The correct levels of sox2 are critical for the functionally important asymmetrical positioning of the parapineal organ and for the migration of parapineal cells as a coherent structure. Deviations from this strict control result in defects associated with abnormal habenular laterality, which we have documented and quantified in sox2 morphants. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
1332921	19921201	Analysis of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene in hepatocellular carcinomas from Britain.	Human hepatocellular carcinomas from patients in Britain, an area of low prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma and low dietary exposure to aflatoxin B1, were analyzed for mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene. Abnormalities in the p53 gene were detected in 2 of 19 hepatocellular carcinomas by polymerase chain reaction--single-stranded conformation polymorphism. Direct sequencing of the evolutionarily conserved regions of p53 (exons 5, 6, 7 and 8), where mutations have been commonly found in a variety of tumors, confirmed that only two hepatocellular carcinomas had mutations in p53, one a 6-bp deletion of codons 158 and 159 (exon 5) and the other a G to A transition at codon 286 (exon 8). No mutations were found in any hepatocellular carcinoma in exons 6 and 7; in particular all tumors had wild-type sequence at codon 249, which has been reported to be a mutational hot spot in the p53 gene in hepatocellular carcinomas from high incidence areas such as China and southern Africa. Abnormalities in p53 expression were examined by immunohistochemistry and found in 1 of the 19 hepatocellular carcinomas. These findings show that p53 mutations are infrequently involved in the malignant transformation of hepatocytes in an area of low hepatocellular carcinoma prevalence. They support the suggestion of a possible link between dietary exposure to aflatoxin and selective G to T mutations at codon 249 of the p53 gene. Our observations also indicate that hepatitis B virus infection alone, present in six of the hepatocellular carcinomas examined, does not account for the specificity for codon 249 mutations reported from endemic areas.

27653549	20160923	Novel anti-EPHA2 antibody, DS-8895a for cancer treatment.	Overexpression of EPHA2 has been observed in multiple cancers and reported to be associated with poor prognosis. Here, we produced an afucosylated humanized anti-EPHA2 monoclonal antibody (mAb), DS-8895a for cancer treatment. The antibody recognizes the extracellular juxtamembrane region of EPHA2 and therefore can bind to both full-length and truncated forms of EPHA2, which are anchored to cell membranes and recently reported to be produced by post-translational cleavage in tumors. DS-8895a exhibited markedly increased antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro and also inhibited tumor growth in EPHA2-positive human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and human gastric cancer SNU-16 xenograft mouse models. Moreover, DS-8895a in combination with cisplatin (CDDP) showed better efficacy than each of the monotherapies did in the human gastric cancer model. These results suggest that a novel antibody, DS-8895a has therapeutic potential against EPHA2-expressing tumors. 	Cancer_Biol._Ther.	D016428

26019289	20150529	Afterhyperpolarization (AHP) regulates the frequency and timing of action potentials in the mitral cells of the olfactory bulb: role of olfactory experience.	Afterhyperpolarization (AHP) is a principal feedback mechanism in the control of the frequency and patterning of neuronal firing. In principal projection neurons of the olfactory bulb, the mitral cells (MCs), the AHP is produced by three separate components: classical potassium-mediated hyperpolarization, and the excitatory and inhibitory components, which are generated by the recurrent dendrodendritic synaptic transmission. Precise spike timing is involved in olfactory coding and learning, as well as in the appearance of population oscillatory activity. However, the contribution of the AHP and its components to these processes remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that the AHP is developed with the MC firing frequency and is dominated by the potassium component. We also show that recurrent synaptic transmission significantly modifies MC AHP and that the strength of the hyperpolarization produced by the AHP in the few milliseconds preceding the action potential (AP) emission determines MC firing frequency and AP timing. Moreover, we show that the AHP area is larger in younger animals, possibly owing to increased Ca(2+) influx during MC firing. Finally, we show that olfactory experience selectively reduces the early component of the MC AHP (under 25?msec), thus producing a modification of the AP timing limited to the higher firing frequency. On the basis of these results, we propose that the AHP, and its susceptibility to be selectively modulated by the recurrent synaptic transmission and olfactory experience, participate in odor coding and learning by modifying the frequency and pattern of MC firing.

7868901	19950301	Mutation of residues in the C3dg region of human complement component C3 corresponding to a proposed binding site for complement receptor type 2 (CR2, CD21) does not abolish binding of iC3b or C3dg to CR2.	Most evidence points toward there being a shared binding site in complement receptor type 2 (CR2, CD21) for the complement ligand C3dg and the EBV surface envelope glycoprotein gp350/220. Indeed, synthetic peptide studies have suggested that the CR2-binding sites in human C3dg and EBV gp350/220 share a similar sequence motif. The proposed CR2-binding sequence in C3dg is EDPGKQLYNVEA (residues 1199-1210 of mature C3), whereas that in EBV gp350/220 is EDPGFFNVEI (residues identical to C3dg are underlined). To further examine the role of amino acids 1199-1210 in the binding of the C3 fragments iC3b and C3dg to CR2, the following alanine-substitution variants of human C3 were tested in two independent CR2-binding assays: ED1199,1200AA; KQ1203,1204AA; L1205A; Y1206A; NV1207,1208AA; E1209A; and ED-KQ-NV1199,1200-1203,1204-1207,1208AA-AA-AA. Also engineered and tested was a chimeric C3 molecule in which the 1199-1210 sequence (PVPGGYQLTLEA) from the non-CR2-binding trout C3 molecule was grafted onto a human C3 background. Recombinant C3 proteins were expressed transiently in COS-1 cells, deposited as C3b on C3 convertase-bearing sheep erythrocytes and finally converted to cell-bound iC3b or C3dg using factors H and I. Binding of EAC423bi and EAC423dg to CR2 on Raji cells or EAC423dg to soluble CR2 was assessed. In most cases, the substitutions had little effect on CR2-binding activity and even in the case of the most highly substituted variants, the decrease in CR2-binding activity was less than twofold. Thus, contrary to the results anticipated from synthetic peptide studies, the single and multiple substitutions to the C3 sequence tested failed to corroborate a role for the 1199-1210 sequence in the C3dg-CR2 interaction.

26254426	20150809	Neovascularization in the pulmonary endothelium is regulated by the endosome: Rab4-mediated trafficking and p18-dependent signaling.	Neovascularization, the formation of new blood vessels, requires multiple processes including vascular leak, migration, and adhesion. Endosomal proteins, such as Rabs, regulate trafficking of key signaling proteins involved in neovascularization. The novel endosome protein, p18, enhances vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin recycling from early endosome to cell junction to improve pulmonary endothelial barrier function. Since endothelial barrier integrity is vital in neovascularization, we sought to elucidate the role for endosome proteins p18 and Rab4, Rab7, and Rab9 in the process of vessel formation within the pulmonary vasculature. Overexpression of wild-type p18 (p18(wt)), but not the nonendosomal-binding mutant (p18(N39)), significantly increased lung microvascular endothelial cell migration, adhesion, and both in vitro and in vivo tube formation. Chemical inhibition of mTOR or p38 attenuated the proneovascularization role of p18(wt). Similar to the effect of p18(wt), overexpression of prorecycling wild-type (Rab4(WT)) and endosome-anchored (Rab4(Q67L)) Rab4 enhanced neovascularization processes, whereas molecular inhibition of Rab4, by using the nonendosomal-binding mutant (Rab4(S22N)) attenuated VEGF-induced neovascularization. Unlike p18, Rab4-induced neovascularization was independent of mTOR or p38 inhibition but was dependent on p18 expression. This study shows for the first time that neovascularization within the pulmonary vasculature is dependent on the prorecycling endocytic proteins Rab4 and p18. 	Am._J._Physiol._Lung_Cell_Mol._Physiol.

7727045	19950401	p53 status in spontaneous and dimethylnitrosamine-induced renal cell tumors from rats.	Rats carrying the Eker tumor-susceptibility mutation (Eker rats) are predisposed to developing renal cell carcinoma. Rats heterozygous for the Eker mutation develop spontaneous multiple bilateral renal cell tumors by the age of 1 yr. In a previous study, Eker-mutation carrier and noncarrier rats were exposed to the renal carcinogen dimethylnitrosamine (DMN), and male rats carrying the Eker mutation exhibited a 70-fold increase in the induction of renal adenomas and carcinomas when compared with noncarrier rats. In this study, spontaneous and DMN-induced rat renal cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) were analyzed for mutations of the p53 gene by direct sequencing of cDNA polymerase chain reaction products. There were no mutations in p53 cDNA derived from renal tumors from six untreated rats. Mutations were found in one of 15 of the DMN-induced tumors: a transition at codon 140, CCT--&gt;CTT, in a renal adenoma. Additionally, seven cell lines derived from spontaneous renal cell tumors did not contain mutations in p53. The low frequency of p53 mutations (one of 21 renal cell tumors and none of seven cell lines derived from renal cell tumors) indicates that the development of both spontaneous and carcinogen-induced renal tumors involved a non-p53-dependent pathway. As p53 is infrequently mutated in human renal cell carcinomas and in rat renal mesenchymal tumors, it is likely that a tumor suppressor gene or genes other than p53 are involved in the development of renal cancer.

27187378	20160518	The Relationship between NALP3 and Autoinflammatory Syndromes.	The nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat/pyrin domain-containing-3 (NALP3) inflammasome, which is required for synthesis of interleukin-1?, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoinflammatory syndromes. This review of the literature summarizes the interconnectedness of NALP3 inflammasome with some of these disorders. Familial Mediterranean fever results from a mutation in the Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene, which encodes the pyrin protein. Previous study results suggest that pyrin suppresses caspase-1 activation, perhaps by competing for the adaptor protein, termed, pyrin domain of apoptosis/speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain (ACS) which therefore interferes with NALP3 inflammasome activation. The nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat/pyrin domain-containing-3 (NALP3) inflammasome is constitutively activated in cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes due to gain-of-function mutations resulting from point mutations within the neuronal apoptosis inhibitor protein/class 2 transcription factor/heterokaryon incompatibility/telomerase-associated protein-1 (NACHT) domain of the NALP3 protein. Pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne (PAPA) syndrome is caused by mutations in the genes encoding proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1). These PSTPIP1 mutants are thought to bind to pyrin causing an increase in the pyrin domain of apoptosis/speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain (ASC) pyroptosome assembly leading to procaspase-1 recruitment and therefore its activation. Hyperimmunoglublinemia D syndrome is caused by mevalonate kinase (MVK) deficiency, which may be affected by protein accumulation that leads to NALP3 inflammasome activation. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome is associated with mutations in the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 1A (TNFRSF1A) gene which decreases the level of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1) leading to neutralization of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-?. In general, these autoinflammatory disorders have shown a clinical response to interleukin-1 (IL-1) antagonists, suggesting that the NALP3 inflammasome serves a critical role in their pathogenesis.

22139995	20111206	Molecular modeling to rationalize ligand-support interactions in affinity chromatography.	The development of rational design criteria for synthetic-ligand-based affinity chromatography requires a basic comprehension of all the factors influencing the binding capacity and selectivity of the stationary phase. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations are systematically used to investigate the impact of structural modifications of spacer and ligand on ligand-support interactions. The investigated ligands are characterized by a triazine core bi-functionalized with two amino acid side chains aimed at representing a range of hydrophobic/hydrophilic characters. As spacers both literature (1-2-diaminoethane and 1,4-substituted [1,2,3]-triazole) and speculative oligopeptidic molecules (Gly-[Ala]4-Gly, Gly-[Lys]4-Gly, and Gly-[Glu]4-Gly) have been considered to address the role of charges distribution, rigidity, and structural complexity. In this investigation, the spacer emerged as a key component: on the one hand, the choice of a proper spacer allows improving the hydrophilic character of the ligand-spacer adduct without compromising the structure of the affinity ligand, while on the other hand the use of structurally complex spacers induces spacer-support interactions that enhance the degree of solvation of the ligand regardless of its hydrophobic character. These findings suggest that the use of structured spacers could represent a viable pathway for tailoring the performances of affinity chromatography stationary phases.

16519686	20060308	Critical roles of Leu99 and Leu115 at the heme distal side in auto-oxidation and the redox potential of a heme-regulated phosphodiesterase from Escherichia coli.	The heme-regulated phosphodiesterase from Escherichia coli (Ec DOS), which is a heme redox-dependent enzyme, is active with a ferrous heme but inactive with a ferric heme. Global structural changes including axial ligand switching and a change in the rigidity of the FG loop accompanying the heme redox change may be related to the dependence of Ec DOS activity on the redox state. Axial ligands such as CO, NO, and O2 act as inhibitors of Ec DOS because they interact with the ferrous heme complex. The X-ray crystal structure of the isolated heme-bound domain (Ec DosH) shows that Leu99, Phe113 and Leu115 indirectly and directly form a hydrophobic triad on the heme plane and that they should be located at or near the ligand access channel of the heme iron. We generated L99T, L99F, L115T, and L115F mutants of Ec DosH and examined their physicochemical characteristics, including auto-oxidation rates, O2 and CO binding kinetics, and redox potentials. The Fe(III) complex of the L115F mutant was unstable and had a Soret absorption spectrum located 5 nm lower than those of the wild-type and other mutants. Auto-oxidation rates of the mutants (0.049-0.33 min(-1)) were much higher than that of the wild-type (0.0063 min(-1)). Furthermore, the redox potentials of the former three mutants (23.1-34.6 mV versus SHE) were also significantly lower than that of the wild-type (63.9 mV versus SHE). Interaction between O2 and the L99F mutant was different from that in the wild-type, whereas CO binding rates of the mutants were similar to those of the wild-type. Thus, it appears that Leu99 and Leu115 are critical for determining the characteristics of heme iron. Finally, we discuss the roles of these amino-acid residues in the heme electronic states.

25658762	20150207	High rates of o'nyong nyong and Chikungunya virus transmission in coastal Kenya.	Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and o'nyong nyong virus (ONNV) are mosquito-borne alphaviruses endemic in East Africa that cause acute febrile illness and arthritis. The objectives of this study were to measure the seroprevalence of CHIKV and ONNV in coastal Kenya and link it to demographics and other risk factors. Demographic and exposure questionnaires were administered to 1,848 participants recruited from two village clusters (Milalani-Nganja and Vuga) in 2009. Sera were tested for alphavirus exposure using standardized CHIKV IgG ELISA protocols and confirmed with plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT). Logistic regression models were used to determine the variables associated with seropositivity. Weighted K test for global clustering of houses with alphavirus positive participants was performed for distance ranges of 50-1,000 meters, and G* statistic and kernel density mapping were used to identify locations of higher seroprevalence. 486 (26%) participants were seropositive by IgG ELISA. Of 443 PRNT confirmed positives, 25 samples (6%) were CHIKV+, 250 samples (56%) were ONNV+, and 168 samples (38%) had high titers for both. Age was significantly associated with seropositivity (OR 1.01 per year, 95% C.I. 1.00-1.01); however, younger adults were more likely to be seropositive than older adults. Males were less likely to be seropositive (p&lt;0.05; OR 0.79, 95% C.I. 0.64-0.97). Adults who owned a bicycle (p&lt;0.05; OR 1.37, 95% C.I. 1.00-1.85) or motor vehicle (p&lt;0.05; OR 4.64, 95% C.I. 1.19-18.05) were more likely to be seropositive. Spatial analysis demonstrated hotspots of transmission within each village and clustering among local households in Milalani-Nganja, peaking at the 200-500m range. Alphavirus exposure, particularly ONNV exposure, is common in coastal Kenya with ongoing interepidemic transmission of both ONNV and CHIKV. Women and adults were more likely to be seropositive. Household location may be a defining factor for the ecology of alphaviral transmission in this region. 	PLoS_Negl_Trop_Dis	D016428 D052061
21360822	20110302	Thiazolidinedione-based PI3K? inhibitors: an analysis of biochemical and virtual screening methods.	A series of synthesized and commercially available compounds were assessed against PI3K? for in vitro inhibitory activity and the results compared to binding calculated in silico. Using published crystal structures of PI3K? and PI3K? co-crystallized with inhibitors as a template, docking was able to identify the majority of potent inhibitors from a decoy set of 1000 compounds. On the other hand, PI3K? in the apo-form, modeled by induced fit docking, or built as a homology model gave only poor results. A PI3K? homology model derived from a ligand-bound PI3K? crystal structure was developed that has a good ability to identify active compounds. The docking results identified binding poses for active compounds that differ from those identified to date and can contribute to our understanding of structure-activity relationships for PI3K inhibitors.

11937186	20020409	Antibodies to varicella-zoster virus in blood donors with genetic variance in CC chemokine receptor 5.	Carriers of a 32 bp deletion (Delta32) allele of the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) gene are reported to be more likely to lack antibodies to varicella-zoster virus than CCR5 wild-type individuals. To find out whether CCR5-Delta32 is associated with the seroprevalence of varicella-zoster virus infection, we tested blood donors with different CCR5-Delta32 genotypes for varicella-zoster virus IgG. Antibody to varicella-zoster virus was present in 209 (99.5%) of 210 CCR5-Delta32 carriers and exactly the same proportion of CCR5 wild-type individuals (209 of 210). We have therefore found no evidence that the CCR5-Delta32 allele is associated with decreased seroprevalence of varicella-zoster virus infection. 	Lancet	D016428 D013487
21909094	20110913	Weak seed-pairing stability and high target-site abundance decrease the proficiency of lsy-6 and other microRNAs.	Most metazoan microRNAs (miRNAs) target many genes for repression, but the nematode lsy-6 miRNA is much less proficient. Here we show that the low proficiency of lsy-6 can be recapitulated in HeLa cells and that miR-23, a mammalian miRNA, also has low proficiency in these cells. Reporter results and array data indicate two properties of these miRNAs that impart low proficiency: their weak predicted seed-pairing stability (SPS) and their high target-site abundance (TA). These two properties also explain differential propensities of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to repress unintended targets. Using these insights, we expand the TargetScan tool for quantitatively predicting miRNA regulation (and siRNA off-targeting) to model differential miRNA (and siRNA) proficiencies, thereby improving prediction performance. We propose that siRNAs designed to have both weaker SPS and higher TA will have fewer off-targets without compromised on-target activity. 	Nat._Struct._Mol._Biol.	D016428 D052061 D013485
27847570	20161117	Parasellar Extension Grades and Surgical Extent in Endoscopic Endonasal Transsphenoidal Surgery for Pituitary Adenomas : A Single Surgeon's Consecutive Series with the Aspects of Reliability and Clinical Validity.	The inter-rater reliability of the modified Knosp's classification was measured before the analysis. The clinical validity of the parasellar extension grading system was evaluated by investigating the extents of resection and complication rates among the grades in the endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery (EETS) for pituitary adenomas. From November 2008 to August 2015, of the 286 patients who underwent EETS by the senior author, 208 were pituitary adenoma cases (146 non-functioning pituitary adenomas, 10 adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting adenomas, 31 growth hormone-secreting adenomas, 17 prolactin-secreting adenomas, and 4 thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting adenomas; 23 microadenomas, 174 macroadenomas, and 11 giant adenomas). Two neurosurgeons and a neuroradiologist independently measured the degree of parasellar extension on the preoperative sellar MRI according to the modified Knosp's classification. Inter-rater reliability was statistically assessed by measuring the intraclass correlation coefficient. The extents of resection were evaluated by comparison of the pre- and post-operative MR images; the neurovascular complications were assessed by reviewing the patients' medical records. The extent of resection was measured in each parasellar extension grade; thereafter, their statistical differences were calculated. The intraclass correlation coefficient value of reliability across the three raters amounted to 0.862. The gross total removal (GTR) rates achieved in each grade were 70.0, 69.8, 62.9, 21.4, 37.5, and 4.3% in Grades 0, 1, 2, 3A, 3B, and 4, respectively. A significant difference in the extent of resection was observed only between Grades 2 and 3A. In addition, significantly higher complication rates were observed in the groups above Grade 3A. Although the modified Knosp's classification system appears to be complex, its inter-rater reliability proves to be excellent. Regarding the clinical validity of the parasellar extension grading system, Grades 3A, 3B, and 4 have a negative predictive value for the GTR rate, with higher complication rates.

26286752	20150820	The GH130 Family of Mannoside Phosphorylases Contains Glycoside Hydrolases That Target ?-1,2-Mannosidic Linkages in Candida Mannan.	The depolymerization of complex glycans is an important biological process that is of considerable interest to environmentally relevant industries. ?-Mannose is a major component of plant structural polysaccharides and eukaryotic N-glycans. These linkages are primarily cleaved by glycoside hydrolases, although recently, a family of glycoside phosphorylases, GH130, have also been shown to target ?-1,2- and ?-1,4-mannosidic linkages. In these phosphorylases, bond cleavage was mediated by a single displacement reaction in which phosphate functions as the catalytic nucleophile. A cohort of GH130 enzymes, however, lack the conserved basic residues that bind the phosphate nucleophile, and it was proposed that these enzymes function as glycoside hydrolases. Here we show that two Bacteroides enzymes, BT3780 and BACOVA_03624, which lack the phosphate binding residues, are indeed ?-mannosidases that hydrolyze ?-1,2-mannosidic linkages through an inverting mechanism. Because the genes encoding these enzymes are located in genetic loci that orchestrate the depolymerization of yeast ?-mannans, it is likely that the two enzymes target the ?-1,2-mannose residues that cap the glycan produced by Candida albicans. The crystal structure of BT3780 in complex with mannose bound in the -1 and +1 subsites showed that a pair of glutamates, Glu(227) and Glu(268), hydrogen bond to O1 of ?-mannose, and either of these residues may function as the catalytic base. The candidate catalytic acid and the other residues that interact with the active site mannose are conserved in both GH130 mannoside phosphorylases and ?-1,2-mannosidases. Functional phylogeny identified a conserved lysine, Lys(199) in BT3780, as a key specificity determinant for ?-1,2-mannosidic linkages. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
23589301	20130417	Defining the molecular basis for the first potent and selective orthosteric agonists of the FFA2 free fatty acid receptor.	FFA2 is a G protein-coupled receptor that responds to short chain fatty acids and has generated interest as a therapeutic target for metabolic and inflammatory conditions. However, definition of its functions has been slowed by a dearth of selective ligands that can distinguish it from the closely related FFA3. At present, the only selective ligands described for FFA2 suffer from poor potency, altered signaling due to allosteric modes of action, or a lack of function at non-human orthologs of the receptor. To address the need for novel selective ligands, we synthesized two compounds potentially having FFA2 activity and examined the molecular basis of their function. These compounds were confirmed to be potent and selective orthosteric FFA2 agonists. A combination of ligand structure-activity relationship, pharmacological analysis, homology modeling, species ortholog comparisons, and mutagenesis studies were then employed to define the molecular basis of selectivity and function of these ligands. From this, we identified key residues within both extracellular loop 2 and the transmembrane domain regions of FFA2 critical for ligand function. One of these ligands was active with reasonable potency at rodent orthologs of FFA2 and demonstrated the role of FFA2 in inhibition of lipolysis and glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion in murine-derived 3T3-L1 and STC-1 cell lines, respectively. Together, these findings describe the first potent and selective FFA2 orthosteric agonists and demonstrate key aspects of ligand interaction within the binding site of FFA2 that will be invaluable in future ligand development at this receptor.

9137882	19970301	Two novel mutations in a Canadian family with aspartylglucosaminuria and early outcome post bone marrow transplantation.	Aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of aspartylglucosaminidase. The disease is overrepresented in the Finnish population, in which one missense mutation (Cys163Ser) is responsible for 98% of the disease alleles. The few non-Finnish cases of AGU which have been analyzed at molecular level have revealed a spectrum of different mutations. Here, we report two new missense mutations causing AGU in two Canadian siblings. The patients were compound heterozygotes with a G299--&gt;A transition causing a Gly100--&gt;Gln substitution and a T404--&gt;C transition resulting in a Phe135--&gt;Ser change in the cDNA coding for aspartylglucosaminidase. The younger patient recently underwent bone marrow transplantation. 	Clin._Genet.	D002363 D016428
2007142	19910326	Wild-type and mutant bacterioopsins D85N, D96N, and R82Q: high-level expression in Escherichia coli.	The integral membrane protein bacterioopsin, found in the extremely halophilic archaebacterium Halobacterium halobium, was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein containing 13 heterologous amino acids at the amino terminus. The expressed protein was localized primarily to the E. coli cytoplasmic membrane (greater than 80%) and had an in vivo half-life of 26 min. The amount of bacterioopsin in E. coli crude lysates was quantitated immunologically from Western blots and was expressed at 10-20-fold higher levels than seen previously (i.e., 17 mg/L; 5.6% of the total protein). Three distinct forms of the protein were detected immunologically: two of the forms were generated by the removal of either one or four amino acid residues at the amino terminus; the third form remained unaltered.

9038211	19970228	Post-translational processing in the Golgi plays a critical role in the trafficking of the luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin receptor to the cell surface.	Point mutations in the luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin (LH/hCG) receptor have been shown to cause constitutive activation which results in precocious puberty in affected males. We introduced one of these mutations, Asp-556 --&gt; Gly, into the rat LH/hCG receptor and demonstrated that the mutant receptor constitutively activated adenylate cyclase in transfected 293 T cells. The cell surface expression of the mutant receptor was lower than that of the wild type receptor. Pulse-chase studies showed that the 73-kDa precursor of both the mutant and wild type receptors was synthesized at comparable efficiencies. However, post-translational processing of the mutant receptor to the mature 92-kDa form, which has N-linked complex type oligosaccharide chains, was impaired. Sensitivity of the mutant receptor to peptide-N-glycanase F and endoglycosidase H, and insensitivity to sialidase indicated that the 73-kDa species represents the high mannose form that has not yet been trafficked through the medial and trans Golgi. Additionally, although the wild type receptor was palmitoylated, the mutant receptor was not. Although the high mannose 73-kDa species is capable of binding LH/hCG, our results show that post-translational processing in the Golgi is required for the mature 92-kDa receptor to reach the cell surface.

23169942	20121122	Factors that explain excretion of enteric pathogens by persons without diarrhea.	Excretion of enteropathogens by subjects without diarrhea influences our appreciation of the role of these pathogens as etiologic agents. Characteristics of the pathogens and host and environmental factors help explain asymptomatic excretion of diarrheal pathogens by persons without diarrhea. After causing acute diarrhea followed by clinical recovery, some enteropathogens are excreted asymptomatically for many weeks. Thus, in a prevalence survey of persons without diarrhea, some may be excreting pathogens from diarrheal episodes experienced many weeks earlier. Volunteer challenges with Vibrio cholerae O1, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli, Campylobacter jejuni, and Giardia lamblia document heterogeneity among enteropathogen strains, with some inexplicably not eliciting diarrhea. The immune host may not manifest diarrhea following ingestion of a pathogen but may nevertheless asymptomatically excrete. Some human genotypes render them less susceptible to symptomatic or severe diarrheal infection with certain pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae O1 and norovirus. Pathogens in stools of individuals without diarrhea may reflect recent ingestion of inocula too small to cause disease in otherwise susceptible hosts or of animal pathogens (eg, bovine or porcine ETEC) that do not cause human illness.

16299313	20051122	Ectophosphorylation of CD36 regulates cytoadherence of Plasmodium falciparum to microvascular endothelium under flow conditions.	The adhesion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IRBCs) to human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) under flow conditions is regulated by a Src family kinase- and alkaline phosphatase (AP)-dependent mechanism. In this study, we showed that the target of the phosphatase activity is the ectodomain of CD36 at threonine-92 (Thr92). Mouse fibroblasts (NIH 3T3 cells) transfected with wild-type CD36 or a mutant protein in which Thr92 was substituted by Ala supported the rolling and adhesion of IRBCs. However, while the Src family kinase inhibitors PP1 and PP2 and the specific AP inhibitor levamisole significantly reduced IRBC adhesion to wild-type CD36 transfectants as with HDMECs, the inhibitors had no effect on IRBC adhesion to the mutant cells. Using a phosphospecific antibody directed at a 12-amino-acid peptide spanning Thr92, we demonstrated directly that CD36 was constitutively phosphorylated and could be dephosphorylated by exogenous AP. Endothelial CD36 was likewise constitutively phosphorylated. The phosphospecific antibody inhibited IRBC adhesion to HDMECs that could be reversed by preincubating the antibody with the phosphorylated but not the nonphosphorylated peptide. Pretreatment of HDMECs with AP abrogated the effect of PP1 on IRBC adhesion. Collectively, these results are consistent with a critical role for CD36 dephosphorylation through Src family kinase activation in regulating IRBC adhesion to vascular endothelium. 	Infect._Immun.

21914837	20110915	Childhood brain tumors and maternal cured meat consumption in pregnancy: differential effect by glutathione S-transferases.	Some epidemiologic studies suggest that maternal consumption of cured meat during pregnancy may increase risk of brain tumors in offspring. We explored whether this possible association was modified by fetal genetic polymorphisms in genes coding for glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) that may inactivate nitroso compounds. We assessed six GST variants: GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null, GSTP1(I105V) (rs1695), GSTP1(A114V) (rs1138272), GSTM3*B (3-bp deletion), and GSTM3(A-63C) (rs1332018) within a population-based case-control study with data on maternal prenatal cured meat consumption (202 cases and 286 controls born in California or Washington, 1978-1990). Risk of childhood brain tumor increased with increasing cured meat intake by the mother during pregnancy among children without GSTT1 [OR = 1.29; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.07-1.57 for each increase in the frequency of consumption per week] or with potentially reduced GSTM3 (any -63C allele; OR = 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03-1.26), whereas no increased risk was observed among those with GSTT1 or presumably normal GSTM3 levels (interaction P = 0.01 for each). Fetal ability to deactivate nitrosoureas may modify the association between childhood brain tumors and maternal prenatal consumption of cured meats. These results support the hypothesis that maternal avoidance during pregnancy of sources of some nitroso compounds or their precursors may reduce risk of brain tumors in some children.

3856100	19850221	Is sequence conservation in interferons due to selection for functional proteins?	The human alpha-interferon (IFN-alpha) gene family consists of at least 14 potentially functional non-allelic members; the amino acid sequences they encode differ from each other by up to approximately 20% of their residues. Human IFN-beta, which is encoded by a single gene, is distantly related to the IFN-alpha family; it differs in 67% of its residues from IFN-alpha 2. There is considerable evidence that IFN-alpha and -beta compete for the same receptors on their target cells. Comparison of 14 non-allelic human IFN-alpha sequences and the IFN-beta sequence has revealed that 37 of 166 residues are completely conserved and that several of these are arranged in clusters, for example at positions 29-33, 47-50 and 136-150. It is commonly held that evolutionary conservation of amino acids indicates that the residues in question are essential for function. To test this hypothesis in the case of IFNs, we have introduced single site-directed point mutations into the strictly conserved codons 48 and 49 of the IFN-alpha 2 gene which form part of the longest uninterrupted cluster (position 47-50). We report here that the mutant proteins, containing Tyr, Ser and Cys instead of Phe48, or His instead of Gln49, have biological activities indistinguishable from those of wild-type IFN-alpha. In addition, when Glu62, a residue conserved in all known alpha and beta IFNs of man, mouse and cattle, was replaced by Lys, antiviral activity remained unchanged. 	Nature	D016428 D013485
10940294	20000815	The PDZ protein TIP-1 interacts with the Rho effector rhotekin and is involved in Rho signaling to the serum response element.	The human T-cell lymphotrophic virus, type 1 Tax protein can interact via its C terminus with various proteins including a PDZ domain. In this work, one of them, TIP-1, is characterized as a cytoplasmic 14-kDa protein mainly corresponding to one PDZ domain. A two-hybrid screen performed with TIP-1 as bait showed that it interacts with the human homologue of rhotekin that was previously identified in mice as a Rho effector. Both human and mouse rhotekins exhibit at their C termini the sequence QSPV-COOH that matches the X(S/T)XV-COOH consensus known for proteins recognizing PDZ domains. Mutation of the serine and valine residues to alanine impairs interaction of rhotekin with TIP-1. Transient expression experiments with a reporter construct including the c-Fos serum response element (SRE) showed that coexpression of TIP-1 with the constitutively active RhoA.V14 mutant and human rhotekin caused a strong activation of the SRE. A negative mutant of Rho, RhoA.N19, was unable to cooperate with TIP-1 and rhotekin. The positive effect of TIP-1 was also lost when the C terminus of rhotekin was mutated. These data show that the complex of active Rho with its effector rhotekin bound to TIP-1 produces in the cytoplasm a signal that triggers strong activation of the SRE. 	J._Biol._Chem.

16033979	20050722	Modifications of both selectivity factor and upstream binding factor contribute to poliovirus-mediated inhibition of RNA polymerase I transcription.	Soon after infection, poliovirus (PV) shuts off host-cell transcription, which is catalysed by all three cellular RNA polymerases. rRNA constitutes more than 50 % of all cellular RNA and is transcribed from rDNA by RNA polymerase I (pol I). Here, evidence has been provided suggesting that both pol I transcription factors, SL-1 (selectivity factor) and UBF (upstream binding factor), are modified and inactivated in PV-infected cells. The viral protease 3C(pro) appeared to cleave the TATA-binding protein-associated factor 110 (TAF(110)), a subunit of the SL-1 complex, into four fragments in vitro. In vitro protease-cleavage assays using various mutants of TAF(110) and purified 3C(pro) indicated that the Q(265)G(266) and Q(805)G(806) sites were cleaved by 3C(pro). Both SL-1 and UBF were depleted in PV-infected cells and their disappearance correlated with pol I transcription inhibition. rRNA synthesis from a template containing a human pol I promoter demonstrated that both SL-1 and UBF were necessary to restore pol I transcription fully in PV-infected cell extracts. These results suggested that both SL-1 and UBF are transcriptionally inactivated in PV-infected HeLa cells. 	J._Gen._Virol.	D016428 D052061 D013487
18624112	20080716	[The (-2548G/A) polymorphism of leptin gene in women with gestational hypertension and preeclampsia].	Leptin is a polypeptide hormone (167 amino acids, molecular weight of about 16kDa), synthesized mainly in white adipose tissue. The hormone plays an important role in regulation of hunger and satiety processes, in metabolism of carbohydrates and fats, development of cardio-vascular diseases and obesity. The occurrence of the increased level of leptin in pregnant women with hypertension, especially in women with preeclampsia, has also been brought to our attention. In recent years it has been suggested that the presence of different variants of leptin and leptin receptor genes may modify the leptin level in serum, and, in this way, influence an increased risk of obstetric complications, such as preeclampsia or eclampsia. We have analyzed a group of 103 hypertensive pregnant women--61 women with gestational hypertension (GH) and 42 women with preeclampsia (PE). The control group consisted of 113 healthy pregnant women who have been investigated. Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia were recognized with the help of and assessed according to the ACOG criteria. The (-2548G/A) polymorphism was determined using polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR/RFLP). In our study, a higher frequency of mutated AA genotype in GH group and PE groups (21.31% and 21.43% respectively vs. 16.81% in the controls) and the overrepresentation of mutated A allele in both analyzed groups (47.54% and 45.24% respectively vs. 41.59% in the controls) have been observed, without statistically significant differences. The overrepresentation of AA genotypes and higher frequency of mutated A allele of (-2548G/A) polymorphism of leptin gene in GH and PE groups might indicate its possible contribution in gestational hypertension and preeclampsia.

26505631	20151028	Oriented Cell Division in the C. elegans Embryo Is Coordinated by G-Protein Signaling Dependent on the Adhesion GPCR LAT-1.	Orientation of spindles and cell division planes during development of many species ensures that correct cell-cell contacts are established, which is vital for proper tissue formation. This is a tightly regulated process involving a complex interplay of various signals. The molecular mechanisms underlying several of these pathways are still incompletely understood. Here, we identify the signaling cascade of the C. elegans latrophilin homolog LAT-1, an essential player in the coordination of anterior-posterior spindle orientation during the fourth round of embryonic cell division. We show that the receptor mediates a G protein-signaling pathway revealing that G-protein signaling in oriented cell division is not solely GPCR-independent. Genetic analyses showed that through the interaction with a Gs protein LAT-1 elevates intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels in the C. elegans embryo. Stimulation of this G-protein cascade in lat-1 null mutant nematodes is sufficient to orient spindles and cell division planes in the embryo in the correct direction. Finally, we demonstrate that LAT-1 is activated by an intramolecular agonist to trigger this cascade. Our data support a model in which a novel, GPCR-dependent G protein-signaling cascade mediated by LAT-1 controls alignment of cell division planes in an anterior-posterior direction via a metabotropic Gs-protein/adenylyl cyclase pathway by regulating intracellular cAMP levels.

25638254	20150202	Effects of GRK5 and ADRB1 polymorphisms influence on systolic heart failure.	G-protein receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) Gln41?&gt;?Leu and ?1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) Arg389?&gt;?Gly polymorphisms presented the different distribution of genotype frequencies between Caucasian American and African American, and produced the difference in ?-blocker treatment effect among them with systolic heart failure (SHF). This study sought to identify the distributed characteristics of these variant genotypes in Chinese population, and influence of GRK5 and ADRB1 polymorphisms on SHF morbidity and ?-blocker treatment effect in patients with SHF. This study was based on cross-sectional survey data. 1794 and 1718 subjects' ADRB1 and GRK5 gene sequencing (sanger method) data were achieved respectively. Blood samples collection, clinical laboratory detection, electrocardiogram and echocardiography examinations were performed. Medication usage was confirmed at in-hospital visits or the questionnaire by personal interview. GRK5 Leu41Leu genotype was not found in our Chinese population. In non-SHF population, allele frequencies of GRK5 Gln41 and Leu41 were 2782 (0.992) and 22 (0.008) (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test ?(2)?=?0.088, P?=?0.767), and allele frequencies of ADRB1 Arg389 and Gly389 were 2127 (0.715) and 849 (0.285) (?(2)?=?0.272, P?=?0.602). In SHF patients, allele frequencies of Gln41 and Leu41 were 446 (0.991) and 4 (0.009) (?(2)?=?0.018, P?=?0.893), and allele frequencies of Arg389 and Gly389 were 331 (0.726) and 125 (0.274) (?(2)?=?1.892, P?=?0.169). Further in logistic regression model, these ADRB1 and GRK5 variants were not significantly independently associated with the risk of SHF morbidity. Those carrying genotype ADRB1 Gly389Gly did not reduce significantly the risk of SHF morbidity after ?-blocker therapy. GRK5 Leu41Leu genotype was not found in our Chinese population, neither ADRB1 nor GRK5 variants presented independently associated with the risk of SHF morbidity, most ADRB1 and GRK5 polymorphisms did decrease significantly the risk of SHF morbidity after ?-blocker therapy except for those carrying genotype ADRB1 Gly389Gly.

25107489	20140810	Promoter methylation analysis of WNT/?-catenin pathway regulators and its association with expression of DNMT1 enzyme in colorectal cancer.	Aberrant DNA methylation as the most important reason making epigenetic silencing of genes is a main mechanism of gene inactivation in patients with colorectal cancer. In this study, we decided to identify promoter methylation status of ten genes encoding WNT negative regulators, and measure the expression of DNMT1 enzyme in colorectal cancer samples. Aberrant methylation of APC gene was statistically significant associated with age over 50 (p?=?0.017), DDK3 with male (p?&lt;?0.0001), SFRP4, WIF1, and WNT5a with increasing tumor stage (p?=?0.004, p?=?0.029, and p?=?0.004), SFRP4 and WIF1 with tumor differentiation (p?=?0.009 and p?=?0.031) and SFRP2 and SFRP5 with histological type (p?=?0.001 and p?=?0.025). The increasing number of methylated genes correlated with the expression levels of the DNMT1 mRNA. The rate of gene promoter methylation of WNT pathway regulators is high in colorectal cancer cells. Hyper-methylation is associated with increased expression of the DNMT1 enzyme. 	J._Biomed._Sci.	D016430 D016428 D013485
27422716	20160717	Phosphorylation of NMDA receptor GluN2B subunit at Tyr1472 is important for trigeminal processing of itch.	Itch and pain are intimately related and may share similar peripheral and central mechanisms and pathways. However, it has been believed that synaptic glutamate release from a group of peripheral nociceptors is required to sense pain and suppress itch. Although we previously demonstrated that phosphorylation of GluN2B subunits of the NMDA receptor at Tyr1472 is important for central sensitization in a neuropathic pain model of mice with a knock-in mutation of the Tyr1472 site to phenylalanine of GluN2B (Y1472F-KI), the role of NMDA receptors in itch transmission remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that the scratching behaviors elicited by various pruritogens applied to the cheek and c-fos expression in the region innervated by the trigeminal nerve were markedly attenuated in the Y1472F-KI mice. The c-fos immunoreactivity was co-localized with the receptor of gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). Scratching behaviors evoked by chloroquine were inhibited by the NMDA receptor antagonists D-AP5 and CP101,606 and by the Src kinase inhibitor PP2. Direct activation of the trigeminal region by intracisternal administration of NMDA and GRP induced robust scratching behaviors, both of which were reduced by the GRP receptor antagonist RC-3095. Taken together, the data obtained in this present study are the first to demonstrate that phosphorylation of GluN2B subunit at Tyr1472 is important for trigeminal transmission of itch and suggest that the NMDA receptor activation occurs upstream of the GRP-GRP receptor pathway.

2026167	19910423	Heparinase II from Flavobacterium heparinum. Action on chemically modified heparins.	Five chemically modified heparins were derived from native pig mucosal heparin (pig heparin Is). These were de-N-sulphated heparin (heparin IH), N-acetylheparin (heparin IA), de-N/O-sulphated heparin (heparin IVH), de-O-sulphated heparin (heparin IVs) and de-O-sulphated N-acetyl-heparin (heparin IVA). Their structures were studied by 13C-NMR spectroscopy at 90.56 MHz. Native heparin and the derivatives were incubated with Flavobacterium heparinase II at 25 degrees C. The progress of degradation was followed by the delta A235 and the final composition examined by gel filtration with Bio-Gel P-4. Native heparin (Is) was readily degraded by heparinase II and, with the exception of heparin IVH for which degradation was negligible, the chemically modified derivatives were also degraded. Approximately 90% of the saccharides from heparins Is, IA, IVs and IVA were disaccharides and tetrasaccharides. For heparin IH, which was degraded more slowly, the proportion was 65%. Heparins Is, IVs and IVA underwent initial rapid degradation. The digestion of heparin Ia proceeded rapidly after an initial lag phase. The undegraded polymers produced similar elution profiles from Bio-Gel P-4. Following the action of heparinase II on heparins Is, IA, IVs and IVA, the elution profiles revealed a major peak of disaccharides and minor peaks of higher oligomers. The profile of heparin IH revealed a greater proportion of intermediate-molecular-mass saccharides. Our results demonstrate a broad specificity for heparinase II. It is capable of lysing both N-acetylated and N-sulphated heparins independent of O-sulphation. Heparinase II will also degrade heparin derivatives that are non-N-substituted provided that they are O-sulphated. 	Eur._J._Biochem.	D016428 D013485
25897024	20150422	Structure-function analysis and genetic interactions of the Yhc1, SmD3, SmB, and Snp1 subunits of yeast U1 snRNP and genetic interactions of SmD3 with U2 snRNP subunit Lea1.	Yhc1 and U1-C are essential subunits of the yeast and human U1 snRNP, respectively, that stabilize the duplex formed by U1 snRNA at the pre-mRNA 5' splice site (5'SS). Mutational analysis of Yhc1, guided by the human U1 snRNP crystal structure, highlighted the importance of Val20 and Ser19 at the RNA interface. Though benign on its own, V20A was lethal in the absence of branchpoint-binding complex subunit Mud2 and caused a severe growth defect in the absence of U1 subunit Nam8. S19A caused a severe defect with mud2?. Essential DEAD-box ATPase Prp28 was bypassed by mutations of Yhc1 Val20 and Ser19, consistent with destabilization of U1?5'SS interaction. We extended the genetic analysis to SmD3, which interacts with U1-C/Yhc1 in U1 snRNP, and to SmB, its neighbor in the Sm ring. Whereas mutations of the interface of SmD3, SmB, and U1-C/Yhc1 with U1-70K/Snp1, or deletion of the interacting Snp1 N-terminal peptide, had no growth effect, they elicited synthetic defects in the absence of U1 subunit Mud1. Mutagenesis of the RNA-binding triad of SmD3 (Ser-Asn-Arg) and SmB (His-Asn-Arg) provided insights to built-in redundancies of the Sm ring, whereby no individual side-chain was essential, but simultaneous mutations of Asn or Arg residues in SmD3 and SmB were lethal. Asn-to-Ala mutations SmB and SmD3 caused synthetic defects in the absence of Mud1 or Mud2. All three RNA site mutations of SmD3 were lethal in cells lacking the U2 snRNP subunit Lea1. Benign C-terminal truncations of SmD3 were dead in the absence of Mud2 or Lea1 and barely viable in the absence of Nam8 or Mud1. In contrast, SMD3-E35A uniquely suppressed the temperature-sensitivity of lea1?. 	RNA	D016428 D052061

24050657	20130921	Investigating the role of zinc and copper binding motifs of trafficking sites in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803.	Although zinc and copper are required by proteins with very different functions, these metals can be delivered to cellular locations by homologous metal transporters within the same organism, as demonstrated by the cyanobacterial ( Synechocystis PCC 6803) zinc exporter ZiaA and thylakoidal copper importer PacS. The N-terminal metal-binding domains of these transporters (ZiaAN and PacSN, respectively) have related ferredoxin folds also found in the metallochaperone Atx1, which delivers copper to PacS, but differ in the residues found in their M/IXCXXC metal-binding motifs. To investigate the role of the nonconserved residues in this region on metal binding, the sequence from ZiaAN has been introduced into Atx1 and PacSN, and the motifs of Atx1 and PacSN swapped. The motif sequence can tune Cu(I) affinity only approximately 3-fold. However, the introduction of the ZiaAN motif (MDCTSC) dramatically increases the Zn(II) affinity of both Atx1 and PacSN by up to 2 orders of magnitude. The Atx1 mutant with the ZiaAN motif crystallizes as a side-to-side homodimer very similar to that found for [Cu(I)2-Atx1]2 ( Badarau et al. Biochemistry 2010 , 49 , 7798 ). In a crystal structure of the PacSN mutant possessing the ZiaAN motif (PacSN(ZiaAN)), the Asp residue from the metal-binding motif coordinates Zn(II). This demonstrates that the increased Zn(II) affinity of this variant and the high Zn(II) affinity of ZiaAN are due to the ability of the carboxylate to ligate this metal ion. Comparison of the Zn(II) sites in PacSN(ZiaAN) structures provides additional insight into Zn(II) trafficking in cyanobacteria. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485
15018634	20040317	Novel and de novo PKD1 mutations identified by multiple restriction fragment-single strand conformation polymorphism (MRF-SSCP).	We have previously developed a long RT-PCR method for selective amplification of full-length PKD1 transcripts (13.6 kb) and a long-range PCR for amplification in the reiterated region (18 kb) covering exons 14 and 34 of the PKD1 gene. These have provided us with an opportunity to study PKD1 mutations especially in its reiterated region which is difficult to examine. In this report, we have further developed the method of multiple restriction fragment-single strand conformation polymorphism (MRF-SSCP) for analysis of PKD1 mutations in the patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Novel and de novo PKD1 mutations are identified and reported. Full-length PKD1 cDNA isolated from the patients with ADPKD was fractionated into nine overlapping segments by nested-PCR. Each segment was digested with sets of combined restriction endonucleases before the SSCP analysis. The fragments with aberrant migration were mapped, isolated, and sequenced. The presence of mutation was confirmed by the long-range genomic DNA amplification in the PKD1 region, sequencing, direct mutation detection, and segregation analysis in the affected family. Five PKD1 mutations identified are two frameshift mutations caused by two di-nucleotide (c. 5225_5226delAG and c.9451_9452delAT) deletions, a nonsense (Q1828X, c.5693C&gt;T) mutation, a splicing defect attributable to 31 nucleotide deletion (g.33184_33214del31), and an in-frame deletion (L3287del, c.10070_10072delCTC). All mutations occurred within the reiterated region of the gene involving exons 15, 26, 15, 19 and 29, respectively. Three mutations (one frameshift, splicing defect, and in-frame deletion) are novel and two (one frameshift and nonsense) known. In addition, two mutations (nonsense and splicing defect) are possibly de novo. The MRF-SSCP method has been developed to analyze PCR products generated by the long RT-PCR and nested-PCR technique for screening PKD1 mutations in the full-length cDNA. Five mutations identified were all in the reiterated region of this gene, three of which were novel. The presence of de novo PKD1 mutations indicates that this gene is prone to mutations.

The vascular action of insulin to stimulate endothelial production of nitric oxide (NO), leading to vasodilation and increased blood flow is an important component of insulin-stimulated whole body glucose utilization. Therefore, we hypothesized that adiponectin may also stimulate production of NO in endothelium. Bovine aortic endothelial cells in primary culture loaded with the NO-specific fluorescent dye 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF-2 DA) were treated with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (a calcium-releasing agonist) or adiponectin (10 microg/ml bacterially produced full-length adiponectin). LPA treatment increased production of NO by approximately 4-fold. Interestingly, adiponectin treatment significantly increased production of NO by approximately 3-fold. Preincubation of cells with wortmannin (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) blocked only adiponectin- but not LPA-mediated production of NO. Using phospho-specific antibodies, we observed that either adiponectin or insulin treatment (but not LPA treatment) caused phosphorylation of both Akt at Ser473 and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) at Ser1179 that was inhibitable by wortmannin. We next transfected bovine aortic endothelial cells with dominant-inhibitory mutants of Akt (Akt-AAA) or AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (AMPKK45R). Neither mutant affected production of NO in response to LPA treatment. Importantly, only AMPKK45R, but not Akt-AAA, caused a significant partial inhibition of NO production in response to adiponectin. Moreover, AMPK-K45R inhibited phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1179 in response to adiponectin but not in response to insulin. We conclude that adiponectin has novel vascular actions to directly stimulate production of NO in endothelial cells using phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathways involving phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1179 by AMPK. Thus, the effects of adiponectin to augment metabolic actions of insulin in vivo may be due, in part, to vasodilator actions of adiponectin. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485

17303804	20070217	Genetic influences of adiponectin on insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.	Recent evidence points to molecules secreted by the adipose tissue, or adipokines, as possible links between increased adipose mass and metabolic abnormalities. Among these molecules, adiponectin has drawn much attention because of its insulin-sensitizing and antiatherogenic actions, suggesting that genetic deficits in its production or action may contribute to insulin resistance and coronary artery disease (CAD). A meta-analysis of the data published to date supports this hypothesis. Two independent effects, corresponding to the two linkage disequilibrium blocks that can be identified at the adiponectin locus, appear to be present. In the 5' block, the g.-11391G--&gt;A variant has a modest but significant effect on adiponectinemia, with a mean difference between genotypes of 1.64 ng/ml (95% CI 0.88-2.41). In the 3' block, the g.+276G--&gt;T variant is a strong determinant of insulin resistance and CAD, with minor allele homozygotes having a lower homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA(IR)) index (-0.36 units, 95% CI 0.24-0.47) and a lower cardiovascular risk (odds ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.38-0.80) than carriers of other genotypes. No consistent effect on BMI or risk of type 2 diabetes is evident. Polymorphisms in the genes coding for the adiponectin receptors may also influence the risk of insulin resistance and CAD, but data on these genes are still too sparse to draw firm conclusions. In summary, the studies published to date indicate that polymorphisms at the adiponectin locus are indeed predictors of circulating adiponectin levels, insulin sensitivity, and atherosclerosis, highlighting the pivotal role of this adipokine in the modulation of metabolism and atherogenesis.

26402764	20150925	A Novel A?PP M722K Mutation Affects Amyloid-? Secretion and Tau Phosphorylation and May Cause Early-Onset Familial Alzheimer's Disease in Chinese Individuals.	Mutations within exons 16 and 17 of the amyloid-? protein precursor (A?PP) gene were the first known causes of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (EOFAD). Since the first A?PP mutation was reported, 39 different A?PP variations have been discovered in EOFAD. We described a novel A?PP M722K mutation found in a Chinese familial Alzheimer's disease pedigree and confirmed its effects on amyloid-? (A?) secretion and tau phosphorylation. We performed direct sequencing of exons 16 and 17 of the A?PP gene and coding exons 3-12 of the PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes for genetic analysis. N2a cells were transfected with wild-type A?PP, A?PP constructs harboring the M722K mutation, or A?PP constructs harboring the Swedish mutation to demonstrate the effects of the A?PP M722K mutation on A? secretion and tau phosphorylation. Different phenotypes of patients carrying the A?PP M722K mutation maybe were related to different apolipoprotein E genotypes. The expression of A?PP M722K in mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells induced a 1.7-fold increased ratio of A? 42 to A? 40 without changes in sA?PP? and sA?PP?. Tau phosphorylation at the AT8 sites was also increased. Maybe the A?PP M722K mutation contributed to the cause of EOFAD in this Chinese pedigree mediated by increased A? 42/A? 40. Further studies should be conducted to validate the pathogenicity of A?PP M722K and the interactions among ?-secretase, APOE, and A?PP. 	J._Alzheimers_Dis.	D016428 D016448 D013485
9202006	19970704	Role of the glycine triad in the ATP-binding site of cAMP-dependent protein kinase.	A glycine-rich loop in the ATP-binding site is one of the most highly conserved sequence motifs in protein kinases. Each conserved glycine (Gly-50, Gly-52, and Gly-55) in the catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) was replaced with Ser and/or Ala. Active mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to apparent homogeneity, separated into phosphoisoforms, and characterized. Replacing Gly-55 had minimal effects on steady-state kinetic parameters, whereas replacement of either Gly-50 or Gly-52 had major effects on both Km and kcat values consistent with the prediction of the importance of the tip of the glycine-rich loop for catalysis. Substitution of Gly-50 caused a 5-8-fold reduction in Km (ATP), an 8-12-fold increase in Km (peptide), and a 3-5-fold drop in kcat. The Km (ATP) and Km (peptide) values of C(G52S) were increased 8- and 18-fold, respectively, and the kcat was decreased 6-fold. In contrast to catalytic efficiency, the ATPase rates of C(G50S) and C(G52S) were increased by more than an order of magnitude. The thermostability of each mutant was slightly increased. Unphosphorylated C(G52S) was characterized as well as several isoforms phosphorylated at a single site, Ser-338. All of these phosphorylation-defective mutants displayed a substantial decrease in both enzymatic activity and thermal stability that correlated with the missing phosphate at Thr-197. These results are correlated with the crystal structure, models of the respective mutant proteins, and conservation of the Glys within the protein kinase family. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
23433342	20130226	A system-level, molecular evolutionary analysis of mammalian phototransduction.	Visual perception is initiated in the photoreceptor cells of the retina via the phototransduction system. This system has shown marked evolution during mammalian divergence in such complex attributes as activation time and recovery time. We have performed a molecular evolutionary analysis of proteins involved in mammalian phototransduction in order to unravel how the action of natural selection has been distributed throughout the system to evolve such traits. We found selective pressures to be non-randomly distributed according to both a simple protein classification scheme and a protein-interaction network representation of the signaling pathway. Proteins which are topologically central in the signaling pathway, such as the G proteins, as well as retinoid cycle chaperones and proteins involved in photoreceptor cell-type determination, were found to be more constrained in their evolution. Proteins peripheral to the pathway, such as ion channels and exchangers, as well as the retinoid cycle enzymes, have experienced a relaxation of selective pressures. Furthermore, signals of positive selection were detected in two genes: the short-wave (blue) opsin (OPN1SW) in hominids and the rod-specific Na+/ Ca2+, K+ ion exchanger (SLC24A1) in rodents. The functions of the proteins involved in phototransduction and the topology of the interactions between them have imposed non-random constraints on their evolution. Thus, in shaping or conserving system-level phototransduction traits, natural selection has targeted the underlying proteins in a concerted manner. 	BMC_Evol._Biol.	D016428 D013485
21320115	20110216	An association analysis at 2q36 reveals a new candidate susceptibility gene for juvenile absence epilepsy and/or absence seizures associated with generalized tonic-clonic seizures.	To further evaluate the previously shown linkage of absence epilepsy (AE) to 2q36, both in human and WAG/Rij absence rat models, a 160-kb region at 2q36 containing eight genes with expressions in the brain was targeted in a case-control association study involving 205 Turkish patients with AE and 219 controls. Haplotype block and case-control association analysis was carried out using HAPLOVIEW 4.0 and inhibin alpha subunit (INHA) gene analysis by DNA sequencing. An association was found between the G allele of rs7588807 located in the INHA gene and juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) syndrome and patients having generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) with p-values of 0.003 and 0.0002, respectively (uncorrected for multiple comparisons). DNA sequence analysis of the INHA gene in 110 JAE/GTCS patients revealed three point mutations with possible damaging effects on inhibin function in three patients and the presence of a common ACTC haplotype (H1) with a possible dominant protective role conferred by the T allele of rs7588807 with respective p-values of 0.0005 and 0.0014. The preceding findings suggest that INHA could be a novel candidate susceptibility gene involved in the pathogenesis of JAE or AE associated with GTCS. 	Epilepsia	D016428 D013485
22678813	20120609	An unmasked mutation of EIF2B2 due to submicroscopic deletion of 14q24.3 in a patient with vanishing white matter disease.	Leukodystrophy with vanishing white matter (VWM) is a neurodegenerative disorder with autosomal recessive traits that is caused by alteration of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2B (EIF2B). An 11-month-old patient with distinctive features began to exhibit progressive developmental deterioration associated with intractable epilepsy, which was triggered by recurrent acute infectious diseases. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed abnormal white matter intensity. Chromosomal microarray testing identified a submicroscopic deletion at 14q24.3 that included EIF2B2, the gene encoding one of the subunits of EIF2B. Because the patient's clinical findings were distinctive for VWM, compound heterozygous mutations of EIF2B2 were suspected, and subsequent sequencing analysis of the remaining allele unmasked the existence of a novel missense mutation of EIF2B2 (V85W). Some distinctive features including small palpebral fissures, bushy eyebrows, ear abnormalities, small upturned nose, downturned corners of the mouth, and micrognathia may be the common features of the patients with 14q24.3 deletions.

24959884	20140625	Nuclear MEK1 sequesters PPAR? and bisects MEK1/ERK signaling: a non-canonical pathway of retinoic acid inhibition of adipocyte differentiation.	Uncontrolled adipogenesis and adipocyte proliferation have been connected to human comorbidities. Retinoic acid (RA) is known to inhibit adipocyte differentiation, however the underlying mechanisms have not been adequately understood. This study reports that RA acting as a ligand to RA receptors (RARs and RXRs) is not a sine qua non to the inhibition of adipogenesis. Our intriguing observation of a negative correlation between increased retinoylation and adipogenesis led us to explore retinoylated proteins in adipocytes. Exportin (CRM1) was found to be retinoylated, which in turn can affect the spatio-temporal regulation of the important signaling molecule mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1), likely by disrupting its export from the nucleus. Nuclear enrichment of MEK1 physically sequesters peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR?), the master regulator of adipogenesis, from its target genes and thus inhibits adipogenesis while also disrupting the MEK1-extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) signaling cascade. This study is first to report the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation by retinoylation. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
23629699	20130501	Identification of PTC725, an orally bioavailable small molecule that selectively targets the hepatitis C Virus NS4B protein.	While new direct-acting antiviral agents for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have been approved, there is a continued need for novel antiviral agents that act on new targets and can be used in combination with current therapies to enhance efficacy and to restrict the emergence of drug-resistant viral variants. To this end, we have identified a novel class of small molecules, exemplified by PTC725, that target the nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B). PTC725 inhibited HCV 1b (Con1) replicons with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 1.7 nM and an EC90 of 9.6 nM and demonstrated a &gt;1,000-fold selectivity window with respect to cytotoxicity. The compounds were fully active against HCV replicon mutants that are resistant to inhibitors of NS3 protease and NS5B polymerase. Replicons selected for resistance to PTC725 harbored amino acid substitutions F98L/C and V105M in NS4B. Anti-replicon activity of PTC725 was additive to synergistic in combination with alpha interferon or with inhibitors of HCV protease and polymerase. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that neither the HCV inhibitors nor the F98C substitution altered the subcellular localization of NS4B or NS5A in replicon cells. Oral dosing of PTC725 showed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile with high liver and plasma exposure in mice and rats. Modeling of dosing regimens in humans indicates that a once-per-day or twice-per-day oral dosing regimen is feasible. Overall, the preclinical data support the development of PTC725 for use in the treatment of chronic HCV infection. 	Antimicrob._Agents_Chemother.	D016428
26075076	20150616	Involvement of vascular endothelial growth factor -460 C/T, +405 G/C and +936 C/T polymorphisms in the development of endometriosis.	There are inconsistent data on the contribution of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -460 C/T (rs833061), +405 G/C (rs2010963) and +936 C/T (rs3025039) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to endometriosis in different ethnicities. Therefore, using high-resolution melting curve analysis, the present study examined the distribution of these SNPs in females with endometriosis-related infertility and a control group. None of the threeVEGFSNPs were associated with endometriosis-related infertility in the dominant and recessive models. The lowest P-values of the trend were observed for theVEGF+936 C/T (rs3025039) SNP in endometriosis-related infertility (Ptrend=0.149). Similarly, haplotype analyses ofVEGFSNPs did not demonstrate any SNP combination as a risk for endometriosis-related infertility, and the lowest overall P-values, P=0.141 and Pcorr=0.395, were observed for a haplotype (TGT) of the above SNPs. Taken together, these results did not demonstrate the contribution ofVEGFC/T, +405 G/C and +936 C/T SNPs to endometriosis-related infertility. 	Biomed_Rep	D016428

24340026	20131217	Cathepsin E deficiency impairs autophagic proteolysis in macrophages.	Cathepsin E is an endosomal aspartic proteinase that is predominantly expressed in immune-related cells. Recently, we showed that macrophages derived from cathepsin E-deficient (CatE(-/-)) mice display accumulation of lysosomal membrane proteins and abnormal membrane trafficking. In this study, we demonstrated that CatE(-/-) macrophages exhibit abnormalities in autophagy, a bulk degradation system for aggregated proteins and damaged organelles. CatE(-/-) macrophages showed increased accumulation of autophagy marker proteins such as LC3 and p62, and polyubiquitinated proteins. Cathepsin E deficiency also altered autophagy-related signaling pathways such as those mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Akt, and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK). Furthermore, immunofluorescence microscopy analyses showed that LC3-positive vesicles were merged with acidic compartments in wild-type macrophages, but not in CatE(-/-) macrophages, indicating inhibition of fusion of autophagosome with lysosomes in CatE(-/-) cells. Delayed degradation of LC3 protein was also observed under starvation-induced conditions. Since the autophagy system is involved in the degradation of damaged mitochondria, we examined the accumulation of damaged mitochondria in CatE(-/-) macrophages. Several mitochondrial abnormalities such as decreased intracellular ATP levels, depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, and decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption were observed. Such mitochondrial dysfunction likely led to the accompanying oxidative stress. In fact, CatE(-/-) macrophages showed increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and up-regulation of oxidized peroxiredoxin-6, but decreased antioxidant glutathione. These results indicate that cathepsin E deficiency causes autophagy impairment concomitantly with increased aberrant mitochondria as well as increased oxidative stress. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
23505615	20130319	Lack of HLA predominance and HLA shared epitopes in biliary Atresia.	Biliary atresia (BA) is characterized by progressive inflammation and fibrosis of bile ducts. A theory of pathogenesis entails autoimmune-mediated injury targeting bile duct epithelia. One of the strongest genetic associations with autoimmunity is with HLA genes. In addition, apparently dissimilar HLA alleles may have similar antigen-binding sites, called shared epitopes, that overlap in their capacity to present antigens. In autoimmune disease, the incidence of the disease may be related to the presence of shared epitopes, not simply the HLA allelic association. To determine HLA allele frequency (high-resolution genotyping) and shared epitope associations in BA. Analysis of every allele for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DPB1 and -DQB1 in 180 BA and 360 racially-matched controls did not identify any significant HLA association with BA. Furthermore, shared epitope analysis of greater than 10 million possible combinations of peptide sequences was not different between BA and controls. This study encompasses the largest HLA allele frequency analysis for BA in the United States and is the first study to perform shared epitope analysis. When controlling for multiple comparisons, no HLA allele or shared epitope association was identified in BA. Future studies of genetic links to BA that involve alterations of the immune response should include investigations into defects in regulatory T cells and non-HLA linked autoinflammatory diseases.

23055834	20121012	Risk of cardiovascular disease and total mortality in adults with type 1 diabetes: Scottish registry linkage study.	Randomized controlled trials have shown the importance of tight glucose control in type 1 diabetes (T1DM), but few recent studies have evaluated the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality among adults with T1DM. We evaluated these risks in adults with T1DM compared with the non-diabetic population in a nationwide study from Scotland and examined control of CVD risk factors in those with T1DM. The Scottish Care Information-Diabetes Collaboration database was used to identify all people registered with T1DM and aged ?20 years in 2005-2007 and to provide risk factor data. Major CVD events and deaths were obtained from the national hospital admissions database and death register. The age-adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) for CVD and mortality in T1DM (n?=?21,789) versus the non-diabetic population (3.96 million) was estimated using Poisson regression. The age-adjusted IRR for first CVD event associated with T1DM versus the non-diabetic population was higher in women (3.0: 95% CI 2.4-3.8, p&lt;0.001) than men (2.3: 2.0-2.7, p&lt;0.001) while the IRR for all-cause mortality associated with T1DM was comparable at 2.6 (2.2-3.0, p&lt;0.001) in men and 2.7 (2.2-3.4, p&lt;0.001) in women. Between 2005-2007, among individuals with T1DM, 34 of 123 deaths among 10,173 who were &lt;40 years and 37 of 907 deaths among 12,739 who were ?40 years had an underlying cause of death of coma or diabetic ketoacidosis. Among individuals 60-69 years, approximately three extra deaths per 100 per year occurred among men with T1DM (28.51/1,000 person years at risk), and two per 100 per year for women (17.99/1,000 person years at risk). 28% of those with T1DM were current smokers, 13% achieved target HbA(1c) of &lt;7% and 37% had very poor (?9%) glycaemic control. Among those aged ?40, 37% had blood pressures above even conservative targets (?140/90 mmHg) and 39% of those ?40 years were not on a statin. Although many of these risk factors were comparable to those previously reported in other developed countries, CVD and mortality rates may not be generalizable to other countries. Limitations included lack of information on the specific insulin therapy used. Although the relative risks for CVD and total mortality associated with T1DM in this population have declined relative to earlier studies, T1DM continues to be associated with higher CVD and death rates than the non-diabetic population. Risk factor management should be improved to further reduce risk but better treatment approaches for achieving good glycaemic control are badly needed.

24090058	20131005	Structure and dynamic behavior of Toll-like receptor 2 subfamily triggered by malarial glycosylphosphatidylinositols of Plasmodium falciparum.	Proinflammatory responses by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to malaria infection are considered to be a significant factor in suppressing pathogen growth and in disease control. The key protozoan parasite Plasmodium?falciparum causes malaria through glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs), which induce the host immune response mainly via TLR2 signalling. Experimental studies have suggested that malarial GPIs from P.?falciparum are recognized by the TLR2 subfamily. However, the interaction site and their involvement in the activation mechanism are still unknown. A better understanding of the detailed structure of the TLR-GPI interaction is important for the design of more effective anti-malarial therapeutics. We used a molecular docking method to predict the binding regions of malarial GPIs with the TLR2 subfamily members. We also employed molecular dynamics simulations and principal component analysis to understand ligand-induced conformational changes of the TLR2 subfamily. We observed the expected structural changes upon ligand binding, and significant movements were found in loop regions located in the ligand-binding site of the TLR2 subfamily. We further propose that the binding modes of malarial GPIs are similar to lipopeptides, and that the lipid portions of the ligands could play an essential role in selective dimerization of the TLR2 subfamily.

21792326	20110728	Is obesity in women protective against osteoporosis?	The belief that obesity is protective against osteoporosis has recently come into question. The latest epidemiologic and clinical studies have shown that a high level of fat mass might be a risk factor for osteoporosis and fragility fractures. Further, increasing evidence seems to indicate that different components of the metabolic syndrome, ie, hypertension, increased triglycerides, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, are also potential risk factors for the development of low bone mineral density and osteoporosis. This review considers both the older and more recent data in the literature in order to evaluate further the relationship between fat tissue and bone tissue. 	Diabetes_Metab_Syndr_Obes	D016428
9578585	19980606	Influence of proximal side mutations on the molecular and electronic structure of cyanomet myoglobin: an 1H NMR study.	A series of proximal side mutants of sperm whale metmyoglobin (metMb) that involves residues which provide hydrogen bonds to the axial His and heme have been prepared, and the CO binding and solution molecular and electronic structure has been investigated by 1H NMR. These include Ser92(F7), whose O gamma serves as a hydrogen-bond acceptor to the axial His ring NdeltaH and whose O gamma H serves as hydrogen-bond donor to the 7-propionate carboxylate, and His97(FG3) whose ring provides the other hydrogen-bond donor to the 7-propionate carboxylate. 2D NMR data on the S92A-metMbCN, S92P-metMbCN and H97F-metMbCN show that the distal structure is completely conserved and that proximal side structural changes are highly localized. For the S92A-metMbCN, altered dipolar contacts to the F-helix backbone show that the axial His imidazole has rotated clockwise by approximately 10 degrees relative to a stationary heme, while in H97F-metMbCN, the altered heme-E helix backbone contacts reveal that the heme has rotated counterclockwise by approximately 3 degrees relative to a conserved axial His. The pattern of axial His rotation was qualitatively predicted by energy minimization calculations. The assignments and conserved structural elements allow the determination of a set of magnetic axes whose major magnetic axis is unchanged with respect to WT and confirms that local distal, and not proximal, interactions control the orientation of the major magnetic axis and, by inference, the degree and direction of tilt of the Fe-CN from the heme normal. The rhombic magnetic axes in S92A-metMbCN are rotated approximately 10 degrees in the opposite direction from the established approximately 10 degrees rotation for the axial His ring as expected. It is shown, moreover, that the pairwise alpha-, gamma-meso vs beta-, delta-meso-H hyperfine shift differences are well predicted by the change in the location of the rhombic magnetic axes. Carbon monoxide ligation rates experience minor but systematic perturbation for the S92A substitutions which confirms an influence (albeit very small) for axial His orientation on ligand affinity.

25283508	20141007	Serum uric acid levels are associated with polymorphisms in the SLC2A9, SF1, and GCKR genes in a Chinese population.	Genome-wide association studies have identified several novel loci associated with serum uric acid concentrations in individuals of European descent. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the associations between these loci and serum uric acid concentrations in a Chinese population. Fourteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapped in or near 11 loci (PDZK1, GCKR, LRP2, SLC2A9, ABCG2, LRRC16A, SLC17A1, SLC17A3, SLC22A11, SLC22A12 and SF1) were genotyped in 2329 Chinese subjects in Shanghai. Serum biochemical parameters including uric acid concentrations were determined. All the variants were analyzed for gender differences since uric acid metabolism differed between genders. In males after adjustments for age and BMI, GCKR rs780094, SLC2A9 rs11722228 and SF1 rs606458 were associated with the uric acid concentrations, which were statistically significant (P=0.016, 0.001 and 0.03, respectively), whereas SLC2A9 rs3775948 was marginally associated with the uric acid concentrations (P=0.071). In females, SLC22A12 rs506338 was also marginally associated with the uric acid concentrations (P=0.057). The meta-analysis for combined data from both males and females revealed that rs3775948 and rs606458 were associated with the uric acid concentrations (P=0.036 and 0.043, respectively). Furthermore, the gender significantly affected the association of rs11722228 with serum uric acid levels (P=0.012). The SLC2A9 rs11722228, SF1 rs606458 and GCKR rs780094 variants modulate uric acid concentrations in Chinese males, while SF1 rs606458 and SLC2A9 rs3775948 are associated with the uric acid concentrations in both Chinese males and females.

Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) are sporadic or inherited vascular lesions of the central nervous system characterized by dilated, thin-walled, leaky vessels. Linkage studies have mapped autosomal dominant mutations to three loci: ccm1 (KRIT1), ccm2 (OSM), and ccm3 (PDCD10). All three proteins appear to be scaffolds or adaptor proteins, as no enzymatic function can be attributed to them. Our previous results demonstrated that OSM is a scaffold for the assembly of the GTPase Rac and the MAPK kinase kinase MEKK3, for the hyperosmotic stress-dependent activation of p38 MAPK. Herein, we show that the three CCM proteins are members of a larger signaling complex. To define this complex, epitope-tagged wild type OSM or OSM harboring the mutation of F217--&gt;A, which renders the OSM phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain unable to bind KRIT1, were stably introduced into RAW264.7 mouse macrophages. FLAG-OSM or FLAG-OSMF217A and the associated complex members were purified by immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody. OSM binding partners were identified by gel-based methods combined with electrospray ionization-MS or by multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT). Previously identified proteins that associate with OSM including KRIT1, MEKK3, Rac, and the KRIT1-binding protein ICAP-1 were found in the immunoprecipitates. In addition, we show for the first time that PDCD10 binds to OSM and is found in cellular CCM complexes. Other prominent proteins that bound the CCM complex include EF1A1, RIN2, and tubulin, with each interaction disrupted with the OSMF217A mutant protein. We further show that PDCD10 binds phosphatidylinositol di- and triphosphates and OSM binds phosphatidylinositol monophosphates. The findings define the targeting of the CCM complex to membranes and to proteins regulating trafficking and the cytoskeleton. 	J._Proteome_Res.	D016428 D052061 D013485
25474898	20141206	[Expression of bioinformatically identified genes in skin of psoriasis patients].	Gene expression analysis for EPHA2 (EPH receptor A2), EPHB2 (EPH receptor B2), S100A9 (S100 calcium binding protein A9), PBEF(nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase), LILRB2 (leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor, subfamily B (with TM and ITIM domains), member 2), PLAUR (plasminogen activator, urokinase receptor), LTB (lymphotoxin beta (TNF superfamily, member 3)), WNT5A (wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 5A) has been conducted using real-time polymerase chain reaction in specimens affected by psoriasis versus visually intact skin in 18 patients. It was revealed that the expression of the nine examined genes was upregulated in the affected by psoriasis compared to visually intact skin specimens. The highest expression was observed for S100A9, S100AS, PBEF, WNT5A2, and EPHB2 genes. S100A9 and S100A8 gene expression in the affected by psoriasis skin was 100-fold higher versus visually intact skin while PBEF, WNT5A, and EPHB2 gene expression was upregulated more than five-fold. We suggested that the high expression of these genes might be associated with the state of the pathological process in psoriasis. Moreover, the transcriptional activity of these genes might serve a molecular indicator of the efficacy of treatment in psoriasis. 	Genetika	D016428
8724135	19960401	Transcription of the beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase gene in B lymphocytes is directed by a separate and distinct promoter.	A single human gene, SIAT1, encodes the beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase from which multiple mRNA isoforms are generated. In rat, expression of the hepatic mRNA isoform (Form 1) has been defined with respect to the transcriptional initiation site and promoter region. We show here that a similar hepatic SIAT1 mRNA isoform exists in human. Another human mRNA isoform, a mature B-cell-specific mRNA isoform (Form 2), was previously reported. Here, we used 5'-RACE and S1 nuclease protection analysis to define the 5'-untranslated region of Form 2 human SIAT1 mRNA. We demonstrate conclusively that Form 2 mRNA is initiated from a point completely distinct from that of Form 1 mRNA. A number of cis-acting regulatory elements residing immediately 5'of the Form 2 initiation site includes AP-1, AP-2, NF-kappa B, NF-IL6, C/EBP, and CREB. A TATAA box is also present 29 bp 5' of the transcriptional initiation site. CAT reporter gene expression from serially-truncated segments of the 5'-flanking region of the Form 2 initiation site indicates that the segment between -784 and +125 was sufficient to promote high level CAT expression in Louckes, a mature B-cell line. The 5'-flanking region to the human Form 1 initiation site is competent in expression of CAT upon transfection of the fusion construct into HepG2, a human hepatoma cell line. Cellular specificity of expression is apparently retained. Louckes cells expressed CAT efficiently from Form 2 promoter but only marginally from the Form 1 promoter. In contrast, CAT expression from Form 1 promoter is more efficient than from the Form 2 promoter in HepG2 cells. 	Glycobiology	D016428 D013487
22241178	20120114	AAV-based neonatal gene therapy for hemophilia A: long-term correction and avoidance of immune responses in mice.	Hemophilia A gene therapy has been hampered by immune responses to vector-associated antigens and by neutralizing antibodies or inhibitors against the factor VIII (FVIII) protein; these 'inhibitors' more commonly affect hemophilia A patients than those with hemophilia B. A gene replacement strategy beginning in the neonatal period may avoid the development of these immune responses and lead to prolonged expression with correction of phenotype, thereby avoiding long-term consequences. A serotype rh10 adeno-associated virus (AAV) was developed splitting the FVIII coding sequence into heavy and light chains with the chicken ?-actin promoter/CMV enhancer for dual recombinant adeno-associated viral vector delivery. Virions of each FVIII chain were co-injected intravenously into mice on the second day of life. Mice express sustained levels of FVIII antigen ?5% up to 22 months of life without development of antibodies against FVIII. Phenotypic correction was manifest in all AAV-FVIII-treated mice as demonstrated by functional assay and reduction in bleeding time. This study demonstrates the use of AAV in a gene replacement strategy in neonatal mice that establishes both long-term phenotypic correction of hemophilia A and lack of antibody development against FVIII in this disease model where AAV is administered shortly after birth. These studies support the consideration of gene replacement therapy for diseases that are diagnosed in utero or in the early neonatal period. 	Gene_Ther.	D016428 D052061 D013485
25971455	20150515	Mutation of the iron-sulfur cluster assembly gene IBA57 causes fatal infantile leukodystrophy.	Leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of severe genetic neurodegenerative disorders. A multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome was found in an infant presenting with a progressive leukoencephalopathy. Homozygosity mapping, whole exome sequencing, and functional studies were used to define the underlying molecular defect. Respiratory chain studies in skeletal muscle isolated from the proband revealed a combined deficiency of complexes I and II. In addition, western blotting indicated lack of protein lipoylation. The combination of these findings was suggestive for a defect in the iron-sulfur (Fe/S) protein assembly pathway. SNP array identified loss of heterozygosity in large chromosomal regions, covering the NFU1 and BOLA3, and the IBA57 and ABCB10 candidate genes, in 2p15-p11.2 and 1q31.1-q42.13, respectively. A homozygous c.436C?&gt;?T (p.Arg146Trp) variant was detected in IBA57 using whole exome sequencing. Complementation studies in a HeLa cell line depleted for IBA57 showed that the mutant protein with the semi-conservative amino acid exchange was unable to restore the biochemical phenotype indicating a loss-of-function mutation of IBA57. In conclusion, defects in the Fe/S protein assembly gene IBA57 can cause autosomal recessive neurodegeneration associated with progressive leukodystrophy and fatal outcome at young age. In the affected patient, the biochemical phenotype was characterized by a defect in the respiratory chain complexes I and II and a decrease in mitochondrial protein lipoylation, both resulting from impaired assembly of Fe/S clusters.

24805240	20140509	Quantitative flux analysis reveals folate-dependent NADPH production.	ATP is the dominant energy source in animals for mechanical and electrical work (for example, muscle contraction or neuronal firing). For chemical work, there is an equally important role for NADPH, which powers redox defence and reductive biosynthesis. The most direct route to produce NADPH from glucose is the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, with malic enzyme sometimes also important. Although the relative contribution of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation to ATP production has been extensively analysed, similar analysis of NADPH metabolism has been lacking. Here we demonstrate the ability to directly track, by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, the passage of deuterium from labelled substrates into NADPH, and combine this approach with carbon labelling and mathematical modelling to measure NADPH fluxes. In proliferating cells, the largest contributor to cytosolic NADPH is the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. Surprisingly, a nearly comparable contribution comes from serine-driven one-carbon metabolism, in which oxidation of methylene tetrahydrofolate to 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate is coupled to reduction of NADP(+) to NADPH. Moreover, tracing of mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism revealed complete oxidation of 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate to make NADPH. As folate metabolism has not previously been considered an NADPH producer, confirmation of its functional significance was undertaken through knockdown of methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD) genes. Depletion of either the cytosolic or mitochondrial MTHFD isozyme resulted in decreased cellular NADPH/NADP(+) and reduced/oxidized glutathione ratios (GSH/GSSG) and increased cell sensitivity to oxidative stress. Thus, although the importance of folate metabolism for proliferating cells has been long recognized and attributed to its function of producing one-carbon units for nucleic acid synthesis, another crucial function of this pathway is generating reducing power.

27377295	20160706	Role of F225 in O-phosphoserine sulfhydrylase from Aeropyrum pernix K1.	O-Phosphoserine sulfhydrylase (OPSS) synthesizes cysteine from O-phospho-L-serine (OPS) and sulfide. We have determined the three-dimensional structures of OPSS from hyperthermophilic archaeon Aeropyrum pernix K1 (ApOPSS) in complex with aminoacrylate intermediate (AA) formed from pyridoxal 5'-phosphate with OPS or in complex with cysteine and compared them with that of ApOPSS. We found an orientational change of F225 at the active-site entrance and constructed an F225A mutant to examine its activities and AA stability and clarify the role of F225 in ApOPSS. The OPS and O-acetyl-L-serine (OAS) sulfhydrylase activities of the F225A mutant decreased by 4.2- and 15-fold compared to those of the wild-type (wt) ApOPSS, respectively. The ability of OPS and OAS to form AA also decreased by 12- and 27-fold, respectively. AA was less stable in the F225A mutant than in the wt ApOPSS. Simulated docking showed that leaving groups, such as phosphate and acetate, were oriented to the inside of the active site in the F225A mutant, whereas they were oriented to the entrance in the wt ApOPSS. These results suggest that F225 in ApOPSS plays important roles in maintaining the hydrophobic environment of AA from solvent water and in controlling the orientation of leaving groups.

20101303	20100127	Biologics: target-specific treatment of systemic and cutaneous autoimmune diseases.	Biologics are becoming important in the treatment of systemic and cutaneous autoimmune diseases. They are designed to target specific components of immune system. As the new drugs are capable of targeting proteins in a more specific fashion, yet have lower risks of systemic side-effects, they have considerable advantages over the older immunomodulators. The development of TNF-alpha blockers in the treatment of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and ankylosing spondylitis have been major breakthroughs. Likewise, B-cell depletion has proved to be equally revolutionary for the treatment of lupus, pemphigus, certain vasculitides etc. But all said and done, the development of these molecules and their clinical usage are still at evolving stages. Consensus needs be formed to further categorize the clinical profiles of the patients in whom biologics are to be used in the future, given that the long-term safety profiles of these agents are very much unknown at present.

To consider a possible cumulative effect of two genetic polymorphisms (FOXP3 C-2383T/rs3761549 and FCRL3 C-169T/rs7528684) that were previously shown to be associated with endometriosis. Genetic association study. Human reproduction outpatient clinic of Faculdade de Medicina do ABC. One hundred eighty-eight infertile women with endometriosis and 169 controls. Detection of polymorphisms FOXP3 (C-2383T/rs3761549) and FCRL3 (C-169T/rs7528684) by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results were analyzed statistically. Genotype distribution, allele frequency, and combination analysis of the FOXP3 and FCRL3 polymorphisms. Single-marker analysis revealed a significant association of FOXP3 C-2383T and FCRL3 C-169T, independently, with endometriosis-related infertility, regardless of the stage of the disease. Considering the combined genotypes of FCRL3 and FOXP3 polymorphisms, a positive association was found between genotypes FCRL3TT/FOXP3CT, FCRL3CT/FOXP3CT, and FCRL3CC/FOXP3CT and the risk of endometriosis development. Moreover, a progression of the disease risk was observed according to the presence of one or two copies of risk allele FCRL3 C and only one copy of risk allele FOXP3 T (odds ratio [OR] = 2.14, OR = 3.25, and OR = 6.0, respectively, for genotypes FCRL3TT/FOXP3CT, FCRL3CT/FOXP3CT, and FCRL3CC/FOXP3CT). Our findings support a possible gene-gene interaction leading to a cumulative effect on endometriosis development. 	Fertil._Steril.	D016428 D013485
17618615	20070710	Hyperhomocysteinemia and elevated ox-LDL in Tunisian type 2 diabetic patients: role of genetic and dietary factors.	Total plasma homocysteine (tHcy) is an emerging risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. However, its relationship with diabetes is still unclear. We evaluated the association between tHcy levels and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C--&gt;T genotype in a type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) population and their relationship with oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) according to dietary habits and vascular complications. Eighty-six DM patients were compared to 120 healthy volunteers. Associated higher tHcy levels and significantly higher ox-LDL levels (p&lt;0.001) were found in DM patients compared to healthy subjects. Homozygosity for the T allele of MTHFR was more frequent in diabetics than in healthy subjects (12.8% vs. 7.2%) and it was associated with higher tHcy levels. Moreover, this elevated level was associated with significantly higher ox-LDL levels in DM patients with hypertension (p&lt;0.05). Improving folate and vitamin C intakes could have beneficial effects on lowering the tHcy and ox-LDL levels. The interplay of genetic and dietary factors modulates the effect of homocysteine on cardiovascular risk factors. 	Clin._Biochem.	D016428 D013485
22479321	20120406	Therapeutic hemoglobin levels after gene transfer in ?-thalassemia mice and in hematopoietic cells of ?-thalassemia and sickle cells disease patients.	Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate the feasibility of treating ?-thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) by lentiviral-mediated transfer of the human ?-globin gene. However, previous studies have not addressed whether the ability of lentiviral vectors to increase hemoglobin synthesis might vary in different patients.We generated lentiviral vectors carrying the human ?-globin gene with and without an ankyrin insulator and compared their ability to induce hemoglobin synthesis in vitro and in thalassemic mice. We found that insertion of an ankyrin insulator leads to higher, potentially therapeutic levels of human ?-globin through a novel mechanism that links the rate of transcription of the transgenic ?-globin mRNA during erythroid differentiation with polysomal binding and efficient translation, as reported here for the first time. We also established a preclinical assay to test the ability of this novel vector to synthesize adult hemoglobin in erythroid precursors and in CD34(+) cells isolated from patients affected by ?-thalassemia and SCD. Among the thalassemic patients, we identified a subset of specimens in which hemoglobin production can be achieved using fewer copies of the vector integrated than in others. In SCD specimens the treatment with AnkT9W ameliorates erythropoiesis by increasing adult hemoglobin (Hb A) and concurrently reducing the sickling tetramer (Hb S).Our results suggest two major findings. First, we discovered that for the purpose of expressing the ?-globin gene the ankyrin element is particularly suitable. Second, our analysis of a large group of specimens from ?-thalassemic and SCD patients indicates that clinical trials could benefit from a simple test to predict the relationship between the number of vector copies integrated and the total amount of hemoglobin produced in the erythroid cells of prospective patients. This approach would provide vital information to select the best candidates for these clinical trials, before patients undergo myeloablation and bone marrow transplant.

8349640	19930815	Lysine 84 is at the subunit interface of lac repressor protein.	Mutations have been generated at the Lys84 site of the lac repressor to explore its predicted role in inducer binding and/or subunit interaction. Four single mutations, Lys84--&gt;Ala, Lys84--&gt;Leu, Lys84--&gt;Arg, and Lys84--&gt;Glu, have been generated by site-specific mutagenesis. In addition, the mutation Tyr282--&gt;Asp, which results in a monomeric repressor, has been coupled with these four single mutants to generate the four corresponding double mutants. Unchanged inducer binding affinities in all Lys84 mutants except Lys84--&gt;Arg suggest that Lys84 does not contribute energy to inducer binding and is not found in the inducer-binding site as previously proposed (Sams, C. F., Vyas, N. K., Quiocho, F. A., and Matthews, K. S. (1984) Nature 310, 429-430). Interestingly, the double mutants with hydrophobic side chains at the Lys84 site are tetramers, while those with charged side chains remain monomers. This result agrees with the recent model of the lac repressor (Nichols, J. C., Vyas, N. K., Quiocho, F. A., and Matthews, K. S. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 17602-17612), in which Lys84 is mapped by sequence alignment to the same face of the subunit as Tyr282. More detailed inducer binding, operator binding, and immunoblotting studies show that all the mutations at Lys84 have quaternary structures that deviate from wild-type protein, providing supportive evidence for the model placing this residue on the surface of the monomer subunit. Substitution of Lys84 by Ala or Leu results in 100-200-fold decreased association and dissociation rate constants for inducer binding and biphasic character. This decrease can be rescued at least partially in the respective double mutants at elevated pH, at which wild-type repressor shows a 10-fold decrease in affinity and cooperativity in inducer binding. In all substitutions with Ala or Leu, immunoblotting patterns with monoclonal antibody, an assay sensitive to alterations in quaternary structure, are distinct from wild-type repressor. Although substitution with Arg at position 84 yields a protein with 10-fold lower inducer binding affinity, the mutant shows decreased pH dependence of inducer binding. Substitution at this site with Glu results in cooperativity at neutral pH with no change in inducer binding at elevated pH. In addition, operator binding affinity of this mutant is affected by elevated pH, a phenomenon not observed in wild-type repressor. These changes in inducer and operator binding properties appear to be related to the altered quaternary structure of these mutants at Lys84. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485 D013487
20385275	20100414	Lack of association between nNOS -84G&gt;A polymorphism and risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in a Chinese population.	Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal obstructions in the infancy requiring surgery. Reduced expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which plays an important role in the regulation of the human pyloric muscle, is thought to underlie IHPS. The role of nNOS in IHPS has been supported by the genetic association of a functional regulatory nNOS polymorphism (-84G&gt;A) with IHPS in whites. We reasoned that the corroboration of this association in a population of different ethnic origin would prompt follow-up studies and further investigation of the IHPS pathology at molecular level. Thus, we attempted to reproduce the original findings in a Chinese population of comparable size in what would be the first genetic study on IHPS conducted in Chinese. nNOS -84G&gt;A genotypes were analyzed in 56 patients and 86 controls by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios. Our study could not corroborate the association previously reported. Although the frequency of the IHPS-associated allele (-84A) in controls (0.205) was similar to that reported for white controls, there was a dramatic difference in -84A frequencies between white and Chinese patients (0.198). Similarly, there was no difference in the nNOS -84G&gt;A genotype distribution between patients and controls, even when the GA and AA genotypes were combined to compare GG genotype (odds ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-2.19). Failure to replicate the initial finding does not detract from its validity, because genetic effects may differ across populations. Differences across populations in linkage disequilibrium and/or allele frequencies may contribute to this lack of replication. The role nNOS in IHPS awaits further investigation. 	J._Pediatr._Surg.

15642157	20050112	Presence of papillomavirus sequences in condylomatous lesions of the mamillae and in invasive carcinoma of the breast.	Viruses including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a human equivalent of murine mammary tumour virus (MMTV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) have been implicated in the aetiology of human breast cancer. We report the presence of HPV DNA sequences in areolar tissue and tumour tissue samples from female patients with breast carcinoma. The presence of virus in the areolar-nipple complex suggests to us a potential pathogenic mechanism. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was undertaken to amplify HPV types in areolar and tumour tissue from breast cancer cases. In situ hybridisation supported the PCR findings and localised the virus in nipple, areolar and tumour tissue. Papillomavirus DNA was present in 25 of 29 samples of breast carcinoma and in 20 of 29 samples from the corresponding mamilla. The most prevalent type in both carcinomas and nipples was HPV 11, followed by HPV 6. Other types detected were HPV 16, 23, 27 and 57 (nipples and carcinomas), HPV 20, 21, 32, 37, 38, 66 and GA3-1 (nipples only) and HPV 3, 15, 24, 87 and DL473 (carcinomas only). Multiple types were demonstrated in seven carcinomas and ten nipple samples. The data demonstrate the occurrence of HPV in nipple and areolar tissues in patients with breast carcinoma. The authors postulate a retrograde ductular pattern of viral spread that may have pathogenic significance. 	Breast_Cancer_Res.	D016428 D013485
10941163	20000815	Genetic polymorphisms in head and neck cancer risk.	To assess whether genetic polymorphisms implicated as risk factors for other tobacco-associated malignancies are associated with altered risk of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Case-control study. One hundred sixty patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma recruited from a university-based head and neck oncology clinic and 149 population-based controls. Genotyping of the CYP1A1 (Ile462Val), GSTM1 (null), GSTP1 (Ile105Val), GSTT1 (null), and P53 (Arg72Pro) genes was performed by polymerase chain reaction-based techniques on DNA prepared from peripheral blood. In addition, a questionnaire was used to collect demographic information from each subject. Cases were significantly older (p &lt;.0001) and had significantly greater tobacco use (p &lt;.0001) and were more likely to be male (p &lt;.0001) than were control subjects, thus confirming known risk factors for this disease. When cases and controls were compared by simple chi-square analysis, only the frequency of CYP1A1 (Ile462Val) polymorphism was significantly different between cases and controls (OR =.42; 95% CI =.18-.99; p &lt;.04). However, with a logistic regression model to control for known risk factors, we were unable to demonstrate a significant association with head and neck cancer for any of the polymorphisms tested, including CYP1A1. This population fails to identify a relationship between the above-mentioned polymorphisms and head and neck cancer. 	Head_Neck	D016428 D013485 D013487
20142614	20100210	Gene expression levels as endophenotypes in genome-wide association studies of Alzheimer disease.	Late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) is a common disorder with a substantial genetic component. We postulate that many disease susceptibility variants act by altering gene expression levels. We measured messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of 12 LOAD candidate genes in the cerebella of 200 subjects with LOAD. Using the genotypes from our LOAD genome-wide association study for the cis-single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (n = 619) of these 12 LOAD candidate genes, we tested for associations with expression levels as endophenotypes. The strongest expression cis-SNP was tested for AD association in 7 independent case-control series (2,280 AD and 2,396 controls). We identified 3 SNPs that associated significantly with IDE (insulin degrading enzyme) expression levels. A single copy of the minor allele for each significant SNP was associated with approximately twofold higher IDE expression levels. The most significant SNP, rs7910977, is 4.2 kb beyond the 3' end of IDE. The association observed with this SNP was significant even at the genome-wide level (p = 2.7 x 10(-8)). Furthermore, the minor allele of rs7910977 associated significantly (p = 0.0046) with reduced LOAD risk (OR = 0.81 with a 95% CI of 0.70-0.94), as expected biologically from its association with elevated IDE expression. These results provide strong evidence that IDE is a late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) gene with variants that modify risk of LOAD by influencing IDE expression. They also suggest that the use of expression levels as endophenotypes in genome-wide association studies may provide a powerful approach for the identification of disease susceptibility alleles.

15239024	20040709	Identification of influencing variables on adiponectin serum levels in diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2.	Adiponectin represents an adipocyte-specific secretory protein that has been discussed recently as candidate gene and promising new drug target to restore insulin sensitivity in diabetes mellitus type 2. The aim of the present study was to define influencing variables on adiponectin serum levels in a large cohort of caucasian patients with type 1/type 2 diabetes and healthy controls. Additionally, adiponectin gene polymorphisms (Tyr111His and Gly15Gly) were investigated for possible associations with adiponectin serum levels. Adiponectin serum concentrations were measured in a metabolically well characterized cohort of 892 caucasian patients (556 with type 2 diabetes, 118 with type 1 diabetes, 218 controls) by ELISA. Gene polymorphisms were determined by PCR-based RFLP. 1) Adiponectin values are dependent on gender with higher levels in diabetic females than in diabetic males. This gender-specific effect was only restricted to patients with diabetes and cannot be observed in controls. 2) In contrast to previous studies, the presence of diabetes does not influence adiponectin serum levels after correction for BMI. In addition, age has no influence on adiponectin levels. 3) Adiponectin levels are dependent on renal function at a creatinine clearance &lt; 45 ml/min. 4) Regression analysis showed a significant, but only weak correlation between BMI and adiponectin in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 (r = 0.47) and type 1 (r = 0.57). 5) Adiponectin gene polymorphisms (Tyr111His and Gly15Gly) do not influence adiponectin levels. Adiponectin serum concentrations can only be interpreted after careful correction for gender and renal function, whereas the genetic variants Tyr11His and Gly15Gly do not seem to play a role. The correlation between BMI and adiponectin was weaker than expected in diabetic patients. 	Exp._Clin._Endocrinol._Diabetes	D016428
11715002	20011121	Functional significance of PMM2 mutations in mildly affected patients with congenital disorders of glycosylation Ia.	Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) result from mutations in N-glycan biosynthesis. Mutations in phosphomannomutase (PMM2) cause CDG-Ia. Here, we report four clinically mild patients and their mutations in PMM2. Analysis of the PMM2 cDNA and gene revealed the mutations affecting the glycosylation efficiency. The patients have 30% to 50% normal PMM activity in fibroblasts due to different mutations in PMM2, and we studied the effect of each mutation on the PMM activity in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression system. Each patient carried a severe mutation that decreased the PMM activity to less than 10% as well as a relatively mild mutation. A new mutation, deletion of base 24, changed the reading frame. The C9Y, C241S, and L32R mutations showed 27% to 45% activity when expressed in the eukaryotic expression system, and the more severe D148N was shown to be thermolabile. 	Genet._Med.

27051024	20160407	Role of ERCC2 and ERCC3 gene polymorphisms in the development of osteosarcoma.	We conducted a case-control study to investigate the role of common SNPs in ERCC2 (rs13181 and rs1799793) and ERCC3 (rs4150441 and rs4150506) in the development of osteosarcoma. A 1:2 matched case-control study was conducted. Between January 2012 and December 2013, 141 patients with pathologically diagnosed osteosarcoma and 282 controls were recruited in our study. Genotyping of ERCC2 rs13181 and rs1799793 as well as ERCC3 rs4150441 and rs4150506 were performed using polymerase chain reaction coupled with restriction fragment length polymorphism. The genotype distributions of ERCC2 rs13181 and rs1799793 as well as ERCC3 rs4150441 and rs4150506 showed no significant difference between patients with osteosarcoma and controls, as analyzed by c2 tests. Multivariate logistic regression analysis did not reveal significant associations between ERCC2 rs13181/rs1799793 or ERCC3 rs4150441/ rs4150506 gene polymorphisms and the development of osteosarcoma in codominant, dominant, and recessive models. In conclusion, we did not find any association between ERCC2 or ERCC3 gene polymorphisms and the development of osteosarcoma. Future studies with larger sample sizes may contribute in elucidating the impact of ERCC2 and ERCC3 gene polymorphisms on osteosarcoma risks. 	Genet._Mol._Res.	D016428
11113269	20001213	Gene polymorphisms in the TNF locus and the risk of myocardial infarction.	We investigated two genetic polymorphisms in the tumor necrosis factor locus (TNF-alpha -308 G--&gt;A and LT-alpha +252 A--&gt;G) as risk factors for coronary atherothrombotic disease (CAD) by determining its prevalence in 148 survivors of myocardial infarction (MI) with angiographically-proven severe CAD, and in 148 age-, gender- and race-matched controls. The odds ratio (OR) for MI related to the mutant TNF-alpha and LT-alpha alleles was 0.8 (CI95: 0.4-1.3) and 1. 3 (CI95: 0.8-2.0), respectively. We also sought interaction of smoking and metabolic risk factors for MI with each mutant genotype. Smokers not carrying the LT-alpha +252 A--&gt;G mutation had a risk of MI of 2.7 (CI95: 1.4-5.4) whereas in smoking carriers the risk was 6. 9 (CI95: 3.4-14.1). An interactive effect of the LT-alpha mutation may also exist with dyslipidemia (OR for MI in non-carriers was 12 [CI95: 3.2-41.3] and in carriers the OR was 39, [CI95: 5.1-301] and with obesity (OR for MI was 2.7, [CI95: 1-7.2] in non-carriers and in carriers the OR was 6 [CI95: 2.1-16.8]). Lastly, the OR for MI in obese non-carriers of TNF-alpha -308 G--&gt;A was 2.8 (CI95: 1.3-6) and in obese carriers the OR was 14.5 (CI95: 1.8-113). Although significant interactive effects could not be detected, the findings suggest that interaction of polymorphisms in the TNF locus with major risk factors for CAD may exist, and should be explored in larger studies.

11340577	20010508	Adenovirus-mediated gene therapy for bladder cancer in an orthotopic model using a dominant negative H-ras mutant.	It has been suggested that abnormal Ras function is important in the carcinogenesis and progression of bladder cancer. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of transurethral inoculation of an adenovirus expressing the dominant negative H-ras mutant N116Y against orthotopically implanted human bladder-cancer cells in nude mice. We used a replication-defective adenovirus vector containing the beta-galactosidase gene (AdCMV-LacZ) as a control and the N116Y gene (AdCMV-N116Y) as the therapeutic vector under the transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. We initially investigated the in vitro growth-suppressive effects of AdCMV-N116Y on 2 human bladder-cancer cell lines, KU-7 and UMUC-2. Thereafter, we examined the inhibitory effects of AdCMV-N116Y on the 2 orthotopically implanted cell lines in nude mice. Intravesically created, orthotopic human bladder cancers were established in female KSN athymic nude mice with 1x 10(7) cancer cells. Then, 2, 3 and 4 days following implantation, 1 x 10(9) pfu of AdCMV-LacZ or AdCMV-N116Y were administered transurethrally. In vitro growth assays revealed significant growth suppression (&gt;95%) with apoptosis of target cells treated with AdCMV-N116Y compared to AdCMV-LacZ. Transurethral inoculation of AdCMV-N116Y into the bladder brought about a significant reduction in size (73% to 90%) and number (47% to 78%) of orthotopically implanted human bladder tumors compared to AdCMV-LacZ or PBS. Normal mucosa in nude mice had minor inflammation with the infiltration of mononuclear cells. Our results suggest that gene therapy via transurethral inoculation of AdCMV-N116Y holds promise for the treatment of human bladder cancer. 	Int._J._Cancer	D016428 D013485
27014071	20160326	DNA Damage Response Is Involved in the Developmental Toxicity of Mebendazole in Zebrafish Retina.	Intestinal helminths cause iron-deficiency anemia in pregnant women, associated with premature delivery, low birth weight, maternal ill health, and maternal death. Although benzimidazole compounds such as mebendazole (MBZ) are highly efficacious against helminths, there are limited data on its use during pregnancy. In this study, we performed in vivo imaging of the retinas of zebrafish larvae exposed to MBZ, and found that exposure to MBZ during 2 and 3 days post-fertilization caused malformation of the retinal layers. To identify the molecular mechanism underlying the developmental toxicity of MBZ, we performed transcriptome analysis of zebrafish eyes. The analysis revealed that the DNA damage response was involved in the developmental toxicity of MBZ. We were also able to demonstrate that inhibition of ATM significantly attenuated the apoptosis induced by MBZ in the zebrafish retina. These results suggest that MBZ causes developmental toxicity in the zebrafish retina at least partly by activating the DNA damage response, including ATM signaling, providing a potential adverse outcome pathway in the developmental toxicity of MBZ in mammals.

19603021	20090716	BubR1 as a prognostic marker for recurrence-free survival rates in epithelial ovarian cancers.	Epithelial ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies, and has a high recurrence rate. Thus, prognostic markers for recurrence are crucial for the care of ovarian cancer. As ovarian cancers frequently exhibit chromosome instability, we aimed at assessing the prognostic significance of two key mitotic kinases, BubR1 and Aurora A. We analysed paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 160 ovarian cancer patients whose clinical outcomes had been tracked after first-line treatment. The median recurrence-free survival in patients with a positive and negative expression of BubR1 was 27 and 83 months, respectively (P&lt;0.001). A positive BubR1 expression was also associated with advanced stage, serous histology and high grade. In contrast, Aurora A immunostaining did not correlate with any of the clinical parameters analysed. BubR1, but not Aurora A, is a prognostic marker for recurrence-free survival rates in epithelial ovarian cancers. 	Br._J._Cancer	D016428 D013485
27191586	20160519	Identification of a mutation causing a defective spindle assembly checkpoint in high ethyl caproate-producing sake yeast strain K1801.	In high-quality sake brewing, the cerulenin-resistant sake yeast K1801 with high ethyl caproate-producing ability has been used widely; however, K1801 has a defective spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). To identify the mutation causing this defect, we first searched for sake yeasts with a SAC-defect like K1801 and found that K13 had such a defect. Then, we searched for a common SNP in only K1801 and K13 by examining 15 checkpoint-related genes in 23 sake yeasts, and found 1 mutation, R48P of Cdc55, the PP2A regulatory B subunit that is important for the SAC. Furthermore, we confirmed that the Cdc55-R48P mutation was responsible for the SAC-defect in K1801 by molecular genetic analyses. Morphological analysis indicated that this mutation caused a high cell morphological variation. But this mutation did not affect the excellent brewing properties of K1801. Thus, this mutation is a target for breeding of a new risk-free K1801 with normal checkpoint integrity. 	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428
26870315	20160213	Y-chromosome phylogeographic analysis of the Greek-Cypriot population reveals elements consistent with Neolithic and Bronze Age settlements.	The archeological record indicates that the permanent settlement of Cyprus began with pioneering agriculturalists circa 11,000?years before present, (ca. 11,000 y BP). Subsequent colonization events followed, some recognized?regionally. Here, we assess the Y-chromosome structure of Cyprus in context to regional populations and correlate it to phases of prehistoric colonization. Analysis of haplotypes from 574 samples showed that island-wide substructure was barely significant in a spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA). However, analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) of haplogroups using 92 binary markers genotyped in 629 Cypriots revealed that the proportion of variance among the districts was irregularly distributed. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed potential genetic associations of Greek-Cypriots with neighbor populations. Contrasting haplogroups in the PCA were used as surrogates of parental populations. Admixture analyses suggested that the majority of G2a-P15 and R1b-M269 components were contributed by Anatolia and Levant sources, respectively, while Greece Balkans supplied the majority of E-V13 and J2a-M67. Haplotype-based expansion times were at historical levels suggestive of recent demography. Analyses of Cypriot haplogroup data are consistent with two stages of prehistoric settlement. E-V13 and E-M34 are widespread, and PCA suggests sourcing them to the Balkans and Levant/Anatolia, respectively. The persistent pre-Greek component is represented by elements of G2-U5(xL30) haplogroups: U5*, PF3147, and L293. J2b-M205 may contribute also to the pre-Greek strata. The majority of R1b-Z2105 lineages occur in both the westernmost and easternmost districts. Distinctively, sub-haplogroup R1b- M589 occurs only in the east. The absence of R1b- M589 lineages in Crete and the Balkans and the presence in Asia Minor are compatible with Late Bronze Age influences from Anatolia rather than from Mycenaean Greeks.

9305949	19971008	Ligand preferences of kringle 2 and homologous domains of human plasminogen: canvassing weak, intermediate, and high-affinity binding sites by 1H-NMR.	The interaction of various small aliphatic and aromatic ionic ligands with the human plasminogen (HPg) recombinant kringle 2 (r-K2) domain has been investigated by 1H-NMR spectroscopy at 500 MHz. The results are compared against ligand-binding properties of the homologous, lysine-binding HPg kringle 1 (K1), kringle 4 (K4), and kringle 5 (K5). The investigated ligands include the omega-aminocarboxylic acids 4-aminobutyric acid (4-ABA), 5-aminopentanoic acid (5-APA), 6-aminohexanoic acid (6-AHA), 7-aminoheptanoic acid (7-AHA), lysine and arginine derivatives with free and blocked alpha-amino and/or carboxylate groups, and a number of cyclic analogs, zwitterions of similar size such as trans-(aminomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (AMCHA) and p-benzylaminesulfonic acid (BASA), and the nonzwitterions benzylamine and benzamidine. Equilibrium association constant (Ka) values were determined from 1H-NMR ligand titration profiles. Among the aliphatic linear ligands, 5-APA (Ka approximately 3.4 mM-1) shows the strongest interaction with r-K2 followed by 6-AHA (Ka approximately 2.3 mM-1), 7-AHA (Ka approximately 0.45 mM-1), and 4-ABA (Ka approximately 0.22 mM-1). In contrast, r-K1, K4, and K5 exhibit a preference for 6-AHA (Ka approximately 74.2, 21.0, and 10.6 mM-1, respectively), a ligand approximately 1.14 A longer than 5-APA. Mutations R220G and E221D increase the affinity of r-K2 for these ligands but leave the selectivity profile essentially unaffected: 5-APA &gt; 6-AHA &gt; 7-AHA &gt; 4-ABA (Ka approximately 6.5, 3.9, 1.8, and 0.74 mM-1, respectively). We find that, while r-K2 definitely interacts with Nalpha-acetyl-L-lysine and L-lysine (Ka approximately 0.96 and 0.68 mM-1, respectively), the affinity for analogs carrying a blocked carboxylate group is relatively weak (Ka approximately 0.1 mM-1). We also investigated the interaction of r-K2 with L-arginine (Ka approximately 0.31 mM-1) and its derivatives Nalpha-acetyl-L-arginine (Ka approximately 0.55 mM-1), Nalpha-acetyl-L-arginine methyl ester (Ka approximately 0.07 mM-1), and L-arginine methyl ester (Ka approximately 0.03 mM-1). Zwitterionic gamma-guanidinobutyric acid, containing one less methylene group than arginine, exhibits a Ka of approximately 0.28 mM-1. The affinity of r-K2 for lysine and arginine derivatives suggests that K2 could play a role in intermolecular as well as intramolecular interactions of HPg. As is the case for the HPg K1, K4, and K5, among the tested ligands, AMCHA is the one which interacts most firmly with r-K2 (Ka approximately 7.3 mM-1) while the aromatic ligands BASA, benzylamine, and benzamidine exhibit Ka values of approximately 4.0, approximately 0.04, and approximately 0.03 mM-1, respectively. The relative stability of these interactions indicates a strict requirement for both cationic and anionic polar groups in the ligand, whereas the presence of a lipophilic aromatic group seems to be of lesser consequence. Ligand-induced shifts of r-K2 (1)H-NMR signals and two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect (NOESY) experiments in the presence of 6-AHA reveal direct involvement of residues Tyr36, Trp62, Phe64, and Trp72 (kringle residue numbering convention) in ligand binding. Starting from the X-ray crystallographic structure of HPg K4 and the intermolecular 1H-NMR NOE data, two models of the K2 lysine binding site complexed to 6-AHA have been derived which differ mainly in the extent of electrostatic pairing between the K2 Arg56 and Glu57 side chains. Competition between these two conformations in equilibrium may account for the relatively lesser affinity of the K2 domain for zwitterionic lysine-type ligands. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485 D013487
22146390	20111208	Graphene chiral liquid crystals and macroscopic assembled fibres.	Chirality and liquid crystals are both widely expressed in nature and biology. Helical assembly of mesophasic molecules and colloids may produce intriguing chiral liquid crystals. To date, chiral liquid crystals of 2D colloids have not been explored. As a typical 2D colloid, graphene is now receiving unprecedented attention. However, making macroscopic graphene fibres is hindered by the poor dispersibility of graphene and by the lack of an assembly method. Here we report that soluble, chemically oxidized graphene or graphene oxide sheets can form chiral liquid crystals in a twist-grain-boundary phase-like model with simultaneous lamellar ordering and long-range helical frustrations. Aqueous graphene oxide liquid crystals were continuously spun into metres of macroscopic graphene oxide fibres; subsequent chemical reduction gave the first macroscopic neat graphene fibres with high conductivity and good mechanical performance. The flexible, strong graphene fibres were knitted into designed patterns and into directionally conductive textiles. 	Nat_Commun	D016428 D013485
24419411	20140115	A prospective, molecular epidemiology study of EGFR mutations in Asian patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma histology (PIONEER).	PIONEER (NCT01185314) was a prospective, multinational, epidemiological study of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in patients from Asia with newly diagnosed advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Eligible patients (aged ?20 years) had untreated stage IIIB/IV adenocarcinoma. The EGFR mutation status (primary end point: positive, negative, or undetermined) of tumor samples (biopsy, surgical specimen, or cytology) was determined (Scorpion amplification refractory mutation system). EGFR mutation frequency was calculated and compared between demographic and clinical subgroups. Of 1482 patients from seven Asian regions, 43.4% of patients were female, median age was 60 years (range, 17-94), and 52.6% of patients were never-smokers. EGFR mutation status was evaluable in tumors from 1450 patients (97.8%) (746 [51.4%] positive; 704 [48.6%] negative). Country, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, pack-years (all p &lt; 0.001), disease stage (p = 0.009), and histology type (p = 0.016) correlated significantly with EGFR mutation frequency. Mutation frequency was 61.1% in females, 44.0% in males; lower in patients from India (22.2%) compared with other areas (47.2%-64.2%); highest among never-smokers (60.7%); and decreased as pack-year number increased (&gt;0-10 pack-years, 57.9%; &gt;50 pack-years, 31.4%) (similar trend by sex). Ethnic group (p &lt; 0.001) and pack-years (p &lt; 0.001) had statistically significant associations with mutation frequency (multivariate analysis); sex was not significant when adjusted for smoking status. PIONEER is the first prospective study to confirm high EGFR mutation frequency (51.4% overall) in tumors from Asian patients with adenocarcinoma. The observed high mutation frequency in demographic/clinical subgroups compared with white populations suggests that mutation testing should be considered for all patients with stage IIIB/IV adenocarcinoma, even males and regular smokers, among Asian populations.

23965272	20130823	Characterization of the glutamate-specific endopeptidase from Bacillus licheniformis expressed in Escherichia coli.	Glutamate-specific endopeptidase from Bacillus licheniformis (GSE-BL) is widely used in peptide recovery and synthesis because of its unique substrate specificity. However, the mechanism underlying its specificity is still not thoroughly understood. In this study, the roles of the prosegment and key amino acids involved in the proteolytic activity of GSE-BL were investigated. Loss of the GSE-BL prosegment severely restricted enzymatic activity toward Z-Phe-Leu-Glu-pNA. A homologous model of GSE-BL revealed that it contains the catalytic triad &quot;His47, Asp96 and Ser 167&quot;, which was further confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. In vitro mutagenesis further indicated that Val2, Arg89 and His190 are essential for enzymatic activity toward Z-Phe-Leu-Glu-pNA. Moreover, the catalytic efficiency of Phe57Ala GSE-BL toward Z-Phe-Leu-Glu-pNA was 50% higher than that of the native mature GSE-BL. This is the first study to fully elucidate the key amino acids for proteolytic activity of GSE-BL. Mature GSE-BL could be obtained through self-cleavage alone when Lys at -1 position was replaced by Glu, providing a new strategy for the preparation of mature GSE-BL. This study yielded some valuable insights into the substrate specificity of glutamate-specific endopeptidase, establishing a foundation for broadening the applications of GSE-BL. 	J._Biotechnol.

17991730	20071110	Wild-type but not mutant androgen receptor inhibits expression of the hTERT telomerase subunit: a novel role of AR mutation for prostate cancer development.	Androgens play a central role in prostate development and prostate cancer proliferation. Induction of telomerase is an early event in prostate carcinogenesis and is considered as a marker for both primary tumors and metastases. Interestingly, several reports suggest that telomerase activity is regulated by androgens in vivo. Here, we show that the wild-type (WT) human androgen receptor (AR) inhibits the expression of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and telomerase activity via inhibition of hTERT promoter activity in the presence of androgen receptor agonists. However, pure androgen antagonists failed to repress hTERT transcription. The androgen-mediated repression of hTERT is abrogated in a human prostate cancer cell line exhibiting hormone-dependent growth, which expresses a mutant AR (T877A) frequently occurring in prostate cancer. We reveal that this single amino acid exchange is sufficient for the lack of transrepression. Interestingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation data suggest that, in contrast to the WT AR, the mutant AR is recruited less efficiently to the hTERT promoter in vivo, indicating that loss of transrepression results from reduced chromatin recruitment. Thus, our findings suggest that the WT AR inhibits expression of hTERT, which is indicative of a protective mechanism, whereas the T877A mutation of AR not only broadens the ligand spectrum of the receptor but abrogates this inhibitory mechanism in prostate cancer cells. This novel role of AR mutations in prostate cancer development suggests the benefit to a search for new AR antagonists that inhibit transactivation but allow transrepression. 	FASEB_J.

21461182	20110405	Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Oxidative Stress in Asthma: Implications for Mitochondria-Targeted Antioxidant Therapeutics.	Asthma is a complex, inflammatory disorder characterized by airflow obstruction of variable degrees, bronchial hyper-responsiveness, and airway inflammation. Asthma is caused by environmental factors and a combination of genetic and environmental stimuli. Genetic studies have revealed that multiple loci are involved in the etiology of asthma. Recent cellular, molecular, and animal-model studies have revealed several cellular events that are involved in the progression of asthma, including: increased Th2 cytokines leading to the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the airway, and an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial dysfunction in the activated inflammatory cells, leading to tissue injury in the bronchial epithelium. Further, aging and animal model studies have revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are involved and play a large role in asthma. Recent studies using experimental allergic asthmatic mouse models and peripheral cells and tissues from asthmatic humans have revealed antioxidants as promising treatments for people with asthma. This article summarizes the latest research findings on the involvement of inflammatory changes, and mitochondrial dysfunction/oxidative stress in the development and progression of asthma. This article also addresses the relationship between aging and age-related immunity in triggering asthma, the antioxidant therapeutic strategies in treating people with asthma.

11376161	20010529	Enzymatic properties of rat DNA polymerase beta mutants obtained by randomized mutagenesis.	We have used random sequence mutagenesis to generate mutants of DNA polymerase beta in an effort to identify amino acid residues important for function, catalytic efficiency and fidelity of replication. A library containing 100 000 mutants at residues 274-278 in the N-helix of the thumb subdomain of the polymerase was constructed and screened for polymerase activity by genetic complementation. The genetic screen identified 4000 active pol beta mutants, 146 of which were sequenced. Each of the five positions mutagenized tolerated substitutions, but residues G274 and F278 were only found substituted in combination with mutations at other positions. The least conserved residue, D276, was replaced by a variety of amino acids and, therefore, does not appear to be essential for function. Steady-state kinetic analysis, however, demonstrated that D276 may be important for catalytic efficiency. Mutant D276E exhibited a 25-fold increase in catalytic efficiency over the wild-type enzyme but also a 25-fold increase in G:T misincorporation efficiency. We present a structural model that can account for the observations and we discuss the implications of this study for the question of enzyme optimization by natural selection. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.

18294457	20080226	Xylosyltransferase I variants and their impact on abdominal aortic aneurysms.	The formation of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is caused by a destructive remodeling of the extracellular matrix in the vascular wall. Proteoglycan content and biosynthesis have been shown to be altered in AAA. Xylosyltransferase I (XT-I) is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of the proteoglycan-linked glycosaminoglycan chains. A familial predisposition to AAA is well recognized. Thus, variations in the XT-I coding gene XYLT1 might be risk factors for AAA formation. We performed genotyping of two genetic variations in the XYLT1 gene which, have been already linked to proteoglycan-associated diseases, in 129 AAA patients and 129 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The T-allele of the polymorphism c.343G&gt;T (p.A115S) was found to be significantly more frequent in AAA patients compared to the healthy control group, demonstrating that carriers of the T-allele have a 5-fold increased risk of developing AAA (odds ratio 4.87, 95%-CI 1.38-17.19; p=0.011). Our results show that XT-I polymorphisms potentially confer to the genetic susceptibility of AAA. 	Clin._Chim._Acta	D016428
24488013	20140204	EphA2 promotes infiltrative invasion of glioma stem cells in vivo through cross-talk with Akt and regulates stem cell properties.	Diffuse infiltrative invasion is a major cause for the dismal prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Using human glioma stem cells (GSCs) that recapitulate the invasive propensity of primary GBM, we find that EphA2 critically regulates GBM invasion in vivo. EphA2 was expressed in all seven GSC lines examined, and overexpression of EphA2 enhanced intracranial invasion. The effects required Akt-mediated phosphorylation of EphA2 on serine 897. In vitro the Akt-EphA2 signaling axis is maintained in the absence of ephrin-A ligands and is disrupted upon ligand stimulation. To test whether ephrin-As in tumor microenvironment can regulate GSC invasion, the newly established Efna1;Efna3;Efna4 triple knockout mice (TKO) were used in an ex vivo brain slice invasion assay. We observed significantly increased GSC invasion through the brain slices of TKO mice relative to wild-type (WT) littermates. Mechanistically EphA2 knockdown suppressed stem cell properties of GSCs, causing diminished self-renewal, reduced stem marker expression and decreased tumorigenicity. In a subset of GSCs, the reduced stem cell properties were associated with lower Sox2 expression. Overexpression of EphA2 promoted stem cell properties in a kinase-independent manner and increased Sox2 expression. Disruption of Akt-EphA2 cross-talk attenuated stem cell marker expression and neurosphere formation while having minimal effects on tumorigenesis. Taken together, the results show that EphA2 endows invasiveness of GSCs in vivo in cooperation with Akt and regulates glioma stem cell properties. 	Oncogene	D016428 D052061 D013485
17077181	20061102	Enhanced half-life of genetically engineered human IgG1 antibodies in a humanized FcRn mouse model: potential application in humorally mediated autoimmune disease.	The MHC class I-like Fc receptor FcRn plays an essential role in extending the half-life (t(1/2)) of IgG antibodies and IgG-Fc-based therapeutics in the circulation. The goal of this study was to analyze the effect of human IgG1 (hIgG1) antibodies with enhanced in vitro binding to FcRn on their in vivo t(1/2) in mice expressing human FcRn (hFcRn). Mutants of the humanized monoclonal Herceptin antibody (Hu4D5-IgG1), directed against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (p185 (HER2)), show altered pH-dependent binding to hFcRn in vitro. Two engineered IgG1 mutants (N434A and T307A/E380A/N434A) showed a considerably extended t(1/2) in vivo compared with wild-type antibody in mice expressing an hFcRn transgene (Tg) but not in mice expressing the endogenous mouse FcRn. The efficiency of hFcRn-mediated protection was dependent on hFcRn Tg copy number. Moreover, when injected into FcRn-humanized mice at a concentration sufficient to partially saturate hFcRn, the engineered IgG1 mutants with an extended serum t(1/2) were most effective in reducing the t(1/2) of a tracer hIgG1 antibody. Finally, administration of mutant with high binding to hFcRn ameliorated arthritis induced by passive transfer with human pathogenic plasma. These results indicate that Fc regions modified for high binding affinity to hFcRn increases serum persistence of therapeutic antibodies, that the same approach can be exploited as an anti-autoimmune therapy to promote the clearance of endogenous pathogenic IgG and that FcRn-humanized mice are a promising surrogate for hIgG therapeutic development.

26843428	20160205	The downregulation of the RNA-binding protein Staufen2 in response to DNA damage promotes apoptosis.	Staufen2 (Stau2) is an RNA-binding protein involved in cell fate decision by controlling several facets of mRNA processing including localization, splicing, translation and stability. Herein we report that exposure to DNA-damaging agents that generate replicative stress such as camptothecin (CPT), 5-fluoro-uracil (5FU) and ultraviolet radiation (UVC) causes downregulation of Stau2 in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. In contrast, other agents such as doxorubicin and ionizing radiation had no effect on Stau2 expression. Consistently, Stau2 expression is regulated by the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) signaling pathway but not by the DNA-PK or ataxia telangiectasia mutated/checkpoint kinase 2 pathways. Stau2 downregulation is initiated at the level of transcription, independently of apoptosis induction. Promoter analysis identified a short 198 bp region which is necessary and sufficient for both basal and CPT-regulated Stau2 expression. The E2F1 transcription factor regulates Stau2 in untreated cells, an effect that is abolished by CPT treatment due to E2F1 displacement from the promoter. Strikingly, Stau2 downregulation enhances levels of DNA damage and promotes apoptosis in CPT-treated cells. Taken together our results suggest that Stau2 is an anti-apoptotic protein that could be involved in DNA replication and/or maintenance of genome integrity and that its expression is regulated by E2F1 via the ATR signaling pathway.

25097823	20140807	Subtle neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive changes in hereditary gelsolin amyloidosis (AGel amyloidosis).	Hereditary gelsolin amyloidosis (AGel amyloidosis) is an autosomal dominant form of systemic amyloidosis caused by a c.640G&gt;A or c.640G&gt;T mutation in the gene coding for gelsolin. Principal clinical manifestations include corneal lattice dystrophy, cranial neuropathy and cutis laxa with vascular fragility. Signs of minor CNS involvement have also been observed, possibly related to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). To investigate further if AGel amyloidosis carries a risk for a specific neuropsychological or psychiatric symptomatology we studied 35 AGel patients and 29 control subjects. Neuropsychological tests showed abnormalities in visuocontructional and -spatial performance in AGel patients, also some indication of problems in processing efficacy was found. At psychiatric evaluation the patient group showed more psychiatric symptomatology, mainly depression. In brain MRI, available in 16 patients and 14 controls, we found microhemorrhages or microcalcifications only in the patient group, although the number of findings was small. Our study shows that AGel amyloidosis can be associated with visuoconstructional problems and depression, but severe neuropsychiatric involvement is not characteristic. The gelsolin mutation may even induce cerebrovascular fragility, but further epidemiological and histopathological as well as longitudinal follow-up studies are needed to clarify gelsolin-related vascular pathology and its clinical consequences.

23013484	20120928	Modulation of K(v)7 potassium channels by a novel opener pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7(4H)-one compound QO-58.	Modulation of K(v)7/M channel function represents a relatively new strategy to treat neuronal excitability disorders such as epilepsy and neuropathic pain. We designed and synthesized a novel series of pyrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidin-7(4H)-one compounds, which activate K(v)7 channels. Here, we characterized the effects of the lead compound, QO-58, on K(v)7 channels and investigated its mechanism of action. A perforated whole-cell patch technique was used to record K(v)7 currents expressed in mammalian cell lines and M-type currents from rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. The effects of QO-58 in a rat model of neuropathic pain, chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve, were also examined. QO-58 increased the current amplitudes, shifted the voltage-dependent activation curve in a more negative direction and slowed the deactivation of K(v)7.2/K(v)7.3 currents. QO-58 activated K(v)7.1, K(v)7.2, K(v)7.4 and K(v)7.3/K(v)7.5 channels with a more selective effect on K(v)7.2 and K(v)7.4, but little effect on K(v)7.3. The mechanism of QO-58's activation of K(v)7 channels was clearly distinct from that used by retigabine. A chain of amino acids, Val(224)Val(225)Tyr(226), in K(v)7.2 was important for QO-58 activation of this channel. QO-58 enhanced native neuronal M currents, resulting in depression of evoked action potentials. QO-58 also elevated the pain threshold of neuropathic pain in the sciatic nerve CCI model. The results indicate that QO-58 is a potent modulator of K(v)7 channels with a mechanism of action different from those of known K(v)7 openers. Hence, QO-58 shows potential as a treatment for diseases associated with neuronal hyperexcitability. 	Br._J._Pharmacol.	D016428 D013485
11162087	20010213	Genetic interaction between yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae release factors and the decoding region of 18 S rRNA.	Functional and structural similarities between tRNA and eukaryotic class 1 release factors (eRF1) described previously, provide evidence for the molecular mimicry concept. This concept is supported here by the demonstration of a genetic interaction between eRF1 and the decoding region of the ribosomal RNA, the site of tRNA-mRNA interaction. We show that the conditional lethality caused by a mutation in domain 1 of yeast eRF1 (P86A), that mimics the tRNA anticodon stem-loop, is rescued by compensatory mutations A1491G (rdn15) and U1495C (hyg1) in helix 44 of the decoding region and by U912C (rdn4) and G886A (rdn8) mutations in helix 27 of the 18 S rRNA. The rdn15 mutation creates a C1409-G1491 base-pair in yeast rRNA that is analogous to that in prokaryotic rRNA known to be important for high-affinity paromomycin binding to the ribosome. Indeed, rdn15 makes yeast cells extremely sensitive to paromomycin, indicating that the natural high resistance of the yeast ribosome to paromomycin is, in large part, due to the absence of the 1409-1491 base-pair. The rdn15 and hyg1 mutations also partially compensate for inactivation of the eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3) resulting from the formation of the [PSI+] prion, a self-reproducible termination-deficient conformation of eRF3. However, rdn15, but not hyg1, rescues the conditional cell lethality caused by a GTPase domain mutation (R419G) in eRF3. Other antisuppressor rRNA mutations, rdn2(G517A), rdn1T(C1054T) and rdn12A(C526A), strongly inhibit [PSI+]-mediated stop codon read-through but do not cure cells of the [PSI+] prion. Interestingly, cells bearing hyg1 seem to enable [PSI+] strains to accumulate larger Sup35p aggregates upon Sup35p overproduction, suggesting a lower toxicity of overproduced Sup35p when the termination defect, caused by [PSI+], is partly relieved.

21793305	20110729	ENOS-G894T polymorphism is a risk factor for essential hypertension in China.	Vascular endothelial cells produce nitric oxide (NO), which contributes to the regulation of blood pressure and regional blood flow. Polymorphisms of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene are associated with coronary artery disease; however, associations between polymorphism (G894T) of the eNOS gene and essential hypertension remain unclear. This study was designed to investigate the association between a eNOS-G894T polymorphism and essential hypertension (EH). A total of 190 Chinese EH patients (EH group) and 94 healthy participants (control group) were included in the study. eNOS-G894T was determined using multi-polymerase chain reaction and polymorphisms in eNOS-G894T were genotyped using gene chip technology. Patients carrying eNOS GT + TT genotypes had a higher risk of EH than those carrying the GG genotype (OR = 2.82, 95% CI: 1.05-7.60, P = 0.033). The EH group showed a significantly higher frequency of the T-allele compared with controls (OR = 3.48, 95% CI: 1.34-9.07; P = 0.007). eNOS-894T was found to be significantly associated with EH in the dominant genetic model. Thus, the study demonstrated a significant and independent association between a eNOS-G894T polymorphism and EH in the Chinese patients. The study also showed that eNOS-G894T polymorphism is a risk factor for EH in Chinese patients. 	Indian_J._Biochem._Biophys.	D016428 D013485
26653099	20151215	Rapid dissemination of colistin and carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in Central Greece: mechanisms of resistance, molecular identification and epidemiological data.	Colistin-resistant/carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii is a significant challenge for antibiotic treatment and infection control policies. Since 2012, in Central Greece an increase of colistin/pan- resistant A. baumannii has occurred, indicating the need for further analysis. A total of 86 colistin-resistant/carbapenem-resistant out of 1228 A. baumannii clinical isolates, consecutively collected between 2012 and 2014 in a tertiary Greek hospital of Central Greece, as well as one environmental isolate from surveillance cultures were studied. Molecular typing and mechanisms of resistance to colistin and to carbapenems were assessed, whereas, epidemiological and clinical data of the patients were reviewed. During the study period, the rate of colistin resistance gradually increased and reached 21.1?% in 2014. All colistin-resistant/carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii belonged to 3LST ST101 clone that corresponds to the international clonal lineage II. Carbapenem resistance was associated with the presence of bla oxa-23-like, while resistance to colistin probably correlated with G54E and R109H amino acid substitutions in PmrA and PmrC, respectively. Epidemiological data of the patients indicated that the first detection of colistin-resistant/carbapenem-resistant ST101 clone in the University Hospital of Larissa (UHL) was associated with a patient who previously had received colistin, while, the movement of the infected patients into the hospital probably resulted to its spread.

24187523	20131105	Preamplification procedure for the analysis of ancient DNA samples.	In ancient DNA studies the low amount of endogenous DNA represents a limiting factor that often hampers the result achievement. In this study we extracted the DNA from nine human skeletal remains of different ages found in the Byzantine cemetery of Abdera Halkidiki and in the medieval cemetery of St. Spiridion in Rhodes (Greece). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to detect in the extracts the presence of PCR inhibitors and to estimate the DNA content. As mitochondrial DNA was detected in all samples, amplification of nuclear targets, as amelogenin and the polymorphism M470V of the transmembrane conductance regulator gene, yielded positive results in one case only. In an effort to improve amplification success, we applied, for the first time in ancient DNA, a preamplification strategy based on TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix. A comparison between results obtained from nonpreamplified and preamplified samples is reported. Our data, even if preliminary, show that the TaqMan PreAmp procedure may improve the sensitivity of qPCR analysis. 	ScientificWorldJournal	D016428 D013485
24286475	20131130	Involvement of the Notch pathway in terminal astrocytic differentiation: role of PKA.	The Notch pathway is a highly conserved signaling system essential for modulating neurogenesis and promoting astrogenesis. Similarly, the cAMP signaling cascade can promote astrocytic commitment in several cell culture models, such as the C6 glioma cell line. These cells have the capacity to differentiate into oligodendrocytes or astrocytes, characteristics that allow their use as a glial progenitor model. In this context, we explore here the plausible involvement of cAMP in Notch-dependent signal transactions. The exposure of C6 cells to a non-hydrolysable cAMP analogue resulted in a sustained augmentation of Notch activity, as detected by nuclear translocation of its intracellular domain portion (NICD) and transcriptional activity. The cAMP effect is mediated through the activation of the ?-secretase complex, responsible for Notch cleavage and is sensitive to inhibitors of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA. As expected, Notch cleavage and nuclear translocation resulted in the up-regulation of the mRNA levels of one of its target genes, the transcription factor Hair and enhancer of split 5. Moreover, the glutamate uptake activity, as well as the expression of astrocytic markers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein, S100? protein and GLAST was also enhanced in cAMP-exposed cells. Our results clearly suggest that during the process of C6 astrocytic differentiation, cAMP activates the PKA/?-secretase/NICD/RBPJ(?) pathway and Notch1 expression, leading to transcriptional activation of the genes responsible for glial progenitor cell fate decision.

23351726	20130129	Cost-effectiveness of adding-on new antiepileptic drugs to conventional regimens in controlling intractable seizures in children.	Intractable seizures are a subgroup of epileptic disorders challenging the physicians' skills to become controlled. Showing resistance towards common pharmacotherapy, they demand newer antiepileptic drugs acquired at higher costs. 0.06% of children around the world are estimated to suffer from epilepsy and its consequences. The aim of the present study has been to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these drugs in the treatment of intractable seizures in children. Clinical and cost data were collected from medical and cost records preserved at a neurologist office and a referral pharmacy respectively. Based on the new AED which are accessible in Iran, regimens were categorized into eight groups. The first group consisting of conventional AEDs was considered as comparator and the effectiveness of other groups was compared with it. Incremental Cost-effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of adding-on each new antiepileptic drug was calculated in terms of Rials per consequence (Rls/consq) and compared with each other. Furthermore ICER of the regimens was compared with the GDP per capita (Gross Domestic Product) of the year (2010). the ICER of the adding-on regimens range from negative values for Gabapentin, Levetiracetam and Zonisamide to low values for Lamotrigine (~ 6.4 million Rials/consequence [mil Rls/consq]) and Oxcarbazepine (~7.7 mil Rls/consq) and followed by high values for Topiramate (~21 mil Rls/consq) and Vigabatrin (~43.7 mil Rls/consq) considering the three months of remaining on regimen. By increasing the limit of remaining time to six months, the previously mentioned regimens persist on negative values. However Oxcarbazepine (~28.7 mil Rls/consq) and Lamotrigine (~13.8 mil Rls/consq) show a steep increase. Topiramate (~23.6 mil Rls/consq) displays a less change. Opposite to other regimens, the ICER value of Vigabatrin (~17.26 mil Rls/consq) has shown an important increase. Adding-on new antiepileptics to conventional regimens are cost-effective and justified considering the GDP per capita. 	Daru	D016428
7682695	19930415	Disease severity correlates with position of keratin point mutations in patients with epidermolysis bullosa simplex.	Keratins are the major structural proteins of the epidermis. Recently, it was discovered that point mutations in the epidermal keratins can lead to the blistering skin diseases epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) and epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (EH), involving epidermal cell fragility and rupture upon mechanical stress. In this study, we demonstrate a correlation between disease severity, location of point mutations within the keratin polypeptides, and degree to which these mutations perturb keratin filament structure. Interestingly, of the 11 EBS or EH mutations thus far identified, 6 affect a single highly evolutionarily conserved arginine residue, which, when mutated, markedly perturbs keratin filament structure and keratin network formation. This site also appears to be a hot spot for mutation by CpG methylation and deamination. In the four epidermal keratins, there are several other CpG dinucleotides that exist at codons within the highly conserved ends of the keratin rod. To elucidate why mutations at these sites have not been detected in severe cases of EBS, we engineered 7 of these C--&gt;T transitions in K14 and tested their ability to perturb keratin network formation and keratin filament assembly in vitro. The effects of these mutants on keratin filament network formation were significantly less severe than the EBS/EH arginine mutation, suggesting that the high incidence of mutations of the residue in EBS and EH patients is a result of both a special sensitivity of filament structure to perturbations in this residue and its susceptibility to mutagenesis.

21441443	20110329	Inherited variation in vitamin D genes is associated with predisposition to autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes.	Vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] &lt;50 nmol/L) is commonly reported in both children and adults worldwide, and growing evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency is associated with many extraskeletal chronic disorders, including the autoimmune diseases type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. We measured 25(OH)D concentrations in 720 case and 2,610 control plasma samples and genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms from seven vitamin D metabolism genes in 8,517 case, 10,438 control, and 1,933 family samples. We tested genetic variants influencing 25(OH)D metabolism for an association with both circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and disease status. Type 1 diabetic patients have lower circulating levels of 25(OH)D than similarly aged subjects from the British population. Only 4.3 and 18.6% of type 1 diabetic patients reached optimal levels (?75 nmol/L) of 25(OH)D for bone health in the winter and summer, respectively. We replicated the associations of four vitamin D metabolism genes (GC, DHCR7, CYP2R1, and CYP24A1) with 25(OH)D in control subjects. In addition to the previously reported association between type 1 diabetes and CYP27B1 (P = 1.4 ? 10(-4)), we obtained consistent evidence of type 1 diabetes being associated with DHCR7 (P = 1.2 ? 10(-3)) and CYP2R1 (P = 3.0 ? 10(-3)). Circulating levels of 25(OH)D in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes vary seasonally and are under the same genetic control as in the general population but are much lower. Three key 25(OH)D metabolism genes show consistent evidence of association with type 1 diabetes risk, indicating a genetic etiological role for vitamin D deficiency in type 1 diabetes.

21533078	20110503	PDP-1 links the TGF-? and IIS pathways to regulate longevity, development, and metabolism.	The insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway is a conserved regulator of longevity, development, and metabolism. In Caenorhabditis elegans IIS involves activation of DAF-2 (insulin/IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase), AGE-1 (PI 3-kinase), and additional downstream serine/threonine kinases that ultimately phosphorylate and negatively regulate the single FOXO transcription factor homolog DAF-16. Phosphatases help to maintain cellular signaling homeostasis by counterbalancing kinase activity. However, few phosphatases have been identified that negatively regulate the IIS pathway. Here we identify and characterize pdp-1 as a novel negative modulator of the IIS pathway. We show that PDP-1 regulates multiple outputs of IIS such as longevity, fat storage, and dauer diapause. In addition, PDP-1 promotes DAF-16 nuclear localization and transcriptional activity. Interestingly, genetic epistasis analyses place PDP-1 in the DAF-7/TGF-? signaling pathway, at the level of the R-SMAD proteins DAF-14 and DAF-8. Further investigation into how a component of TGF-? signaling affects multiple outputs of IIS/DAF-16, revealed extensive crosstalk between these two well-conserved signaling pathways. We find that PDP-1 modulates the expression of several insulin genes that are likely to feed into the IIS pathway to regulate DAF-16 activity. Importantly, dysregulation of IIS and TGF-? signaling has been implicated in diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes, obesity, and cancer. Our results may provide a new perspective in understanding of the regulation of these pathways under normal conditions and in the context of disease. 	PLoS_Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013485
10319473	19990513	Bacillus marismortui sp. nov., a new moderately halophilic species from the Dead Sea.	A group of 91 moderately halophilic, Gram-positive, rod-shaped strains were isolated from enrichments prepared from Dead Sea water samples collected 57 years ago. These strains were examined for 117 morphological, physiological, biochemical, nutritional and antibiotic susceptibility characteristics. All strains formed endospores and were motile, strictly aerobic and positive for catalase and oxidase. They grew in media containing 5-25% (w/v) total salts, showing optimal growth at 10% (w/v). Eighteen strains were chosen as representative isolates and were studied in more detail. All these strains had mesodiaminopimelic acid in the cell wall and a DNA G + C content of 39.0-42.8 mol%; they constitute a group with levels of DNA-DNA similarity of 70-100%. The sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of three representative strains (strains 123T, 557 and 832) were almost identical (99.9%), and placed the strains in the low G + C content Gram-positive bacteria. On the basis of their features, these isolates should be regarded as members of a new species of the genus Bacillus, for which the name Bacillus marismortui sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is strain 123T (= DSM 12325T = ATCC 700626T = CIP 105609T = CECT 5066T). 	Int._J._Syst._Bacteriol.	D016428 D013485
24735563	20140417	Soluble human leukocyte antigen-G in seminal plasma is associated with HLA-G genotype: possible implications for fertility success.	We have previously shown that human seminal plasma contains immunomodulatory soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G). We investigated whether sHLA-G levels in seminal plasma are associated with a specific 14 base pair (bp) insertion/deletion (ins/del) polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region of the HLA-G gene and/or with the outcome of assisted reproduction treatments (ART) in couples attending a fertility clinic. In a total of 54 unselected couples, sHLA-G levels were measured in seminal plasma samples and blood samples, HLA-G genotyping was performed, and clinical data were collected. The concentration of sHLA-G in seminal plasma samples was significantly associated with the HLA-G 14 bp ins/del genotype of the men; the del14 bp/del14 bp genotype showed the highest level of sHLA-G, and the ins14 bp/ins14 bp genotype showed the lowest level (P = 0.003). We observed a trend for higher seminal plasma levels of sHLA-G/total protein and total sHLA-G in cases with reduced semen quality, where the female partner became pregnant after ART, compared with those couples in which no pregnancy was achieved. These first results are in accordance with a possible role of seminal sHLA-G as an immunomodulatory factor in the female reproductive tract before and at the time of conception.

25679006	20150214	5-Hydroxy tryptamine transporter (5HTT) gene promoter region polymorphism in anxiety and depressive disorders.	5HTTLPR polymorphism (5- Hydroxy tryptamine transporter linked promoter region polymorphism) is the most widely studied genetic variant in psychiatry. The present study is a modest effort at ascertaining the role of 5HT transporter linked promoter region polymorphism (5HTTLPR) in anxiety and depressive disorders in Kashmir (India).The aim of this study was to examine 5-Hydroxy tryptamine transporter (5HTT) gene promoter region polymorphism in anxiety and depressive disorders. Thirty patients with unipolar depressive disorders, 30 patients with anxiety disorders and 40 healthy volunteers (controls) were studied on a case control design, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and agarose gel electrophoresis after digestion with endonuclease enzyme. Genotypes and allele frequencies were compared using chi square tests, and p value of &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. The mean (?sd) HAM-A (Hamilton rating scale for anxiety) scores for anxiety and depressive groups were 28.2?5.14 and 17?5.61, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). The mean (?sd) HAM-D (Hamilton rating scale for depression) scores for depressive and anxiety groups were 25?5.58 and 15?6.13, respectively. (p&lt; 0.001). The frequency of S allele was significantly high (83.3% vs 60%) in the group with anxiety (p&lt; 0.05) compared to the control group (p&gt; 0.05). The genetic studies are still evolving as pathogenesis of anxiety and depressive disorders and involve the interaction of environmental factors with various genes. Genetic variation in different populations and hence different environments is important for elucidation of the mechanisms of these disorders. However, the study concludes that the locus under study is not shared between the two disorders. 	Med_J_Islam_Repub_Iran	D016428
23630412	20130501	Phentermine and topiramate for the management of obesity: a review.	Obesity is now a major public health concern worldwide with increasing prevalence and a growing list of comorbidities and complications. The morbidity, mortality and reduced productivity associated with obesity and its complications result in a major burden to health care costs. Obesity is a complex chronic medical syndrome often with multiple different etiologic factors in individual patients. The long term successful management of obesity remains particularly challenging and invariably requires a multifaceted approach including lifestyle and behavioral modification, increased physical activity, and adjunctive pharmacotherapy. Bariatric surgery remains a last resort though at present it has the best results for achieving sustained robust weight loss. Obesity pharmacotherapy has been very limited in its role for long term obesity management because of the past history of several failed agents as well as the fact that presently available agents are few, and generally utilized as monotherapy. The recent FDA approval of the fixed drug combination of phentermine and extended release topiramate (topiramate-ER) (trade name Qsymia?) marks the first FDA approved combination pharmacotherapeutic agent for obesity since the Phen-Fen combination of the 1990s. This review details the history and clinical trial basis for the use of both phentermine and topiramate in obesity therapeutics as well as the results of clinical trials of their combination for obesity treatment in humans. The initial clinical approval trials offer evidence that this fixed drug combination offers synergistic potential for effective, robust and sustained weight loss with mean weight loss of at least 10% of baseline achieved and sustained for up to 2 years in over 50% of subjects treated. It is anticipated that this agent will be the first in a new trend of multi-agent combination therapy for the chronic adjunctive management of obesity. 	Drug_Des_Devel_Ther	D016428 D016454
19260764	20090306	Commitment to the regulatory T cell lineage requires CARMA1 in the thymus but not in the periphery.	Regulatory T (T(reg)) cells expressing forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) arise during thymic selection among thymocytes with modestly self-reactive T cell receptors. In vitro studies suggest Foxp3 can also be induced among peripheral CD4(+) T cells in a cytokine dependent manner. T(reg) cells of thymic or peripheral origin may serve different functions in vivo, but both populations are phenotypically indistinguishable in wild-type mice. Here we show that mice with a Carma1 point mutation lack thymic CD4(+)Foxp3(+) T(reg) cells and demonstrate a cell-intrinsic requirement for CARMA1 in thymic Foxp3 induction. However, peripheral Carma1-deficient T(reg) cells could be generated and expanded in vitro in response to the cytokines transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) and interleukin-2 (IL-2). In vivo, a small peripheral T(reg) pool existed that was enriched at mucosal sites and could expand systemically after infection with mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Our data provide genetic evidence for two distinct mechanisms controlling regulatory T cell lineage commitment. Furthermore, we show that peripheral T(reg) cells are a dynamic population that may expand to limit immunopathology or promote chronic infection. 	PLoS_Biol.	D016428 D052061

15981205	20050628	RNASEL germline variants are associated with pancreatic cancer.	The RNASEL (encoding ribonuclease L) gene Glu265X mutation has been implicated in familial prostate cancer, and an association between the RNASEL Arg462Gln variant and sporadic and familial prostate cancer, has also been suggested. Because prostate cancer occurs in some familial pancreatic cancer families, we evaluated the role of the RNASEL gene variants Glu265X and Arg462Gln in the etiology of pancreatic cancer. Exon 2 of the RNASEL gene was directly sequenced in the germline of 36 familial and 75 sporadic pancreatic cancer patients and in 108 controls. The Glu265X mutation was identified in one (2.8%) familial and one (1.3%) sporadic pancreatic cancer case, but not in any of the controls. Arg462Gln variants were identified in 61 (56%) controls and in 55 (73%) sporadic pancreatic cancer cases with 8 (7%) and 12 (16%) homozygotes, respectively (p = 0.009). For homozygous carriers the increased risk for pancreatic cancer was 3.5 (odds ratio [OR] = 3.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11-11.46, p = 0.03). The population attributable fraction (PAF) was 38.7% (95% CI = 0.08-0.80). In familial pancreatic cancer no association between Arg462Gln genotypes and pancreatic cancer risk was evident. In sporadic pancreatic cancer there were no significant differences between Arg462Gln genotypes regarding clinical characteristics. In familial pancreatic cancer, however, patients with Arg462Gln variants had more aggressive tumors with more high grade cancers (OR = 15.40, p = 0.009) and more distant metastases (OR = 7.00, p = 0.04) than patients with the wild-type genotype. Our results suggest that RNASEL variants Glu265X and Arg462Gln may contribute to the tumorigenesis of sporadic and familial pancreatic cancer, which has to be proven in large scale studies.

Here, we described a six-generation Chinese family presenting with morphologically homogeneous &quot;nuclear pulverulent&quot; cataracts. A whole genome scan was performed with polymorphic microsatellites in the Human MapPairs marker set, with special attention paid to known ADCC loci. Then we screened for mutations by direct sequencing. A significantly positive two-point LOD score was obtained at marker D13S175(Zmax=7.83, theta=0). Haplotype analysis indicated this disease was located at 13q11, close to GJA3. Upon screening for mutations in GJA3 in this family, we found a novel transition mutation (TTC-&gt;TTA) resulting in a Phenylalanine-Leucine substitution at the highly conserved codon 32 of the GJA3 protein. This mutation segregated with the affected members of the family. This finding is the first report of a mutation in the first transmembrane region of GJA3. Our study further confirmed that GJA3 plays a vital role in the maintenance of human lens transparency. 	Mol._Vis.	D016428 D013485
24250732	20131120	Differences in care between general medicine and respiratory specialists in the management of patients hospitalized for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	Hospitalized patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) may be managed by either respiratory specialists (RS) or general medicine physicians (GMP). While previous studies have audited the hospital AECOPD management of RS, only a small number of studies have evaluated the management of GMP. The aims of this study were to firstly examine the differences in AECOPD management of GMP and RS and secondly compare their care to national COPD guidelines. A retrospective review was undertaken of consecutive AECOPD patients admitted to two hospitals (one hospital where all AECOPD patients were managed by RS and another where all AECOPD patients were managed by GMP) over a 3-month period. Electronic medical records, medical case notes, pathology and radiology data for the admission were reviewed. There were 201 COPD exacerbations in 169 patients (49.7% male, mean age 72.3). GMP managed 84 (41.7%) exacerbations. In comparison to RS, GMP performed fewer spirometry tests, blood gas analysis and less frequently treated patients with guideline-recommended medications. Referral to pulmonary rehabilitation was poor for both groups of clinicians. Median length of stay was shorter in GMP patients versus RS patients (3 days vs. 5 days, P = 0.001). There were no differences in the 12-month re-admission (41.7% vs. 38.5%, P = 0.664) and mortality rates (10.7% vs. 6%, P = 0.292) between both groups of patients. Our study found differences in the hospital AECOPD management of GMP and RS, but these did not translate into different clinical outcomes between their patients. We also found suboptimal adherence to national COPD guidelines, suggesting that there is scope for improvement in the AECOPD management of both groups of clinicians. 	Ann_Thorac_Med	D016428
22577218	20120512	Hereditary myopathy with early respiratory failure associated with a mutation in A-band titin.	Hereditary myopathy with early respiratory failure and extensive myofibrillar lesions has been described in sporadic and familial cases and linked to various chromosomal regions. The mutated gene is unknown in most cases. We studied eight individuals, from three apparently unrelated families, with clinical and pathological features of hereditary myopathy with early respiratory failure. The investigations included clinical examination, muscle histopathology and genetic analysis by whole exome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. All patients had adult onset muscle weakness in the pelvic girdle, neck flexors, respiratory and trunk muscles, and the majority had prominent calf hypertrophy. Examination of pulmonary function showed decreased vital capacity. No signs of cardiac muscle involvement were found. Muscle histopathological features included marked muscle fibre size variation, fibre splitting, numerous internal nuclei and fatty infiltration. Frequent groups of fibres showed eosinophilic inclusions and deposits. At the ultrastructural level, there were extensive myofibrillar lesions with marked Z-disc alterations. Whole exome sequencing in four individuals from one family revealed a missense mutation, g.274375T&gt;C; p.Cys30071Arg, in the titin gene (TTN). The mutation, which changes a highly conserved residue in the myosin binding A-band titin, was demonstrated to segregate with the disease in all three families. High density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays covering the entire genome demonstrated sharing of a 6.99?Mb haplotype, located in chromosome region 2q31 including TTN, indicating common ancestry. Our results demonstrate a novel and the first disease-causing mutation in A-band titin associated with hereditary myopathy with early respiratory failure. The typical histopathological features with prominent myofibrillar lesions and inclusions in muscle and respiratory failure early in the clinical course should be incentives for analysis of TTN mutations.

22653970	20120602	Long QT2 mutation on the Kv11.1 ion channel inhibits current activity by ablating a protein kinase C? consensus site.	Mutations that inhibit Kv11.1 ion channel activity contribute to abnormalities of cardiac repolarization that can lead to long QT2 (LQT2) cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. However, for most of these mutations, nothing is known about the molecular mechanism linking Kv11.1 malfunction to cardiac death. We have previously demonstrated that disease-related mutations that create consensus sites for kinases on ion channels can dramatically change ion channel activity. Here, we show that a LQT2-associated mutation can inhibit Kv11.1 ion channel activity by perturbing a consensus site for the Ser/Thr protein kinase C ? (PKC?). We first reveal by mass spectrometry analysis that Ser890 of the Kv11.1 ion channel is phosphorylated. Then, we demonstrate by a phospho-detection immunoassay combined with genetic manipulation that PKC? phosphorylates Ser890. Furthermore, we show that Ser890 phosphorylation is associated with an increase in Kv11.1 membrane density with alteration of recovery from inactivation. In addition, a newly discovered and as yet uncharacterized LQT2-associated nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism 2660 G?A within the human ether-?-go-go-related gene 1 coding sequence, which replaces arginine 887 with a histidine residue (R887H), strongly inhibits PKC?-dependent phosphorylation of residue Ser890 on Kv11.1, and ultimately inhibits surface expression and current density. Taken together, our data provide a functional link between this channel mutation and LQT2. 	Mol._Pharmacol.	D016428
27788484	20161028	Association of Vitamin D receptor Fok I polymorphism with the risk of prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.	Several previous studies have been reported to examine the association between Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene Fok I polymorphism and susceptibility to prostate cancer (PCa), however the results remain inconclusive. To provide a relatively comprehensive account of the association, we searched PubMed, Embase, CNKI, and Wanfang for eligible studies and carry out this meta-analysis. A total of 27 case-control studies with 10,486 cases and 10,400 controls were included. In the overall analysis, Fok I polymorphism was not significantly associated with the susceptibility to PCa. Subgroup analyses showed that significantly association was existed in Caucasian population, the subgroup of population-based controls and the stratified group with advanced tumor.These results indicate that the VDR Fok I polymorphism might be capable of causing PCa susceptibility and could be a promising target to forecast the PCa risk for clinical practice. However further well-designed epidemiologic studies are needed to confirm this conclusion. 	Oncotarget	D016428
17113613	20061123	Changes in the nasal carriage of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in urban and rural Vietnamese schoolchildren.	Studying the antimicrobial drug resistance of nasopharyngeal or nasal carriage isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae in children is likely to have predictive potential for invasive isolates. Streptococcus pneumoniae nasal carriage was studied in 1422 Vietnamese children. Forty-six percent of 536 isolates showed reduced susceptibility to penicillin and 7% showed intermediate susceptibility to ceftriaxone; and 50% of 518 isolates showed resistance to erythromycin. All isolates were sensitive to levofloxacin and gatifloxacin. Urban and suburban children were significantly more likely to carry drug-resistant isolates than rural children. Rates of non-susceptibility to penicillin and erythromycin increased significantly in the rural province Khanh Hoa in 2003/2004 compared with rates obtained in 1997. An emerging clone of penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae of serogroup 15 was identified, which was widely distributed in addition to the pandemic clones Spain(23F)-1 and Taiwan(19F)-14. Although resistance to fluoroquinolones was not observed, 6 (18%) of 34 isolates had a Lys137Asn mutation in the parC gene. This study shows that drug resistance is increasing in carriage isolates of S. pneumoniae in rural areas in Vietnam owing to spread of pandemic and emerging resistant clones.

28004755	20161223	STAT3 Undergoes Acetylation-dependent Mitochondrial Translocation to Regulate Pyruvate Metabolism.	Cytoplasmic STAT3, after activation by growth factors, translocates to different subcellular compartments, including nuclei and mitochondria, where it carries out different biological functions. However, the precise mechanism by which STAT3 undergoes mitochondrial translocation and subsequently regulates the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-electron transport chain (ETC) remains poorly understood. Here, we clarify this process by visualizing STAT3 acetylation in starved cells after serum reintroduction or insulin stimulation. CBP-acetylated STAT3 undergoes mitochondrial translocation in response to serum introduction or insulin stimulation. In mitochondria, STAT3 associates with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E1 (PDC-E1) and subsequently accelerates the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, elevates the mitochondrial membrane potential, and promotes ATP synthesis. SIRT5 deacetylates STAT3, thereby inhibiting its function in mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism. In the A549 lung cancer cell line, constitutively acetylated STAT3 localizes to mitochondria, where it maintains the mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP synthesis in an active state.

26400658	20150925	Impact of sub and supra-threshold adaptation currents in networks of spiking neurons.	Neuronal adaptation is the intrinsic capacity of the brain to change, by various mechanisms, its dynamical responses as a function of the context. Such a phenomena, widely observed in vivo and in vitro, is known to be crucial in homeostatic regulation of the activity and gain control. The effects of adaptation have already been studied at the single-cell level, resulting from either voltage or calcium gated channels both activated by the spiking activity and modulating the dynamical responses of the neurons. In this study, by disentangling those effects into a linear (sub-threshold) and a non-linear (supra-threshold) part, we focus on the the functional role of those two distinct components of adaptation onto the neuronal activity at various scales, starting from single-cell responses up to recurrent networks dynamics, and under stationary or non-stationary stimulations. The effects of slow currents on collective dynamics, like modulation of population oscillation and reliability of spike patterns, is quantified for various types of adaptation in sparse recurrent networks.

22566954	20120509	Innate immunity and resistance to tolerogenesis in allotransplantation.	The development of immunosuppressive drugs to control adaptive immune responses has led to the success of transplantation as a therapy for end-stage organ failure. However, these agents are largely ineffective in suppressing components of the innate immune system. This distinction has gained in clinical significance as mounting evidence now indicates that innate immune responses play important roles in the acute and chronic rejection of whole organ allografts. For instance, whereas clinical interest in natural killer (NK) cells was once largely confined to the field of bone marrow transplantation, recent findings suggest that these cells can also participate in the acute rejection of cardiac allografts and prevent tolerance induction. Stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), another important component of innate immunity, by endogenous ligands released in response to ischemia/reperfusion is now known to cause an inflammatory milieu favorable to graft rejection and abrogation of tolerance. Emerging data suggest that activation of complement is linked to acute rejection and interferes with tolerance. In summary, the conventional wisdom that the innate immune system is of little importance in whole organ transplantation is no longer tenable. The addition of strategies that target TLRs, NK cells, complement, and other components of the innate immune system will be necessary to eventually achieve long-term tolerance to human allograft recipients.

20010544	20091217	Circulating methylarginine levels and the decline in renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease are modulated by DDAH1 polymorphisms.	In patients with chronic kidney disease, high plasma levels of the endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, asymmetric dimethylarginine, are thought to contribute to decline in renal function. Here we took a candidate gene approach to determine any causal role of asymmetric dimethylarginine in the progression of chronic kidney disease. The impact of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genes encoding the two isoforms of the asymmetric dimethylarginine-degrading enzyme, dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH1 and DDAH2), on enzyme expression, plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine levels, and longitudinal changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate were determined in various patient groups. There was evidence suggesting that the rs17384213 DDAH1 GG genotype was associated with increased expression of its mRNA in kidney allografts. Healthy subjects carrying the rs17384213 G allele had lower plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine, and a similar borderline association was found in patients with chronic kidney disease. This allele, however, was independently associated with a steeper decline in renal function in two separate cohorts of patients with chronic kidney disease. We conclude that polymorphisms in DDAH1 alter the rate of decline of glomerular filtration rate in subjects with chronic kidney disease. Our findings show that DDAH1 modulates plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine and contributes to the decline in renal function. However, it appears that increases in circulating methylarginine did not mediate progressive kidney injury. 	Kidney_Int.	D016428 D013485
8799283	19960401	Gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometric comparison of N-acetyl- and N-pivaloyl amino acid esters to measure 15N isotopic abundances in physiological samples: a pilot study on amino acid synthesis in the upper gastro-intestinal tract of minipigs.	There is evidence that in animals and also in humans, non-specific nitrogen is used for de novo synthesis of indispensable amino acids by the microflora of the gastro-intestinal tract. Gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry was applied to investigate whether lysine of intestinal origin is available for body protein synthesis. Two minipigs with an end-to-end ileorectal anastomosis received orally equimolar amounts of 15N as ammonium chloride or urea twice a day for 10 days. Samples of blood and ileal digesta were collected before and throughout the 10 days; tissue samples were taken at termination of the experiment. The N-acetyl-n-propyl (NAP)- and N-pivaloyl-i-propyl (NPP)-amino acid esters were evaluated for the determination of the 15N content of lysine and 16 other amino acids ranging from natural abundance to an enrichment of 0.6 APE 15N in a complex mixture of proteinogenic amino acids and several matrices. At natural abundances for all amino acids analysed, NAP and NPP derivatives gave mean precisions of 0.5 and 0.3/1000 delta 15N, respectively. The mean precision for NPP derivatives at enrichments between 0.42 and 1.10 AP 15N ranged between 1.0-15.0/1000 delta 15N. 15N from ammonium chloride was incorporated into lysine and in all other amino acids of serum albumin to a 2.5 times higher degree than from urea. Somewhat lower, but significant, lysine enrichments were detected in liver, duodenum and jejunum. After 10 days of ingestion of 15N-labeled urea a significant 15N enrichment in lysine of serum albumin could not be detected, although lysine in the ileal digesta was significantly labeled by day 5. This is the first report providing evidence that the microflora in the upper gastrointestinal tract of pigs is capable of synthesizing lysine de novo and that this lysine is available for body protein synthesis.

17311011	20070222	Stat3 activation in human endometrial and cervical cancers.	The activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) has been implicated in the oncogenesis of cancer and is regarded as a novel target for cancer therapy. Stat3 is classified as a proto-oncogene, because an activated form of Stat3 can mediate oncogenic transformation in cultured cells and tumour formation in nude mice. The constitutive activation of Stat3 has been frequently detected in various types of human cancers. However, the constitutive activation of Stat3 in endometrial and cervical cancers has not been studied. We examined tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 (activated form of Stat3) in multiple endometrial and cervical cancer tissues using tissue microarray slides as well as cancer cell lines to explore the possible activation of Stat3. Our results indicated that elevated phosphorylation of Stat3 was detected in cervical and endometrial cancer cell lines. Our results also showed that elevated levels of phosphorylation of Stat3 protein were detected in the endometrial and cervical cancer specimens. This is the first study to demonstrate that Stat3 is activated in human endometrial and cervical cancer tissues. Immunohistochemical staining showed that activated Stat3 is associated with increased expression of downstream antiapoptotic genes, Bcl-xL, survivin, and Mcl-1 in these tissues. Expression of a dominant-negative Stat3 mutant using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in HeLa and SiHa cervical cancer cell lines expressing elevated levels of Stat3 phosphorylation. Further, a JAK/Stat3 small molecular inhibitor, JSI-124, induced apoptosis more selectively in HeLa and SiHa cancer cell lines than Ishikawa cell line without elevated levels of Stat3 phosphorylation. These results indicate that Stat3 is activated in human endometrial and cervical cancers and the inhibition of constitutive Stat3 signaling may be an effective target for cancer intervention in these two cancers.

18205436	20080122	Theoretical characterization of temperature and density dependence of liquid water electronic excitation energy: comparison with recent experimental data.	In a recent paper [Aschi et al., ChemPhysChem 6, 53 (2005)], we characterized, by means of theoretical-computational procedures, the electronic excitation of water along the typical liquid state isochore (55.32 mol/l) for a large range of temperature. In that paper we were able to accurately reproduce the experimental absorption maximum at room temperature and to provide a detailed description of the temperature dependence of the excitation spectrum along the isochore. In a recent experimental work by Marin et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 125, 104314 (2006)], water electronic excitation energy was carefully analyzed in a broad range of density and temperature, finding a remarkable agreement of the temperature behavior of the experimental data with our theoretical results. Here, by means of the same theoretical-computational procedures (molecular dynamics simulations and the perturbed matrix method), we investigate water electronic absorption exactly in the same density-temperature range used in the experimental work, hence, now considering also the absorption density dependence. Our results point out that, (1) for all the densities and temperatures investigated, our calculated absorption spectra are in very good agreement with the experimental ones and (2) the gradual maxima redshift observed increasing the temperature or decreasing the density has to be ascribed to a real shift of the lowest X--&gt;A electronic transition, supporting the conclusions of Marin et al.

27536305	20160819	Barley Genes as Tools to Confer Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Crops.	Barley is one of the oldest cultivated crops in the world with a high adaptive capacity. The natural tolerance of barley to stress has led to increasing interest in identification of stress responsive genes through small/large-scale omics studies, comparative genomics, and overexpression of some of these genes by genetic transformation. Two major categories of proteins involved in stress tolerance are transcription factors (TFs) responsible from the re-programming of the metabolism in stress environment, and genes encoding Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins, antioxidant enzymes, osmolytes, and transporters. Constitutive overexpression of several barley TFs, such as C-repeat binding factors (HvCBF4), dehydration-responsive element-binding factors (HvDREB1), and WRKYs (HvWRKY38), in transgenic plants resulted in higher tolerance to drought and salinity, possibly by effectively altering the expression levels of stress tolerance genes due to their higher DNA binding affinity. Na(+)/H(+) antiporters, channel proteins, and lipid transporters can also be the strong candidates for engineering plants for tolerance to salinity and low temperatures.

16291504	20051118	Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency: genotype-biochemical phenotype correlations.	The fatty acid oxidation disorder most commonly identified by tandem mass spectrometry newborn screening is the potentially fatal medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCAD). In clinically presenting cases, 80% are homozygous for the common mutation, c.985A &gt; G and 18% heterozygous. We screened 592,785 babies and identified 34 with MCAD, 17 homozygous for c.985A &gt; G, 14 with one copy, and 3 with no copy. We sequenced the exons of 19 patients, the 17 carrying one or no copy of c.985A &gt; G, and two with marginal findings, and examined correlations between groups of mutations and biochemical markers. We found two known or putative pathogenic mutations in 18 of the 19 patients. Two mutations appeared more than once: c.199T &gt; C, not recorded in clinically presenting cases (n = 4), and c.583G &gt; A (n = 2). Patients homozygous for c.985A &gt; G had the highest levels of neonatal octanoylcarnitine, plasma octanoylcarnitine when asymptomatic, and urinary acylglycines. Compound heterozygotes of c.985A &gt; G and other mutations had intermediate levels, and those without c.985A &gt; G, or heterozygous for that and c.199T &gt; C had the lowest levels of these analytes. There was overlap in all values. The c.985A &gt; G and c.583G &gt; A mutations appear to have functional effects towards the severe end of the spectrum, and the c.199T &gt; C mutation a smaller effect, as has been previously postulated. If these results are confirmed and extended, this could influence the advice given to parents of babies with MCAD detected by newborn screening, and make management more specific. In the meantime, all MCAD patients identified by newborn screening have, by definition, a functional defect and require careful clinical management. 	Mol._Genet._Metab.	D016428 D013485
26818920	20160129	A Functional Polymorphism (rs2494752) in the AKT1 Promoter Region and Gastric Adenocarcinoma Risk in an Eastern Chinese Population.	AKT is an important signal transduction protein that plays a crucial role in cancer development. Therefore, we evaluated associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AKT promoter region and gastric cancer (GCa) risk in a case-control study of 1,110 GCa patients and 1,114 matched cancer-free controls. We genotyped five SNPs (AKT1 rs2494750G &gt;C, AKT1 rs2494752A &gt;G, AKT1 rs10138227C &gt;T, AKT2 rs7254617G&gt;A and AKT2 rs2304186G &gt;T) located in the 5' upstream regulatory, first intron or promoter regions. In the logistic regression analysis, a significantly elevated GCa risk was associated with the rs2494752 AG/GG variant genotypes (adjusted odds ratio [OR]?=?1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI]?=?1.02-1.42) under a dominant genetic model, and this risk was more evident in subgroups of ever drinkers. The luciferase reporter assay showed that the rs2494752 G allele significantly increased luciferase activity. Our results suggest that the potentially functional AKT1 rs2494752 SNP may affect GCa susceptibility, likely by modulating the AKT1 promoter transcriptional activity. Larger, independent studies are warranted to validate our findings. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D013485
18219286	20080126	Progesterone receptor variation and risk of ovarian cancer is limited to the invasive endometrioid subtype: results from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium pooled analysis.	There is evidence that progesterone plays a role in the aetiology of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer. Therefore, genes involved in pathways that regulate progesterone may be candidates for susceptibility to this disease. Previous studies have suggested that genetic variants in the progesterone receptor gene (PGR) may be associated with ovarian cancer risk, although results have been inconsistent. We have established an international consortium to pool resources and data from many ovarian cancer case-control studies in an effort to identify variants that influence risk. In this study, three PGR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), for which previous data have suggested they affect ovarian cancer risk, were examined. These were +331 C/T (rs10895068), PROGINS (rs1042838), and a 3' variant (rs608995). A total of 4788 ovarian cancer cases and 7614 controls from 12 case-control studies were included in this analysis. Unconditional logistic regression was used to model the association between each SNP and ovarian cancer risk and two-sided P-values are reported. Overall, risk of ovarian cancer was not associated with any of the three variants studied. However, in histopathological subtype analyses, we found a statistically significant association between risk of endometrioid ovarian cancer and the PROGINS allele (n=651, OR=1.17, 95% CI=1.01-1.36, P=0.036). We also observed borderline evidence of an association between risk of endometrioid ovarian cancer and the +331C/T variant (n=725 cases; OR=0.80, 95% CI 0.62-1.04, P=0.100). These data suggest that while these three variants in the PGR are not associated with ovarian cancer overall, the PROGINS variant may play a modest role in risk of endometrioid ovarian cancer.

18390906	20080409	Inhibition of recombinant human T-type calcium channels by Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol.	Delta(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the most prevalent biologically active constituents of Cannabis sativa. THC is the prototypic cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist and is psychoactive and analgesic. CBD is also analgesic, but it is not a CB1 receptor agonist. Low voltage-activated T-type calcium channels, encoded by the Ca(V)3 gene family, regulate the excitability of many cells, including neurons involved in nociceptive processing. We examined the effects of THC and CBD on human Ca(V)3 channels stably expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and T-type channels in mouse sensory neurons using whole-cell, patch clamp recordings. At moderately hyperpolarized potentials, THC and CBD inhibited peak Ca(V)3.1 and Ca(V)3.2 currents with IC(50) values of approximately 1 mum but were less potent on Ca(V)3.3 channels. THC and CBD inhibited sensory neuron T-type channels by about 45% at 1 mum. However, in recordings made from a holding potential of -70 mV, 100 nm THC or CBD inhibited more than 50% of the peak Ca(V)3.1 current. THC and CBD produced a significant hyperpolarizing shift in the steady state inactivation potentials for each of the Ca(V)3 channels, which accounts for inhibition of channel currents. Additionally, THC caused a modest hyperpolarizing shift in the activation of Ca(V)3.1 and Ca(V)3.2. THC but not CBD slowed Ca(V)3.1 and Ca(V)3.2 deactivation and inactivation kinetics. Thus, THC and CBD inhibit Ca(V)3 channels at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. However, THC, but not CBD, may also increase the amount of calcium entry following T-type channel activation by stabilizing open states of the channel. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
15614196	20041223	G-protein beta-3 subunit gene 825C&gt;T dimorphism is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy but not essential hypertension.	The human G-protein beta 3 subunit gene (GNB3) and some of its variants are known to be important genetic influences involved in essential hypertension (EH). Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has long been thought to be an end point of EH, rather than a separate entity, though it is influenced by a unique set of hormonal, vascular and genetic factors. We carried out a retrospective, case-control study of a GNB3 825 C&gt;T dimorphism among nationals from the United Arab Emirates (Emirati), an ethnic group characterized by no alcohol intake and no cigarette smoking, for putative correlations with EH and LVH. We investigated a sample population of 454 Emirati (231 men, 223 women) comprising groups of controls and patients with clinical diagnoses of LVH, based on echocardiographic and ECG criteria, and EH, based on blood pressure values. The GNB3 825 C&gt;T genotypes were determined by PCR and restriction digestion. The distribution of genotypes was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in all three subject groups. GNB3 T825 alleles demonstrated a strong association with LVH (OR = 2.22; 95% CI: 1.29-3.83 and P = 0.0002), but not with EH. GNB3 825 C&gt;T is likely to be a significant risk factor for LVH but not for EH in the Emirati population, thereby strengthening the view that LVH is genetically a separate clinical entity.

23133374	20121108	Design and evaluation of meningococcal vaccines through structure-based modification of host and pathogen molecules.	Neisseria meningitis remains a leading cause of sepsis and meningitis, and vaccines are required to prevent infections by this important human pathogen. Factor H binding protein (fHbp) is a key antigen that elicits protective immunity against the meningococcus and recruits the host complement regulator, fH. As the high affinity interaction between fHbp and fH could impair immune responses, we sought to identify non-functional fHbps that could act as effective immunogens. This was achieved by alanine substitution of fHbps from all three variant groups (V1, V2 and V3 fHbp) of the protein; while some residues affected fH binding in each variant group, the distribution of key amino underlying the interaction with fH differed between the V1, V2 and V3 proteins. The atomic structure of V3 fHbp in complex with fH and of the C-terminal barrel of V2 fHbp provide explanations to the differences in the precise nature of their interactions with fH, and the instability of the V2 protein. To develop transgenic models to assess the efficacy of non-functional fHbps, we determined the structural basis of the low level of interaction between fHbp and murine fH; in addition to changes in amino acids in the fHbp binding site, murine fH has a distinct conformation compared with the human protein that would sterically inhibit binding to fHbp. Non-functional V1 fHbps were further characterised by binding and structural studies, and shown in non-transgenic and transgenic mice (expressing chimeric fH that binds fHbp and precisely regulates complement system) to retain their immunogenicity. Our findings provide a catalogue of non-functional fHbps from all variant groups that can be included in new generation meningococcal vaccines, and establish proof-in-principle for clinical studies to compare their efficacy with wild-type fHbps.

Blinded studies were done by automated DNA sequencing of all the 11 exons and the exon-intron boundaries of the GALT gene using genomic DNA isolated from dry blood spots. Fourteen different mutations (11 missense mutations, 2 nonsense mutations and 1 splicing mutation) were detected in 94 of the 98 mutant alleles (diagnostic efficiency of 96%). The prevalent mutations were N314D (41%), Q188R (37%) and K285N (4%). The other less frequent mutations were IVS2-2A&gt;G and S135L (3% each), T138M (2%) and T23A, H184Q, Y251S, L195P, Q207X, L264X, Q344K, and A345D (1% each). Three novel mutations, T23A, Q207X, and A345D, were identified. Our study supports previous findings that N314D and Q188R are prevalent in Hispanics and Whites and K285N was only observed in Whites. The IVS2-2A-&gt;G mutation is probably ethnic specific because it was identified exclusively in Hispanics. S135L, a prevalent mutation in Blacks, was also present in 3 Hispanics. Two unusual genotypes were observed in 2 patients homozygous for the Duarte-2 N314D allele and heterozygous for a novel mutation (Q207X- N314D/N314D in a classic galactosemia and T23A- N314D/N314D in a Duarte-2 case). The detection of GALT gene mutations in newborns from Texas should focus first on N314D, Q188R, K285N, IVS2-2A&gt;G, S135L and T138M. Other exons and exon-intron boundaries would have to be studied if either one or no mutations are found in the primary screening. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428
24086391	20131003	Increased expression of complement regulators CD55 and CD59 on peripheral blood cells in patients with EAHEC O104:H4 infection.	An outbreak of Shiga Toxin 2 (Stx-2) producing enterohemorrhagic and enteroaggregative E.coli (EAHEC) O104H4 infection in May 2011 caused enterocolitis and an unprecedented high 22% rate of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The monoclonal anti-C5 antibody Eculizumab (ECU) has been used experimentally in EAHEC patients with HUS but treatment efficacy is uncertain. ECU can effectively prevent hemolysis in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) caused by a lack of complement-regulating CD55 and CD59 on blood cells. We hypothesized a low expression of CD55 and CD59, as seen in PNH, might correlate with HUS development in EAHEC patients. 76 EAHEC patients (34 only gastrointestinal symptoms [GI], 23: HUS, 19: HUS and neurological symptoms [HUS/N]) and 12 healthy controls (HC) were tested for the expression of CD55 and CD59 on erythrocytes and leukocytes retrospectively. Additionally, the effect of Stx-2 on CD55 and CD59 expression on erythrocytes and leukocytes was studied ex vivo. CD55 expression on erythrocytes was similar in all patient groups and HC while CD59 showed a significantly higher expression in HUS and HUS/N patients compared to HC and the GI group. CD55 and CD59 expression on leukocytes and their subsets was significantly higher in all patient groups compared to HC regardless of treatment type. However, CD59 expression on erythrocytes was significantly higher in HUS and HUS/N patients treated combined with plasma separation (PS) and ECU compared to HC. Adding Stx-2 ex vivo had no effect on CD55 and CD59 expression on leukocytes from HC or patients. HUS evolved independently from CD55 and CD59 expression on peripheral blood cells in EAHEC O104:H4 infected patients. Our data do not support a role for CD55 and CD59 in HUS development during EAHEC O104:H4 infection and point to a different mechanism within the complement system for HUS development in EAHEC patients.

19885554	20091104	Risk of gastric cancer is associated with the MUC1 568 A/G polymorphism.	Identifying the genetic variants that alter MUC1 protein expression may further our understanding of the risk for development of gastric cancer (GC). We used PCR-SSPs to identify the genotype of MUC1 A/G polymorphism at its 568 site of exon 2 and immunohistochemistry to detect MUC1 protein expression in GC patients and non-cancer subjects and analyzed the association between this polymorphism and MUC1 protein expression. We found that the frequency of AA genotype was significantly high in the GC patients and the risk for GC in AA genotype carriers increased 1.81-fold. Moreover, we found a significant underexpression of MUC1 protein in GC as compared to non-cancer subjects, which was negatively correlated to AA genotype of MUC1 (r=-0.1790, P=0.004). Furthermore, this study provides a possible mechanistic insight that the MUC1 A/G polymorphism at its 568 site disrupts the physiological functions of MUC1 which is important to the physiological protection of gastric mucosa. Thus we have provided evidence that may identify the MUC1 A/G polymorphism at 568 site, as a potential genetic factor which leads to an increase in susceptibility for GC through alteration of MUC1 gene and MUC1 expression in the population that carry the A allele.

25519132	20141219	An AUTS2-Polycomb complex activates gene expression in the CNS.	Naturally occurring variations of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) comprise a core assembly of Polycomb group proteins and additional factors that include, surprisingly, autism susceptibility candidate 2 (AUTS2). Although AUTS2 is often disrupted in patients with neuronal disorders, the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis is unclear. We investigated the role of AUTS2 as part of a previously identified PRC1 complex (PRC1-AUTS2), and in the context of neurodevelopment. In contrast to the canonical role of PRC1 in gene repression, PRC1-AUTS2 activates transcription. Biochemical studies demonstrate that the CK2 component of PRC1-AUTS2 neutralizes PRC1 repressive activity, whereas AUTS2-mediated recruitment of P300 leads to gene activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) demonstrated that AUTS2 regulates neuronal gene expression through promoter association. Conditional targeting of Auts2 in the mouse central nervous system (CNS) leads to various developmental defects. These findings reveal a natural means of subverting PRC1 activity, linking key epigenetic modulators with neuronal functions and diseases. 	Nature	D016428 D052061 D013485
26239916	20150805	A highly sensitive and specific method for the screening detection of genetically modified organisms based on digital PCR without pretreatment.	Digital PCR has developed rapidly since it was first reported in the 1990 s. It was recently reported that an improved method facilitated the detection of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). However, to use this improved method, the samples must be pretreated, which could introduce inaccuracy into the results. In our study, we explored a pretreatment-free digital PCR detection method for the screening for GMOs. We chose the CaMV35s promoter and the NOS terminator as the templates in our assay. To determine the specificity of our method, 9 events of GMOs were collected, including MON810, MON863, TC1507, MIR604, MIR162, GA21, T25, NK603 and Bt176. Moreover, the sensitivity, intra-laboratory and inter-laboratory reproducibility of our detection method were assessed. The results showed that the limit of detection of our method was 0.1%, which was lower than the labeling threshold level of the EU. The specificity and stability among the 9 events were consistent, respectively. The intra-laboratory and inter-laboratory reproducibility were both good. Finally, the perfect fitness for the detection of eight double-blind samples indicated the good practicability of our method. In conclusion, the method in our study would allow more sensitive, specific and stable screening detection of the GMO content of international trading products. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D013485
21899746	20110909	Lynch syndrome: barriers to and facilitators of screening and disease management.	Lynch syndrome is a hereditary cancer with confirmed carriers at high risk for colorectal (CRC) and extracolonic cancers. The purpose of the current study was to develop a greater understanding of the factors influencing decisions about disease management post-genetic testing. The study used a grounded theory approach to data collection and analysis as part of a multiphase project examining the psychosocial and behavioral impact of predictive DNA testing for Lynch syndrome. Individual and small group interviews were conducted with individuals from 10 families with the MSH2 intron 5 splice site mutation or exon 8 deletion. The data from confirmed carriers (n = 23) were subjected to re-analysis to identify key barriers to and/or facilitators of screening and disease management. Thematic analysis identified personal, health care provider and health care system factors as dominant barriers to and/or facilitators of managing Lynch syndrome. Person-centered factors reflect risk perceptions and decision-making, and enduring screening/disease management. The perceived knowledge and clinical management skills of health care providers also influenced participation in recommended protocols. The health care system barriers/facilitators are defined in terms of continuity of care and coordination of services among providers. Individuals with Lynch syndrome often encounter multiple barriers to and facilitators of disease management that go beyond the individual to the provider and health care system levels. The current organization and implementation of health care services are inadequate. A coordinated system of local services capable of providing integrated, efficient health care and follow-up, populated by providers with knowledge of hereditary cancer, is necessary to maintain optimal health.

11318647	20010425	Role of intrahelical arginine residues in functional properties of uncoupling protein (UCP1).	The functional role of the four intrahelical arginines in uncoupling protein (UCP1) from brown adipose tissue were studied in mutants where they were replaced by noncharged residues. Wild-type and mutant UCP1 were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As measured in isolated UCP1, nucleotide binding was largely lost in mutants of R83, R182, and R276 occurring in three repeated domains and common to mitochondrial carrier family, whereas mutation of the UCP typical R91 shows normal binding capacity but &gt; 20-fold lower binding affinity and a near loss of pH dependency of binding. In reconstituted UCP1, fatty acid dependent H(+) transport is retained in all four mutants, but inhibition by nucleotide changes according to the binding ability of UCP1. Cl(-) transport is inhibited only by mutations of arginines in the first domain (R83 and R91). Also in isolated mitochondria H(+) transport and respiration with all four mutants is similar to wt, and inhibition by GDP is found only in R91T. The three &quot;regular&quot; arginines are suggested to influence the nucleotide binding site indirectly via a charge network and the &quot;extra&quot; R91 directly via an ion bond with the previously characterised pH sensor E190. The mutants were also used to assess intrahelical control of UCP1. In the yeast cells expressing UCP1, the aerobic growth could be reduced by fatty acid addition only with the nucleotide insensitive mutants. This demonstrates an intracellular control of UCP1 by nucleotides and fatty acids. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485
8322269	19930503	Double strand conformation polymorphism (DSCP) detects two point mutations at codon 280 (AAC--&gt;ATC) and at codon 431 (TAC--&gt;AAC) of the blood coagulation factor VIII gene.	Hemophilia A is a hereditary, X-linked, bleeding disorder that is caused by a defect in the factor VIII gene. Here, we report two novel point mutations in the factor VIII gene that result in an aberrant electrophoretic mobility of double strand PCR fragments (double strand conformation polymorphism, DSCP). In exon 9 a TAC--&gt;AAC mutation at codon 431, replacing Tyr by Asn, was observed in a family (A211) with moderately severe hemophilia A. A family with mild hemophilia A revealed an A--&gt;T mutation in codon 280 (exon 7) that results in the replacement of Asn by Ile. One of these two mutations was not detected in an analysis based on single strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCP). At present we have no explanation for the effect of the nucleotide changes on the electrophoretic mobility of double strand DNA. Although DSCP is not able to detect all mutations the combination of DSCP analysis with SSCP analysis increases the sensitivity in a screening for factor VIII mutations. 	Thromb._Haemost.

19707468	20090827	Use of a decoy peptide to purify p21 activated kinase-1 in cardiac muscle and identification of ceramide-related activation.	The p(21) activated kinase-1 (Pak1) is a serine-threonine protein kinase directly activated by Cdc42 and Rac1. In cardiac myocytes, Pak1 activation leads to dephosphorylation of cTnI and C-protein through upregulation of phosphatase-2A (PP2A). Pak1 activity is directly correlated with its autophosphorylation, which occurs upon binding to the small GTPases and to some small organic molecules as well. In this report, we describe a novel method for rapid purification of endogenous Pak1 from bovine ventricle muscle. The method is simple and easy to carry out. The purified Pak1 demonstrated autophosphorylation in vitro that was enhanced by D-erythro-sphingosine-1, N-acetyl-D-erythro-sphingosine (C(2)-ceramide), and N-hexanoyl-D-erythro-sphingosine (C(6)-ceramide). Dihydro-L-threo-sphingosine (saphingol) also had some effect on Pak1 autophosphorylation. The method we developed provides a useful tool to study Pak1 activity and regulation in the heart. Moreover, our results indicate a potential role of the sphingolipids as unique signaling molecules inducing a direct activation of Pak1 that may modulate different cardiac functions.

26944452	20160306	Calcium homeostasis modulator 1 gene P86L polymorphism and the risk for alzheimer's disease: A meta-analysis.	Recently, many epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between P86L polymorphism of calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1) and risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the results of these association studies are inconsistent. In this study, we re-evaluated the relation between CALHM1 P86L polymorphism and risk for AD in a meta-analysis. This meta-analysis was performed using the PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus and Google Scholar databases up to June 2015 using the search terms &quot;CALHM1&quot; and &quot;polymorphism or SNP or variant&quot; in combination with &quot;Alzheimer's disease&quot;. A meta-analysis with pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals was carried out to assess the associations between P86L polymorphism and the risks for Alzheimer's disease under four genetic models with fixed or random effects models. Sixteen studies (twenty-four subgroup studies involving 9795 cases and 15,335 controls) were included in our meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis results indicated that several genetic models of CALHM1 P86L polymorphism were significantly associated with increased risk for AD in overall and Caucasian populations. In conclusion, our comprehensive meta-analysis indicated that P86L polymorphism is significantly associated with an increased risk for AD. Our data suggest that CALHM1 polymorphism may be potential biomarker in patients with AD. 	Neurosci._Lett.	D016428 D017418
27197753	20160521	F-box only protein 9 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase of PPAR?.	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR?) is a critical regulator of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, adipocyte differentiation and inflammatory response. Post-translational modification of PPAR? and its degradation involve several pathways, including the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Here, we identified F-box only protein 9 (FBXO9) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase of PPAR?. We screened interacting partners of PPAR? using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis and identified FBXO9 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase of PPAR?. FBXO9 directly interacted with PPAR? through the activation function-1 domain and ligand-binding domain. FBXO9 decreased the protein stability of PPAR? through induction of ubiquitination. We found that the F-box motif of FBXO9 was required for its ubiquitination function. The activity of PPAR? was significantly decreased by FBXO9 overexpression. Furthermore, FBXO9 overexpression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes resulted in decreased levels of endogenous PPAR? and suppression of adipogenesis. These results suggest that FBXO9 is an important enzyme that regulates the stability and activity of PPAR? through ubiquitination. 	Exp._Mol._Med.	D016428 D013485
11323212	20010427	Changes in some blood constituents of Barki ewes during pregnancy and lactation under semi arid conditions.	A study based on 12 pregnant and six dry Barki ewes was carried out to examine the changes in blood constituents during pregnancy and lactation periods. The blood parameters were blood hemoglobin, packed cell volume percent (PCV%), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), glucose, aspartate aminotransaminase (AST or GOT), alanine aminotransaminase (ALT or GPT), total plasma protein, albumin, globulin, albumin to globulin ratio (A/G), urea and creatinine. During pregnancy all these parameters started to increase significantly, but in different stages, reaching maximum values at parturition. In contrast, dry ewes showed almost stable values during the experimental period. From 10th week to parturition, PCV% and MCHC increased (P&lt;0.01) in pregnant ewes, which resulted in increased (P&lt;0.01) blood hemoglobin. Blood glucose increased from the 4th week of pregnancy to reach its maximum at parturition (60.15-90.08mg/dl). The two transaminases increased significantly from the 2nd week (52.23-65.02IU for AST and 8.02-15.12IU for ALT). Plasma protein with its two components, albumin and globulin, increased significantly at the 6th week, but dropped throughout the 16-18th week of pregnancy. Urea and creatinine began to increase significantly after 10-12 weeks of pregnancy (from 54.73 to 72.11mg/dl for urea and from 0.882 to 2.475mg/dl for creatinine). During the first month of lactation, PCV decreased sharply in lactating ewes and was significantly lower than in dry ewes at the 3rd week of lactation (24.25 versus 27.17%), which resulted in a drop in blood hemoglobin at the 4th week (68.42 versus 74.00g/l). However, lactating ewes maintained significantly higher values of MCHC (30.01-31.19% for lactating versus 29.87-27.48% for dry). In lactating ewes, levels of glucose, ALT, urea and creatinine returned to levels comparable to those in dry ewes. The same occurred with total plasma proteins, mainly due to a sharp decrease in globulin, while albumin remained higher than in dry ewes with a slow decline, which resulted in higher values of A/G ratio during lactation. Aspartate aminotransferase remained higher than in dry ewes. 	Small_Rumin._Res.	D016428
21873315	20110830	Production of ELOVL4 transgenic pigs: a large animal model for Stargardt-like macular degeneration.	Truncation mutations in the elongation of very long chain fatty acids-4 (AF277094, MIM #605512) (ELOVL4) gene cause Stargardt-like macular dystrophy type 3 (STGD3). Mice expressing truncated ELOVL4 develop rapid retinal degeneration, but are poor STGD3 models since mice lack a macula. Photoreceptor topography in the pig retina is more similar to that in humans as it includes the cone rich, macula-like area centralis. The authors generated transgenic pigs expressing human disease-causing ELOVL4 mutations to better model the pathobiology of this macular disease. Pronuclear DNA microinjection and somatic cell nuclear transfer were used to produce transgenic pigs for two different ELOVL4 mutations: the 5 base pair deletion (5 bpdel) and the 270 stop mutation (Y270terEYFP). Retinal transgene expression, morphology and electrophysiology were examined. The authors obtained four lines of Y270terEYFP and one line of 5 bpdel transgenic animals. Direct fluorescence microscopy indicated that the Y270terEYFP protein is expressed in photoreceptors and mislocalised within the cell. Immunohistochemical examination of transgenic pigs showed photoreceptor loss and disorganised inner and outer segments. Electroretinography demonstrated diminished responses in both transgenic models. These transgenic pigs provide unique animal models for examining macular degeneration and STGD3 pathogenesis.

25285017	20141007	Tumor heterogeneity and resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy in advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer: challenges and perspectives.	Lung cancer, mostly nonsmall cell lung cancer, continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. With the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors that selectively target lung cancer-related epidermal growth factor receptor mutations, management of advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer has been greatly transformed. Improvements in progression-free survival and life quality of the patients were observed in numerous clinical studies. However, overall survival is not prolonged because of later-acquired drug resistance. Recent studies reveal a heterogeneous subclonal architecture of lung cancer, so it is speculated that the tumor may rapidly adapt to environmental changes via a Darwinian selection mechanism. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of both spatial and temporal tumor heterogeneity as potential mechanisms underlying epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in nonsmall cell lung cancer and summarize the possible origins of tumor heterogeneity covering theories of cancer stem cells and clonal evolution, as well as genomic instability and epigenetic aberrations in lung cancer. Moreover, investigational measures that overcome heterogeneity-associated drug resistance and new assays to improve tumor assessment are also discussed. 	Onco_Targets_Ther	D016428 D016454

27653836	20160923	Mislocalisation of BEST1 in iPSC-derived retinal pigment epithelial cells from a family with autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy (ADVIRC).	Autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy (ADVIRC) is a rare, early-onset retinal dystrophy characterised by distinct bands of circumferential pigmentary degeneration in the peripheral retina and developmental eye defects. ADVIRC is caused by mutations in the Bestrophin1 (BEST1) gene, which encodes a transmembrane protein thought to function as an ion channel in the basolateral membrane of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Previous studies suggest that the distinct ADVIRC phenotype results from alternative splicing of BEST1 pre-mRNA. Here, we have used induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to investigate the effects of an ADVIRC associated BEST1 mutation (c.704T?&gt;?C, p.V235A) in patient-derived iPSC-RPE. We found no evidence of alternate splicing of the BEST1 transcript in ADVIRC iPSC-RPE, however in patient-derived iPSC-RPE, BEST1 was expressed at the basolateral membrane and the apical membrane. During human eye development we show that BEST1 is expressed more abundantly in peripheral RPE compared to central RPE and is also expressed in cells of the developing retina. These results suggest that higher levels of mislocalised BEST1 expression in the periphery, from an early developmental stage, could provide a mechanism that leads to the distinct clinical phenotype observed in ADVIRC patients.

24869653	20140530	Anion receptors based on highly fluorinated aromatic scaffolds.	Mono-, di-, and tri-pentafluorobenzyl-substituted hexafluorobenzene (HFB) scaffolds, viz., R(I), R(II), and R(III) are proposed as promising receptors for molecules of chemical, biological, and environmental relevance, viz., N2, O3, H2O, H2O2, F(-), Cl(-), BF4(-), NO3(-), ClO(-), ClO2(-), ClO3(-), ClO4(-), and SO4(2-). The receptor-guest complexes modeled using M06L/6-311++G(d,p) DFT show a remarkable increase in the complexation energy (E(int)) with an increase in the number of fluorinated aromatic moieties in the receptor. Electron density analysis shows that fluorinated aromatic moieties facilitate the formation of large number of lone pair-? interactions around the guest molecule. The lone pair strength of the guest molecules quantified in terms of the absolute minimum (V(min)) of molecular electrostatic potential show that E(int) strongly depends on the electron deficient nature of the receptor as well as strength of lone pairs in the guest molecule. Compared to HFB, R(I) exhibits 1.1-2.5-fold, R(II) shows 1.6-3.6-fold, and the bowl-shaped R(III) gives 1.8-4.7-fold increase in the magnitude of E(int). For instance, in the cases of HFB???F(-), R(I)???F(-), R(II)???F(-), and R(III)???F(-) the E(int) values are -21.1, -33.7, -38.1, and -50.5 kcal/mol, respectively. The results strongly suggest that tuning lone pair-? interaction provides a powerful strategy to design receptors for small molecules and anions. 	J_Phys_Chem_A	D016428
22754710	20120704	Diesel exhaust exposure, wheezing and sneezing.	The rising incidence of allergic disorders in developed countries is unexplained. Exposure to traffic related air pollutants may be an important cause of wheezing and asthma in childhood. Experimental evidence from human studies suggests that diesel exhaust particles, constituents of fine particulate matter less than 2.5 microns (PM(2.5)), may act to enhance IgE mediated aeroallergen sensitization and Th2 directed cytokine responses. To date, epidemiologic investigations indicate that children living in close proximity to heavily travelled roads are more likely to be atopic and wheeze. The Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (CCAAPS) birth cohort study was initiated to test the hypothesis that early high exposure to traffic related air pollutants is associated with early aeroallergen sensitization and allergic respiratory phenotypes. Using an exposure cohort design, more than 700 infants born to atopic parents were recruited at age 1 living either less than 400 meters (high traffic pollutant exposure) or greater than 1,500 meters (low exposure) from a major road. Children were medically evaluated and underwent skin prick testing with aeroallergen at screening, and re-evaluated sequentially at ages 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7. In this study, both proximity and land use regression (LUR) models of traffic air pollutant exposure have been assessed. Proximity to stop and go traffic with large concentrations of bus and truck traffic predicted persistent wheezing during infancy. The LUR model estimated elemental carbon attributable to traffic (ECAT) as a proxy for diesel exhaust particulate exposure. High ECAT was significantly associated with wheezing at age 1 as well as persistent wheezing at age 3. High mold exposure predicted a well defined asthma phenotype at age 7.

26999129	20160322	A Novel Pretreatment-Free Duplex Chamber Digital PCR Detection System for the Absolute Quantitation of GMO Samples.	Digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has developed rapidly since it was first reported in the 1990s. However, pretreatments are often required during preparation for digital PCR, which can increase operation error. The single-plex amplification of both the target and reference genes may cause uncertainties due to the different reaction volumes and the matrix effect. In the current study, a quantitative detection system based on the pretreatment-free duplex chamber digital PCR was developed. The dynamic range, limit of quantitation (LOQ), sensitivity and specificity were evaluated taking the GA21 event as the experimental object. Moreover, to determine the factors that may influence the stability of the duplex system, we evaluated whether the pretreatments, the primary and secondary structures of the probes and the SNP effect influence the detection. The results showed that the LOQ was 0.5% and the sensitivity was 0.1%. We also found that genome digestion and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites affect the detection results, whereas the unspecific hybridization within different probes had little side effect. This indicated that the detection system was suited for both chamber-based and droplet-based digital PCR. In conclusion, we have provided a simple and flexible way of achieving absolute quantitation for genetically modified organism (GMO) genome samples using commercial digital PCR detection systems.

22659876	20120605	Duplex interrogation by a direct DNA repair protein in search of base damage.	ALKBH2 is a direct DNA repair dioxygenase guarding the mammalian genome against N(1)-methyladenine, N(3)-methylcytosine and 1,N(6)-ethenoadenine damage. A prerequisite for repair is to identify these lesions in the genome. Here we present crystal structures of human ALKBH2 bound to different duplex DNAs. Together with computational and biochemical analyses, our results suggest that DNA interrogation by ALKBH2 has two previously unknown features: (i) ALKBH2 probes base-pair stability and detects base pairs with reduced stability, and (ii) ALKBH2 does not have nor need a damage-checking site, which is critical for preventing spurious base cleavage for several glycosylases. The demethylation mechanism of ALKBH2 insures that only cognate lesions are oxidized and reversed to normal bases, and that a flipped, non-substrate base remains intact in the active site. Overall, the combination of duplex interrogation and oxidation chemistry allows ALKBH2 to detect and process diverse lesions efficiently and correctly. 	Nat._Struct._Mol._Biol.

20096102	20100126	Regulation of UGT1A1 and HNF1 transcription factor gene expression by DNA methylation in colon cancer cells.	UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) is a pivotal enzyme involved in metabolism of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan commonly used to treat metastatic colorectal cancer. We previously demonstrated aberrant methylation of specific CpG dinucleotides in UGT1A1-negative cells, and revealed that methylation state of the UGT1A1 5'-flanking sequence is negatively correlated with gene transcription. Interestingly, one of these CpG dinucleotides (CpG -4) is found close to a HNF1 response element (HRE), known to be involved in activation of UGT1A1 gene expression, and within an upstream stimulating factor (USF) binding site. Gel retardation assays revealed that methylation of CpG-4 directly affect the interaction of USF1/2 with its cognate sequence without altering the binding for HNF1-alpha. Luciferase assays sustained a role for USF1/2 and HNF1-alpha in UGT1A1 regulation in colon cancer cells. Based on the differential expression profiles of HNF1A gene in colon cell lines, we also assessed whether methylation affects its expression. In agreement with the presence of CpG islands in the HNF1A promoter, treatments of UGT1A1-negative HCT116 colon cancer cells with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor restore HNF1A gene expression, as observed for UGT1A1. This study reveals that basal UGT1A1 expression in colon cells is positively regulated by HNF1-alpha and USF, and negatively regulated by DNA methylation. Besides, DNA methylation of HNF1A could also play an important role in regulating additional cellular drug metabolism and transporter pathways. This process may contribute to determine local inactivation of drugs such as the anticancer agent SN-38 by glucuronidation and define tumoral response. 	BMC_Mol._Biol.	D016428 D013485
25382104	20141111	Identification of novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors for drug resistant T315I mutant BCR-ABL: a virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulations study.	BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase plays a major role in the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and is a proven target for drug development. Currently available drugs in the market are effective against CML; however, side-effects and drug-resistant mutations in BCR-ABL limit their full potential. Using high throughput virtual screening approach, we have screened several small molecule databases and docked against wild-type and drug resistant T315I mutant BCR-ABL. Drugs that are currently available, such as imatinib and ponatinib, were also docked against BCR-ABL protein to set a cutoff value for our screening. Selected lead compounds were further evaluated for chemical reactivity employing density functional theory approach, all selected ligands shows HLG value &gt; 0.09900 and the binding free energy between protein-ligand complex interactions obtained was rescored using MM-GBSA. The selected compounds showed least ?G score -71.53?KJ/mol to maximum -126.71?KJ/mol in both wild type and drug resistant T315I mutant BCR-ABL. Following which, the stability of the docking complexes were evaluated by molecular dynamics simulation (MD) using GROMACS4.5.5. Results uncovered seven lead molecules, designated with Drug-Bank and PubChem ids as DB07107, DB06977, ST013616, DB04200, ST007180 ST019342, and DB01172, which shows docking scores higher than imatinib and ponatinib.

20136084	20100209	Kinetics of the reactions of CH2Cl, CH3CHCl, and CH3CCl2 radicals with Cl2 in the temperature range 191-363 K.	The kinetics of three chlorinated free radical reactions with Cl(2) have been studied in direct time-resolved measurements. Radicals were produced in low initial concentrations by pulsed laser photolysis at 193 nm, and the subsequent decays of the radical concentrations were measured under pseudo-first-order conditions using photoionization mass spectrometer (PIMS). The bimolecular rate coefficients of the CH(3)CHCl + Cl(2) reaction obtained from the current measurements exhibit negative temperature dependence and can be expressed by the equation k(CH(3)CHCl + Cl(2)) = ((3.02 +/- 0.14) x 10(-12))(T/300 K)(-1.89+/-0.19) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) (1.7-5.4 Torr, 191-363 K). For the CH(3)CCl(2) + Cl(2) reaction the current results could be fitted with the equation k(CH(3)CCl(2) + Cl(2)) = ((1.23 +/- 0.02) x 10(-13))(T/300 K)(-0.26+/-0.10) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) (3.9-5.1 Torr, 240-363 K). The measured rate coefficients for the CH(2)Cl + Cl(2) reaction plotted as a function of temperature show a minimum at about T = 240 K: first decreasing with increasing temperature and then, above the limit, increasing with temperature. The determined reaction rate coefficients can be expressed as k(CH(2)Cl + Cl(2)) = ((2.11 +/- 1.29) x 10(-14)) exp(773 +/- 183 K/T)(T/300 K)(3.26+/-0.67) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) (4.0-5.6 Torr, 201-363 K). The rate coefficients for the CH(3)CCl(2) + Cl(2) and CH(2)Cl + Cl(2) reactions can be combined with previous results to obtain: k(combined)(CH(3)CCl(2) + Cl(2)) = ((4.72 +/- 1.66) x 10(-15)) exp(971 +/- 106 K/T)(T/300 K)(3.07+/-0.23) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) (3.1-7.4 Torr, 240-873 K) and k(combined)(CH(2)Cl + Cl(2)) = ((5.18 +/- 1.06) x 10(-14)) exp(525 +/- 63 K/T)(T/300 K)(2.52+/-0.13) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) (1.8-5.6 Torr, 201-873 K). All the uncertainties given refer only to the 1sigma statistical uncertainties obtained from the fitting, and the estimated overall uncertainty in the determined bimolecular rate coefficients is about +/-15%.

27331049	20160623	Imaging neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis using TSPO-PET.	Conventional MR imaging (MRI) techniques form the cornerstone of multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnostics and clinical follow-up today. MRI is sensitive in demonstrating focal inflammatory lesions and diffuse atrophy. However, especially in progressive MS, there is increasingly widespread diffuse pathology also outside the plaques, often related to microglial activation and neurodegeneration. This cannot be detected using conventional MRI. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) binding radioligands has recently shown promise as a tool to detect this diffuse pathology in vivo, and for the first time allows one to follow its development longitudinally. It is becoming evident that the more advanced the MS disease is, the more pronounced is microglial activation. PET imaging allows the detection of MS-related pathology at molecular level in vivo. It has potential to enable measurement of effects of new disease-modifying drugs aimed at reducing neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. PET imaging could thus be included in the design of future clinical trials of progressive MS. There are still technical issues related to the quality of TSPO radioligands and post-processing methodology, and comparison of studies from different PET centres is challenging. In this review, we summarise the main evidence supporting the use of TSPO-PET as a tool to explore the diffuse inflammation in MS. 	Clin_Transl_Imaging	D016454 D016428
27412236	20160715	Rescue of mitochondrial function in parkin-mutant fibroblasts using drug loaded PMPC-PDPA polymersomes and tubular polymersomes.	Mutations in parkin cause autosomal recessive Parkinsonism and mitochondrial defects. A recent drug screen identified a class of steroid-like hydrophobic compounds able to rescue mitochondrial function in parkin-mutant fibroblasts. Whilst these possess therapeutic potential, the size and high hydrophobicity of some may limit their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier from systemic circulation, something that could be improved by novel drug formulations. In the present study, the steroid-like compounds Ursolic Acid (UA) and Ursocholanic Acid (UCA) were successfully encapsulated within nanoscopic polymersomes formed by poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl phosphorylcholine)-poly(2-di-isopropylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PMPC-PDPA) and separated into spherical and tubular morphologies to assess the effects of nanoparticle mediated delivery on drug efficacy. Following incubation with either morphology, parkin-mutant fibroblasts demonstrated time and concentration dependent increases in intracellular ATP levels, resembling those resulting from treatment with nascent UA and UCA formulated in 0.1% DMSO, as used in the original drug screen. Empty PMPC-PDPA polymersomes did not alter physiological measures related to mitochondrial function or induce cytotoxicity. In combination with other techniques such as ligand functionalisation, PMPC-PDPA nanoparticles of well-defined morphology may prove a promising platform for tailoring the pharmacokinetic profile and organ specific bio-distribution of highly hydrophobic compounds.

19320971	20090327	AKT/eNOS signaling module functions as a potential feedback loop in the growth hormone signaling pathway.	While evidence suggested that the activity states of Protein kinase B (AKT/PKB) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) play an important role in the progression of the Growth Hormone (GH) signal cascade, the implication of the activation of AKT/PKB and eNOS in terms of their function in the signaling pathway was not clear. Using a specific AKT/PKB inhibitor and a functional proteomic approach, we were able to detect the activities of multiple signal transduction pathway elements, the downstream targets of the AKT/PKB pathway and the modification of those responses by treatment with GH. Inhibiting the AKT/PKB activity reduced or eliminated the activation (phosphorylation) of eNOS. We demonstrated that the progression of the GH signal cascade is influenced by the activity status of AKT and eNOS, wherein the suppression of AKT activity appears to augment the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (Erk1/2) and to antagonize the deactivation (phosphorylation) of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDC2/Cdk1) induced by GH. Phosphorylation of GSK3a/b (glycogen synthase kinase 3), the downstream target of AKT/PKB, was inhibited by the AKT/PKB inhibitor. GH did not increase phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1) in normal cells but increases phosphorylation of RSK1 in cells pre-treated with the AKT and eNOS inhibitors. The MAP kinase and CDC2 kinase-dependent intracellular mechanisms are involved in or are the targets of the GH's action processes, and these activities are probably directly or indirectly modulated by AKT/PKB pathways. We propose that the AKT/PKB-eNOS module likely functions as a negative feedback mediator of GH actions. 	J_Mol_Signal	D016428
25257319	20140927	Microglial pathology.	This paper summarizes pathological changes that affect microglial cells in the human brain during aging and in aging-related neurodegenerative diseases, primarily Alzheimer's disease (AD). It also provides examples of microglial changes that have been observed in laboratory animals during aging and in some experimentally induced lesions and disease models. Dissimilarities and similarities between humans and rodents are discussed in an attempt to generate a current understanding of microglial pathology and its significance during aging and in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer dementia (AD). The identification of dystrophic (senescent) microglia has created an ostensible conflict with prior work claiming a role for activated microglia and neuroinflammation during normal aging and in AD, and this has raised a basic question: does the brain's immune system become hyperactive (inflamed) or does it become weakened (senescent) in elderly and demented people, and what is the impact on neuronal function and cognition? Here we strive to reconcile these seemingly contradictory notions by arguing that both low-grade neuroinflammation and microglial senescence are the result of aging-associated free radical injury. Both processes are damaging for microglia as they synergistically exhaust this essential cell population to the point where the brain's immune system is effete and unable to support neuronal function.

26017636	20150529	Molecular architecture and function of the hemidesmosome.	Hemidesmosomes are multiprotein complexes that facilitate the stable adhesion of basal epithelial cells to the underlying basement membrane. The mechanical stability of hemidesmosomes relies on multiple interactions of a few protein components that form a membrane-embedded tightly-ordered complex. The core of this complex is provided by integrin ?6?4 and P1a, an isoform of the cytoskeletal linker protein plectin that is specifically associated with hemidesmosomes. Integrin ?6?4 binds to the extracellular matrix protein laminin-332, whereas P1a forms a bridge to the cytoplasmic keratin intermediate filament network. Other important components are BPAG1e, the epithelial isoform of bullous pemphigoid antigen 1, BPAG2, a collagen-type transmembrane protein and CD151. Inherited or acquired diseases in which essential components of the hemidesmosome are missing or structurally altered result in tissue fragility and blistering. Modulation of hemidesmosome function is of crucial importance for a variety of biological processes, such as terminal differentiation of basal keratinocytes and keratinocyte migration during wound healing and carcinoma invasion. Here, we review the molecular characteristics of the proteins that make up the hemidesmosome core structure and summarize the current knowledge about how their assembly and turnover are regulated by transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms.

16890469	20060808	Engineering a beta-carotene ketolase for astaxanthin production.	A new beta-carotene ketolase gene (crtW) was cloned from an environmental isolate Sphingomonas sp. DC18. A robust and reliable color screen was developed for protein engineering to improve its activity on hydroxylated carotenoids for astaxanthin production. Localized random mutagenesis was performed on the crtW gene including the upstream ribosomal binding site (RBS). Six mutations (H96L, R203W, A205V, A208V, F213L and A215T) in the crtW gene were isolated multiple times that showed improved astaxanthin production. These mutations were localized near the conserved histidine motifs, which were proposed for binding iron required for enzymatic activity. Combination of two of the mutations (R203W/F213L) further improved astaxanthin production. One mutation at the RBS (a438t) was shown to have additional effect on improving astaxanthin production. Most of the mutants still retained high activity on beta-carotene, however, the F213L single mutant and the R203W/F213L double mutant that yielded the highest improvement for astaxanthin production showed decreased activity for canthaxanthin production.

27694977	20161004	Modification of plant cell wall structure accompanied by enhancement of saccharification efficiency using a chemical, lasalocid sodium.	The cell wall is one major determinant of plant cell morphology, and is an attractive bioresource. Here, we report a novel strategy to modify plant cell wall property by small molecules. Lasalocid sodium (LS) was isolated by chemical screening to identify molecules that affect the cell morphology of tobacco BY-2 cells. LS treatment led to an increase in cell wall thickness, whilst the quantity and sugar composition of the cell wall remained unchanged in BY-2 cells. The chemical also disordered the cellular arrangement of hypocotyls of Arabidopsis plants, resulting in a decrease in hypocotyl length. LS treatment enhanced enzymatic saccharification efficiency in both BY-2 cells and Arabidopsis plants. Microarray analysis on Arabidopsis showed that exposure to LS upregulated type III peroxidase genes, of which some are involved in lignin biogenesis, and jasmonic acid response genes, and phloroglucinol staining supported the activation of lignification by the LS treatment. As jasmonic acid-mediated lignification is a typical reaction to cell wall damage, it is possible that LS induces cell wall loosening, which can trigger cell wall damage response. Thus, LS is a unique chemical for modification of cell wall and morphology through changes in cell wall architecture. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
27357839	20160701	KinMutRF: a random forest classifier of sequence variants in the human protein kinase superfamily.	The association between aberrant signal processing by protein kinases and human diseases such as cancer was established long time ago. However, understanding the link between sequence variants in the protein kinase superfamily and the mechanistic complex traits at the molecular level remains challenging: cells tolerate most genomic alterations and only a minor fraction disrupt molecular function sufficiently and drive disease. KinMutRF is a novel random-forest method to automatically identify pathogenic variants in human kinases. Twenty six decision trees implemented as a random forest ponder a battery of features that characterize the variants: a) at the gene level, including membership to a Kinbase group and Gene Ontology terms; b) at the PFAM domain level; and c) at the residue level, the types of amino acids involved, changes in biochemical properties, functional annotations from UniProt, Phospho.ELM and FireDB. KinMutRF identifies disease-associated variants satisfactorily (Acc: 0.88, Prec:0.82, Rec:0.75, F-score:0.78, MCC:0.68) when trained and cross-validated with the 3689 human kinase variants from UniProt that have been annotated as neutral or pathogenic. All unclassified variants were excluded from the training set. Furthermore, KinMutRF is discussed with respect to two independent kinase-specific sets of mutations no included in the training and testing, Kin-Driver (643 variants) and Pon-BTK (1495 variants). Moreover, we provide predictions for the 848 protein kinase variants in UniProt that remained unclassified. A public implementation of KinMutRF, including documentation and examples, is available online ( http://kinmut2.bioinfo.cnio.es ). The source code for local installation is released under a GPL version 3 license, and can be downloaded from https://github.com/Rbbt-Workflows/KinMut2 . KinMutRF is capable of classifying kinase variation with good performance. Predictions by KinMutRF compare favorably in a benchmark with other state-of-the-art methods (i.e. SIFT, Polyphen-2, MutationAssesor, MutationTaster, LRT, CADD, FATHMM, and VEST). Kinase-specific features rank as the most elucidatory in terms of information gain and are likely the improvement in prediction performance. This advocates for the development of family-specific classifiers able to exploit the discriminatory power of features unique to individual protein families. 	BMC_Genomics	D016428 D013485
27240352	20160531	Structural Characterization of Heme Environmental Mutants of CgHmuT that Shuttles Heme Molecules to Heme Transporters.	Corynebacteria contain a heme uptake system encoded in hmuTUV genes, in which HmuT protein acts as a heme binding protein to transport heme to the cognate transporter HmuUV. The crystal structure of HmuT from Corynebacterium glutamicum (CgHmuT) reveals that heme is accommodated in the central cleft with His141 and Tyr240 as the axial ligands and that Tyr240 forms a hydrogen bond with Arg242. In this work, the crystal structures of H141A, Y240A, and R242A mutants were determined to understand the role of these residues for the heme binding of CgHmuT. Overall and heme environmental structures of these mutants were similar to those of the wild type, suggesting that there is little conformational change in the heme-binding cleft during heme transport reaction with binding and the dissociation of heme. A loss of one axial ligand or the hydrogen bonding interaction with Tyr240 resulted in an increase in the redox potential of the heme for CgHmuT to be reduced by dithionite, though the wild type was not reduced under physiological conditions. These results suggest that the heme environmental structure stabilizes the ferric heme binding in CgHmuT, which will be responsible for efficient heme uptake under aerobic conditions where Corynebacteria grow.

19910179	20091114	Two novel mutations in surfactant protein-C, lung function and obstructive lung disease.	Dominant mutations in the surfactant protein-C(SFTPC) gene have been linked with interstitial lung disease. The frequency of lung disease due to SFTPC mutations in the general population is unknown. The aim of this study was to identify novel SFTPC mutations that are associated with lung function or disease in the general population. We resequenced the SFTPC gene in 760 individuals and identified 18 genetic variants, of which 5 were novel. Of the five novel mutations, two were situated in highly conserved areas of the SFTPC gene: A53T and Y106X. We genotyped the Copenhagen City Heart Study(n=10,604) and the Copenhagen General Population Study(n=37,337) to assess the clinical relevance of these mutations. Genotyping identified 36 individuals heterozygous for A53T and 3 individuals heterozygous for Y106X. A53T heterozygotes and Y106X heterozygotes did not differ from non-carriers in FEV(1)% predicted, FVC% predicted or FEV(1)/FVC. A53T heterozygotes had a two-fold increased risk for asthma in the Copenhagen City Heart Study and Copenhagen General Population Study combined (adjusted odds ratio 2.2(1.0-4.9)). A53T heterozygotes did not differ consistently from non-carriers in risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or interstitial lung disease. No Y106X heterozygotes suffered from asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or interstitial lung disease. We identified two novel mutations in highly conserved areas of the SFTPC gene, and show that heterozygotes for the mutations have normal lung function and are unaffected by COPD and interstitial lung disease. A53T heterozygotes had increased asthma risk, but further research is required to conclusively determine whether this mutation is associated with asthma. 	Respir_Med	D016428 D013485

26085992	20150619	Novel CYP4V2 mutations associated with Bietti crystalline corneoretinal dystrophy in Chinese patients.	To analyze the CYP4V2 mutations in five unrelated Chinese patients with Bietti crystalline corneoretinal dystrophy (BCD) and to provide clinical features of these patients. BCD is a rare monogenic autosomal recessively inherited disorder characterized by the presence of crystals in the retina and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy. Mutations in the CYP4V2 gene have been found to be causative for BCD. Ophthalmic examinations were carried out in the affected individuals. Peripheral blood samples were collected and genomic DNA was extracted. All exons and flanking intronic regions of the CYP4V2 gene were amplified with polymerase chain reaction and screened for mutations by direct DNA sequencing. One hundred control chromosomes were also screened to exclude nonpathogenic polymorphisms. Fundus examination revealed the presence of tiny yellowish-sparkling crystals at the posterior pole of the fundus and atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium in all patients. Choroid neovascularization was noted in one patient. Five different CYP4V2 mutations were identified, including two missense mutations (p.F73L, p.R400H), two splice site mutations (c.802-8_810del17insGC, c.1091-2A&gt;G), and one single base-pair deletion (p.T479TfsX7 or c.1437delC). The two splice site mutations were identified in three of the patients with BCD. Mutation p.T479TfsX7 was a novel mutation not observed in any of 100 ethnically matched control chromosomes. Mutation c.802-8_810del17insGC and c.1091-2A&gt;G are common mutations in Chinese patients with BCD. Our results expand the allelic heterogeneity of BCD. 	Int_J_Ophthalmol	D016428
25742478	20150306	Cancer spectrum and frequency among children with Noonan, Costello, and cardio-facio-cutaneous syndromes.	Somatic mutations affecting components of the Ras-MAPK pathway are a common feature of cancer, whereas germline Ras pathway mutations cause developmental disorders including Noonan, Costello, and cardio-facio-cutaneous syndromes. These 'RASopathies' also represent cancer-prone syndromes, but the quantitative cancer risks remain unknown. We investigated the occurrence of childhood cancer including benign and malignant tumours of the central nervous system in a group of 735 individuals with germline mutations in Ras signalling pathway genes by matching their information with the German Childhood Cancer Registry. We observed 12 cases of cancer in the entire RASopathy cohort vs 1.12 expected (based on German population-based incidence rates). This corresponds to a 10.5-fold increased risk of all childhood cancers combined (standardised incidence ratio (SIR)=10.5, 95% confidence interval=5.4-18.3). The specific cancers included juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia=4; brain tumour=3; acute lymphoblastic leukaemia=2; rhabdomyosarcoma=2; and neuroblastoma=1. The childhood cancer SIR in Noonan syndrome patients was 8.1, whereas that for Costello syndrome patients was 42.4. These data comprise the first quantitative evidence documenting that the germline mutations in Ras signalling pathway genes are associated with increased risks of both childhood leukaemia and solid tumours.

18392553	20080409	Identification of 13 novel mutations including a retrotransposal insertion in SLC25A13 gene and frequency of 30 mutations found in patients with citrin deficiency.	Deficiency of citrin, liver-type mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carrier, is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of the SLC25A13 gene on chromosome 7q21.3 and has two phenotypes: neonatal intrahepatic cholestatic hepatitis (NICCD) and adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). So far, we have described 19 SLC25A13 mutations. Here, we report 13 novel SLC25A13 mutations (one insertion, two deletion, three splice site, two nonsense, and five missense) in patients with citrin deficiency from Japan, Israel, UK, and Czech Republic. Only R360X was detected in both Japanese and Caucasian. IVS16ins3kb identified in a Japanese CTLN2 family seems to be a retrotransposal insertion, as the inserted sequence (2,667-nt) showed an antisense strand of processed complementary DNA (cDNA) from a gene on chromosome 6 (C6orf68), and the repetitive sequence (17-nt) derived from SLC25A13 was found at both ends of the insert. All together, 30 different mutations found in 334 Japanese, 47 Chinese, 11 Korean, four Vietnamese and seven non-East Asian families have been summarized. In Japan, IVS16ins3kb was relatively frequent in 22 families, in addition to known mutations IVS11 + 1G &gt; A, 851del4, IVS13 + 1G &gt; A, and S225X in 189, 173, 48 and 30 families, respectively; 851del4 and IVS16ins3kb were found in all East Asian patients tested, suggesting that these mutations may have occurred very early in some area of East Asia.

26934978	20160304	Development of a stable ERroGFP variant suitable for monitoring redox dynamics in the ER.	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential organelle for cellular metabolic homeostasis including folding and maturation of secretory and membrane proteins. Disruption of ER proteostasis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases such as diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. The ER redox state, which is an oxidative environment suitable for disulfide-bond formation, is essential for ER protein quality control. Hence, detection of the ER redox state, especially in living cells, is essential to understand the mechanism by which the redox state of the ER is maintained. However, methods to detect the redox state of the ER have not been well-established because of inefficient folding and stability of roGFP variants with oxidative redox potential like roGFP-iL. Here we have improved the folding efficiency of ER-targeted roGFP-iL (ERroGFP-iL) in cells by introducing superfolder GFP (sfGFP) mutations. Four specific amino acid substitutions (S30R, Y39N, T105N and I171V) greatly improved folding efficiency in Escherichia coli and in the ER of HeLa cells, as well as the thermostability of the purified proteins. Introduction of these mutations also enhanced the dynamic range for redox change both in?vitro and in the ER of living cells. ER-targeted roGFP-S4 (ERroGFP-S4) possessing these four mutations could detect physiological redox changes within the ER. ERroGFP-S4 is therefore a novel probe suitable for monitoring redox change in the ER. ERroGFP-S4 can be applied to detect aberrant ER redox states associated with various pathological conditions and to identify the mechanisms used to maintain the redox state of the ER. 	Biosci._Rep.

25310460	20141014	Anisotropic covalency contributions to superexchange pathways in type one copper active sites.	Type one (T1) Cu sites deliver electrons to catalytic Cu active sites: the mononuclear type two (T2) Cu site in nitrite reductases (NiRs) and the trinuclear Cu cluster in the multicopper oxidases (MCOs). The T1 Cu and the remote catalytic sites are connected via a Cys-His intramolecular electron-transfer (ET) bridge, which contains two potential ET pathways: P1 through the protein backbone and P2 through the H-bond between the Cys and the His. The high covalency of the T1 Cu-S(Cys) bond is shown here to activate the T1 Cu site for hole superexchange via occupied valence orbitals of the bridge. This covalency-activated electronic coupling (H(DA)) facilitates long-range ET through both pathways. These pathways can be selectively activated depending on the geometric and electronic structure of the T1 Cu site and thus the anisotropic covalency of the T1 Cu-S(Cys) bond. In NiRs, blue (?-type) T1 sites utilize P1 and green (?-type) T1 sites utilize P2, with P2 being more efficient. Comparing the MCOs to NiRs, the second-sphere environment changes the conformation of the Cys-His pathway, which selectively activates HDA for superexchange by blue ? sites for efficient turnover in catalysis. These studies show that a given protein bridge, here Cys-His, provides different superexchange pathways and electronic couplings depending on the anisotropic covalencies of the donor and acceptor metal sites.

21506741	20110422	A common MUC5B promoter polymorphism and pulmonary fibrosis.	The mutations that have been implicated in pulmonary fibrosis account for only a small proportion of the population risk. Using a genomewide linkage scan, we detected linkage between idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and a 3.4-Mb region of chromosome 11p15 in 82 families. We then evaluated genetic variation in this region in gel-forming mucin genes expressed in the lung among 83 subjects with familial interstitial pneumonia, 492 subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and 322 controls. MUC5B expression was assessed in lung tissue. Linkage and fine mapping were used to identify a region of interest on the p-terminus of chromosome 11 that included gel-forming mucin genes. The minor-allele of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs35705950, located 3 kb upstream of the MUC5B transcription start site, was present at a frequency of 34% among subjects with familial interstitial pneumonia, 38% among subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and 9% among controls (allelic association with familial interstitial pneumonia, P=1.2?10(-15); allelic association with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, P=2.5?10(-37)). The odds ratios for disease among subjects who were heterozygous and those who were homozygous for the minor allele of this SNP were 6.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9 to 12.0) and 20.8 (95% CI, 3.8 to 113.7), respectively, for familial interstitial pneumonia and 9.0 (95% CI, 6.2 to 13.1) and 21.8 (95% CI, 5.1 to 93.5), respectively, for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. MUC5B expression in the lung was 14.1 times as high in subjects who had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as in those who did not (P&lt;0.001). The variant allele of rs35705950 was associated with up-regulation in MUC5B expression in the lung in unaffected subjects (expression was 37.4 times as high as in unaffected subjects homozygous for the wild-type allele, P&lt;0.001). MUC5B protein was expressed in lesions of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. A common polymorphism in the promoter of MUC5B is associated with familial interstitial pneumonia and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Our findings suggest that dysregulated MUC5B expression in the lung may be involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and others.).

15236414	20040706	POMGnT1 gene alterations in a family with neurological abnormalities.	Muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB), is caused by mutations in the POMGnT1 gene. We describe a white family with two siblings affected with congenital hypotonia early-onset glaucoma, and psychomotor delays. Brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) showed hydrocephalus, bilateral frontal polymicrogyria, abnormal cerebellum, and characteristic flattened dystrophic pons. We identified novel POMGnT1 gene alterations in this family. Both affected siblings were found to be compound hetrozygotes and carried two missense changes inherited from their mother and one missense change (p.R442C) inherited from their father. Our findings further define the phenotypic spectrum of MEB and its occurrence in the US population. 	Ann._Neurol.	D016428
27806098	20161103	Soil Salt Distribution and Tomato Response to Saline Water Irrigation under Straw Mulching.	To investigate better saline water irrigation scheme for tomatoes that scheduling with the compromise among yield (Yt), quality, irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) and soil salt residual, an experiment with three irrigation quotas and three salinities of irrigation water was conducted under straw mulching in northern China. The irrigation quota levels were 280 mm (W1), 320 mm (W2) and 360 mm (W3), and the salinity levels were 1.0 dS/m (F), 3.0 dS/m (S1) and 5.0 dS/m (S2). Compared to freshwater, saline water irrigations decreased the maximum leaf area index (LAIm) of tomatoes, and the LAIm presented a decline tendency with higher salinity and lower irrigation quota. The best overall quality of tomato was obtained by S2W1, with the comprehensive quality index of 3.61. A higher salinity and lower irrigation quota resulted in a decrease of individual fruit weight and an increase of the blossom-end rot incidence, finally led to a reduction in the tomato Yt and marketable yield (Ym). After one growth season of tomato, the mass fraction of soil salt in plough layer under S2W1 treatment was the highest, and which presented a decline trend with an increasing irrigation quota. Moreover, compared to W1, soil salts had a tendency to move to the deeper soil layer when using W2 and W3 irrigation quota. According to the calculation results of projection pursuit model, S1W3 was the optimal treatment that possessed the best comprehensive benefit (tomato overall quality, Yt, Ym, IWUE and soil salt residual), and was recommended as the saline water irrigation scheme for tomatoes in northern China.

26892980	20160220	Genetic variation frequencies in Wilms' tumor: A meta-analysis and systematic review.	Over the last few decades, numerous biomarkers in Wilms' tumor have been confirmed and shown variations in prevalence. Most of these studies were based on small sample sizes. We carried out a meta-analysis of the research published from 1992 to 2015 to obtain more precise and comprehensive outcomes for genetic tests. In the present study, 70 out of 5175 published reports were eligible for the meta-analysis, which was carried out using Stata 12.0 software. Pooled prevalence for gene mutations WT1, WTX, CTNNB1, TP53, MYCN, DROSHA, and DGCR8 was 0.141 (0.104, 0.178), 0.147 (0.110, 0.184), 0.140 (0.100, 0.190), 0.410 (0.214, 0.605), 0.071 (0.041, 0.100), 0.082 (0.048, 0.116), and 0.036 (0.026, 0.046), respectively. Pooled prevalence of loss of heterozygosity at 1p, 11p, 11q, 16q, and 22q was 0.109 (0.084, 0.133), 0.334 (0.295, 0.373), 0.199 (0.146, 0.252), 0.151 (0.129, 0.172), and 0.148 (0.108, 0.189), respectively. Pooled prevalence of 1q and chromosome 12 gain was 0.218 (0.161, 0.275) and 0.273 (0.195, 0.350), respectively. The limited prevalence of currently known genetic alterations in Wilms' tumors indicates that significant drivers of initiation and progression remain to be discovered. Subgroup analyses indicated that ethnicity may be one of the sources of heterogeneity. However, in meta-regression analyses, no study-level characteristics of indicators were found to be significant. In addition, the findings of our sensitivity analysis and possible publication bias remind us to interpret results with caution. 	Cancer_Sci.	D016428 D017418 D016454
11175302	20010215	Relative fitness of carriers of the mitochondrial DNA mutation 3243A &gt; G.	Deleterious point mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been found in many human populations and always at a low frequency suggesting that they are under strong negative selection. It is assumed that this selection is caused by reduced genetic fitness of mutation carriers, but the fitness of carriers of any mtDNA mutation has not been determined. We estimated the reproductive disadvantage caused by the mitochondrial DNA mutation 3243A &gt; G in a population-based group of female carriers (n = 32). The person-years method, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and population statistics were used to estimate net reproduction rates of the mutation carriers and the general population. We found that women with 3243A &gt; G reproduced at the same rate as women in the general population, suggesting that on average host-level selection against women harbouring the 3243A &gt; G mutation is not strong.

20172480	20100223	Clinical differences between patients with MODY-3, MODY-2 and type 2 diabetes mellitus with I27L polymorphism in the HNF1alpha gene.	The aim of our study was to describe and evaluate the clinical and metabolic characteristics of patients with MODY-3, MODY-2 or type 2 diabetes who presented I27L polymorphism in the HNF1alpha gene. The study included 31 previously diagnosed subjects under follow-up for MODY-3 (10 subjects from 5 families), MODY-2 (15 subjects from 9 families), or type 2 diabetes (6 subjects) with I27L polymorphism in the HNF1alpha gene. The demographic, clinical, metabolic, and genetic characteristics of all patients were analyzed. No differences were observed in distribution according to sex, age of onset, or form of diagnosis. All patients with MODY-2 or MODY-3 had a family history of diabetes. In contrast, 33.3% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and I27L polymorphism in the HNF1alpha gene had no family history of diabetes (p &lt; 0.05). No differences were observed in body mass index, prevalence of hypertension, or microvascular or macrovascular complications. Drug therapy was required by 100% of MODY-3 patients, but not required by 100% of MODY-2 patients or 16.7% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and I27L polymorphism in the HNF1alpha gene (p &lt; 0.05). Occasional difficulties may be encountered when classifying patients with MODY-2, MODY-3 or type 2 diabetes of atypical characteristics, in this case patients who present I27L polymorphism in the HNF1alpha gene.

23137336	20121110	Rational design, synthesis, evaluation and enzyme-substrate structures of improved fluorogenic substrates for family 6 glycoside hydrolases.	Methylumbelliferyl-?-cellobioside (MUF-G2) is a convenient fluorogenic substrate for certain ?-glycoside hydrolases (GH). However, hydrolysis of the aglycone is poor with GH family 6 enzymes (GH6), despite strong binding. Prediction of the orientation of the aglycone of MUF-G2 in the +1 subsite of Hypocrea jecorina Cel6A by automated docking suggested umbelliferyl modifications at C4 and C6 for improved recognition. Four modified umbelliferyl-?-cellobiosides [6-chloro-4-methyl- (ClMUF); 6-chloro-4-trifluoromethyl- (ClF3MUF); 4-phenyl- (PhUF); 6-chloro-4-phenyl- (ClPhUF)] were synthesized and tested with GH6, GH7, GH9, GH5 and GH45 cellulases. Indeed the rate of aglycone release by H. jecorina Cel6A was 10-150 times higher than with MUF-G2, although it was still three orders of magnitude lower than with H. jecorina Cel7B. The 4-phenyl substitution drastically reduced the fluorescence intensity of the free aglycone, while ClMUF-G2 could be used for determination of k(cat) and K(M) for H. jecorina Cel6A and Thermobifida fusca Cel6A. Crystal structures of H. jecorina Cel6A D221A mutant soaked with the MUF-, ClMUF- and ClPhUF-?-cellobioside substrates show that the modifications turned the umbelliferyl group 'upside down', with the glycosidic bond better positioned for protonation than with MUF-G2.

17012384	20061003	The plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M protein-related protein Prp binds plasminogen via arginine and histidine residues.	The migration of the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) from localized to deep tissue sites may result in severe invasive disease, and sequestration of the host zymogen plasminogen appears crucial for virulence. Here, we describe a novel plasminogen-binding M protein, the plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M protein (PAM)-related protein (Prp). Prp is phylogenetically distinct from previously described plasminogen-binding M proteins of group A, C, and G streptococci. While competition experiments indicate that Prp binds plasminogen with a lower affinity than PAM (50% effective concentration = 0.34 microM), Prp nonetheless binds plasminogen with high affinity and at physiologically relevant concentrations of plasminogen (K(d) = 7.8 nM). Site-directed mutagenesis of the putative plasminogen binding site indicates that unlike the majority of plasminogen receptors, Prp does not interact with plasminogen exclusively via lysine residues. Mutagenesis to alanine of lysine residues Lys(96) and Lys(101) reduced but did not abrogate plasminogen binding by Prp. Plasminogen binding was abolished only with the additional mutagenesis of Arg(107) and His(108) to alanine. Furthermore, mutagenesis of Arg(107) and His(108) abolished plasminogen binding by Prp despite the presence of Lys(96) and Lys(101) in the binding site. Thus, binding to plasminogen via arginine and histidine residues appears to be a conserved mechanism among plasminogen-binding M proteins. 	J._Bacteriol.	D016428 D013485

19706162	20090827	Impairment of insulin-stimulated Akt/GLUT4 signaling is associated with cardiac contractile dysfunction and aggravates I/R injury in STZ-diabetic rats.	In this study, we established systemic in-vivo evidence from molecular to organism level to explain how diabetes can aggravate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and revealed the role of insulin signaling (with specific focus on Akt/GLUT4 signaling molecules). The myocardial I/R injury was induced by the left main coronary artery occlusion for 1 hr and then 3 hr reperfusion in control, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced insulinopenic diabetes, and insulin-treated diabetic rats. The diabetic rats showed a significant decrease in heart rate, and a prolonged isovolumic relaxation (tau) which lead to decrease in cardiac output (CO) without changing total peripheral resistance (TPR). The phosphorylated Akt and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT 4) protein levels were dramatically reduced in both I/R and non-I/R diabetic rat hearts. Insulin treatment in diabetes showed improvement of contractile function as well as partially increased Akt phosphorylation and GLUT 4 protein levels. In the animals subjected to I/R, the mortality rates were 25%, 65%, and 33% in the control, diabetic, and insulin-treated diabetic group respectively. The I/R-induced arrhythmias and myocardial infarction did not differ significantly between the control and the diabetic groups. Consistent with its anti-hyperglycemic effects, insulin significantly reduced I/R-induced arrhythmias but had no effect on I/R-induced infarctions. Diabetic rat with I/R exhibited the worse hemodynamic outcome, which included systolic and diastolic dysfunctions. Insulin treatment only partially improved diastolic functions and elevated P-Akt and GLUT 4 protein levels. Our results indicate that cardiac contractile dysfunction caused by a defect in insulin-stimulated Akt/GLUT4 may be a major reason for the high mortality rate in I/R injured diabetic rats.

19440513	20090515	Molecular mechanisms of inherited arrhythmias.	Inherited arrhythmias and conduction system diseases are known causes of sudden cardiac death and are responsible for significant mortality and morbidity in patients with congenital heart disease and electrical disorders. Knowledge derived from human genetics and studies in animal models have led to the discovery of multiple molecular defects responsible for arrhythmogenesis. This review summarizes the molecular basis of inherited arrhythmias in structurally normal and altered hearts.On the cellular and molecular levels, minor disturbances can provoke severe arrhythmias. Ion channels are responsible for the initiation and propagation of the action potential within the cardiomyocyte. Structural heart diseases, such as hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathies, increase the likelihood of cardiac electrical abnormalities. Ion channels can also be up- or down-regulated in congenital heart disease, altering action potential cellular properties and therefore triggering arrhythmias. Conduction velocities may be inhomogeneously altered if connexin function, density or distribution changes. Another important group of electrophysiologic diseases is the heterogeneous category of inherited arrhythmias in the structurally normal heart, with a propensity to sudden cardiac death. There have been many recent relevant discoveries that help explain the molecular and functional mechanisms of long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and other electrical myopathies. Identification of molecular pathways allows the identification of new therapeutic targets, for both disease palliation and cure. As more disease-causing mutations are identified and genotypic-phenotypic correlation is defined, families can be screened prior to symptom-onset and patients may potentially be treated in a genotype-specific manner, opening the doors of cardiac electrophysiology to the emerging field of pharmacogenomics.

27062340	20160411	Mutational spectrum and risk stratification of intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia patients based on next-generation sequencing.	Intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia (IR-AML), which accounts for a substantial number of AML cases, is highly heterogeneous. Although several mutations have been identified, the heterogeneity of AML is uncertain because novel mutations have yet to be discovered. Here we applied next generation sequencing (NGS) platform to screen mutational hotspots in 410 genes relevant to hematological malignancy. IR-AML samples (N=95) were sequenced by Illumina Hiseq and mutations in 101 genes were identified. Only seven genes (CEBPA, NPM1, DNMT3A, FLT3-ITD, NRAS, IDH2 and WT1) were mutated in more than 10% of patients. Genetic interaction analysis identified several cooperative and exclusive patterns of overlapping mutations. Mutational analysis indicated some correlation between genotype and phenotype. FLT3-ITD mutations were identified as independent factors of poor prognosis, while CEBPA mutations were independent favorable factors. Co-occurrence of FLT3-ITD, NPM1 and DNMT3A mutations was identified with associated with specific clinical AML features and poor outcomes. Furthermore, by integrating multiple mutations in the survival analysis, 95 IR-AML patients could be stratified into three distinct risk groups allowing reductions in IR-AML by one-third. Our study offers deep insights into the molecular pathogenesis and biology of AML and indicated that the prognosis of IR-AML could be further stratified by different mutation combinations which may direct future treatment intervention.

26413493	20150929	Effects of CoQ10 Supplementation on Lipid Profiles and Glycemic Control in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial.	Low grade inflammation and oxidative stress are the key factors in the pathogenesis and development of diabetes and its complications. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is known as an antioxidant and has a vital role in generation of cellular energy providing. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of CoQ10 supplementation on lipid profiles and glycemic controls in patients with diabetes. Fifty patients with diabetes were randomly allocated into two groups to receive either 150?mg CoQ10 or placebo daily for 12?weeks. Before and after supplementation, fasting venous blood samples were collected and lipid profiles containing triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and glycemic indices comprising of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) were measured. Insulin resistance was calculated using HOMA-IR index. Forty patients completed the study. After intervention FPG and HbA1C were significantly lower in the CoQ10 group compared to the placebo group, but there were no significant differences in serum insulin and HOMA-IR between the two groups. Although total cholesterol did not change in the Q10 group after supplementation, triglyceride and HDL-C significantly decreased and LDL-C significantly increased in the CoQ10 group. The present study showed that treatment with Q10 may improve glycemic control with no favorable effects on lipid profiles in type 2 patients with diabetes. IRCT registry number: IRCT138806102394N1.

19016916	20081120	Rapid real-time PCR assay for detection of MPL W515L mutation in patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders.	Clinical diagnosis of the myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) has previously been based on clinical data and bone marrow morphology due to lack of specific molecular markers. The discovery of JAK2 V617F mutation has shed light on understanding of the molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of the myeloproliferative disorders. The thrombopoietin receptor gene (MPL) is expressed in megakaryocytes and exhibits the gain of function point mutation in approximately 5% of MPDs. Several research groups have used real-time PCR to detect and quantify the presence of JAK2 V617F mutation. We report here a highly specific real-time assay based on the TaqMan((R)) technology to detect the MPL W515L mutation with high sensitivity from the patient's blood. This assay can be easily performed together with the JAK2 V617F mutation assay on the same real-time PCR reaction plate. 	Int_J_Lab_Hematol	D016428
28036027	20161231	The Phosphorylation of PDX-1 by Protein Kinase CK2 Is Crucial for Its Stability.	The homeodomain protein PDX-1 is a critical regulator of pancreatic development and insulin production in pancreatic ?-cells. We have recently shown that PDX-1 is a substrate of protein kinase CK2; a multifunctional protein kinase which is implicated in the regulation of various cellular aspects, such as differentiation, proliferation, and survival. The CK2 phosphorylation site of PDX-1 is located within the binding region of the E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor protein PCIF1. To study the interaction between PDX-1 and PCIF1 we used immunofluorescence analysis, co-immunoprecipitation, GST-pull-down studies, and proximity ligation assay (PLA). For the analysis of the stability of PDX-1 we performed a cycloheximide chase. We used PDX-1 in its wild-type form as well as phosphomutants of the CK2 phosphorylation site. In pancreatic ?-cells PDX-1 binds to PCIF1. The phosphorylation of PDX-1 by CK2 increases the ratio of PCIF1 bound to PDX-1. The stability of PDX-1 is extended in the absence of CK2 phosphorylation. Our results identified protein kinase CK2 as new important modulator of the stability of PDX-1. 	Pharmaceuticals_(Basel)	D016428
26938431	20160304	Association Studies Between XRCC1, XRCC2, XRCC3 Polymorphisms and Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma.	DNA HRR pathway and BER pathway play vital roles in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) development, thus we supposed that polymorphisms of XRCC1, XRCC2, XRCC3 DNA repair genes are associated with thyroid cancer risk and progression. We searched the NCBI database for relevant literatures to determine eight SNPs to be included in our study (XRCC1: rs25487, rs25489, rs1799782; XRCC2: rs3218536; XRCC3: rs1799794, rs56377012, rs1799796, rs861539). SNP of rs25487 was linked with a 53% decrease in DTC risk (OR: 0.47; 95%CI: 0.268-0.82; P = 0.01). For SNP of rs1799782, the homozygous TT genotype indicated a statistically significant 2-fold increased risk of DTC (OR: 2.09; 95%CI: 1.27-3.43; P &lt; 0.001) after multivariate adjustment. For SNP of rs861539, the homozygous TT genotype suggested statistically significant 3-fold increased risk of DTC (OR: 3.02; 95%CI: 1.68-5.42; P &lt; 0.001). No significant association between the other five SNPs and DTC risk. Besides that, female was linked with 47% increase in DTC risk (OR: 1.47; 95%CI: 1.062-2.04; P = 0.02) after multivariate adjustment. Similar results for most of the SNPs were obtained from subgroup analysis by different histological types of DTC. Haplotype analysis revealed that AGC and GGT haplotypes of XRCC1 polymorphisms were associated with DTC. Moreover, results from gene-gene interaction showed that XRCC1-rs25487, XRCC1- rs1799782 and XRCC3- rs861539 variants jointly contributed to a specifically increased risk of DTC, with the combination variant of rs1799782-CT heterozygote and rs861539-TT homozygote exhibiting a higher 3.66-fold risk of DTC (OR: 3.66; 95% CI: 1.476-9.091, P = 0.005). Polymorphisms of XRCC1 (rs25487, rs1799782) and XRCC3 (rs861539), may play a critical role in DTC development and progression. Furthermore, XRCC1 variant can interact with XRCC3 variant to significantly increase DTC susceptibility. Identifying these genetic risk markers could provide evidence for exploring the insight pathogenesis and develop novel therapeutic strategies for DTC. 	Cell._Physiol._Biochem.	D016428
26340004	20150905	Delayed Turnover of Unphosphorylated Ssk1 during Carbon Stress Activates the Yeast Hog1 Map Kinase Pathway.	In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Hog1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway coordinates the adaptation to osmotic stress and was recently reported to respond to acute changes in glucose levels. Similarly as in osmotic stress, glucose starvation leads to a transient accumulation of Hog1 in the nucleus. However, the kinetics and the mechanism of Hog1 activation are different for these stress conditions. During osmotic shock the activation of Hog1 can be transduced by either the Sho1 or the Sln1/Ypd1/Ssk1 branch. During glucose starvation the phosphorylation of Hog1 is slower and is completely dependent on Ssk1, but independent of Sho1. To characterize the mechanism of activation of Hog1 during carbon stress, we examined the turnover of Ssk1 protein levels upon glucose starvation in the presence of cycloheximide and monitored protein levels by western blotting. Our data demonstrate that unphosphorylated Ssk1 was quickly degraded during exponential growth and after osmotic stress but remained remarkably stable during glucose limitation. We conclude that glucose starvation induces a delay in the turnover of unphosphorylated Ssk1, which is sufficient to activate the Hog1 MAPK pathway. Although unphosphorylated Ssk1 is known to be degraded by the proteasome, its stabilization is apparently not due to changes in cellular localization or decrease in ubiquitination levels during glucose limitation.

Genes involved in metabolism of environmental chemical exposures exhibit sequence variability that may mediate the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We evaluated associations between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 15 variants in AHR, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP2C9, CYP2E1, GSTP1, GSTM3, EPHX1, NQO1, and PON1. Cases were identified from four Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries in the United States, and population-based controls were identified through random-digit dialing and Medicare eligibility files. Metabolic gene variants were characterized for the 1,172 (89% of total) cases and 982 (93%) controls who provided biological samples for genotyping. Subjects who were heterozygous or homozygous for the cytochrome P450 gene variant CYP1B1 V432L G allele were at slightly greater risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [odds ratio (OR), 1.27; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.97-1.65]; these results were consistent across B-cell lymphoma subtypes and among both non-Hispanic White and Black subjects, although not statistically significant. The CYP2E1 -1054T allele was associated with decreased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (CT and TT genotypes combined OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.37-0.93), and this pattern was observed among all histologic subtypes. The numbers of cases of particular subtypes were rather small for stable estimates, but we noted that the PON1 L55M AA allele, associated with slightly increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (variant homozygotes OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.96-1.95), was most strongly associated with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and T-cell lymphoma, with ORs for variant homozygotes of 2.12 and 2.93, respectively. There was no overall association with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for the other gene variants we examined. The modest effects we observed may reflect the context of exposures within the general population represented in our study. 	Cancer_Epidemiol._Biomarkers_Prev.	D016428 D052060 D013485
21292804	20110205	Homology modelling and site-directed mutagenesis studies of the epoxide hydrolase from Phanerochaete chrysosporium.	Three-dimensional structural model of epoxide hydrolase (PchEHA) from Phanerochaete chrysosporium was constructed based on X-ray structure of Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 sEH using SWISS-MODEL server. Conserved residues constituting the active site cavity were identified, of which the functional roles of 14 residues were determined by site-directed mutagenesis. In catalytic triad, Asp105 and His308 play a leading role in alkylation and hydrolysis steps, respectively. Distance between Asp105 and epoxide ring of substrate may determine the regiospecificity in the substrate docking model. Asp277 located at the entrance of substrate tunnel is concerned with catalysis but not essential. D307E had the highest activity and lower enantioselectivity among 14 mutants, suggesting Asp307 may be involved in choice of substrate configuration. Y159F and Y241F almost exhibited no activity, indicating that they are essential to bind substrate and facilitate opening of epoxide ring. Besides, His35-Gly36-Asn37-Pro38, Trp106 and Trp309 surrounding Asp105, may coordinate the integration of active site cavity and influence substrate binding. Especially, W106I reversed the enantioselectivity, perhaps due to more deteriorative impact on the preferred (R)-styrene oxide. Gly65 and Gly67 occurring at ?-turns and Gly36 are vital in holding protein conformation. Conclusively, single conserved residue around the active sites has an important impact on catalytic properties. 	J._Biochem.	D016428 D013485
20132558	20100206	Differential genome-wide gene expression profiling of bovine largest and second-largest follicles: identification of genes associated with growth of dominant follicles.	Bovine follicular development is regulated by numerous molecular mechanisms and biological pathways. In this study, we tried to identify differentially expressed genes between largest (F1) and second-largest follicles (F2), and classify them by global gene expression profiling using a combination of microarray and quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) analysis. The follicular status of F1 and F2 were further evaluated in terms of healthy and atretic conditions by investigating mRNA localization of identified genes. Global gene expression profiles of F1 (10.7 +/- 0.7 mm) and F2 (7.8 +/- 0.2 mm) were analyzed by hierarchical cluster analysis and expression profiles of 16 representative genes were confirmed by QPCR analysis. In addition, localization of six identified transcripts was investigated in healthy and atretic follicles using in situ hybridization. The healthy or atretic condition of examined follicles was classified by progesterone and estradiol concentrations in follicular fluid. Hierarchical cluster analysis of microarray data classified the follicles into two clusters. Cluster A was composed of only F2 and was characterized by high expression of 31 genes including IGFBP5, whereas cluster B contained only F1 and predominantly expressed 45 genes including CYP19 and FSHR. QPCR analysis confirmed AMH, CYP19, FSHR, GPX3, PlGF, PLA2G1B, SCD and TRB2 were greater in F1 than F2, while CCL2, GADD45A, IGFBP5, PLAUR, SELP, SPP1, TIMP1 and TSP2 were greater in F2 than in F1. In situ hybridization showed that AMH and CYP19 were detected in granulosa cells (GC) of healthy as well as atretic follicles. PlGF was localized in GC and in the theca layer (TL) of healthy follicles. IGFBP5 was detected in both GC and TL of atretic follicles. GADD45A and TSP2 were localized in both GC and TL of atretic follicles, whereas healthy follicles expressed them only in GC. We demonstrated that global gene expression profiling of F1 and F2 clearly reflected a difference in their follicular status. Expression of stage-specific genes in follicles may be closely associated with their growth or atresia. Several genes identified in this study will provide intriguing candidates for the determination of follicular growth. 	Reprod._Biol._Endocrinol.	D016428 D013485 D023361
14510822	20030927	Autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy: clinical spectrum, new epitempin mutations, and genetic heterogeneity in seven European families.	[corrected] To describe the clinical and genetic findings of seven additional pedigrees with autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADLTE). A personal and family history was obtained from each affected and unaffected member, along with a physical and neurologic examination. Routine and sleep EEGs, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in almost all the patients. DNAs from family members were typed with several microsatellite markers localized on either side of LGI1 at 10q24 and screened for LGI1 mutations. The seven families included a total of 34 affected individuals (10 deceased). The age at onset ranged between 8 and 50 years (average, 22 years). Twenty-six patients had clear-cut focal (elementary, complex, or secondarily generalized) seizures, characterized by prominent auditory auras in 68% of the cases. Less frequent ictal symptoms were visual, psychic, or aphasic seizures, the latter occurring in isolation in one family. The attacks were rare and well controlled by antiepileptic drug treatment but recurred after drug discontinuation. Interictal EEGs were usually unrevealing. MRI or CT scans were negative. Analysis of LGI1/Epitempin exons failed to show mutations in three pedigrees. Linkage analysis strongly suggested exclusion of linkage in one of these families. We found two novel missense mutations, a T--&gt;C substitution in exon 6 at position 598, and a T--&gt;A transition in exon 8 at position 1295, the latter being detected in a family with aphasic seizures. Our data confirm the inclusion of aphasic seizures within the ADLTE clinical spectrum, suggest the existence of locus heterogeneity in ADLTE, and provide new familial cases with LGI1 missense mutations associated with the disease.

23922661	20130808	Genome-wide identification of molecular pathways and biomarkers in response to arsenic exposure in zebrafish liver.	Inorganic arsenic is a worldwide metalloid pollutant in environment. Although extensive studies on arsenic-induced toxicity have been conducted using in vivo and in vitro models, the exact molecular mechanism of arsenate toxicity remains elusive. Here, the RNA-SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) sequencing technology was used to analyse hepatic response to arsenic exposure at the transcriptome level. Based on more than 12 million SAGE tags mapped to zebrafish genes, 1,444 differentially expressed genes (750 up-regulated and 694 down-regulated) were identified from a relatively abundant transcripts (&gt;10 TPM [transcripts per million]) based on minimal two-fold change. By gene ontology analyses, these differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in several major biological processes including oxidation reduction, translation, iron ion transport, cell redox, homeostasis, etc. Accordingly, the main pathways disturbed include metabolic pathways, proteasome, oxidative phosphorylation, cancer, etc. Ingenity Pathway Analysis further revealed a network with four important upstream factors or hub genes, including Jun, Kras, APoE and Nr2f2. The network indicated apparent molecular events involved in oxidative stress, carcinogenesis, and metabolism. In order to identify potential biomarker genes for arsenic exposure, 27 out of 29 up-regulated transcripts were validated by RT-qPCR analysis in pooled RNA samples. Among these, 14 transcripts were further confirmed for up-regulation by a lower dosage of arsenic in majority of individual zebrafish. Finally, at least four of these genes, frh3 (ferrintin H3), mgst1 (microsomal glutathione S-transferase-like), cmbl (carboxymethylenebutenolidase homolog) and slc40a1 (solute carrier family 40 [iron-regulated transporter], member 1) could be confirmed in individual medaka fish similarly treated by arsenic; thus, these four genes might be robust arsenic biomarkers across species. Thus, our work represents the first comprehensive investigation of molecular mechanism of asenic toxicity and genome-wide search for potential biomarkers for arsenic exposure.

25573590	20150110	A critical analysis of the relationship between aldehyde dehydrogenases-2 Glu487Lys polymorphism and colorectal cancer susceptibility.	Studies investigating the association between genetic polymorphism of aldehyde dehydrogenases-2 (ALDH-2) Glu487Lys and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk have reported conflicting results. Given this uncertainty, we carried out a critical analysis of published case-control studies to derive a more precise estimation of this relationship. Published literature from PubMed, EMBASE and China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database were retrieved, and the literature search was updated in June 2014. Eleven studies comprising 6965 subjects were selected (2300 cases and 4665 controls). Overall, our study showed no statistical significance for CRC risk associated with any of the genetic models of ALDH-2 Glu487Lys polymorphism. When studies were stratified for control source, a decreased risk of CRC for participants with Lys/Lys was observed in population based case-control studies [Lys/Lys vs. (Glu/Lys + Glu/Glu): odds ratio (OR)?=?0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI)?=?0.38-0.87]. Furthermore, we also confirmed the significant correlation between Glu487Lys polymorphism and the influence on the risk of rectal cancer in males [Glu/Glu vs. (Glu/Lys + Lys/Lys): OR?=?1.52, 95%CI?=?1.10-2.08]. The combined effects of the two gene polymorphisms [ALDH-2 and alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH-1B)] were also studied. Compared with subjects having ALDH-2 Lys+ with ADH-1B His/His, ORs and 95%CIs for those with ALDH-2 Glu/Glu and ADH-1B His/His was 3.42(0.57-20.38). Similar trends were observed for the other two types of comparisons. Our study supports that ALDH-2 Glu487Lys polymorphism is associated with significant reduced risks of CRC in population-based samples, and of rectal cancer in males. 	Pathol._Oncol._Res.	D016428

9508773	19980429	Role of the kinesin neck region in processive microtubule-based motility.	Kinesin is a dimeric motor protein that can move along a microtubule for several microns without releasing (termed processive movement). The two motor domains of the dimer are thought to move in a coordinated, hand-over-hand manner. A region adjacent to kinesin's motor catalytic domain (the neck) contains a coiled coil that is sufficient for motor dimerization and has been proposed to play an essential role in processive movement. Recent models have suggested that the neck enables head-to-head communication by creating a stiff connection between the two motor domains, but also may unwind during the mechanochemical cycle to allow movement to new tubulin binding sites. To test these ideas, we mutated the neck coiled coil in a 560-amino acid (aa) dimeric kinesin construct fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), and then assayed processivity using a fluorescence microscope that can visualize single kinesin-GFP molecules moving along a microtubule. Our results show that replacing the kinesin neck coiled coil with a 28-aa residue peptide sequence that forms a highly stable coiled coil does not greatly reduce the processivity of the motor. This result argues against models in which extensive unwinding of the coiled coil is essential for movement. Furthermore, we show that deleting the neck coiled coil decreases processivity 10-fold, but surprisingly does not abolish it. We also demonstrate that processivity is increased by threefold when the neck helix is elongated by seven residues. These results indicate that structural features of the neck coiled coil, although not essential for processivity, can tune the efficiency of single molecule motility. 	J._Cell_Biol.	D016428 D013485
24737917	20140417	Acquisition of conditioned responding in a multiple schedule depends on the reinforcement's temporal contingency with each stimulus.	Forty mice acquired conditioned responses to stimuli presented in a multiple schedule with variable inter-trial intervals (ITIs). In some trials, reinforcement was preceded by a variable conditioned stimulus (CS), while other trials were reinforced following distinctive fixed-duration CS. A third stimulus was presented but never paired with reinforcement. Subjects in five groups experienced ITIs of different durations. Acquisition of responding to each stimulus depended only on the cycle-to-trial ratio (C/T), and thus on the temporal contingency of each stimulus. Acquisition was unaffected by whether CSs were of fixed or variable duration. 	Learn._Mem.	D016428
26468522	20151016	TRIM5 Retroviral Restriction Activity Correlates with the Ability To Induce Innate Immune Signaling.	Host restriction factor TRIM5 inhibits retroviral transduction in a species-specific manner by binding to and destabilizing the retroviral capsid lattice before reverse transcription is completed. However, the restriction mechanism may not be that simple since TRIM5 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, the proteasome, autophagy, and TAK1-dependent AP-1 signaling have been suggested to contribute to restriction. Here, we show that, among a panel of seven primate and Carnivora TRIM5 orthologues, each of which has potential for potent retroviral restriction activity, all activated AP-1 signaling. In contrast, TRIM family paralogues most closely related to TRIM5 did not. While each primate species has a single TRIM5 gene, mice have at least seven TRIM5 homologues that cluster into two groups, Trim12a, -b, and -c and Trim30a, -b, -c, and -d. The three Trim12 proteins activated innate immune signaling, while the Trim30 proteins did not, though none of the murine Trim5 homologues restricted any of a panel of cloned retroviruses. To determine if any mouse TRIM5 homologues had potential for restriction activity, each was fused to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) CA binding protein cyclophilin A (CypA). The three Trim12-CypA fusions all activated AP-1 and restricted HIV-1 transduction, whereas the Trim30-CypA fusions did neither. AP-1 activation and HIV-1 restriction by the Trim12-CypA fusions were inhibited by disruption of TAK1. Overall then, these experiments demonstrate that there is a strong correlation between TRIM5 retroviral restriction activity and the ability to activate TAK1-dependent innate immune signaling. The importance of retroviruses for the evolution of susceptible host organisms cannot be overestimated. Eight percent of the human genome is retrovirus sequence, fixed in the germ line during past infection. Understanding how metazoa protect their genomes from mutagenic retrovirus infection is therefore of fundamental importance to biology. TRIM5 is a cellular protein that protects host genome integrity by disrupting the retroviral capsid as it transports viral nucleic acid to the host cell nucleus. Previous data suggest that innate immune signaling contributes to TRIM5-mediated restriction. Here, we show that activation of innate immune signaling is conserved among primate and carnivore TRIM5 orthologues and among 3 of the 7 mouse Trim5 homologues and that such activity is required for TRIM5-mediated restriction activity.

12909629	20030812	Cell type- and promoter-specific roles of Ser18 phosphorylation in regulating p53 responses.	Phosphorylation of mouse p53 at Ser18 occurs after DNA damage. To determine the physiological roles of this phosphorylation event in p53-dependent DNA damage responses, a Ser18 to Ala missense mutation was introduced into the germline of mice. Thymocytes and fibroblasts from the knock-in mice show reduced transactivation of many p53 target genes following DNA damage. p53 protein stabilization and DNA binding are similar in knock-in and wild type mice, but C-terminal acetylation was defective, consistent with a role for Ser18 in the recruitment of transcriptional co-activators. The apoptotic response of knock-in thymocytes to ionizing radiation is intermediate between that of wild type and p53 null thymocytes. Despite impaired transcriptional and apoptotic responses, the knock-in mice are not prone to spontaneous tumorigenesis. This indicates that neither phosphorylation of p53 on Ser18 by ATM nor a full transcriptional response is essential to prevent spontaneous tumor formation in mice. 	J._Biol._Chem.

18790059	20080916	Lrrk2 and alpha-synuclein are co-regulated in rodent striatum.	LRRK2, alpha-synuclein, UCH-L1 and DJ-1 are implicated in the etiology of Parkinson's disease. We show for the first time that increase in striatal alpha-synuclein levels induce increased Lrrk2 mRNA levels while Dj-1 and Uch-L1 are unchanged. We also demonstrate that a mouse strain lacking the dopamine signaling molecule DARPP-32 has significantly reduced levels of both Lrrk2 and alpha-synuclein, while mice carrying a disabling mutation of the DARPP-32 phosphorylation site T34A or lack alpha-synuclein do not show any changes. To test if striatal dopamine depletion influences Lrrk2 or alpha-synuclein expression, we used the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine in rats and MitoPark mice in which there is progressive degeneration of dopamine neurons. Because striatal Lrrk2 and alpha-synuclein levels were not changed by dopamine depletion, we conclude that Lrrk2 and alpha-synuclein mRNA levels are possibly co-regulated, but they are not influenced by striatal dopamine levels.

10995221	20000920	N-glycosylation and residue 96 are involved in the functional properties of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes.	The recent cloning of several human and monkey UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B proteins has allowed the characterization of these steroid metabolic enzymes. However, relatively little is known about the structure-function relationship, and the potential post-translational modifications of these proteins. The mammalian UGT2B proteins contain at least one consensus asparagine-linked glycosylation site NX(S/T). Endoglycosidase H digestion of the human and monkey UGT2B proteins demonstrates that only UGT2B7, UGT2B15, UGT2B17, and UGT2B20 are glycosylated. Although UGT2B15 and UGT2B20 contain three and four potential glycosylation sites, respectively, site-directed mutagenesis revealed that both proteins are glycosylated at the same first site. In both proteins, abolishing glycosylation decreased glucuronidation activity; however, the K(m) values and the substrate specificities were not affected. Despite the similarities between UGT2B15 and UGT2B20, UGT2B20 is largely more labile than UGT2B15. Treating HK293 cells stably expressing UGT2B20 with cycloheximide for 2 h decreased the enzyme activity by more than 50%, whereas the activity of UGT2B15 remained unchanged after 24 h. The UGT2B20 protein is unique in having an isoleucine at position 96 instead of an arginine as found in all the other UGT2B enzymes. Changing the isoleucine in UGT2B20 to an arginine stabilized enzyme activity, while the reciprocal mutation in UGT2B15 R96I produced a more labile enzyme. Secondary structure predictions of UGT2B proteins revealed a putative alpha-helix in this region in all the human and monkey proteins. This alpha-helix is shortest in UGT2B20; however, the helix is lengthened in UGT2B20 I96R. Thus, it is apparent that the length of the putative alpha-helix between residues 84 and 100 is a determining factor in the stability of UGT2B enzyme activity. This study reveals the extent and importance of protein glycosylation on UGT2B enzyme activity and that the effect of residue 96 on UGT2B enzyme stability is correlated to the length of a putative alpha-helix.

11337938	20010508	In-vitro metabolism of celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, by allelic variant forms of human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 2C9: correlation with CYP2C9 genotype and in-vivo pharmacokinetics.	In-vitro studies were conducted to assess the impact of CYP2C9 genotype on the metabolism (methyl hydroxylation) and pharmacokinetics of celecoxib, a novel cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor and CYP2C9 substrate. When compared to cDNA-expressed wild-type CYP2C9 (CYP2C9*1), the Vmax/Km ratio for celecoxib methyl hydroxylation was reduced by 34% and 90% in the presence of recombinant CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, respectively. These data indicated that the amino acid substitution at position 359 (Ile to Leu) elicited a more pronounced effect on the metabolism of celecoxib than did a substitution at position 144 (Arg to Cys). The Vmax/Km ratio was also decreased in microsomes of livers genotyped CYP2C9*1/*2 (47% decrease, mean of two livers), or CYP2C9*1/*3 (59% decrease, one liver). In all cases, these changes were largely reflective of a decrease in Vmax, with a minimal change in Km. Based on simulations of the in-vitro data obtained with the recombinant CYP2C9 proteins, it was anticipated that the pharmacokinetics of celecoxib (as a much as a five-fold increase in plasma AUC) would be altered (versus CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects) in subjects genotyped heterozygous or homozygous for the CYP2C9*2 (Cys144) or CYP2C9*3 (Leu359) allele. In a subsequent clinical study, the AUC of celecoxib was increased (versus CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects) approximately 2.2-fold (range, 1.6-3-fold) in two CYP2C9*1/*3 subjects and one CYP2C9*3/*3 subject receiving a single oral dose (200 mg) of the drug. In contrast, there was no significant change in celecoxib AUC in two subjects genotyped CYP2C9*1/*2. 	Pharmacogenetics	D016428
21276224	20110201	Evolution of major milk proteins in Mus musculus and Mus spretus mouse species: a genoproteomic analysis.	Due to their high level of genotypic and phenotypic variability, Mus spretus strains were introduced in laboratories to investigate the genetic determinism of complex phenotypes including quantitative trait loci. Mus spretus diverged from Mus musculus around 2.5 million years ago and exhibits on average a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in every 100 base pairs when compared with any of the classical laboratory strains. A genoproteomic approach was used to assess polymorphism of the major milk proteins between SEG/Pas and C57BL/6J, two inbred strains of mice representative of Mus spretus and Mus musculus species, respectively. The milk protein concentration was dramatically reduced in the SEG/Pas strain by comparison with the C57BL/6J strain (34 ? 9 g/L vs. 125 ? 12 g/L, respectively). Nine major proteins were identified in both milks using RP-HPLC, bi-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-Tof mass spectrometry. Two caseins (? and ?s1) and the whey acidic protein (WAP), showed distinct chromatographic and electrophoresis behaviours. These differences were partly explained by the occurrence of amino acid substitutions and splicing variants revealed by cDNA sequencing. A total of 34 SNPs were identified in the coding and 3'untranslated regions of the SEG/Pas Csn1s1 (11), Csn2 (7) and Wap (8) genes. In addition, a 3 nucleotide deletion leading to the loss of a serine residue at position 93 was found in the SEG/Pas Wap gene. SNP frequencies found in three milk protein-encoding genes between Mus spretus and Mus musculus is twice the values previously reported at the whole genome level. However, the protein structure and post-translational modifications seem not to be affected by SNPs characterized in our study. Splicing mechanisms (cryptic splice site usage, exon skipping, error-prone junction sequence), already identified in casein genes from other species, likely explain the existence of multiple ?s1-casein isoforms both in SEG/Pas and C57BL/6J strains. Finally, we propose a possible mechanism by which the hallmark tandem duplication of a 18-nt exon (14 copies) may have occurred in the mouse genome. 	BMC_Genomics	D003160 D016428 D013485
26650836	20151210	CarNAC4, a NAC-type chickpea transcription factor conferring enhanced drought and salt stress tolerances in Arabidopsis.	CarNAC4 is a typical stress-responsive NAC transcription factor and enhances drought and salt stress tolerances in transgenic Arabidopsis. Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is relatively vulnerable to abiotic stress conditions, but the tolerance mechanisms for such stresses in chickpea are largely unknown. To identify stress-related factors in chickpea, we previously constructed a cDNA library of chickpea leaves exposed to drought stress conditions. A cDNA encoding a putative NAC transcription factor (CarNAC4) was identified as a putative stress-responsive gene. Our study indicated that the transcript levels of CarNAC4 were enhanced in response to several abiotic stresses and phytohormones. Promoter analysis demonstrated that multiple stress-related cis-acting elements exist in promoter region of CarNAC4. CarNAC4 is localized in the nucleus and binds to the DNA sequence containing CGT[G/A], while the C-terminal region of CarNAC4 contains a transcriptional activation domain. Over-expression of CarNAC4 in Arabidopsis plants improved tolerance to drought and salt stresses. Transgenic plants exhibited greater reduced rates of water loss and more proline accumulation than Col-0 plants under drought stress and less MDA contents than Col-0 plants under salt stress. In addition, over-expression of CarNAC4 enhanced the expression of stress-responsive genes such as RD29A, ERD10, COR15A, COR47, KIN1 and DREB2A. These results indicated that CarNAC4 functions as a transcription factor involved in the regulation of drought and salt stress response. 	Plant_Cell_Rep.	D016428 D013485

Up to present, EGF 61*A/G, TGF-?1 -509*T/C and TNF-? -308*A/G gene polymorphisms have been analysed in other cancer entities than hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We here investigated the frequency of these gene polymorphisms among HCC patients. A total of 73 HCC patients and 117 cancer-free healthy people were recruited at the Surgical Department of Zhongshan Hospital. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and gene polymorphisms were analyzed by PCR-RFLP. The distribution of EGF 61*G/G homozygotes among HCC patients was more frequent than that in the control group (24.7% vs 11.1%, OR=2.618, 95%CI=1.195-5.738). In parallel, the frequency of the &quot;G&quot; allele in the HCC patient group was also higher than that in the control group (45.9% vs 33.3%, OR= 1.696, 95%CI=1.110-2.592). No difference could be found for the TGF-?1-509 and TNF-? -308 genotypes. EGF 61*G/G genotype and G allele are significantly increased among patients with HCC. TGF-?1-509*T/C and TNF-? -308*A/G gene polymorphisms are not related to this cancer entity. 	Asian_Pac._J._Cancer_Prev.	D016428
20057144	20100109	Defective dynamic properties of human cardiac troponin mutations.	Mutations in Troponin I (TnI) and Troponin T (TnT) are closely linked to familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), but the underlying molecular mechanism is not yet well understood. There might be a close link between the defective dynamic properties and the functional aberrations of hcTroponin. To prove this hypothesis, we undertook detailed NMR relaxation measurements of [(2)H, (13)C, (15)N] labeled proteins reconstituted into hcTroponin in both the Ca(2+)- and the Mg(2+)-loaded state. The wild-type TnI and two FHC causing mutations, TnI(G203S) and TnI(DeltaK183), were investigated. To ensure that defective dynamic properties are not only a particular feature for mutations in the flexible part of TnI, measurements of the TnT mutation TnT(R278P) were also performed. For all mutations significant dynamic changes in the area for Troponin C (TnC) and actin-Tm binding were obtained. These measurements provide important information to understand the functional aberrations of FHC and HCM causing mutation in human cardiac Troponin (hcTn). 	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.

23076359	20121019	Virulence factors of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex.	The Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) consists of closely related species that cause tuberculosis in both humans and animals. This illness, still today, remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. The mycobacteria enter the host by air, and, once in the lungs, are phagocytated by macrophages. This may lead to the rapid elimination of the bacillus or to the triggering of an active tuberculosis infection. A large number of different virulence factors have evolved in MTBC members as a response to the host immune reaction. The aim of this review is to describe the bacterial genes/proteins that are essential for the virulence of MTBC species, and that have been demonstrated in an in vivo model of infection.

15979955	20050628	TNFalpha, IFNgamma and IL-10 gene polymorphisms in a sample of Sicilian patients with coeliac disease.	Coeliac disease is associated with DQ2 and DQ8 alleles, but other genes also confer an additional genetic risk. Defining whether the genetic profiles of interleukin-10, tumour necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma are associated with an increased coeliac disease risk. The functionally gene polymorphisms of tumour necrosis factor alpha (-308G/A), interferon gamma (+874T/A) and interleukin-10 (-1082G/A) were typed using sequence specific primer-polymerase chain reaction in 110 Sicilian coeliac disease patients and in 220 Sicilian healthy controls. No differences in genotype frequencies of interleukin-10 polymorphisms were found between coeliac disease patients and healthy controls. A significant increase of -308A (p&lt;0.033; OR: 1.72; CI: 1.27-2.33) and of +874T (p: 0.0045; OR: 3.02; CI: 1.47-6.21) allele frequencies, both in hetero- and homozygosis, was observed in coeliac patients in comparison with healthy controls. In addition, simultaneous significant higher percentages of -308A and +874T alleles (p: 0.0066; OR: 2.33; CI: 1.42-3.82) as well as simultaneous significant lower percentages of -308A and +874T alleles (p: 0.003; OR: 0.23; CI: 0.10-0.60) were observed in coeliac patients compared with healthy controls. Genetically determined higher frequencies of -308A tumour necrosis factor alpha and +874T interferon gamma alleles, both in hetero and in homozygosis and mostly whether simultaneous, may play a role in predisposing to gluten intolerance. Subjects positive for -308A tumour necrosis factor alpha and +874T interferon gamma alleles have an increased risk for coeliac disease. 	Dig_Liver_Dis	D016428 D013485
6817672	19820101	Genetic variation of the sixth component of complement (C6) in the Manx shearwater (Puffinus p. puffinus).	A polymorphism in the sixth complement component (C6) has been investigated by isoelectric focusing. The results indicate that C6 is coded by genes at a single autosomal locus. Six structural alleles have been identified, a null allele is also postulated. Five island colonies of Shearwater were investigated, two alleles C6 A and C6 B predominate in all sites. The ability of rabbit C5 and C7 to combine successfully with avian C6 indicates the functional sites of these molecules are highly conserved. 	Anim_Blood_Groups_Biochem_Genet	D016428 D013485
8702765	19960823	A molecular basis for affinity modulation of Fab ligand binding to integrin alphaIIb beta3.	The Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence within the third complementarity-determining region (CDR3) of the heavy chain (H3) is responsible for the binding of the recombinant murine Fab molecules, AP7 and PAC1.1, to the platelet integrin alphaIIbbeta3. AP7 binding is minimally influenced by the conformational state of this receptor, whereas PAC1.1 binds preferentially to the activated state of the receptor induced by platelet agonists. To study the molecular basis for this functional difference, we replaced the AP7 H3 loop (HPFYRGDGGN) with all or segments of the analogous sequence from PAC1.1 (RSPSYYRGDGAGP). AP7 Fd (VH domain + Cgamma1 domain) segments containing these H3 loop sequences were expressed as active Fab molecules by coinfection of Spodoptera frugiperda cell lines with recombinant baculoviruses containing Fd and AP7 kappa chain cDNA. Replacement of the entire AP7 H3 loop with that from PAC1.1 generated the mutant AP7.3 Fab molecule, which bound selectively to either activated, gel-filtered platelets or to purified alphaIIbbeta3 in a manner identical to that of PAC1.1. Identical results were obtained when solely the sequences flanking the amino side of RGD within the respective H3 loops were exchanged. AP7.3 and PAC1.1 exhibited saturable but submaximal binding to activated gel-filtered platelets. Relative to AP7, the number of AP7.3 or PAC1. 1 Fab molecules bound per platelet was 17% in the presence of 1 m Ca2+ + 1 mM Mg2+ or 40% in the presence of 10 microM Mn2+. The ratio of Fab molecules bound after versus before activation (mean =/- S.D.; n = 3) was: for AP7.3, 9.8 =/- 0.6; for PAC1.1, 8.8 +/- 0.3; and for AP7, 1.4 =/- 0.2. In addition, AP7 bound to the stably expressed integrin mutant alphaIIbbeta3(S123A), whereas AP7.3 and PAC1 did not. Because AP7.3 behaves in every respect like PAC1.1, we conclude that the ability of RGD-based ligands to distinguish activated from resting conformations of the integrin alphaIIbbeta3 can be regulated by limited amino acid sequences immediately adjacent to the RGD tripeptide. Furthermore, those Fab molecules that exhibit increased selectivity for the activated conformation of alphaIIbbeta3 bind to a subpopulation of this integrin on platelets that is modulated by divalent cations.

21715084	20110701	SRD5A polymorphisms and biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy.	The relationship between inherited germ-line variations in the 5?-reductase pathways of androgen biosynthesis and the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP) remains an unexplored area. To determine the link between germ-line variations in the steroid-5?-reductase, ?-polypeptide 1 (SRD5A1) and steroid-5?-reductase, ?-polypeptide 2 (SRD5A2) genes and BCR. We studied retrospectively two independent cohorts composed of 526 white (25% BCR) and 320 Asian men (36% BCR) with pathologically organ-confined prostate cancer who had a median follow-up of 88.8 and 30.8 mo after surgery, respectively. Patients were genotyped for 19 haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) in SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 genes, and their prognostic significance on prostate-specific antigen recurrence was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox regression model. After adjusting for all clinicopathologic risk factors, four SNPs (rs2208532, rs12470143, rs523349, and rs4952197) were associated with BCR in both whites and Asians. The strongest effect was conferred by the SRD5A2 V89L nonsynonymous SNP (rs523349C) with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.07-4.00; p = 4 ? 10???; 48% BCR). In addition, in whites, the combination of two SNPs, rs518673T in SRD5A1 and rs12470143A in SRD5A2, was associated with a reduced BCR rate for carriers of three or four alleles (HR: 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19-0.71; p=0.003;16% BCR) compared with noncarriers (38% BCR), whereas the SRD5A2 rs12470143A was significant in Asians (HR: 0.46; 95% CI, 0.28-0.73; p=0.001). Limitations of our study include few events of androgen-deprivation resistance or cancer-specific death. Our study is the first to show positive associations of several SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 variations as independent predictors of BCR after RP. 	Eur._Urol.	D016428 D016448 D013485
10505677	19991003	Rapid detection of the HIV type 1 reverse transcriptase codon T215Y by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with fluorogenic probes.	Early detection of viral mutations, particularly those mutations associated with cross-resistance to antiretroviral drugs, is critical both for understanding the mechanism of drug resistance and for the clinical management of patients infected with HIV-1. One of the frequently observed mutations in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT)-coding region is ACC --&gt; TAC at codon 215, resulting in a change of wild-type threonine (T) to tyrosine (Y); this mutation has been associated with decreased phenotypic susceptibility to zidovudine (ZDV). We describe a technique for the detection of the T215Y mutation using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of viral sequences and a 5' nuclease assay requiring fluorogenic probes. In addition to detecting the presence of the ACC --&gt; TAC mutation at codon 215, this assay provides an increased ability to detect low levels of mutant species in a mixed population, relative to conventional sequencing. Further advantages of this technique include the rapid and high-throughput nature of the assay, the accuracy of the assay relative to conventional DNA sequencing, and the convenience of combining RT-PCR virus amplification with the allelic discrimination assay, without the need for purification of PCR products.

24654912	20140325	Association studies of cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily E, polypeptide 1 (CYP2E1) gene polymorphisms with acute rejection in kidney transplantation recipients.	Recent studies have shown that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with allograft rejection in kidney transplantation recipients. We evaluated the possible association between SNPs of the cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily E, polypeptide 1 (CYP2E1) gene, and acute rejection (AR) among renal transplant patients in a Korean population. We conducted a case-control association study in 63 AR and 284 non-AR kidney transplant recipients. The SNPs of CYP2E1 were genotyped by direct sequencing. Recipient sex (p = 0.023) and the use of tacrolimus (p = 0.017) were significantly different between the two groups. The use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and antibody induction therapy was significantly lower in the AR group. Multiple logistic regression models (codominant, dominant, recessive, and log-additive models) adjusted by sex and type of immunosuppressive regimens were applied to determine the odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p-values. The rs2515641 of CYP2E1 showed significant differences between the AR patient group and non-AR group (p = 0.003, OR = 2.55, 95% CI = 1.37-4.75 in the codominant 1 model; p = 0.002, OR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.43-4.77 in the dominant model; p = 0.0035, OR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.29-3.50 in the log-additive model). The allele of the rs2515641 SNP also showed a significant association (p = 0.004, OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.24-3.21). This study suggests that the CYP2E1 polymorphism may be related to the development of AR in Korean kidney transplantation recipients. 	Clin_Transplant	D003160 D016428 D016448 D013485
9468285	19980219	Pattern of inheritance in hereditary myeloperoxidase deficiency associated with the R569W missense mutation.	Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an essential component of the oxygen-dependent microbicidal system of neutrophils and monocytes. Hereditary deficiency of MPO occurs in 1 in 2,000 to 4,000 individuals in the general population and has been generally considered an autosomal recessive trait. Previous studies have used the peroxidase activity of blood leukocytes to assess the phenotype of affected family members. Eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) also contributes to the peroxidase activity of blood leukocytes. Because EPO expression is normal in MPO-deficient subjects, eosinophil contamination can significantly contribute to peroxidase activity in leukocytes from family members of an MPO-deficient subject and thereby undermine correct interpretation of the inheritance pattern. To avoid this potential problem, we used cytochemical, immunochemical, and genetic techniques to assess the inheritance pattern of MPO deficiency in sixteen individuals from five unrelated kindreds. Each kindred had an index case with MPO deficiency and the R569W missense mutation, a genotype that causes MPO deficiency. Our analysis demonstrated that MPO deficiency was not inherited as a simple autosomal recessive trait. Most subjects were compound heterozygotes with respect to the R569W mutation and demonstrated a spectrum of phenotypes. Our data demonstrate the broad phenotypic impact of compound heterozygosity on the expression and function of a multimeric protein such as MPO. 	J._Leukoc._Biol.	D016428 D013485 D013486
22535280	20120427	Gene polymorphisms involved in manifestation of leucopenia, digestive intolerance, and pancreatitis in azathioprine-treated patients.	Approximately 10-28 % of patients experience adverse drug reactions related to treatment with thiopurines. The most serious reaction is myelosuppression, typically manifested as leucopenia, which occurs in approximately 2-5 % of patients. Other adverse drug reactions that often accompany thiopurine therapy are pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, allergic reactions, digestive intolerance, arthralgia, febrile conditions, and rash. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between variant alleles of thiopurine S-methyltransferase (SNPs 238G &gt; C, 460G &gt; A and 719A &gt; G), inosine triphosphate diphosphatase (SNPs 94C &gt; A and IVS2 + 21A &gt; C), and xanthine dehydrogenase (837C &gt; T) and the occurrence of adverse drug reactions to azathioprine therapy. Genotype was determined for 188 Caucasians diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease treated with a standard dose of azathioprine (1.4-2.0 mg/kg/day). Allelic variants were determined by PCR-REA and real-time PCR methods. Results were statistically evaluated by use of Fisher's test and by odds ratio calculation. Variant genotype thiopurine S-methyltransferase predisposes to development of leucopenia (P = 0.003, OR = 5, CI 95 %, 1.8058-13.8444). Although not statistically significant, we observed a trend that suggested correlation between the occurrence of digestive intolerance and the variant genotype inosine triphosphate diphosphatase (P = 0.1102; OR 15.63, CI 95 %, 1.162-210.1094), and between the occurrence of pancreatitis and the variant allele xanthine dehydrogenase 837T (P = 0.1124; OR 12,1, CI 95 %, 1.15-126.37). The variant genotype thiopurine S-methyltransferase has been associated with the occurrence of leucopenia. The involvement of polymorphisms in inosine triphosphate diphosphatase and xanthine dehydrogenase genes in the development of digestive intolerance and pancreatitis will require further verification.

25511643	20141217	High nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of Cdk1 expression predicts poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients.	Cdk1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1) is critical regulator of the G2-M checkpoint. Cyclin-dependent kinase pathways are considered possible targets for cancer treatment; however, the prognostic role of Cdk1 in colorectal cancer is still controversial. Therefore, we attempted to determine the impact of Cdk1 on the clinical outcome of colorectal cancer patients to further identify its role in colorectal cancer. Cdk1 immunoreactivity was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 164 cancer specimens from primary colorectal cancer patients. The medium follow-up time after surgery was 3.7 years (range: 0.01 to 13.10 years). The prognostic value of Cdk1 on overall survival was determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models. All samples displayed detectable Cdk1 expression with predominant location in the cytoplasm and nucleus. A high Cdk1 nuclear/cytoplasmic (N/C) expression ratio was correlated with poor overall survival (5-year survival rate: 26.3% vs 46.9%, N/C ratio ?1.5 vs N/C ratio &lt;1.5, log-rank p = 0.027). Accordingly, a Cdk1 N/C expression ratio ?1.5 was identified as an independent risk factor by multivariate analysis (hazard ratio = 1.712, P = 0.039). We suggest that Cdk1 N/C expression ratio determined by IHC staining could be an independent prognostic marker for colorectal cancer. 	BMC_Cancer	D016428 D013485

21455723	20110402	Desmoglein 2 mutant mice develop cardiac fibrosis and dilation.	Desmosomes are cell-cell adhesion sites and part of the intercalated discs, which couple adjacent cardiomyocytes. The connection is formed by the extracellular domains of desmosomal cadherins that are also linked to the cytoskeleton on the cytoplasmic side. To examine the contribution of the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein 2 to cardiomyocyte adhesion and cardiac function, mutant mice were prepared lacking a part of the extracellular adhesive domain of desmoglein 2. Most live born mutant mice presented normal overall cardiac morphology at 2 weeks. Some animals, however, displayed extensive fibrotic lesions. Later on, mutants developed ventricular dilation leading to cardiac insufficiency and eventually premature death. Upon histological examination, cardiomyocyte death by calcifying necrosis and replacement by fibrous tissue were observed. Fibrotic lesions were highly proliferative in 2-week-old mutants, whereas the fibrotic lesions of older mutants showed little proliferation indicating the completion of local muscle replacement by scar tissue. Disease progression correlated with increased mRNA expression of c-myc, ANF, BNF, CTGF and GDF15, which are markers for cardiac stress, remodeling and heart failure. Taken together, the desmoglein 2-mutant mice display features of dilative cardiomyopathy and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, an inherited human heart disease with pronounced fibrosis and ventricular arrhythmias that has been linked to mutations in desmosomal proteins including desmoglein 2.

22656863	20120605	The large scale conformational change of the human DPP III-substrate prefers the &quot;closed&quot; form.	Human dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPP III) is a two domain metallo-peptidase from the M49 family. The wide interdomain cleft and broad substrate specificity suggest that this enzyme could experience significant conformational change. Long (&gt;100 ns) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of DPP III revealed large range conformational changes of the protein, suggesting the pre-existing equilibrium model for a substrate binding. The binding free energy calculations revealed tighter binding of the preferred synthetic substrate Arg-Arg-2-naphtylamide to the &quot;closed&quot; than to the &quot;open&quot; DPP III conformation. Our assumption that Asp372 plays a crucial role in the large scale interdomain closure was proved by the MD simulations of the Asp372Ala variant. During the same simulation time, the variant remained more &quot;open&quot; than the wild type protein. Apparently, Ala was not as efficient as Asp in establishing the interdomain interactions. According to the MM-PBSA calculations, the electrostatic component of the free energy of solvation turned out to be higher for the &quot;closed&quot; protein than for its less compact form. However, the gain in entropy due to water released from the interdomain cleft nicely balanced this negative effect. 	J_Chem_Inf_Model	D016428 D013485
27338421	20160625	Immunomodulatory Effects of the Mycosporine-Like Amino Acids Shinorine and Porphyra-334.	Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are secondary metabolites, produced by a large variety of microorganisms including algae, cyanobacteria, lichen and fungi. MAAs act as UV-absorbers and photo-protectants. MAAs are suggested to exert pharmaceutical relevant bioactivities in the human system. We particularly focused on their effect on defence and regulatory pathways that are active in inflamed environments. The MAAs shinorine and porphyra-334 were isolated and purified from the red algae Porphyra sp. using chromatographic methods. The effect of MAAs on central signaling cascades, such as transcription factor nuclear factor kappa b (NF-?B) activation, as well as tryptophan metabolism, was investigated in human myelomonocytic THP-1 and THP-1-Blue cells. Cells were exposed to the MAAs in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). NF-?B activity and the activity of tryptophan degrading enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1) were used as readout. Compounds were tested in the concentration range from 12.5 to 200 ?g/mL. Both MAAs were able to induce NF-?B activity in unstimulated THP-1-Blue cells, whereby the increase was dose-dependent and more pronounced with shinorine treatment. While shinorine also slightly superinduced NF-?B in LPS-stimulated cells, porphyra-334 reduced NF-?B activity in this inflammatory background. Modulation of tryptophan metabolism was moderate, suppressive in stimulated cells with the lower treatment concentration of both MAAs and with the unstimulated cells upon porphyra-334 treatment. Inflammatory pathways are affected by MAAs, but despite the structural similarity, diverse effects were observed. 	Mar_Drugs	D016428
21585624	20110519	Association of haplotype combination of serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms with monthly headache days in MOH patients.	To evaluate the role of 5-HTTLPR, STin2 VNTR, and rs1042173T&gt;G polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) as susceptibility factors for medication overuse headache (MOH) and to assess their value as predictors of the number of headache days per month, a potential marker of disease severity. Genotyping was performed by PCR and PCR-RFLP on genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood of 227 MOH patients and 312 control subjects. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between the SL6A4 gene polymorphisms and MOH risk. The association between polymorphic variants and monthly headache days was evaluated by linear regression analysis. Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age and gender, revealed a nominal association between rs1042173T&gt;G and MOH risk (TT vs. TG + GG, OR: 1.58 95% CI: 1.05-2.37, P = 0.028). In the linear regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, primary headache diagnosis, acute drug overused and monthly drug number, STin2 VNTR was found nominally associated with monthly headache days (12/12 vs. others, difference: 1.55 days, 95% CI: 0.01-3.08, P = 0.050). When STin2 VNTR and rs1042173T&gt;G were analyzed in haplotypic combination, a global haplotype association emerged with monthly headache days which remained significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (global haplotype association P = 0.0056). Although a minor contribution of SLC6A4 variants in the genetic liability of MOH cannot be excluded, haplotype-based analysis of STin2 VNTR and rs1042173T&gt;G polymorphisms allowed to identify a subgroup of MOH patients with a higher number of monthly headache and, possibly, with a more severe disease.

26779272	20160119	Chitosan-genipin nanohydrogel as a vehicle for sustained delivery of alpha-1 antitrypsin.	Alpha-1antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency, an inherited disorder, has been shown to be the cause of lung diseases such as emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. One of the treatment strategies to provide appropriate and adequate concentrations of A1AT in the lungsis the application of nanoparticles (NPs) in pulmonary drug delivery. In the current study, biocompatible nanohydrogels were prepared using chemically cross-linked chitosan with ginepin, a natural cross linker reagent, and used as a carrier to deposit A1AT into the lung tissue. Colloidal and monodispersed NPs were synthesized through reverse microemulsion. Nanohydrogels were characterized with TEM, LLS, FTIR, ZTEA potential, UV spectrum, and swelling test. Encapsulation efficacy was determined at different concentrations of A1AT using Bradford assay. Effect of processing variables such as pH, loading efficiency, and release media components on drug release profile was determined in simulated lung fluids. To evaluate the inhibitory activity of the A1AT after release from NPs, trypsin inhibitory capacity assay was carried out. Results from FTIR and UV spectrum confirmed the development of chitosan cross linkage. Spherical chitosan-genipin NPs were sized from 30-100 nm. NPs exhibited the ability to release 49% of the drug within 12-dayperiodatpH 7. However, there were variations with the drug release profile due to pH variations and loading efficacy. Drug release was higher in pseudo alveolar fluid in comparison with saline solution. These data indicate that application of chitosan nanohydrogels can be a useful tool for sustained release of A1AT in the lung tissue. 	Res_Pharm_Sci	D016428
27038349	20160403	Age and gender differences in the influences of eNOS T-786C polymorphism on arteriosclerotic parameters in general population in Japan.	The influence of T-786C polymorphism in the promoter region of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) on arteriosclerotic parameters by age and gender were examined. Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), heart-rate adjusted augmentation index (AIx@75), pulse pressure (PP) and albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) were assessed as arteriosclerotic parameters in addition to non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) to HDL-C (non-HDL-C/HDL-C) ratio in 1499 participants. T-786C polymorphism (rs2070744) was screened using a TaqMan allelic discrimination assay. Analyses of covariance were carried. Women with the non-C allele showed significantly lower AIx@75 in participants aged &lt;65?years and baPWV in participants aged ?65?years than those with C allele. In contrast, men with the non-C allele showed significantly higher PP in participants aged &lt;65?years, and higher ACR and non-HDL-C/HDL-C ratio in participants aged ?65?years. In men on cholesterol-lowering medication, the non-C allele carriers showed significantly higher non-HDL-C compared to those in the C allele carriers. eNOS T-786C polymorphism is significantly associated with arteriosclerotic parameters accompanied with age and gender differences, possibly involving antioxidative and/or endothelial signaling other than inflammatory signaling.

1980288	19900701	Role of presynaptic purinoceptors and cyclic AMP on the noradrenaline release in cat cerebral arteries.	Field electrical stimulation (ES), K+ (50 mM) or ionophore X-537A (0.01 mM) induced tritium release from cat cerebral arteries preincubated with [3H]noradrenaline (NA). Adenosine and AMP (0.5 mM) did not modify tritium release caused by ionophore X-537A, but these agents and ATP (0.5 mM) significantly reduced that elicited by ES and K+; this reduction was antagonized by 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (MIX; 0.05 mM). Inosine (0.5 mM) and the agonist of purinergic A2-receptors, 5'N-ethyl-carboxamide adenosine (NECA; 0.5 mM) had no effect, but the agonist of purinergic A2-receptors L-N6-phenylisopropyl adenosine (L-PIA; 0.1 mM) diminished tritium efflux caused by ES and K+. The adenosine inhibition of ES-induced radioactivity release was not affected by indomethacin (0.05 mM). MIX (0.05 mM) increased tritium release evoked by ES and K+. Agents that increase intracellular cyclic (c)AMP levels, such as dibutyryl cAMP (0.5 mM), the phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro 20-1724 (0.1 mM), and the activators of adenylate cyclase, forskolin (0.005 mM) and NaF (2 mM) reduced tritium secretion elicited by ES and K+. However, the intracellular increase of cyclic GMP (cGMP) caused by 8-Br-cGMP did not affect this secretion. Dipyridamole (0.05 mM) and the adenosine deaminase inhibitor erythro-9-2-hydroxy-3 nonyl adenosine (EHNA; 0.1 mM) also produced inhibition of tritium secretion elicited by ES and K+. Dipyridamole reduced both the uptake of [3H]NA and [3H]adenosine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) 	J._Pharm._Pharmacol.	D016428 D013485

Metastasis is the reason for most cancer death, and a crucial primary step for cancer metastasis is invasion of the surrounding tissue, which may be initiated by some rare tumor cells that escape the heterogeneous primary tumor. In this study, we isolated invasive subpopulations of cancer cells from human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) H460 and H1299 cell lines, and determined the gene expression profiles and the responses of these invasive cancer cells to treatments of ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic agents. The subpopulation of highly invasive NSCLC cells showed epigenetic signatures of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cancer cell stemness, increased DNA damage repair and cell survival signaling. We also investigated the epigenetic therapy potential of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) on invasive cancer cells, and found that SAHA suppresses cancer cell invasiveness and sensitizes cancer cells to treatments of IR and chemotherapeutic agents. Our results provide guidelines for identification of metastatic predictors and for clinical management of NSCLC. This study also suggests a beneficial clinical potential of SAHA as a chemotherapeutic agent for NSCLC patients. 	Oncotarget	D016428
23215728	20121211	Interleukin-1 beta polymorphisms are associated with lymph node metastasis in Korean patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma.	In this study, we investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the interleukin-1 beta (IL-1B) were associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). We also assessed the relationships between IL-1B SNPs and the clinicopathologic characteristics of PTC patients. Ninety-three PTC patients and 324 controls were recruited. The patients with PTC were dichotomized and compared with respect to the clinicopathologic characteristics of PTC. Seven SNPs in the IL-1B gene were selected and genotyped using direct sequencing. Four SNPs (rs1143627, rs3136558, rs1143633, and rs1143643) in the IL-1B gene were significantly associated with PTC (p &lt; 0.05). In clinicopathologic features, 3 SNPs (rs1143630, rs1143633, and rs1143643) showed a strong relationship with lymph node metastasis of PTC. The genotype and allele frequencies of rs1143630 and rs1143643 remained significantly associated with lymph node metastasis after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. In haplotype analysis, two linkage disequilibrium blocks (block 1 consisted of rs1143627, rs3917356, and rs1143630; block 2 consisted of rs1143633 and rs1143643) also revealed significant associations with lymph node metastasis. Our results suggest that IL-1B polymorphisms may be associated with the risk of PTC in the Korean population. Especially, IL-1B polymorphisms might be a predictive factor for lymph node metastasis of PTC patients. 	Immunol._Invest.	D016428 D013485
27685950	20160930	Comparison of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutations between Metastatic Lymph Node Diagnosed by EBUS-TBNA and Primary Tumor in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.	Although the use of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is increasing for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) testing in lung cancer, the discordance rate in EGFR mutations between lymph node (LN) samples obtained by EBUS-TBNA and primary tumor (PT) is not well known. Thus, we compared the EGFR mutation status of LN samples obtained by EBUS-TBNA and PTs to estimate the efficacy of using EBUS-TBNA specimens for EGFR testing in advanced, non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Using data of patients from the EBUS-TBNA database (N = 1914) obtained between January 2009 and January 2013, we identified 100 treatment-na?ve, advanced, non-squamous NSCLC patients (stage 3 and 4) with matched LN specimens obtained by EBUS-TBNA and PT specimens. Of these, 74 patients with paired specimens were feasible for EGFR mutation analysis, which we performed using a direct sequencing method. Of the 74 cases, at least one major [exon 19 deleted (19del) and L858R] or minor (T790M, exon 20 insertion, and other point mutations) EGFR mutation was detected in 31 cases (41.9%), which included PT (n = 31, 41.9%) and LN (n = 28, 37.8%) specimens. Major mutations were detected in 25 PT (33.8%, 19del = 13, L858R = 12) and 22 LN (29.8%, 19del = 11, L858R = 11) specimens. The discordance rate in major mutations between matched PT and LN specimens was 4.1% (3/74). Among minor mutations, T790M was detected in LN specimen only in 2 cases with L858R in PT and LN. The discordance rate major and minor EGFR mutations combined between matched PT and LN specimens was 12% (9/74). We observed a high concordance rate of major EGFR mutations between matched LN specimens sampled by EBUS-TBNA and PTs, suggesting that LN samples obtained by EBUS-TBNA from advanced non-squamous NSCLC patients are effective for use in EGFR mutation testing.

9232873	19970701	The N-terminal propeptide of the precursor to sporamin acts as a vacuole-targeting signal even at the C terminus of the mature part in tobacco cells.	An asparagine-proline-isoleucine-arginine-leucine (NPIRL) and its related sequences in the N-terminal propeptides (NTPP) of several plant vacuolar proteins, including that of sporamin from sweet potato (SPO) function as vacuole-targeting determinants in a manner that is distinct from the vacuole-targeting determinant in the CTPPs of other plant vacuolar proteins. When the mutant precursor to sporamin, SPO-NTPP (in which NTPP was moved to the C terminus of the mature part), was expressed in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cells, the pro-form was efficiently targeted to the vacuole and the NTPP was cleaved off. Unlike the results obtained with the wild-type precursor, substitution of the NPIRL sequence in the C-terminally located NTPP to asparagine-proline-glycine-arginine-leucine in the SPO-isoleucine-28-to-glycine mutant resulted in missorting of less than 20% of the pro-form to the medium. Unlike the vacuolar transport of SPO-NTPP, the vacuolar transport of SPO-isoleucine-28-to-glycine was strongly inhibited by 33 microM wortmannin, which is similar to the C-terminal propeptide-mediated vacuolar transport. These results suggest that the vacuole-targeting function of the NPIRL sequence is not strictly dependent on its location at the N terminus of a protein and that the C-terminally located mutant NTPP acquired some physicochemical properties of the C-terminal vacuole-targeting sequence.

21063116	20101111	Molecular analysis of aquaporin genes 1 to 4 in patients with Meni?re's disease.	Meni?re's Disease (MD) is an episodic cochleovestibular dysfunction of unknown etiology, still lacking a specific test and therapy. The proposed theories on the pathophysiology include genetic factors and factors relating to inner ear homeostasis. Various aquaporins (AQP), water channels, expressed in the inner ear and the vestibular organ, are involved in homeostasis. Mutations in AQP genes could result in disturbed inner ear homeostasis and endolymphatic hydrops, and therefore be involved in the pathogenesis of MD. To search for mutations in AQP1 to 4 in patients suffering from MD. In patients with definite MD, DNA was extracted from whole blood. The coding sequences of AQP1 to 4 were amplified by PCR reaction and sequenced. One sequence alteration, homozygous c.105G-&gt;C (conservative change without alteration of amino acid) in AQP3 was detected in 11 out of 34 patients but not in 100 control chromosomes. By itself the detected alteration is unlikely to play a role in the pathogenesis of MD. However, together with an additional modifying gene an effect can not be excluded. Additional regions (introns, splice-sites) and other genes involved in inner ear homeostasis need to be analyzed to identify a possible molecular alteration in MD. 	Cell._Physiol._Biochem.

21944974	20110928	Molecular pathology of MELAS and L-arginine effects.	The pathogenic mechanism of stroke-like episodes seen in mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) has not been clarified yet. About 80% of MELAS patients have an A3243G mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene, which is the base change at position 14 in the consensus structure of tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene. This review aims to give an overview on the actual knowledge about the pathogenic mechanism of mitochondrial cytopathy at the molecular levels, the possible pathogenic mechanism of mitochondrial angiopathy to cause stroke-like episodes at the clinical and pathophysiological levels, and the proposed site of action of l-arginine therapy on MELAS. Molecular pathogenesis is mainly demonstrated using ?(0) cybrid system. The mutation creates the protein synthesis defects caused by 1) decreased life span of steady state amount of tRNA(Leu(UUR)) molecules; 2) decreased ratio of aminoacyl-tRNA(Leu(UUR)) versus uncharged tRNA(Leu(UUR)) molecules; 3) the accumulation of aminoacylation with leucine without any misacylation; 4) accumulation of processing intermediates such as RNA 19, 5) wobble modification defects. All of these loss of function abnormalities are created by the threshold effects of cell or organ to the mitochondrial energy requirement when they establish the phenotype. Mitochondrial angiopathy demonstrated by muscle or brain pathology, as SSV (SDH strongly stained vessels), and by vascular physiology using FMD (flow mediated dilation). MELAS patients show decreased capacity of NO dependent vasodilation because of the low plasma levels of l-arginine and/or of respiratory chain dysfunction. Although the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood in stroke-like episodes in MELAS, l-arginine therapy improved endothelial dysfunction. Though the molecular pathogenesis of an A3243G or T3271C mutation of mitochondrial tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene has been clarified as a mitochondrial cytopathy, the underlying mechanisms of stroke-like episodes in MELAS are not completely understood. At this point, l-arginine therapy showed promise in treating of the stroke-like episodes in MELAS. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Biochemistry of Mitochondria.

24034842	20130917	[Relation of IL-17 polymorphisms and serum levels in patients with chronic HCV infection].	To investigate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the interleukin 17 (IL-17) gene and serum protein levels in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. A total of 228 patients with chronic HCV infection and 81 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The frequencies of IL-17 rs8193036 and rs2275913 polymorphisms were detected by the TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. Serum levels of IL-17 protein were detected by ELISA. Pairwise comparisons were made by the Chi-square test, and the significance of between-group differences was assessed by the Student's t-test with P less than 0.05. The patients with chronic HCV infection and the healthy controls showed similar frequencies of the rs8193036 C/T allele (x2 = 1.428, P = 0.232) and the rs2275913 A/G allele (x2 = 0.106, P = 0.744). In addition, the two groups showed similar distribution of the rs8193036 CC (chronic HCV infection: 46.49% vs. healthy controls: 41.98%), CT (45.61% vs. 44.44%) and TT (7.89% vs. 13.58%) genotypes (x2 = 2.346, P = 0.309), and of the rs2275913 AA (16.23% vs. 13.58%), AG (48.25% vs. 50.62%) and GG (35.53% vs. 35.80%) genotypes (x2 = 0.340, P = 0.844). Subgroup analysis of chronic HCV infection patients stratified according to HCV genotypes 1 and 2 showed no differences in the distribution of rs8193036 and rs2275913 alleles (x2 = 1.127, P = 0.288; x2 = 1.088, P = 0.297) and genotypes (x2 = 2.825, P = 0.246; x2 = 0.970, P = 0.616). However, the chronic HCV infection group did show significantly higher levels of serum IL-17 than the controls (97.67+/-39.68 vs. 71.60+/-19.78 pg/ml, t = 2.414, P = 0.033). Chronic HCV infection is associated with increased serum IL-17; however, the IL-17 polymorphisms rs8193036 and rs2275913 were not associated with chronic HCV infection susceptibility in this study's Chinese cohort.

26187647	20150719	Macrolides rapidly inhibit red blood cell invasion by the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum.	Malaria invasion of red blood cells involves multiple parasite-specific targets that are easily accessible to inhibitory compounds, making it an attractive target for antimalarial development. However, no current antimalarial agents act against host cell invasion. Here, we demonstrate that the clinically used macrolide antibiotic azithromycin, which is known to kill human malaria asexual blood-stage parasites by blocking protein synthesis in their apicoplast, is also a rapid inhibitor of red blood cell invasion in human (Plasmodium falciparum) and rodent (P. berghei) malarias. Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that the action of azithromycin in inhibiting parasite invasion of red blood cells is independent of its inhibition of protein synthesis in the parasite apicoplast, opening up a new strategy to develop a single drug with multiple parasite targets. We identified derivatives of azithromycin and erythromycin that are better invasion inhibitors than parent compounds, offering promise for development of this novel antimalarial strategy. Safe and effective macrolide antibiotics with dual modalities could be developed to combat malaria and reduce the parasite's options for resistance. 	BMC_Biol.	D016428 D013485
22155194	20111214	Arg 901 in the AE1 C-terminal tail is involved in conformational change but not in substrate binding.	In our previous paper, we demonstrated that Arg 901 in the C-terminal tail of human AE1 (band 3, anion exchanger 1) had a functional role in conformational change during anion exchange. To further examine how Arg 901 is involved in conformational change, we expressed various Arg 901 mutants and alanine mutants of the C-terminal tail (from Leu 886 to Val 911) on the plasma membrane of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and evaluated the kinetic parameters of sulfate ion transport. As a result, Vmax decreased as the hydrophobicities of the 901st and peripheral hydrophilic residues increased, indicating that the hydrophobicity of the C-terminal residue is involved in the conformational change. We also found the alkali and protease resistance of the C-terminal region after Arg 901 modification with hydroxyphenylglyoxal (HPG) or phenylglyoxal (PG), a hydrophobic reagent. These results suggested that the increased hydrophobicity of the C-terminal region around Arg 901 leads to inefficient conformational change by the newly produced hydrophobic interaction.

14701904	20040101	Monitoring protein stability and aggregation in vivo by real-time fluorescent labeling.	In vivo fluorescent labeling of an expressed protein has enabled the observation of its stability and aggregation directly in bacterial cells. Mammalian cellular retinoic acid-binding protein I (CRABP I) was mutated to incorporate in a surface-exposed omega loop the sequence Cys-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-Cys, which binds specifically to a biarsenical fluorescein dye (FlAsH). Unfolding of labeled tetra-Cys CRABP I is accompanied by enhancement of FlAsH fluorescence, which made it possible to determine the free energy of unfolding of this protein by urea titration in cells and to follow in real time the formation of inclusion bodies by a slow-folding, aggregationprone mutant (FlAsH-labeled P39A tetra-Cys CRABP I). Aggregation in vivo displayed a concentration-dependent apparent lag time similar to observations of protein aggregation in purified in vitro model systems. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.

Large multifunctional protease LMP2 (Arg60--&gt;His), LMP7 (Lys145--&gt;Gln) and PSMA6 (C(-8)--&gt;G) gene allelic polymorphisms in 147 young patients with essential hypertension and in 208 practically healthy people were determinated. It was shown that interrelation of genotypes Arg/Arg, Arg/His and His/His in LMP2 gene polymorphisms account 42.5 %, 46.4% and 11.1% correspondingly (in control--63.9%, 28.6%, 7.5%; P = 0.001 by c2-test).

26779242	20160119	Evidence that KARRIKIN-INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2) Receptors may Perceive an Unknown Signal that is not Karrikin or Strigolactone.	The ?/?-hydrolases KAI2 and D14 are paralogous receptors for karrikins and strigolactones, two classes of plant growth regulators with butenolide moieties. KAI2 and D14 act in parallel signaling pathways that share a requirement for the F-box protein MAX2, but produce distinct growth responses by regulating different members of the SMAX1-LIKE/D53 family. kai2 and max2 mutants share seed germination, seedling growth, leaf shape, and petiole orientation phenotypes that are not found in d14 or SL-deficient mutants. This implies that KAI2 recognizes an unknown, endogenous signal, herein termed KAI2 ligand (KL). Recent studies of ligand-specificity among KAI2 paralogs in basal land plants and root parasitic plants suggest that karrikin and strigolactone perception may be evolutionary adaptations of KL receptors. Here we demonstrate that evolutionarily conserved KAI2c genes from two parasite species rescue multiple phenotypes of the Arabidopsis kai2 mutant, unlike karrikin-, and strigolactone-specific KAI2 paralogs. We hypothesize that KAI2c proteins recognize KL, which could be an undiscovered hormone. 	Front_Plant_Sci	D016428
23133759	20121108	The MAPK MEK1/2-ERK1/2 Pathway and Its Implication in Hepatocyte Cell Cycle Control.	Primary cultures of hepatocytes are powerful models in studying the sequence of events that are necessary for cell progression from a G0-like state to S phase. The models mimic the physiological process of hepatic regeneration after liver injury or partial hepatectomy. Many reports suggest that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK1/2 can support hepatocyte proliferation in vitro and in vivo and the MEK/ERK cascade acts as an essential element in hepatocyte responses induced by the EGF. Moreover, its disregulation has been associated with the promotion of tumor cell growth of a variety of tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma. Whereas the strict specificity of action of ERK1 and ERK2 is still debated, the MAPKs may have specific biological functions under certain contexts and according to the differentiation status of the cells, notably hepatocytes. In this paper, we will focus on MEK1/2-ERK1/2 activations and roles in normal rodent hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo after partial hepatectomy and in human hepatocarcinoma cells. The possible specificity of ERK1 and ERK2 in normal and transformed hepatocyte will be discussed in regard to other differentiated and undifferentiated cellular models. 	Int_J_Hepatol	D016428
26286479	20150820	Local atomic structure modulations activate metal oxide as electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution in acidic water.	Modifications of local structure at atomic level could precisely and effectively tune the capacity of materials, enabling enhancement in the catalytic activity. Here we modulate the local atomic structure of a classical but inert transition metal oxide, tungsten trioxide, to be an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution in acidic water, which has shown promise as an alternative to platinum. Structural analyses and theoretical calculations together indicate that the origin of the enhanced activity could be attributed to the tailored electronic structure by means of the local atomic structure modulations. We anticipate that suitable structure modulations might be applied on other transition metal oxides to meet the optimal thermodynamic and kinetic requirements, which may pave the way to unlock the potential of other promising candidates as cost-effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution in industry.

26552668	20151111	High efficacy of the MACOP-B regimen in the treatment of adult Langerhans cell histiocytosis, a 20 year experience.	Adult Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is an orphan disease. Chemotherapy is usually reserved to patients presenting with single system multifocal (SS-m) or multisystem (MS) disease but due to the lack of randomized studies no standard first line therapy has been defined yet. Pediatric regimens based on the vinblastine/prednisone backbone are not well tolerated in adults and probably less effective. We previously demonstrated high efficacy of the dose dense polichemotherapy regimen MACOP-B in 7 adult patients with SS-m or MS-LCH, in terms of high response rate and durable responses. Here we report an update of these data with the purpose of evaluating the long term efficacy of MACOP-B in adult LCH. Clinical data of all adult LCH patients (n?=?17) diagnosed and treated at our Institution during the past 20-year period were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 11 patients (6 with SS-m and 5 with MS-LCH) were treated with MACOP-B from 1995 to 2014. The overall response rate was confirmed to be 100 %, with a complete response of 73 % and a partial response rate of 27 %. Overall progression free survival was 64 %, and disease free survival after achievement of initial CR was 87 %. Overall survival rate was 82 % after 6.7 years of median follow-up. These data confirm high activity of MACOP-B in adult LCH, indicating that a substantial fraction of patients achieve long lasting responses and can be cured with this therapeutic approach.

20700534	20100812	Superpose3D: a local structural comparison program that allows for user-defined structure representations.	Local structural comparison methods can be used to find structural similarities involving functional protein patches such as enzyme active sites and ligand binding sites. The outcome of such analyses is critically dependent on the representation used to describe the structure. Indeed different categories of functional sites may require the comparison program to focus on different characteristics of the protein residues. We have therefore developed superpose3D, a novel structural comparison software that lets users specify, with a powerful and flexible syntax, the structure description most suited to the requirements of their analysis. Input proteins are processed according to the user's directives and the program identifies sets of residues (or groups of atoms) that have a similar 3D position in the two structures. The advantages of using such a general purpose program are demonstrated with several examples. These test cases show that no single representation is appropriate for every analysis, hence the usefulness of having a flexible program that can be tailored to different needs. Moreover we also discuss how to interpret the results of a database screening where a known structural motif is searched against a large ensemble of structures. The software is written in C++ and is released under the open source GPL license. Superpose3D does not require any external library, runs on Linux, Mac OSX, Windows and is available at http://cbm.bio.uniroma2.it/superpose3D. 	PLoS_ONE	D003160 D016428 D013485
26726844	20160105	Disease-causing mutations of RhoGDI? induce Rac1 hyperactivation in podocytes.	Nephrotic syndrome (NS) describes a group of kidney disorders in which there is injury to podocyte cells, specialized cells within the kidney's glomerular filtration barrier, allowing proteins to leak into the urine. Three mutations in ARHGDIA, which encodes Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor ? (GDI?), have been reported in patients with heritable NS and encode the following amino acid changes: ?D185, R120X, and G173V. To investigate the impact of these mutations on podocyte function, endogenous GDI? was knocked-down in cultured podocytes by shRNA and then the cells were re-transfected with wild-type or mutant GDI? constructs. Among the 3 prototypical Rho-GTPases, Rac1 was markedly hyperactivated in podocytes with any of the 3 mutant forms of GDI? while the activation of RhoA and Cdc42 was modest and variable. All three mutant GDI? proteins resulted in slow podocyte motility, suggesting that podocytes are sensitive to the relative balance of Rho-GTPase activity. In ?D185 podocytes, both random and directional movements were impaired and kymograph analysis of the leading edge showed increased protrusion and retraction of leading edge (phase switching). The mutant podocytes also showed impaired actin polymerization, smaller cell size, and increased cellular projections. In the developing kidney, GDI? expression increased as podocytes matured. Conversely, active Rac1 was detected only in immature, but not in mature, podocytes. The results indicate that GDI? has a critical role in suppressing Rac1 activity in mature podocytes, to prevent podocyte injury and nephrotic syndrome. 	Small_GTPases	D016428
19903051	20091112	Neurokinin 1 receptor gene polymorphism might be correlated with recurrence rates in endometriosis.	Dysmenorrhoea is the major symptom in women with endometriosis. Recently, pain modulation through Neurokinin-1-receptor (NK1R) pathways have been investigated in neuropathic pain patients. Aim of this study was, therefore, to examine the effect of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the NK1R gene on the susceptibility for endometriosis and the disease free survival (DFS) after surgery for endometriosis. A case-control study was conducted and germline DNA was isolated. Patients were followed up for a recurrence of the disease up to 4 years. Case-control analyses were performed for parameters of the medical history and the genotype of the NK1R-SNP rs881. Furthermore, DFS probabilities were calculated. Concerning the DFS preoperative pain levels and the NK1R genotype were independent predictors for a recurrence with hazard ratios of 2.55 (95% CI: 1.32-4.95) for patients with a high preoperative pain level and 0.44 for patients with a heterozygous or homozygous variant genotype in rs881 (95% CI: 0.21-0.88). The polymorphism rs811 seems to be associated with a lower recurrence risk in endometriosis patients. Thus, there might be a clinical relevant role of the NK1 pathway in the pain perception of endometriosis patients. 	Gynecol._Endocrinol.	D016428
27400804	20160713	A movement disorder with dystonia and ataxia caused by a mutation in the HIBCH gene.	Recessive mutations in the 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase gene (HIBCH) are associated with a rare neurodegenerative disease that affects the basal ganglia. Most patients die during infancy or early childhood. Here we describe 5 adolescent and adult patients from 2 unrelated families, who presented with a movement disorder and MRI features suggestive of Leigh syndrome. Clinical and metabolic assessment was followed by autozygosity mapping and whole exome and Sanger sequencing. HIBCH enzyme activity and the bioenergetic profile were determined in patient fibroblasts. The movement disorder was dominated by ataxia in one family and by dystonia in the other. All affected family members carried the identical homozygous c.913A&gt;G (p.T305A) HIBCH mutation. Enzyme activity was reduced, and a valine challenge reduced the oxygen consumption rate. We report the first adult patients with HIBCH deficiency and a disease course much milder than previously reported, thereby expanding the HIBCH-associated phenotypic spectrum. ? 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

8629113	19950101	Molecular mechanisms of thalassemia in southeast Asia.	Hemoglobinopathies are the most common genetic disorders in Southeast Asia. alpha-Thalassemia is most often due to a alpha-globin gene deletion. Hb Constant Spring (CS) occurs from the mutation at the termination codon of the alpha-globin gene resulting in an elongated polypeptide; alpha(CS)-globin mRNA is also unstable and only small amounts of Hb CS are produced. Thus Hb CS has an alpha-thalassemia 2-like effect. beta-Thalassemia results from a variety of molecular mechanisms, most of which are single base substitutions or deletions or insertions of one to four nucleotides. Hemoglobin E occurs from a Glu --&gt; Lys substitution at position 26 of the beta-globin chain. The abnormal gene also results in reduced amounts of beta E-mRNA and hence of beta E-globin chains. Therefore, Hb E has a mild beta + thalassemia phenotype. Homozygous beta-thalassemia and beta-thalassemia/Hb E are the major beta-thalassemic syndromes in Southeast Asia. In spite of seemingly identical genotypes, severity of beta-thalassemia/Hb E patients can vary greatly. Some may have a severe clinical disorder approaching that seen in homozygous beta-thalassemia. A number of genetic factors have been shown to determine the differences in severity of anemia in beta-thalassemia/Hb E, including co-inheritance of alpha-thalassemia determinants and co-inheritance of other determinants which elevate Hb F expression. A correlation between the extent of beta E-globin mRNA cryptic splicing and the severity of anemia in beta(zero)-thalassemia/Hb E patients has been observed. Complete characterization of mutations causing hemoglobinopathies will help to bolster the establishment of prenatal diagnosis of these genetic disorders in the region.

The etiology of diabetic nephropathy depends partly on genetic factors. Elevated systemic and intraglomerular blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate, partly regulated by the renin-angiotensin system, increase the risk of diabetic nephropathy. The present case-control study investigated the association of the rs5186 polymorphism, in the angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene (AGTR1), with diabetic nephropathy. The study included 3561 patients with type 1 diabetes from Denmark, Finland, France and Sweden. Microalbuminuria was defined as albumin excretion rate (AER) ?20 to &lt;200 ?g/min or albumin concentration ?30 to &lt;300 mg/l (n=707), macroalbuminuria was defined as AER?200 ?g/min or ?300 mg/l (n=1546), and patients with renal replacement therapy were also included in this group. The controls had &gt;15 years diabetes duration, AER &lt;20 ?g/min or &lt;30 mg/l, and no antihypertensive treatment (n=1308). AA genotype of the rs5186 polymorphism significantly increased the risk of diabetic nephropathy in male patients, OR=1.27 (95% CI=1.02-1.58), P=0.03, adjusted for age at diabetes onset, HbA1c, diabetes duration, smoking and country of origin. Among the women, there were no significant associations between rs5186 and diabetic nephropathy, OR=0.89 (0.71-1.11), P=0.30. We conclude that the AGTR1 gene may be associated with increased risk of diabetic nephropathy in men with type 1 diabetes. 	Mol._Genet._Metab.	D016428 D013485
21282435	20110202	Positive impact of HIV-1 gag cleavage site mutations on the virological response to darunavir boosted with ritonavir.	We assessed the roles of baseline gag and gag-pol cleavage site mutations (CSM) on the virological outcome of a darunavir-based regimen in highly antiretroviral-experienced patients. We showed the association, in multivariate analysis, between the A431V gag CSM and the virological response, defined as a reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA to &lt;50 copies/ml at month 3 (P = 0.028). Our results suggest that a specific gag CSM might have a role on protease inhibitor susceptibility in an inhibitor-specific manner. 	Antimicrob._Agents_Chemother.	D016428 D013485
23368899	20130202	SymGRASS: a database of sugarcane orthologous genes involved in arbuscular mycorrhiza and root nodule symbiosis.	The rationale for gathering information from plants procuring nitrogen through symbiotic interactions controlled by a common genetic program for a sustainable biofuel production is the high energy demanding application of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. We curated sequence information publicly available for the biofuel plant sugarcane, performed an analysis of the common SYM pathway known to control symbiosis in other plants, and provide results, sequences and literature links as an online database. Sugarcane sequences and informations were downloaded from the nucEST database, cleaned and trimmed with seqclean, assembled with TGICL plus translating mapping method, and annotated. The annotation is based on BLAST searches against a local formatted plant Uniprot90 generated with CD-HIT for functional assignment, rpsBLAST to CDD database for conserved domain analysis, and BLAST search to sorghum's for Gene Ontology (GO) assignment. Gene expression was normalized according the Unigene standard, presented as ESTs/100 kb. Protein sequences known in the SYM pathway were used as queries to search the SymGRASS sequence database. Additionally, antimicrobial peptides described in the PhytAMP database served as queries to retrieve and generate expression profiles of these defense genes in the libraries compared to the libraries obtained under symbiotic interactions. We describe the SymGRASS, a database of sugarcane orthologous genes involved in arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and root nodule (RN) symbiosis. The database aggregates knowledge about sequences, tissues, organ, developmental stages and experimental conditions, and provides annotation and level of gene expression for sugarcane transcripts and SYM orthologous genes in sugarcane through a web interface. Several candidate genes were found for all nodes in the pathway, and interestingly a set of symbiosis specific genes was found. The knowledge integrated in SymGRASS may guide studies on molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms by which sugarcane controls the establishment and efficiency of endophytic associations. We believe that the candidate sequences for the SYM pathway together with the pool of exclusively expressed tentative consensus (TC) sequences are crucial for the design of molecular studies to unravel the mechanisms controlling the establishment of symbioses in sugarcane, ultimately serving as a basis for the improvement of grass crops.

8124819	19940301	Radiofrequency catheter ablation guided by intracardiac echocardiography.	Radiofrequency catheter ablation requires precise positioning of the ablation electrode. Fluoroscopically guided catheter manipulation has limitations, and there are risks of radiation exposure. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of guiding catheter ablation within the right atrium with catheter-based intracardiac echocardiography. A 10F, 10-MHz intracardiac imaging catheter was used to direct an ablation electrode at four or five anatomic landmarks in the right atrium. Thirty-eight radiofrequency energy applications were performed in nine anesthetized dogs, and 38 lesions were identified on pathological examination. Lesions were created a mean of 1.9 +/- 2.1 mm from the ultrasound-guided site. Twenty-six of 38 lesions (68%) were less than 2.2 mm from the imaged site. Intracardiac echocardiography also was used to confirm stable electrode-endocardial contact in 37 energy applications (97%) and identified catheter movement in 9 energy applications (24%). Discrete lesions, microcavitations, and thrombi were observed in 13 (34%), 23 (61%), and 19 (50%) of 38 energy applications, respectively. Microcavitations predicted the appearance of thrombus. Fluoroscopy time required to create four or five lesions decreased from 23 minutes in the first study to less than 2 minutes in the last five studies. Catheter-based intracardiac echocardiography can accurately guide catheter ablation directed at anatomic landmarks and potentially reduced ionizing radiation exposure. Intracardiac imaging can be used to confirm endocardial contact, identify electrode movement, and directly visualize lesions. Intracardiac echocardiography also can be used to identify microcavitations, which predict thrombus formation during radiofrequency energy applications. 	Circulation	D016428 D013485 D013486
15034781	20040323	Variants of CYP46A1 may interact with age and APOE to influence CSF Abeta42 levels in Alzheimer's disease.	Recent studies have suggested that variants of CYP46A1, encoding cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46), confer risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prospect substantiated by evidence of genetic association from several quantitative traits related to AD pathology, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the 42 amino-acid cleavage product of beta-amyloid (Abeta42) and the tau protein. In the present study, these claims have been explored by the genotyping of previously associated markers in CYP46A1 in three independent northern European case-control series encompassing 1323 individuals and including approximately 400 patients with measurements of CSF Abeta42 and phospho-tau protein levels. Tests of association in case-control models revealed limited evidence that CYP46A1 variants contributed to AD risk across these samples. However, models testing for potential effects upon CSF measures suggested a possible interaction of an intronic marker (rs754203) with age and APOE genotype. In stratified analyses, significant effects were evident that were restricted to elderly APOE epsilon4 carriers for both CSF Abeta42 ( P=0.0009) and phospho-tau ( P=0.046). Computational analyses indicate that the rs754203 marker probably does not impact the binding of regulatory factors, suggesting that other polymorphic sites underlie the observed associations. Our results provide an important independent replication of previous findings, supporting the existence of CYP46A1 sequence variants that contribute to variability in beta-amyloid metabolism.

28123333	20170127	Clinical, molecular, and genetic evaluation of galactosemia in Turkish children.	Galactosemia is a carbohydrate metabolism disorder with autosomal recessive inheritance. The most frequent enzyme deficiency is galactose-1-phosphate-uridylytransferase, which causes classic galactosemia. When the enzyme is absent, an infant cannot metabolize galactose-1-phosphate and it cumulates in liver, kidney, brain, tongue, lens, and skin. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and molecular characteristics of patients with galactosemia, which is observed more frequently in our country than anywhere else in the world. This is a retrospective study that includes the moleculer and genetic charcteristics of 14 patient who were diagnosed as having galactosemia between January 2009 and January 2011. Nine patients were male and 5 female. Consanguineous marriage was detected in the family history of 7 patients. One patient had a history of a deceased sibling with a confirmed diagnosis of galactosemia. The main reasons for admission to the hospital were jaundice in 9, hypoglycemia in 2, sepsis in 2, and elevated liver enzymes in 1 patient. The Beutler test was positive in all patients. The mean enzyme activity was 0.36?0.26 ?mol/mL. Only 6 of our cases were diagnosed in the early period (first 15 days). Cataract was present in four patients. Q188R mutation was observed in 13 patients, and homozygote N314D and homozygote E340X mutations were observed in one patient. Three patients had impaired neurologic development according to the Denver Developmental Screening Test II. The most common genetic abnormality was Q188R mutation. Only 43% of our patients's disease could be diagnosed at an early stage. We suggest that galactosemia should be included in the national newborn screening program in order to make earlier diagnoses.

26098463	20150623	Halo and Through-Focus Performance of Four Diffractive Multifocal Intraocular Lenses.	To compare, as a function of pupil size, the through-focus performance and halo features of four diffractive intraocular lenses (IOLs). Three diffractive bifocal IOLs (ReSTOR +2.5 D SV25T0, Tecnis +2.75 D ZKB00, and AT LISA +3.75 D 809M) and a diffractive trifocal IOL (AT LISA tri +3.33 D, +1.66 D 839MP) were tested in vitro in a modified International Organization for Standardization eye model. The modulation transfer function (MTF) at the IOLs' foci was obtained with pupils ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 mm. Through-focus MTF curves (at 50 cycles/mm) were compared among all the IOLs. The halo formation and characteristics were obtained from image analysis. The multifocal IOLs studied in this work showed, at their foci, secondary out-of-focus images, which originate halos and whose characteristics depend on the lens design and pupil size. The smallest halo occurred for the distance focus of the SV25T0. The distance and near foci of the SV25T0 yielded, respectively, the best and lowest optical quality among the studied IOLs. The distance focus of the ZKB00, AT LISA, and AT LISA tri were of similar quality, but the near focus of the ZKB00 outperformed the near foci of the rest of the IOLs. The IOLs' optical performance gradually deteriorates as pupil increases. Differences in the design of the diffractive IOLs translate into differences in optical quality at their foci, through-focus performance, and halo features, which can offer further information to surgeons when selecting which IOL to implant.

25248379	20140925	STAT3 mediates regorafenib-induced apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma.	Here, we aim to investigate the molecular mechanism of regorafenib and verify the potential druggable target for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC cell lines (PLC5, HepG2, Hep3B, SK-Hep1, and HA59T) were used to investigate the in vitro effect of regorafenib. Phosphatase activity was analyzed in HCC cells and purified SHP-1 proteins. PLC5-bearing mice were used to test the therapeutic efficiency of 20 and 40 mg/kg/d treatment with regorafenib ([Formula: see text] mice). The clinical relevance of STAT3 signaling was investigated with 142 tumor samples from different patients with HCC. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to compare the baseline characteristics of patients and the expression of p-STAT3. Regorafenib inhibited STAT3-related signaling in a dose-dependent manner and was a more potent inhibitor of STAT3 than sorafenib. Regorafenib increased SHP-1 phosphatase activity in purified SHP-1 protein directly. N-SH2 domain deletion and D61A mutants mimicking open-form SHP-1 partially abolished regorafenib-induced STAT3 inhibition and apoptosis. Importantly, a higher level of expression of STAT3 was found in patients with advanced clinical stages (P = 0.009) and poorly differentiated tumors (P = 0.035). Regorafenib induced significant tumor inhibition by relieving the autoinhibited N-SH2 domain of SHP-1 directly and inhibiting p-STAT3 signals. STAT3 may be suitable as a prognostic marker of HCC development, and may be a druggable target for HCC-targeted therapy using regorafenib. 	Clin._Cancer_Res.	D016428 D013485
22888144	20120814	Target binding properties and cellular activity of afatinib (BIBW 2992), an irreversible ErbB family blocker.	Deregulation of the ErbB (proto-oncogene B of the avian erythroblastosis virus AEV-H strain) receptor network is well recognized as an oncogenic driver in epithelial cancers. Several targeted drugs have been developed, including antibodies and small-molecule kinase inhibitors, each of them characterized by distinct patterns of ErbB receptor interactions. Understanding the precise pharmacological properties of these compounds is important for optimal use in clinical practice. Afatinib [BIBW 2992; N-[4-[(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)amino]-7-[[(3S)-tetrahydro-3-furanyl]oxy]-6-quinazolinyl]-4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide] is an ATP-competitive anilinoquinazoline derivative harboring a reactive acrylamide group. It was designed to covalently bind and irreversibly block enzymatically active ErbB receptor family members. Here, we show by X-ray crystallography the covalent binding of afatinib to wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and by mass spectrometry the covalent interaction with EGFR, EGFRL858R/T790M, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and ErbB-4. Afatinib potently inhibits the enymatic activity of ErbB-4 (EC50=1 nM) and the proliferation of cancer cell lines driven by multiple ErbB receptor aberrations at concentrations below 100 nM. N-[4-[(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)amino]-7-[[(3S)-tetrahydro-3-furanyl]oxy]-6-quinazolinyl]-4-(dimethylamino)-2-butanamide (BI 37781), a close analog of afatinib lacking the acrylamide group and thus incapable of covalent bond formation, had similar potency on cells driven by EGFR or EGFRL858R, but less or no detectable activity on cells expressing EGFRL858R/T790M HER2 or ErbB-4. These results stress the importance of the acrylamide group and show that afatinib differs from approved ErbB targeting agents by irreversibly inhibiting the kinase activity of all ErbB family members. They provide a mechanistic rationale for the distinct pharmacological features of this compound and explain the clinical activity seen in some patients who are resistant to antibody or kinase inhibitor therapy because of secondary mutations or ErbB receptor &quot;reprogramming.&quot; 	J._Pharmacol._Exp._Ther.

22553308	20120504	A novel CYP27B1 mutation causes a feline vitamin D-dependent rickets type IA.	A 12-week-old domestic cat presented at a local veterinary clinic with hypocalcemia and skeletal abnormalities suggestive of rickets. Osteomalacia (rickets) is a disease caused by impaired bone mineralization leading to an increased prevalence of fractures and deformity. Described in a variety of species, rickets is most commonly caused by vitamin D or calcium deficiencies owing to both environmental and or genetic abnormalities. Vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1A (VDDR-1A) is a result of the enzymatic pathway defect caused by mutations in the 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3)-1-alpha-hydroxylase gene [cytochrome P27 B1 (CYP27B1)]. Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D(3), regulates calcium homeostasis, which requires sufficient dietary calcium availability and correct hormonal function for proper bone growth and maintenance. Patient calcitriol concentrations were low while calcidiol levels were normal suggestive of VDDR-1A. The entire DNA coding sequencing of CYP27B1 was evaluated. The affected cat was wild type for previously identified VDDR-1A causative mutations. However, six novel mutations were identified, one of which was a nonsense mutation at G637T in exon 4. The exon 4 G637T nonsense mutation results in a premature protein truncation, changing a glutamic acid to a stop codon, E213X, likely causing the clinical presentation of rickets. The previously documented genetic mutation resulting in feline VDDR-1A rickets, as well as the case presented in this research, result from novel exon 4 CYP27B1 mutations, thus exon 4 should be the initial focus of future sequencing efforts.

19956566	20091204	Rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton and E-cadherin-based adherens junctions caused by neoplasic transformation change cell-cell interactions.	E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, which is essential for the maintenance of the architecture and integrity of epithelial tissues, is often lost during carcinoma progression. To better understand the nature of alterations of cell-cell interactions at the early stages of neoplastic evolution of epithelial cells, we examined the line of nontransformed IAR-2 epithelial cells and their descendants, lines of IAR-6-1 epithelial cells transformed with dimethylnitrosamine and IAR1170 cells transformed with N-RasG12D. IAR-6-1 and IAR1170 cells retained E-cadherin, displayed discoid or polygonal morphology, and formed monolayers similar to IAR-2 monolayer. Fluorescence staining, however, showed that in IAR1170 and IAR-6-1 cells the marginal actin bundle, which is typical of nontransformed IAR-2 cells, disappeared, and the continuous adhesion belt (tangential adherens junctions (AJs)) was replaced by radially oriented E-cadherin-based AJs. Time-lapse imaging of IAR-6-1 cells stably transfected with GFP-E-cadherin revealed that AJs in transformed cells are very dynamic and unstable. The regulation of AJ assembly by Rho family small GTPases was different in nontransformed and in transformed IAR epithelial cells. As our experiments with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 and the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin have shown, the formation and maintenance of radial AJs critically depend on myosin II-mediated contractility. Using the RNAi technique for the depletion of mDia1 and loading cells with N17Rac, we established that mDia1 and Rac are involved in the assembly of tangential AJs in nontransformed epithelial cells but not in radial AJs in transformed cells. Neoplastic transformation changed cell-cell interactions, preventing contact paralysis after the establishment of cell-cell contact and promoting dynamic cell-cell adhesion and motile behavior of cells. It is suggested that the disappearance of the marginal actin bundle and rearrangements of AJs may change the adhesive function of E-cadherin and play an active role in migratory activity of carcinoma cells.

20803296	20100831	Intragenic deletions and a deep intronic mutation affecting pre-mRNA splicing in the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene as novel mechanisms causing 5-fluorouracil toxicity.	Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the initial enzyme acting in the catabolism of the widely used antineoplastic agent 5-fluorouracil (5FU). DPD deficiency is known to cause a potentially lethal toxicity following administration of 5FU. Here, we report novel genetic mechanisms underlying DPD deficiency in patients presenting with grade III/IV 5FU-associated toxicity. In one patient a genomic DPYD deletion of exons 21-23 was observed. In five patients a deep intronic mutation c.1129-5923C&gt;G was identified creating a cryptic splice donor site. As a consequence, a 44 bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides c.1129-5967 to c.1129-5924 of intron 10 was inserted in the mature DPD mRNA. The deleterious c.1129-5923C&gt;G mutation proved to be in cis with three intronic polymorphisms (c.483 + 18G&gt;A, c.959-51T&gt;G, c.680 + 139G&gt;A) and the synonymous mutation c.1236G&gt;A of a previously identified haplotype. Retrospective analysis of 203 cancer patients showed that the c.1129-5923C&gt;G mutation was significantly enriched in patients with severe 5FU-associated toxicity (9.1%) compared to patients without toxicity (2.2%). In addition, a high prevalence was observed for the c.1129-5923C&gt;G mutation in the normal Dutch (2.6%) and German (3.3%) population. Our study demonstrates that a genomic deletion affecting DPYD and a deep intronic mutation affecting pre-mRNA splicing can cause severe 5FU-associated toxicity. We conclude that screening for DPD deficiency should include a search for genomic rearrangements and aberrant splicing. 	Hum._Genet.	D016428
21699787	20110625	Val66Met in brain-derived neurotrophic factor affects stimulus-induced plasticity in the human pharyngeal motor cortex.	Polymorphisms in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can affect brain and behavioral responses. However, little is known about the effects of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in BDNF, at codon 66 (the Val-Met substitution, detected in approximately 33% of the Caucasian population) on stimulation-induced plasticity in the cortico-bulbar system. We examined whether this SNP influenced outcomes of different forms of neurostimulation applied to the pharyngeal motor cortex. Thirty-eight healthy volunteers were assessed for corticobulbar excitability after single-pulse, transcranial magnetic stimulation of induced pharyngeal electromyographic responses, recorded from a swallowed intraluminal catheter. Thereafter, volunteers were conditioned with pharyngeal electrical stimulation, or 2 forms of repetitive (1 and 5 Hz) transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Repeated measurements of pharyngeal motor-evoked potentials were assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation for as long as 1 hour after the 3 forms of neurostimulation and correlated with SNPs at codon 66 of BDNF (encoding Val or Met). Pharyngeal electrical stimulation significantly increased the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials in individuals with the SNP that encoded Val66, compared to those that encoded Met66, with a strong GENOTYPE*TIME interaction (F?,??? = 2.4; P = .018). By contrast, there was a significant reduction in latencies of subjects with the SNP that encoded Met66 after 5-Hz rTMS (F?,?? = 4.9; P = .04). In addition, the expected inhibitory effect of 1-Hz rTMS on amplitude was not observed in subjects with the SNP that encoded Met66 in BDNF (F?,??? = 2.23; P = .035). An SNP in human BDNF at codon 66 affects plasticity of the pharyngeal cortex to different forms of neurostimulation. Genetic analysis might help select specific forms of neurostimulation as therapeutics for patients with disorders such as dysphagic stroke. 	Gastroenterology	D016428 D013485
25740874	20150306	Early-onset central diabetes insipidus is associated with de novo arginine vasopressin-neurophysin II or Wolfram syndrome 1 gene mutations.	Idiopathic early-onset central diabetes insipidus (CDI) might be due to mutations of arginine vasopressin-neurophysin II (AVP-NPII (AVP)) or wolframin (WFS1) genes. Sequencing of AVP and WFS1 genes was performed in nine children with CDI, aged between 9 and 68 months, and negative family history for polyuria and polydipsia. Two patients carried a mutation in the AVP gene: a heterozygous G-to-T transition at nucleotide position 322 of exon 2 (c.322G&gt;T) resulting in a stop codon at position 108 (p.Glu108X), and a novel deletion from nucleotide 52 to 54 (c.52_54delTCC) producing a deletion of a serine at position 18 (p.Ser18del) of the AVP pre-prohormone signal peptide. A third patient carried two heterozygous mutations in the WFS1 gene localized on different alleles. The first change was A-to-G transition at nucleotide 997 in exon 8 (c.997A&gt;G), resulting in a valine residue at position 333 in place of isoleucine (p.Ile333Val). The second novel mutation was a 3?bp insertion in exon 8, c.2392_2393insACG causing the addition of an aspartate residue at position 797 and the maintenance of the correct open reading frame (p. Asp797_Val798insAsp). While similar WFS1 protein levels were detected in fibroblasts from healthy subjects and from the patient and his parents, a major sensitivity to staurosporine-induced apoptosis was observed in the patient fibroblasts as well as in patients with Wolfram syndrome. Early-onset CDI is associated with de novo mutations of the AVP gene and with hereditary WFS1 gene changes. These findings have valuable implications for management and genetic counseling.

24134504	20131019	Long-term dominance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Uganda family in peri-urban Kampala-Uganda is not associated with cavitary disease.	Previous studies have shown that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) Uganda family, a sub-lineage of the MTB Lineage 4, is the main cause of tuberculosis (TB) in Uganda. Using a well characterized patient population, this study sought to determine whether there are clinical and patient characteristics associated with the success of the MTB Uganda family in Kampala. A total of 1,746 MTB clinical isolates collected from 1992-2009 in a household contact study were genotyped. Genotyping was performed using Single Nucleotide Polymorphic (SNP) markers specific for the MTB Uganda family, other Lineage 4 strains, and Lineage 3, respectively. Out of 1,746 isolates, 1,213 were from patients with detailed clinical data. These data were used to seek associations between MTB lineage/sub-lineage and patient phenotypes. Three MTB lineages were found to dominate the MTB population in Kampala during the last two decades. Overall, MTB Uganda accounted for 63% (1,092/1,746) of all cases, followed by other Lineage 4 strains accounting for 22% (394/1,746), and Lineage 3 for 11% (187/1,746) of cases, respectively. Seventy-three (4 %) strains remained unclassified. Our longitudinal data showed that MTB Uganda family occurred at the highest frequency during the whole study period, followed by other Lineage 4 strains and Lineage 3. To explore whether the long-term success of MTB Uganda family was due to increased virulence, we used cavitary disease as a proxy, as this form of TB is the most transmissible. Multivariate analysis revealed that even though cavitary disease was associated with known risk factors such as smoking (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.33-6.84) and low income (aOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.47-3.01), no association was found between MTB lineage and cavitary TB. The MTB Uganda family has been dominating in Kampala for the last 18 years, but this long-term success is not due to increased virulence as defined by cavitary disease. 	BMC_Infect._Dis.

17896521	20070928	[Molecular genetic analysis of Diego blood group Dia and Dib in Chinese Han population].	To study the molecular genetic background of Diego blood group in Chinese Han population. A total of 2990 blood samples from unrelated blood donors were phenotyped for Dia and Dib by serological method. Twenty randomly selected samples of Di(a-b+) type and all of the samples of rare Di(a+b-) phenotype by screening were genotyped by PCR-SSP and direct DNA Sequencing. Of the 2990 samples identified by serological method, 2821 were Di(a-b+), 167 were Di(a+b+) and 2 were Di(a+b-). All of the 20 randomly-selected samples with Di(a-b+) phenotype were DI2DI2 homozygote by PCR-SSP genotyping, with nucleotide C at nt position 2561 in exon 19 by direct sequencing of the DI gene. The 2 samples of rare Di (a+b-) phenotype were both the DI1DI1 homozygote, with nucleotide T at nt position 2561 in exon 19. Our results indicate that the expression of Dia and Dib antigens in Chinese Han population most likely result from a single nucleotide T to C substitution at nucleotide position 2561 in exon 19 of the DI gene, which subsequently leads to an amino acid 854 change from Pro to Leu.

24130795	20131017	New findings in a global approach to dissect the whole phenotype of PLA2G6 gene mutations.	Mutations in PLA2G6 gene have variable phenotypic outcome including infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, atypical neuroaxonal dystrophy, idiopathic neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation and Karak syndrome. The cause of this phenotypic variation is so far unknown which impairs both genetic diagnosis and appropriate family counseling. We report detailed clinical, electrophysiological, neuroimaging, histologic, biochemical and genetic characterization of 11 patients, from 6 consanguineous families, who were followed for a period of up to 17 years. Cerebellar atrophy was constant and the earliest feature of the disease preceding brain iron accumulation, leading to the provisional diagnosis of a recessive progressive ataxia in these patients. Ultrastructural characterization of patients' muscle biopsies revealed focal accumulation of granular and membranous material possibly resulting from defective membrane homeostasis caused by disrupted PLA2G6 function. Enzyme studies in one of these muscle biopsies provided evidence for a relatively low mitochondrial content, which is compatible with the structural mitochondrial alterations seen by electron microscopy. Genetic characterization of 11 patients led to the identification of six underlying PLA2G6 gene mutations, five of which are novel. Importantly, by combining clinical and genetic data we have observed that while the phenotype of neurodegeneration associated with PLA2G6 mutations is variable in this cohort of patients belonging to the same ethnic background, it is partially influenced by the genotype, considering the age at onset and the functional disability criteria. Molecular testing for PLA2G6 mutations is, therefore, indicated in childhood-onset ataxia syndromes, if neuroimaging shows cerebellar atrophy with or without evidence of iron accumulation.

26861405	20160211	Influence of Global and Local Membrane Curvature on Mechanosensitive Ion Channels: A Finite Element Approach.	Mechanosensitive (MS) channels are ubiquitous molecular force sensors that respond to a number of different mechanical stimuli including tensile, compressive and shear stress. MS channels are also proposed to be molecular curvature sensors gating in response to bending in their local environment. One of the main mechanisms to functionally study these channels is the patch clamp technique. However, the patch of membrane surveyed using this methodology is far from physiological. Here we use continuum mechanics to probe the question of how curvature, in a standard patch clamp experiment, at different length scales (global and local) affects a model MS channel. Firstly, to increase the accuracy of the Laplace's equation in tension estimation in a patch membrane and to be able to more precisely describe the transient phenomena happening during patch clamping, we propose a modified Laplace's equation. Most importantly, we unambiguously show that the global curvature of a patch, which is visible under the microscope during patch clamp experiments, is of negligible energetic consequence for activation of an MS channel in a model membrane. However, the local curvature (RL &lt; 50) and the direction of bending are able to cause considerable changes in the stress distribution through the thickness of the membrane. Not only does local bending, in the order of physiologically relevant curvatures, cause a substantial change in the pressure profile but it also significantly modifies the stress distribution in response to force application. Understanding these stress variations in regions of high local bending is essential for a complete understanding of the effects of curvature on MS channels. 	Membranes_(Basel)	D016428
12601902	20030226	[Alteration of P73 and P51 genes and its significance in human gastric carcinogenesis]	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relatinship between the expression of P51, P73 and the oncogenesis and development of human gastric carcinoma. METHODS: The expression of P73 mRNA were detected both in 32 human gastric carcinoma tissues and adjacent normal gastric tissues by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Overexpressions of P73 mRNA were found in 17/32 gastric carcinoma tissues,in 2/32 adjacent normal gastric tissues.The positive expression rate of P73 mRNA in gastric carcinooma tissues was significantly higher than in adjacent normal gastric tissues( P&lt;0.01). However, a significant correlation was found between the positive expression rate of P73 mRNA in gastric carcinoma tissues and the TNM staging(P&lt;0.05). THe low expressions of P51A mRNA and P51B were found in all gastric carcinoma tissues and adjacent normal gastric tissues. The expression of P51A in gastric carcinoma tissues were much higher than adjacent normal gastric tissues (P&lt;0.05). The expression of P51B is no significant correlation was observed between gastirc carcinoma tissues and adjacent normal gastric tissues. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that there is an overexpression odf P73 and P51A mRNA in gastric cancer tissues, and their expressions is relationship with oncogenesis and developnment of gastric carcinoma.

23508954	20130320	Cross-species analysis reveals evolving and conserved features of the nuclear factor ?B (NF-?B) proteins.	NF-?B is a key regulator of immune gene expression in metazoans. It is currently unclear what changes occurred in NF-?B during animal evolution and what features remained conserved. To address this question, we compared the biochemical and functional properties of NF-?B proteins derived from human and the starlet sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis) in 1) a high-throughput assay of in vitro preferences for DNA sequences, 2) ChIP analysis of in vivo recruitment to the promoters of target genes, 3) a LUMIER-assisted examination of interactions with cofactors, and 4) a transactivation assay. We observed a remarkable evolutionary conservation of the DNA binding preferences of the animal NF-?B orthologs. We also show that NF-?B dimerization properties, nuclear localization signals, and binding to cytosolic I?Bs are conserved. Surprisingly, the Bcl3-type nuclear I?B proteins functionally pair up only with NF-?B derived from their own species. The basis of the differential NF-?B recognition by I?B subfamilies is discussed.

14627764	20031125	Mutational analysis of the UCP2 core promoter and relationships of variants with obesity.	To identify polymorphisms in the human uncoupling protein 2 gene (UCP2) promoter and to investigate whether these were associated with obesity or weight gain. The human UCP2 promoter was characterized by reporter gene analysis in cell lines derived from skeletal muscle, white adipose tissue, and embryonic tissue. We analyzed the core promoter for polymorphisms in 60 obese subjects. A prevalent polymorphism, the -866 G/A variant, was investigated for association with obesity in 749 men obese as young adults and 816 men of the same age representing the background population. Genotype-phenotype interaction studies were performed in two other population-based samples: one group of middle-aged-to-elderly Danish subjects (mean age, 53 years; range, 30 to 88 years) and one group of 60-year-old Danish subjects. The region up to -1202 bp relative to the UCP2 transcription initiation site gave rise to the highest promoter activity. Eight mutations in this region were identified comprising -866 G/A, -850 G/A, -337 G/C, -41 G/T, -28 insertion T, -5 insertion (cactgcgaagccc), +45 C/T, and +53 G/C, but none of these was associated with consistent alterations in BMI, body fat content, weight gain, or fasting levels of plasma glucose and serum insulin. Variation of the UCP2 promoter including the single common variant (-866 A/G) is not associated with obesity or obesity-related intermediary phenotypes in Danish subjects. 	Obes._Res.

25285724	20141007	Association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ADD3 gene and susceptibility to biliary atresia.	Based on the results of previous studies, the ADD3 gene, located in the 10q24.2 region, may be a susceptibility gene of biliary atresia (BA). In this study, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ADD3 gene, rs17095355 C/T and rs10509906 G/C, were selected to investigate whether there is an association between these SNPs and susceptibility to BA in a Chinese population. A total of 752 Han Chinese (134 BA cases and 618 ethnically matched healthy controls) were included in the present study. The ADD3 gene polymorphisms were genotyped using a TaqMan genotyping assay. Positive associations were found for the SNP rs17095355 in the codominant model; specifically, the frequencies of the CT and TT genotypes and the T allele were higher in the cases than the controls, demonstrating a significant risk for BA (odds ratio [OR]?= 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]?= 1.02-2.58; OR = 2.89, 95% CI = 1.72-4.86; and OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.34-2.29, respectively). Regarding rs10509906, the per-C-allele conferred an OR of 0.70 (95% CI = 0.49-1.00) under the additive model. A greater risk of BA was associated with the T(a)-G(b) (a for rs17095355 and b for rs10509906) haplotype (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.27-2.61) compared with the C(a)-C(b) haplotype. This study suggests that the ADD3 gene plays an important role in BA pathogenesis and reveals a significant association between two SNPs, rs17095355 and rs10509906, and BA. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428
20609320	20100709	The spectrum of SCN5A gene mutations in Spanish Brugada syndrome patients.	Brugada syndrome is characterized by right bundle branch block and ST-segment elevation in the right precordial ECG leads. Familial transmission is frequent and approximately 25% of cases exhibit mutations in the SCN5A gene. We analyzed the sequence of this gene in 25 Spanish patients with Brugada syndrome. In 4 (16%), we found mutations that had not previously been described: three were amino acid changes (i.e. Ala2&gt;Thr, Ala735&gt;Thr and Val1340&gt;Ile) and one was an intron mutation that affected messenger RNA processing (i.e. IVS18-1G&gt;A). These four patients had relatives who were also mutation carriers, several of whom had normal ECGs, even on flecainide challenge. Our study suggests that genetic analysis could be helpful in the presymptomatic diagnosis of Brugada syndrome, but may be less useful for stratifying the risk of adverse events.

15947997	20050611	Two missense mutations of EGR2 R359W and GJB1 V136A in a Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease family.	During mutational analysis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) causative genes, we identified a CMT family with two missense mutations in different genes. A R359W mutation in EGR2 was shared by the affected daughter (proband) and her father. In addition, she had a V136A mutation in GJB1, which was determined to be a de novo mutation. The daughter with two different gene mutations showed more severe clinical, electrophysiological and histopathological phenotypes than her father who had only the EGR2 mutation. We suggest that these phenotypic differences between the proband and her father may have been caused by an altered effect of the genetic modifier in EGR2, or by the additive effect of the EGR2 and GJB1 mutations.

24598114	20140307	Targeting hedgehog signaling in myelofibrosis and other hematologic malignancies.	Treatment of myelofibrosis (MF), a BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm, is challenging. The only current potentially curative option, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, is recommended for few patients. The remaining patients are treated with palliative therapies to manage MF-related anemia and splenomegaly. Identification of a mutation in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene (JAK2 V617F) in more than half of all patients with MF has prompted the discovery and clinical development of inhibitors that target JAK2. Although treatment with JAK2 inhibitors has been shown to improve symptom response and quality of life in patients with MF, these drugs do not alter the underlying disease; therefore, novel therapies are needed. The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has been shown to play a role in normal hematopoiesis and in the tumorigenesis of hematologic malignancies. Moreover, inhibitors of the Hh pathway have been shown to inhibit growth and self-renewal capacity in preclinical models of MF. In a mouse model of MF, combined inhibition of the Hh and JAK pathways reduced JAK2 mutant allele burden, reduced bone marrow fibrosis, and reduced white blood cell and platelet counts. Preliminary clinical data also suggest that inhibition of the Hh pathway, alone or in combination with JAK2 inhibition, may enable disease modification in patients with MF. Future studies, including one combining the Hh pathway inhibitor sonidegib and the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, are underway in patients with MF and will inform whether this combination approach can lead to true disease modification.

17656376	20070728	The A3243G tRNALeu(UUR) mutation induces mitochondrial dysfunction and variable disease expression without dominant negative acting translational defects in complex IV subunits at UUR codons.	Mutations in the mitochondrial tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene are associated with a large variety of human diseases through a largely undisclosed mechanism. The A3243G tRNA(Leu(UUR)) mutation leads to reduction of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded proteins and oxidative phosphorylation activity even when the cells are competent in mitochondrial translation. These two aspects led to the suggestion that a dominant negative factor may underlie the diversity of disease expression. Here we test the hypothesis that A3243G tRNA(Leu(UUR)) generates such a dominant negative gain-of-function defect through misincorporation of amino acids at UUR codons of mtDNA-encoded proteins. Using an anti-complex IV immunocapture technique and mass spectrometry, we show that the mtDNA-encoded cytochrome c oxidase I (COX I) and COX II exist exclusively with the correct amino acid sequences in A3243G cells in a misassembled complex IV. A dominant negative component therefore cannot account for disease phenotype, leaving tissue-specific accumulation by mtDNA segregation as the most likely cause of variable mitochondrial disease expression.

26958626	20160310	Characterisation of the mechanical and fracture properties of a uni-weave carbon fibre/epoxy non-crimp fabric composite.	A complete database of the mechanical properties of an epoxy polymer reinforced with uni-weave carbon fibre non-crimp fabric (NCF) is established. In-plane and through-the-thickness tests were performed on unidirectional laminates under normal loading and shear loading. The response under cyclic shear loading was also measured. The material has been characterised in terms of stiffness, strength, and failure features for the different loading cases. The critical energy release rates associated with different failure modes in the material were measured from interlaminar and translaminar fracture toughness tests. The stress-strain data of the tensile, compressive, and shear test specimens are included. The load-deflection data for all fracture toughness tests are also included. The database can be used in the development and validation of analytical and numerical models of fibre reinforced plastics (FRPs), in particular FRPs with NCF reinforcements. 	Data_Brief	D016428
21383334	20110309	Lack of association of OPRM1 and ABCB1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms to oxycodone response in postoperative pain.	The aim of the study was to search for an association between the single-nucleotide polymorphisms A118G in OPRM1 and C3435T and G2677T/A in ABCB1 and the analgesic effect of intravenous oxycodone in postoperative pain. There were 268 patients with postoperative pain after, primarily, thyroidectomy. At given times during the first 24 hours postoperatively, their pain was rated at rest and during activity according to a numeric rating scale (0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain) and calculated as pain time area under the curve0-24 hours . A negative answer in a final questionnaire and/or the use of rescue medication categorized a patient as a nonresponder. For OPRM1, there was no difference found between the wild type and the variant allele in the percentages of nonresponders (118AA = 16.4% vs 118AG/118GG = 17.0%, P = 1.0) or in the pain ratings. For ABCB1, no difference was found between the wild type and the variant alleles for single-nucleotide polymorphism tested as percentages of nonresponders (3435CC = 17.5% vs 3435CT/3435TT = 15.8%, P = .85; 2677GG = 17.8% vs 2677GT/2677TT = 15.8%, P = .74) or pain ratings. No association was found between the tested single-nucleotide polymorphisms in OPRM1 and ABCB1 and changes in the analgesic effect of oxycodone. 	J_Clin_Pharmacol	D016430 D016428 D013485
19571390	20090703	Mutations Leu427, Asn428, and Leu431 residues within transmembrane domain-I-segment 6 attenuate ginsenoside-mediated L-type Ca(2+) channel current inhibitions.	Many lines of evidences have shown that Panax ginseng exhibits beneficial effects on cardiovascular systems. We previously demonstrated that ginsenoside Rg(3) (Rg(3)), one of active ingredients of Panax ginseng, inhibits Ca(2+) channel currents in a stereospecific manner and affects the steady-state activation but not inactivation. This points a possibility that Rg(3) regulates Ca(2+) channels through specific interaction site(s) for Ca(2+) influx inhibition through Ca(2+) channels. However, it was not known how Rg(3) interacts with Ca(2+) channel proteins. In the current study, we sought to identify these site(s) in Xenopus oocytes expressing cardiac wild-type and mutant L(alpha(1C))-type Ca(2+) channels using the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. To this end, we assessed how various point mutations of the L-type Ca(2+) channel affected the Rg(3) action. Mutations of L427R, N428R and L431K in transmembrane domain-I-segment 6 (IS6) of the channel significantly attenuated the Rg(3) action and caused rightward shifts in dose-response curves. Rg(3) treatment produced a negative shift in the inactivation voltage but did not alter the steady-state activation voltage, and none of the mutant channels affected the Rg(3)-induced negative shift of inactivation voltage. Rg(3) had no effects on inactivation time constant in wild-type and mutant channels. These results indicate that Rg(3) inhibition of L-type Ca(2+) channel currents is attenuated by mutations of Leu427, Asn428 and Leu431 in transmembrane IS6 residues. Leu427, Asn428 and Leu431 residues of the L-type Ca(2+) channel play important roles in the Rg(3) effect on channel properties. 	Biol._Pharm._Bull.	D016428 D013485
18788921	20080916	A novel NKX2.1 mutation in a family with hypothyroidism and benign hereditary chorea.	We studied a boy with congenital hypothyroidism, benign hereditary chorea, and respiratory distress. His mother and his grandfather were affected by hypothyroidism with a late onset and benign hereditary chorea. The aim of this study was to establish the genetic defects that cause that phenotype and study the molecular mechanisms of the pathology. NKX2.1, PAX8, NKX2.5, and TAZ genes were sequenced. Direct sequencing of the NKX2.1 gene showed, in all the affected, a new heterozygous mutation from cytosine to adenine in the second base of the triplet encoding for the amino acid at position 145. The mutation (C609A) is responsible for a change from serine to a stop codon (S145X). We also demonstrated that the mutant protein is predominantly in the cytoplasm and unable to translocate into the nucleus. Of note, the S145X mutation produces variable phenotypes in the affected members of the family. No mutations have been identified in the NKX2.5, PAX8, and TAZ genes. Our study extends the knowledge of the functional effect of NKX2.1 mutations and further highlights the complexities of genotype-phenotype correlation in the NKX2.1 deficiency syndromes.

26977395	20160316	Integration of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq identifies human alpha cell and beta cell signature genes.	Although glucagon-secreting ?-cells and insulin-secreting ?-cells have opposing functions in regulating plasma glucose levels, the two cell types share a common developmental origin and exhibit overlapping transcriptomes and epigenomes. Notably, destruction of ?-cells can stimulate repopulation via transdifferentiation of ?-cells, at least in mice, suggesting plasticity between these cell fates. Furthermore, dysfunction of both ?- and ?-cells contributes to the pathophysiology of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and ?-cell de-differentiation has been proposed to contribute to type 2 diabetes. Our objective was to delineate the molecular properties that maintain islet cell type specification yet?allow for cellular plasticity. We hypothesized that correlating cell type-specific transcriptomes with an atlas of open chromatin will identify novel genes and transcriptional regulatory elements such as enhancers involved in ?- and ?-cell specification and plasticity. We sorted human ?- and ?-cells and performed the &quot;Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high throughput sequencing&quot; (ATAC-seq) and mRNA-seq, followed by integrative analysis to identify cell type-selective gene regulatory regions. We identified numerous transcripts with either ?-cell- or ?-cell-selective expression and discovered the cell type-selective open chromatin regions that correlate with these gene activation patterns. We confirmed cell type-selective expression on the protein level for two of the top hits from our screen. The &quot;group specific protein&quot; (GC; or vitamin D binding protein) was restricted to ?-cells, while CHODL (chondrolectin) immunoreactivity was only present in ?-cells. Furthermore, ?-cell- and ?-cell-selective ATAC-seq peaks were identified to overlap with known binding sites for islet transcription factors, as well as with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously identified as risk loci for type 2 diabetes. We have determined the genetic landscape of human ?- and ?-cells based on chromatin accessibility and transcript levels, which allowed for detection of novel ?- and ?-cell signature genes not previously known to be expressed in islets. Using fine-mapping of open chromatin, we have identified thousands of potential cis-regulatory elements that operate in an endocrine cell type-specific fashion. 	Mol_Metab	D016428
19668779	20090812	Characterization of novel KCNH2 mutations in type 2 long QT syndrome manifesting as seizures.	Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is characterized by corrected QT interval prolongation leading to torsades de pointes and sudden cardiac death. LQTS type 2 (LQTS2) is caused by mutations in the KCNH2 gene, leading to a reduction of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current and loss of human ether-?-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel function by different mechanisms. Triggers for life-threatening arrhythmias in LQTS2 are often auditory stimuli. To screen KCNH2 for mutations in patients with LQTS2 on an electrocardiogram and auditory-induced syncope interpreted as seizures and sudden cardiac death, and to analyze their impact on the channel function in vitro. The KCNH2 gene was screened for mutations in the index patients of three families. The novel mutations were reproduced in vitro using site-directed mutagenesis and characterized using the Xenopus oocyte expression system in voltage clamp mode. Novel KCNH2 mutations (Y493F, A429P and del234-241) were identified in the index patients with mostly typical LQTS2 features on their electrocardiograms. The biochemical data revealed a trafficking defect. The biophysical data revealed a loss of function when mutated hERG channels were coexpressed with the wild type. In all families, at least one patient carrying the mutation had a history of seizures after auditory stimuli, which is a major trigger for arrhythmic events in LQTS2. Seizures are likely due to cardiac syncope as a consequence of mutation-induced loss of function of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current. 	Can_J_Cardiol	D016428 D013485
23071601	20121017	A novel anticancer therapy that simultaneously targets aberrant p53 and Notch activities in tumors.	Notch signaling pathway plays an important role in tumorigenesis by maintaining the activity of self-renewal of cancer stem cells, and therefore, it is hypothesized that interference of Notch signaling may inhibit tumor formation and progression. H101 is a recombinant oncolytic adenovirus that is cytolytic in cells lacking intact p53, but it is unable to eradicate caner stem cells. In this study, we tested a new strategy of tumor gene therapy by combining a Notch1-siRNA with H101 oncolytic adenovirus. In HeLa-S3 tumor cells, the combined therapy blocked the Notch pathway and induced apoptosis in tumors that are p53-inactive. In nude mice bearing xenograft tumors derived from HeLa-S3 cells, the combination of H101/Notch1-siRNA therapies inhibited tumor growth. Moreover, Notch1-siRNA increased Hexon gene expression at both the transcriptional and the translational levels, and promoted H101 replication in tumors, thereby enhancing the oncolytic activity of H101. These data demonstrate the feasibility to combine H101 p53-targted oncolysis and anti-Notch siRNA activities as a novel anti-cancer therapy. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061 D013485 D013486
20562852	20100622	Disruption of the clock components CLOCK and BMAL1 leads to hypoinsulinaemia and diabetes.	The molecular clock maintains energy constancy by producing circadian oscillations of rate-limiting enzymes involved in tissue metabolism across the day and night. During periods of feeding, pancreatic islets secrete insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis, and although rhythmic control of insulin release is recognized to be dysregulated in humans with diabetes, it is not known how the circadian clock may affect this process. Here we show that pancreatic islets possess self-sustained circadian gene and protein oscillations of the transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1. The phase of oscillation of islet genes involved in growth, glucose metabolism and insulin signalling is delayed in circadian mutant mice, and both Clock and Bmal1 (also called Arntl) mutants show impaired glucose tolerance, reduced insulin secretion and defects in size and proliferation of pancreatic islets that worsen with age. Clock disruption leads to transcriptome-wide alterations in the expression of islet genes involved in growth, survival and synaptic vesicle assembly. Notably, conditional ablation of the pancreatic clock causes diabetes mellitus due to defective beta-cell function at the very latest stage of stimulus-secretion coupling. These results demonstrate a role for the beta-cell clock in coordinating insulin secretion with the sleep-wake cycle, and reveal that ablation of the pancreatic clock can trigger the onset of diabetes mellitus.

14625013	20031120	Zinc amplifies mSOD1-mediated toxicity in a transgenic mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Transgenic mice overexpressing the human mutated form (G93A) of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (mSOD1) develop motor neuron degeneration resembling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In vitro studies have shown that mSOD1-induced, reactive oxygen species-mediated apoptosis of motor neurons depends on the presence of copper and the relative absence of zinc. Oral intake of zinc sulphate induces the expression of metallothioneins, enzymes that decrease oxidative stress, and leads to higher serum zinc, and lower copper levels. We therefore tested the effect of chronic oral administration of zinc sulfate (0.075 and 0.375 g/kg) on disease onset and survival of mSOD1 transgenic mice. We observed that zinc sulfate, rather than prolonging survival, decreased survival. We conclude that zinc sulfate amplifies the mSOD1 transgenic mouse phenotype. This finding may shed more light on the role of zinc in mSOD1-mediated toxicity. 	Neurosci._Lett.	D003160 D016428
26677801	20151219	Synthesis of 1-Naphthol by a Natural Peroxygenase Engineered by Directed Evolution.	There is an increasing interest in enzymes that catalyze the hydroxylation of naphthalene under mild conditions and with minimal requirements. To address this challenge, an extracellular fungal aromatic peroxygenase with mono(per)oxygenase activity was engineered to convert naphthalene selectively into 1-naphthol. Mutant libraries constructed by random mutagenesis and DNA recombination were screened for peroxygenase activity on naphthalene together with quenching of the undesired peroxidative activity on 1-naphthol (one-electron oxidation). The resulting double mutant (G241D-R257K) obtained from this process was characterized biochemically and computationally. The conformational changes produced by directed evolution improved the substrate's catalytic position. Powered exclusively by catalytic concentrations of H2 O2 , this soluble and stable biocatalyst has a total turnover number of 50?000, with high regioselectivity (97?%) and reduced peroxidative activity.

25554946	20150103	Exploring the mechanisms of the reductase activity of neuroglobin by site-directed mutagenesis of the heme distal pocket.	Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a six-coordinate globin that can catalyze the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide. Although this reaction is common to heme proteins, the molecular interactions in the heme pocket that regulate this reaction are largely unknown. We have shown that the H64L Ngb mutation increases the rate of nitrite reduction by 2000-fold compared to that of wild-type Ngb [Tiso, M., et al. (2011) J. Biol. Chem. 286, 18277-18289]. Here we explore the effect of distal heme pocket mutations on nitrite reduction. For this purpose, we have generated mutations of Ngb residues Phe28(B10), His64(E7), and Val68(E11). Our results indicate a dichotomy in the reactivity of deoxy five- and six-coordinate globins toward nitrite. In hemoglobin and myoglobin, there is a correlation between faster rates and more negative potentials. However, in Ngb, reaction rates are apparently related to the distal pocket volume, and redox potential shows a poor relationship with the rate constants. This suggests a relationship between the nitrite reduction rate and heme accessibility in Ngb, particularly marked for His64(E7) mutants. In five-coordinate globins, His(E7) facilitates nitrite reduction, likely through proton donation. Conversely, in Ngb, the reduction mechanism does not rely on the delivery of a proton from the histidine side chain, as His64 mutants show the fastest reduction rates. In fact, the rate observed for H64A Ngb (1120 M(-1) s(-1)) is to the best of our knowledge the fastest reported for a heme nitrite reductase. These differences may be related to a differential stabilization of the iron-nitrite complexes in five- and six-coordinate globins. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D052061 D013485
26980058	20160317	An Ethylene-responsive Factor BpERF11 Negatively Modulates Salt and Osmotic Tolerance in Betula platyphylla.	Ethylene responsive factors (ERFs) play important roles in the abiotic stress; however, only a few ERF genes from woody plants have been functionally characterized. In the present study, an ERF gene from Betula platyphylla (birch), BpERF11, was functionally characterized in response to abiotic stress. BpERF11 is a nuclear protein, which could specifically bind to GCC boxes and DRE motifs. BpERF11-overexpressing and BpERF11 RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown plants were generated for gain- and loss-of-function analysis. BpERF11 negatively regulates resistance to salt and severe osmotic stress, and the transgenic birch plants overexpressing BpERF11 shows increased electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents. BpERF11 inhibits the expression of an AtMYB61 homologous gene, resulting in increased stomatal aperture, which elevated the transpiration rate. Furthermore, BpERF11 downregulates the expression of P5CS, SOD and POD genes, but upregulates the expression of PRODH and P5CDH, which results in reduced proline levels and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. BpERF11 also significantly inhibits the expression of LEA and dehydrin genes that involve in abiotic stress tolerance. Therefore, BpERF11 serves as a transcription factor that negatively regulates salt and severe osmotic tolerance by modulating various physiological processes. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D013485
25896535	20150422	Replication of PTPRC as genetic biomarker of response to TNF inhibitors in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.	Genetic biomarkers could be useful for orienting treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but none has been convincingly validated yet. Putative biomarkers include 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms that have shown association with response to TNF inhibitors (TNFi) in candidate gene studies and that we assayed here in 755 RA patients. Three of them, in the PTPRC, IL10 and CHUK genes, were significantly associated with response to TNFi. The most significant result was obtained with rs10919563 in PTPRC, which is a confirmed RA susceptibility locus. Its RA risk allele was associated with improved response (B=0.33, P=0.006). This is the second independent replication of this biomarker (P=9.08 ? 10(-8) in the combined 3003 RA patients). In this way, PTPRC has become the most replicated genetic biomarker of response to TNFi. In addition, the positive but weaker replication of IL10 and CHUK should stimulate further validation studies. 	Pharmacogenomics_J.	D016428 D013485

Up to now there is no effective drug treatment available, which is why recommendations encompass both exercise programs and changes in dietary habits. Exercise is well-known for unleashing potent anti-inflammatory effects, which can principally counteract liver inflammation and chronic low-grade inflammation. This review article summarizes the underlying mechanisms responsible for the exercise-mediated anti-inflammatory effects, illustrates the application in animal models as well as in humans, and highlights the therapeutic value when possible. Based on the available results there is no doubt that exercise can even be beneficial in an advanced stage of liver disease and it is the goal of this review article to provide evidence for the therapeutic impact on fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC and to assess whether exercise might be of value as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of CLD. In principle, all exercise programs carried out in these high-risk patients should be guided and observed by qualified healthcare professionals to guarantee the patients' safety. Nevertheless, it is also necessary to additionally determine the optimal amount and intensity of exercise to maximize its value, which is why further studies are essential.

22797061	20120717	Annexin A6 is a scaffold for PKC? to promote EGFR inactivation.	Protein kinase C? (PKC?) can phosphorylate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at threonine 654 (T654) to inhibit EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (pY-EGFR) and the associated activation of downstream effectors. However, upregulation of PKC? in a large variety of cancers is not associated with EGFR inactivation, and factors determining the potential of PKC? to downregulate EGFR are yet unknown. Here, we show that ectopic expression of annexin A6 (AnxA6), a member of the Ca(2+) and phospholipid-binding annexins, strongly reduces pY-EGFR levels while augmenting EGFR T654 phosphorylation in EGFR overexpressing A431, head and neck and breast cancer cell lines. Reduced EGFR activation in AnxA6 expressing A431 cells is associated with reduced EGFR internalization and degradation. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated PKC? knockdown in AnxA6 expressing A431 cells reduces T654-EGFR phosphorylation, but restores EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, clonogenic growth and EGFR degradation. These findings correlate with AnxA6 interacting with EGFR, and elevated AnxA6 levels promoting PKC? membrane association and interaction with EGFR. Stable expression of the cytosolic N-terminal mutant AnxA6(1-175), which cannot promote PKC? membrane recruitment, does not increase T654-EGFR phosphorylation or the association of PKC? with EGFR. AnxA6 overexpression does not inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of the T654A EGFR mutant, which cannot be phosphorylated by PKC?. Most strikingly, stable plasma membrane anchoring of AnxA6 is sufficient to recruit PKC? even in the absence of EGF or Ca(2+). In summary, AnxA6 is a new PKC? scaffold to promote PKC?-mediated EGFR inactivation through increased membrane targeting of PKC? and EGFR/PKC? complex formation. 	Oncogene	D016428 D013485
9530815	19980408	Primary structure of scombrine alpha: two different species with an identical protamine.	We have studied the protamine scombrine alpha from the mackerel Scomber scombrus. Scombrine alpha is found phosphorylated in spermatid nuclei, but not in nuclei of ripe sperm. It is a typical fish protamine, made up of two distinct molecular species, each of 34 amino acid residues. The primary structure of the main component of scombrine alpha is 100% identical to scombrine gamma, the nonmicroheterogeneous protamine from Scomber australasicus (11). The second component of scombrine alpha is a very minor molecular species that has an isoleucine instead of a valine in position 11. Nuclear sperm-specific basic proteins display an enormous interspecific variability and it is very surprising that two different species show identical protamines. In this work we suggest that evolutionary changes in primary structure of protamines are restricted by several constitutive factors, especially when protamines either lack or have a low degree of microheterogeneity.

27223300	20160526	Factors That Improve RT-QuIC Detection of Prion Seeding Activity.	Rapid and sensitive detection of prions is important in managing prion diseases. The real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay for prion seeding activity has been applied to many prion diseases and provides for specific antemortem diagnostic testing. We evaluated RT-QuIC's long-term consistency and varied multiple reaction parameters. Repeated assays of a single scrapie sample using multiple plate readers and recombinant prion protein (rPrP(Sen)) substrates gave comparable results. N-terminal truncated hamster rPrP(Sen) (residues 90-231) hastened both prion-seeded and prion-independent reactions but maintained a clear kinetic distinction between the two. Raising temperatures or shaking speeds accelerated RT-QuIC reactions without compromising specificity. When applied to nasal brushings from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease patients, higher temperatures accelerated RT-QuIC kinetics, and the use of hamster rPrP(Sen) (90-231) strengthened RT-QuIC responses. Elongation of shaking periods reduced scrapie-seeded reaction times, but continuous shaking promoted false-positive reactions. Furthermore, pH 7.4 provided for more rapid RT-QuIC reactions than more acidic pHs. Additionally, we show that small variations in the amount of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) significantly impacted the assay. Finally, RT-QuIC performed in multiplate thermoshakers followed by fluorescence readings in separate plate readers enhanced assay throughput economically. Collectively, these results demonstrate improved speed, efficacy and practicality of RT-QuIC assays and highlight variables to be optimized for future applications.

27333049	20160623	Complement and Antibody-mediated Enhancement of Red Blood Cell Invasion and Growth of Malaria Parasites.	Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a deadly pathogen. The invasion of red blood cells (RBCs) by merozoites is a target for vaccine development. Although anti-merozoite antibodies can block invasion in vitro, there is no efficacy in vivo. To explain this discrepancy we hypothesized that complement activation could enhance RBC invasion by binding to the complement receptor 1 (CR1). Here we show that a monoclonal antibody directed against the merozoite and human polyclonal IgG from merozoite vaccine recipients enhanced RBC invasion in a complement-dependent manner and that soluble CR1 inhibited this enhancement. Sialic acid-independent strains, that presumably are able to bind to CR1 via a native ligand, showed less complement-dependent enhancement of RBC invasion than sialic acid-dependent strains that do not utilize native CR1 ligands. Confocal fluorescent microscopy revealed that complement-dependent invasion resulted in aggregation of CR1 at the RBC surface in contact with the merozoite. Finally, total anti-P. berghei IgG enhanced parasite growth and C3 deficiency decreased parasite growth in mice. These results demonstrate, contrary to current views, that complement activation in conjunction with antibodies can paradoxically aid parasites invade RBCs and should be considered in future design and testing of merozoite vaccines.

18393234	20080409	[A novel mutation in the SEDL gene leading to X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda in a large Chinese pedigree].	To identify the genetic defect in a four-generation pedigree with X-linked recessive spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda (SEDT) from Southwest China. Linkage analysis with one panel of fluorescently labeled microsatellite markers on chromosome X and mutation screening of SEDL gene by direct sequencing were performed. Linkage between SEDT and Xp22.2-Xp23.1 was established with maximum LOD score of 3.82 (theta = 0) between DXS987 and DXS8051. Upon sequence analysis, a point mutation within exon 4 of the SEDL gene (c.239A to G) was found which resulted in substitution of histidine with arginine at codon 80 (His80Arg). A novel missense mutation (H80R) was identified for SEDL gene in the large Chinese SEDT pedigree. 	Zhonghua_Yi_Xue_Yi_Chuan_Xue_Za_Zhi	D004740 D016428
24244382	20131119	Polymorphism in serotonin receptor 3B is associated with pain catastrophizing.	Pain catastrophizing, a coping style characterized by excessively negative thoughts and emotions in relation to pain, is one of the psychological factors that most markedly predicts variability in the perception of pain; however, only little is known about the underlying neurobiology. The aim of this study was to test for associations between psychological variables, such as pain catastrophizing, anxiety and depression, and selected polymorphisms in genes related to monoaminergic neurotransmission, in particular serotonin pathway genes. Three hundred seventy-nine healthy participants completed a set of psychological questionnaires: the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Beck's Depression Inventory, and were genotyped for 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nine genes. The SNP rs1176744 located in the serotonin receptor 3B gene (5-HTR3B) was found to be associated with pain catastrophizing scores: both the global score and the subscales of magnification and helplessness. This is the first study to show an association between 5-HTR3B and PCS scores, thus suggesting a role of the serotonin pathway in pain catastrophizing. Since 5-HTR3B has previously been associated with descending pain modulation pathways, future studies will be of great interest to elucidate the molecular pathways involved in the relation between serotonin, its receptors and pain catastrophizing.

15064744	20040406	Mutation of a CK2 phosphorylation site in cdc25C impairs importin alpha/beta binding and results in cytoplasmic retention.	cdc25C is a phosphatase, which activates the mitosis-promoting factor cyclin B1/cdc2 by dephosphorylation, and thus triggers G(2)/M transition. The activity of cdc25C itself is controlled by phosphorylation of certain amino-acid residues, which among other things determines the subcellular localization of the enzyme. Here, we describe a new phosphorylation site at threonine 236 of cdc25C, which is phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2. This phosphorylation site is located near the nuclear localization signal (amino acids 239-245). We demonstrate that cdc25C interacts with importin beta and the importin alpha/beta heterodimer but not with importin alpha. We further found that a cdc25C phosphorylation mutant where threonine 236 was replaced by aspartic acid as well as cdc25C phosphorylated by CK2 binds importin beta or the importin alpha/beta heterodimer less efficiently than wild type or the corresponding alanine mutant. Furthermore, the cdc25C(T236D) shows a retarded uptake into the nucleus in a cell import assay. Inhibition of protein kinase CK2 enzyme activity in vivo resulted in an enhanced nuclear localization of cdc25C. Thus, phosphorylation of cdc25C at threonine 236 is an important signal for the retention of cdc25C in the cytoplasm. 	Oncogene	D016428 D013485
25319636	20141017	Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II in a Chinese boy resulting from three mutations in the bilirubin uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) gene and a family genetic analysis.	The UGT1A1 gene encodes a responsible enzyme, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase1A1 (UGT1A1), for bilirubin metabolism. Many mutations have already been identified in patients with inherited disorders with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, such as Crigler-Najjar syndromes and Gilbert's syndrome. In this report, we presented a boy with intermittent unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, whose genetic analysis showed a new compound heterozygote determined by three mutations, c.211G &gt; A (p.G71R), c.508_510delTTC (p.F170-) and c.1456?T &gt; G (p.Y486D) in the hotspot regions of the UGT1A1 gene (exons 1 and 5) in Asian populations, presenting a genotype compatible with clinical picture of CNS-II. The family genetic analysis confirmed the origin of these mutations. UGT1A1 gene analysis should be performed in all cases with unexplained unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The description of patients with peculiar genotypes especially including family analysis could help explain the relationship between the genotype and phenotype,it is helpful for clinicians to predict the outcome of the patients.

18359160	20080325	Association of polymorphisms in the melanocortin receptor type 2 (MC2R, ACTH receptor) gene with heroin addiction.	The melanocortin receptor type 2 (MC2R or adrenocorticotropic hormone, ACTH receptor) gene (MC2R) encodes a protein involved in regulation of adrenal cortisol secretion, important in the physiological response to stressors. A variant of MC2R, -179A&gt;G, results in reduction of promoter activity and less adrenal action. We hypothesize that altered stress responsivity plays a key role in the initiation of substance abuse. By direct resequencing of the promoter region and exons 1 and 2 of the MC2R gene in 272 subjects including Caucasians, Hispanics and African Americans with approximately equal numbers of former heroin addicts and normal volunteers, we identified five novel variants each with allele frequency &lt;2%. Previously reported polymorphisms -184G&gt;A (rs2186944), -179A&gt;G, 833A&gt;C (rs28926182), 952T&gt;C (rs4797825), 1005C&gt;T (rs4797824) and 1579T&gt;C (rs4308014) were each in allelic frequency &gt;/=2% in one or more ethnic groups. These polymorphisms were genotyped in 632 subjects (260 Caucasians, 168 Hispanics, 183 African Americans and 21 Asians) using TaqMan assays. Significant differences in genotype frequency among ethnic groups studied were found for each of the six variants analyzed. We found a significant association (p=0.0004, experiment-wise p=0.0072) of the allele -184A with a protective effect from heroin addiction in Hispanics. Also, in Hispanics only we found the haplotype GACT consisting of four variants (-184G&gt;A, -179A&gt;G, 833A&gt;C and 1005C&gt;T) to be significantly associated with heroin addiction (p=0.0014, experiment-wise p=0.0168), whereas another haplotype, AACT, consisting of the same variants, was associated with a protective effect from heroin addiction (p=0.0039, experiment-wise p=0.0468).

24212762	20131112	Analysis of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD Ala-9Val) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx1 Pro 198 Leu) gene polymorphisms in psoriasis.	Recent studies have suggested the involvement of increased reactive oxygen species levels and decreased antioxidant system functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. In this study, we aimed to examine to investigate possible associations between the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD Ala-9Val) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx1 Pro198Leu) polymorphisms and psoriasis susceptibility and disease progression in a Turkish population. The study group consisted of 100 unrelated patients with psoriasis and 167 unrelated healthy controls. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes of whole blood which were obtained from all patients and control subjects. Genotyping was performed to identify MnSOD Ala-9Val and GPx1 Pro198Leu polymorphisms by a method based on PCR amplification and detection of polymorphisms with hybridization probes labeled with fluorescent dyes. Genotype and allele frequencies were compared between patients with psoriasis and 106 healthy control subjects. There was no significant difference between the MnSOD Ala-9Val single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype distributions and allele frequencies of the psoriasis patients and the control group (p?=?0.99 and p?=?0.89, respectively). There was also no significant difference between distributions of the genotype or allele frequencies of the GPx1 Pro198Leu SNP of the patient groups and control subjects (p?=?0.99 and p?=?0.96, respectively). Also, no significant difference was found between clinical severity of psoriasis and MnSOD Ala-9Val and GPx1 Pro198Leu polymorphism. This is the first report investigating the possible associations between the MnSOD Ala-9Val and GPx1 Pro198Leu polymorphisms and psoriasis susceptibility and disease progression in the Turkish population even if no significant difference was found between patient groups and control subjects. Further studies with large cohort on different populations and ethnicities will be able to better clarify the association. 	Arch._Dermatol._Res.	D016428
1671770	19910101	Molecular analysis of PKU haplotypes in the population of southern Poland.	Out of a population of 138,598 infants born in southern Poland between 1987 and 1989, and screened for phenylketonuria (PKU), 28 cases were ascertained probands and their parents were isolated and eight polymorphic restriction sites were analyzed within the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene region. Twenty-one different haplotypes (HT) were revealed, five of them representing new categories. The most common haplotypes among those carrying normal alleles were: HT1 (27.3%) and HT4 (11.4%). Within the group of haplotypes with mutant alleles the most frequent was HT2 (56.8%), whereas the frequency of this haplotype in other European populations, such as French, Danish and German, ranged from 12% to 24%. HT3, being the most common in Danish (38%), and relatively frequent in the other western European (13-14%) populations, appeared to be very rare in our sample (2.3%). The mutation of codon 408 (exon 12, C----T, Arg----Trp), which has been described to be tightly linked to HT2, was tested on amplified DNA by dot-blot hybridization. This mutation was found in 25 out of 44 proband chromosomes. In one case it was linked to HT5, in the remaining 24 to HT2. Our results confirm molecular heterogeneity of PKU haplotypes, as well as their significant interpopulation variation. 	Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
11926819	20020403	Probing the role of the F-helix in serpin stability through a single tryptophan substitution.	Serpins form loop-sheet polymers through the formation of a partially folded intermediate. Through mutagenesis and biophysical analysis, we have probed the conformational stability of the F-helix, demonstrating that it is almost completely unfolded in the intermediate state. The replacement of Tyr160 on the F-helix of alpha1-antitrypsin to alanine results in the loss of a conserved hydrogen bond that dramatically reduces the stability of the protein to both heat and solvent denaturation, indicating the importance of Tyr160 in the stability of the molecule. The mutation of Tyr160 to a tryptophan residue, within a fluorescently silent variant of alpha1-antitrypsin, results in a fully active, stable serpin. Fluorescence analysis of the equilibrium unfolding behavior of this variant indicates that the F-helix is highly disrupted in the intermediate conformation. Iodide quenching experiments demonstrate that the tryptophan residue is exposed to a similar extent in both the intermediate and unfolded states. Cumulatively, these data indicate that the F-helix plays an important role in controlling the early conformational changes involved in alpha1-antitrypsin unfolding. The implications of these data on both alpha1-antitrypsin function and misfolding are discussed. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485

A mutant Cro protein, which bears the Ile-30----Leu substitution, is thermally unstable and degraded more rapidly than wild-type Cro in vivo. Using an antibody screen, we have isolated five different second site suppressor substitutions that reduce the proteolytic hypersensitivity of this mutant Cro protein. Two of the suppressor substitutions increase the thermal stability of Cro by 12 degrees C to 14 degrees C. These amino acid substitutions affect residues 16 and 26, which are substantially exposed to solvent in the crystal structure of wild-type Cro. 	Proteins	D003160 D016428 D013487
27111224	20160426	Fine Mapping of the Body Fat QTL on Human Chromosome 1q43.	Evidence for linkage and association of obesity-related quantitative traits to chromosome 1q43 has been reported in the Quebec Family Study (QFS) and in populations of Caribbean Hispanic ancestries yet no specific candidate locus has been replicated to date. Using a set of 1,902 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 525 African American (AA) and 391 European American (EA) women enrolled in the NIEHS uterine fibroid study (NIEHS-UFS), we generated a fine association map for the body mass index (BMI) across a 2.3 megabase-long interval delimited by RGS7 (regulator of G-protein signaling 7) and PLD5 (Phospholipase D, member 5). Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models were fitted to the data to evaluate the association in race-stratified analyses and meta-analysis. The strongest associations were observed in a recessive genetic model and peaked in the 3' end of RGS7 at intronic rs261802 variant in the AA group (p = 1.0 x 10-4) and in meta-analysis of AA and EA samples (p = 9.0 x 10-5). In the EA group, moderate associations peaked at rs6429264 (p = 2.0 x 10-3) in the 2 Kb upstream sequence of RGS7. In the reference populations for the European ancestry in the 1,000 genomes project, rs6429264 occurs in strong linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.94) with rs1341467, the strongest candidate SNP for total body fat in QFS that failed genotyping in the present study. Additionally we report moderate associations at the 3' end of PLD5 in meta-analysis (3.2 x 10-4 ? p ? 5.8 x 10-4). We report replication data suggesting that RGS7, a gene abundantly expressed in the brain, might be a putative body fat QTL on human chromosome 1q43. Future genetic and functional studies are required to substantiate our observations and to potentially link them to the neurobehavioral phenotypes associated with the RGS7 region.

24752137	20140423	Mutated tumor alleles are expressed according to their DNA frequency.	The transcription of tumor mutations from DNA into RNA has implications for biology, epigenetics and clinical practice. It is not clear if mutations are in general transcribed and, if so, at what proportion to the wild-type allele. Here, we examined the correlation between DNA mutation allele frequency and RNA mutation allele frequency. We sequenced the exome and transcriptome of tumor cell lines with large copy number variations, identified heterozygous single nucleotide mutations and absolute DNA copy number, and determined the corresponding DNA and RNA mutation allele fraction. We found that 99% of the DNA mutations in expressed genes are expressed as RNA. Moreover, we found a high correlation between the DNA and RNA mutation allele frequency. Exceptions are mutations that cause premature termination codons and therefore activate nonsense-mediated decay. Beyond this, we did not find evidence of any wide-scale mechanism, such as allele-specific epigenetic silencing, preferentially promoting mutated or wild-type alleles. In conclusion, our data strongly suggest that genes are equally transcribed from all alleles, mutated and wild-type, and thus transcribed in proportion to their DNA allele frequency.

17932439	20071013	Interleukin-12B &amp; interleukin-10 gene polymorphisms in pulmonary tuberculosis.	Cytokines play an important role in anti-tuberculosis immune response. Skewing of immunity from protective to pathogenic may involve a shift in Th1-Th2 paradigm. Cytokine gene polymorphism is known to be associated with functional differences in cytokine regulation and altered clinical performance in a variety of diseases. The aim of this study was to know whether Interleukin-12B 3' UTR (Taq1) (A/C) and Interleukin-10 (-1082 G/A) gene polymorphisms were associated with susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis. IL -10 (-1,082 G/A) and IL-12B gene polymorphisms were studied in 132 pulmonary TB (PTB) patients and 143 normal healthy subjects (NHS), using DNA based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with sequence specific primers and restriction digestion. The allelic as well as genotypic frequencies of Interleukin -10 (-1082) and Interleukin -12B (3'UTR Taq 1) did not differ significantly between the patients and controls. Our findings suggested that IL -10 (-1082 G/A) and IL -12B 3'UTR (Taq I) (A/C) gene polymorphisms were not associated either with susceptibility or resistance to pulmonary tuberculosis in the south Indian population.

25569702	20150109	Prevalent polymorphism in thyroid hormone-activating enzyme leaves a genetic fingerprint that underlies associated clinical syndromes.	A common polymorphism in the gene encoding the activating deiodinase (Thr92Ala-D2) is known to be associated with quality of life in millions of patients with hypothyroidism and with several organ-specific conditions. This polymorphism results in a single amino acid change within the D2 molecule where its susceptibility to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation is regulated. To define the molecular mechanisms underlying associated conditions in carriers of the Thr92Ala-D2 polymorphism. Microarray analyses of 19 postmortem human cerebral cortex samples were performed to establish a foundation for molecular studies via a cell model of HEK-293 cells stably expressing Thr92 or Ala92 D2. The cerebral cortex of Thr92Ala-D2 carriers exhibits a transcriptional fingerprint that includes sets of genes involved in CNS diseases, ubiquitin, mitochondrial dysfunction (chromosomal genes encoding mitochondrial proteins), inflammation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and growth factor signaling. Similar findings were made in Ala92-D2-expressing HEK-293 cells and in both cases there was no evidence that thyroid hormone signaling was affected ie, the expression level of T3-responsive genes was unchanged, but that several other genes were differentially regulated. The combined microarray analyses (brain/cells) led to the development of an 81-gene classifier that correctly predicts the genotype of homozygous brain samples. In contrast to Thr92-D2, Ala92-D2 exhibits longer half-life and was consistently found in the Golgi. A number of Golgi-related genes were down-regulated in Ala92-D2-expressing cells, but were normalized after 24-h-treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylecysteine. Ala92-D2 accumulates in the Golgi, where its presence and/or ensuing oxidative stress disrupts basic cellular functions and increases pre-apoptosis. These findings are reminiscent to disease mechanisms observed in other neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease, and could contribute to the unresolved neurocognitive symptoms of affected carriers.

15584483	20041209	CD45 (PTPRC) as a candidate gene in multiple sclerosis.	The 77C--&gt;G polymorphism in exon 4 of CD45 or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type C (PTPRC) has been investigated in families with multiple sclerosis (MS) and in several cohorts of sporadic patients and controls, however, with conflicting results. To better understand the role of this functionally important polymorphism in MS, we investigated the transmission of the 'G' allele from unaffected parents to their affected children in 176 families by using linkage and association statistics. The 'G' allele was transmitted to the affected offspring in five of the seven pedigrees carrying this allele and the TRANSMIT program detected association with a P=0.0342. We conclude that the 77C--&gt;G PTPRC polymorphism is present and preferentially transmitted in a small subgroup (&lt;5%) of MS families, which may only be detected with complementary methods of analysis.

24564230	20140226	Endometrial gene expression profiling in pregnant Meishan and Yorkshire pigs on day 12 of gestation.	Litter size in pigs is a major factor affecting the profitability in the pig industry. The peri-implantation window in pigs is characterized by the coordinated interactions between the maternal uterine endometrium and the rapidly elongating conceptuses and represents a period of time during which a large percentage of the developing conceptuses are lost. However, the gene expression and regulatory networks in the endometrium contributing to the establishment of the maternal: placental interface remain poorly understood. We characterized the endometrial gene expression profile during the peri-implantation stage of development by comparing two breeds that demonstrate very different reproductive efficiencies. We employed the porcine Affymetrix GeneChip? to assay the transcriptomic profiles of genes expressed in the uterine endometrium obtained from Meishan and Yorkshire gilts (n = 4 for each breed) on day 12 of gestation (M12 and Y12, respectively). Total of 17,076 probesets were identified as &quot;present&quot; in at least two arrays. A mixed model-based statistical analysis predicted a total of 2,656 (q &lt; 0.1) transcripts as differentially expressed between Meishan and Yorkshire pigs. Eighteen differentially expressed transcripts of interest were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Gene ontology (GO) annotation revealed that the known functions of the differentially expressed genes were involved in a series of important biological processes relevant to early pregnancy establishment in the pig. The results identified endometrial gene expression profiles of two breeds differing in litter size and identified candidate genes that are related to known physiological pathways related to reproductive prolificacy. These findings provide a deeper understanding of molecular pathways differing between two breeds at the critical peri-implantation stage of pregnancy, which can be utilized to better understand the events contributing to pregnancy establishment in the pig.

24992445	20140704	Distribution and diversity of hepatitis B virus genotypes in Yunnan, China.	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most prevalent pathogens in the world, and infection with this virus is a serious threat for public health. Yunnan is considered as an important endemic center for blood-borne viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus, in China. However, the distribution and diversity of HBV subgenotypes remain unclear in Yunnan province. In the current study, HBV positive samples were collected from different prefectures of Yunnan province and their molecular epidemiological characters were determined. Phylogenetic analysis on the pre-S/S gene (865?bps) showed the prevalence of four HBV genotypes, including genotype B (24 cases, 33.3%), genotype C (45 cases, 62.5%), genotype I (two cases, 2.78%) and C/D recombinants (one case, 1.39%). The most prevalent genotypes B and C could be sub classified into subgenotype B2 and C1, C2, C5, and C7, respectively. Clusters of subgenotype B2 and C2 consisted of strains from China and other East Asian countries, while subgenotype C1, C5, and C7 and genotype I formed a cluster together with strains from Southeast Asia. Using Bayesian inference from phylogenetic, HBV genotypes B and C were estimated to have originated in 1860s and 1910s with an evolutionary rate of 3.26 and 8.01???10(-4) substitutions/site/year, respectively. These findings indicate that the distribution of HBV genotypes in Yunnan was influenced by strains from the rest of China and the neighboring countries. 	J._Med._Virol.	D016428 D013485
24037001	20130917	Tegumentary manifestations of Noonan and Noonan-related syndromes.	Noonan and Noonan-related syndromes are common autosomal dominant disorders with neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous and developmental involvement. The objective of this article is to describe the most relevant tegumentary findings in a cohort of 41 patients with Noonan or Noonan-related syndromes and to detail certain aspects of the molecular mechanisms underlying ectodermal involvement. A standard questionnaire was administered. A focused physical examination and a systematic review of clinical records was performed on all patients to verify the presence of tegumentary alterations. The molecular analysis of this cohort included sequencing of the following genes in all patients: PTPN1, SOS1, RAF1, KRAS, SHOC2 and BRAF. The most frequent tegumentary alterations were xeroderma (46%), photosensitivity (29%), excessive hair loss (24%), recurrent oral ulcers (22%), curly hair (20%), nevi (17%), markedly increased palmar and plantar creases (12%), follicular hyperkeratosis (12%), palmoplantar hyperkeratosis (10%), caf?-au-lait spots (10%) and sparse eyebrows (7%). Patients with mutations in PTPN11 had lower frequencies of palmar and plantar creases and palmar/plantar hyperkeratosis compared with the other patients. We observed that patients with mutations in genes directly involved in cell proliferation kinase cascades (SOS1, BRAF, KRAS and RAF1) had a higher frequency of hyperkeratotic lesions compared with patients with mutations in genes that have a more complex interaction with and modulation of cell proliferation kinase cascades (PTPN11).

25706301	20150224	Sugarcane giant borer transcriptome analysis and identification of genes related to digestion.	Sugarcane is a widely cultivated plant that serves primarily as a source of sugar and ethanol. Its annual yield can be significantly reduced by the action of several insect pests including the sugarcane giant borer (Telchin licus licus), a lepidopteran that presents a long life cycle and which efforts to control it using pesticides have been inefficient. Although its economical relevance, only a few DNA sequences are available for this species in the GenBank. Pyrosequencing technology was used to investigate the transcriptome of several developmental stages of the insect. To maximize transcript diversity, a pool of total RNA was extracted from whole body insects and used to construct a normalized cDNA database. Sequencing produced over 650,000 reads, which were de novo assembled to generate a reference library of 23,824 contigs. After quality score and annotation, 43% of the contigs had at least one BLAST hit against the NCBI non-redundant database, and 40% showed similarities with the lepidopteran Bombyx mori. In a further analysis, we conducted a comparison with Manduca sexta midgut sequences to identify transcripts of genes involved in digestion. Of these transcripts, many presented an expansion or depletion in gene number, compared to B. mori genome. From the sugarcane giant borer (SGB) transcriptome, a number of aminopeptidase N (APN) cDNAs were characterized based on homology to those reported as Cry toxin receptors. This is the first report that provides a large-scale EST database for the species. Transcriptome analysis will certainly be useful to identify novel developmental genes, to better understand the insect's biology and to guide the development of new strategies for insect-pest control.

19006389	20081114	Spectroscopic study of the cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase in the activation conformation: effects of the Y1139 residue and S-adenosylmethionine on the B12 cofactor.	The cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase (MetH) from Escherichia coli is a modular enzyme that catalyzes a methyl group transfer from methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine via a methylcob(III)alamin (MeCbl) intermediate, generating tetrahydrofolate and methionine (Met). Once every approximately 2000 turnovers, the cobalamin cofactor is converted to the inactive cob(II)alamin (Co(2+)Cbl) form, from which MeCbl has to be recovered for MetH to re-enter the catalytic cycle. A particularly puzzling aspect of this reactivation process is that it requires the reduction of the Co(2+)Cbl species to cob(I)alamin (Co(1+)Cbl) by flavodoxin, a reaction that would appear to be endergonic on the basis of the corresponding reduction potentials. To explore how MetH may overcome this apparent thermodynamic challenge, we have prepared the I690C/G743C variant of a C-terminal fragment of MetH (MetH(CT)) to lock the enzyme into the activation conformation without perturbing any of the residues in the vicinity of the active site. A detailed spectroscopic characterization of this species and the I690C/G743C/Y1139F MetH(CT) triple mutant reveals that the strategy employed by MetH to activate Co(2+)Cbl for Co(2+) --&gt; Co(1+) reduction likely involves (i) an axial ligand switch to generate a five-coordinate species with an axially coordinated water molecule and (ii) a significant lengthening, or perhaps complete rupture, of the Co-OH(2) bond of the cofactor, thereby causing a large stabilization of the Co 3d(z(2))-based &quot;redox-active&quot; molecular orbital. The lengthening of the Co-OH(2) bond is mediated by the Y1139 active-site residue and becomes much more dramatic when the S-adenosylmethionine substrate is present in the enzyme active site. This substrate requirement provides MetH a means to suppress deleterious side reactions involving the transiently formed Co(1+)Cbl &quot;supernucleophile&quot;. 	J._Am._Chem._Soc.

25775157	20150317	Phenolic composition and antioxidant properties of different peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch] cultivars in China.	China is an important centre of diversity for Prunus persica. In the present study, 17 Chinese peach cultivars were evaluated for phenolic content and antioxidant activity. Neochlorogenic acid (NCHA), chlorogenic acid (CHA), procyanidin B1 (B1), catechin (CAT), cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), quercetin-3-O-galactoside (Q3GAL), quercetin-3-O-glucoside (Q3GLU), quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (Q3R), and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (K3R) were identified and quantified. CHA and CAT were the predominant components in both the peel and pulp of this fruit. In general, peel extracts showed higher antioxidant activities than the pulp counterparts, consistent with the observed higher phenolic content. The melting peach cultivar &quot;Xinyu&quot; showed the highest antioxidant potency composite (APC) index. The principal component analysis (PCA) of peel phenolics showed a clear distinction between the melting peach and nectarine. Overall, peach cultivars rich in hydroxycinnamates and flavan-3-ols showed relatively higher antioxidant activities and might be excellent sources of phytochemicals and natural antioxidants.

17093889	20061110	Family-based association study of serotonergic candidate genes and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in a German sample.	Alterations in the serotonergic pathway have been implicated in the pathogenesis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The aim of this study was to investigate seven genetic variants in three genes (serotonin transporter (5-HTT), serotonin receptor 1B (5-HTR1B) and serotonin receptor 2A (5-HTR2A)), which have previously been shown to be associated with ADHD. The polymorphisms under investigation were the 5-HTTLPR, the VNTR in intron 2 and the 3'UTR SNP in 5-HTT, the 5-HTR1B variations 861G&gt;C and 102T&gt;C, and the 5-HTR2A variations His452Tyr and 1438G&gt;A. We genotyped these variants in a sample of 102 families with 229 children with ADHD according to DSM-IV criteria. Among the affected children, 69% fulfilled criteria for the combined type, 27% for the predominantly inattentive type, and 4% for the predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type. Associations were tested by the pedigree transmission disequilibrium test (PDT). All investigated polymorphisms in serotonergic candidate genes showed no association to ADHD in our sample. Earlier studies of these polymorphisms had also shown inconsistent results, with some studies reporting significant associations and others demonstrating no association. This discordance between studies may reflect variation in patient ascertainment criteria, genetic heterogeneity, too low statistical power for the expected effects or false positive results in the initial reports. We cannot rule out the possibility that other variations in the investigated genes contribute to the etiology of ADHD. 	J_Neural_Transm_(Vienna)	D016428 D016448 D013485
9242516	19970801	Recurrent mutations in the type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) in patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.	Mutations in the type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) are known to underlie different forms of the inherited blistering skin disease dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB). Most COL7A1 mutations are unique to individual families, and therefore it is usually necessary to screen all 118 exons of the gene to determine the molecular pathology in a patient with DEB. This study aimed to identify any recurrent mutations in COL7A1 that might be applicable to mutation-detection strategies in these patients. Mutational analysis was undertaken in 23 British patients with autosomal recessive DEB using PCR amplification of genomic DNA followed by heteroduplex analysis, nucleotide sequencing, and restriction site analysis. Two recurrent mutations were identified: R578X (6 of 46 alleles) and 7786delG (7 of 46 alleles). Haplotype analysis revealed that the mutations existed on similar allelic backgrounds in different patients, consistent with propagation of common British ancestral haplotypes, although R578X and 7786delG also have been described in DEB patients from other ethnic backgrounds. Given the high relative frequency of these two COL7A1 mutations, British patients with recessive DEB should be screened initially for these nucleotide changes by PCR amplification of genomic DNA and restriction analysis before more exhaustive screening of COL7A1.

19302219	20090324	p53 Arg72Pro, MDM2 T309G and CCND1 G870A polymorphisms are not associated with susceptibility to esophageal adenocarcinoma.	p53 Arg72Pro, MDM2 T309G, and CCND1 G870A are functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in key genes that regulate apoptosis and cell cycle. Variant genotypes of these SNPs have been associated with increased risk and earlier age of onset in some cancers. We investigated the association of these SNPs with susceptibility to esophageal adenocarcinoma in a large, North American case-control study. Three hundred and twelve cases and 454 cancer-free controls recruited in Boston, USA were genotyped for each of the three SNPs, and demographic and clinical data were collected. Genotype frequencies for each of the three SNPs did not deviate from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and did not differ between cases and controls. Odds ratios (OR), adjusted for clinical risk factors, for the homozygous variant genotypes were 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57-1.72) for p53 Pro/Pro, 0.81 (95% CI 0.52-1.28) for MDM2 G/G, and 0.97 (95% CI 0.64-1.49) for CCND1 A/A. The analysis was adequately powered (80%) to detect ORs of 1.37, 1.35, and 1.34 for each SNP, respectively. In contrast to the results of smaller published studies, no association between p53 Arg72Pro, MDM2 T309G, and CCND1 G870A SNPs and susceptibility to esophageal adenocarcinoma, age of onset, or stage of disease at diagnosis was detected.

9521723	19980502	Origin of the catalytic activity of bovine seminal ribonuclease against double-stranded RNA.	Bovine seminal ribonuclease (RNase) binds, melts, and (in the case of RNA) catalyzes the hydrolysis of double-stranded nucleic acid 30-fold better under physiological conditions than its pancreatic homologue, the well-known RNase A. Reported here are site-directed mutagenesis experiments that identify the sequence determinants of this enhanced catalytic activity. These experiments have been guided in part by experimental reconstructions of ancestral RNases from extinct organisms that were intermediates in the evolution of the RNase superfamily. It is shown that the enhanced interactions between bovine seminal RNase and double-stranded nucleic acid do not arise from the increased number of basic residues carried by the seminal enzyme. Rather, a combination of a dimeric structure and the introduction of two glycine residues at positions 38 and 111 on the periphery of the active site confers the full catalytic activity of bovine seminal RNase against duplex RNA. A structural model is presented to explain these data, the use of evolutionary reconstructions to guide protein engineering experiments is discussed, and a new variant of RNase A, A(Q28L K31C S32C D38G E111G), which contains all of the elements identified in these experiments as being important for duplex activity, is prepared. This is the most powerful catalyst within this subfamily yet observed, some 46-fold more active against duplex RNA than RNase A. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485 D013486
18386806	20080405	Mitochondrial ND5 T12338C, tRNA(Cys) T5802C, and tRNA(Thr) G15927A variants may have a modifying role in the phenotypic manifestation of deafness-associated 12S rRNA A1555G mutation in three Han Chinese pedigrees.	We report here on the clinical, genetic, and molecular characterization of three Han Chinese pedigrees with aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic hearing loss. Clinical evaluation revealed the variable phenotype of hearing impairment including severity, age-at-onset, audiometric configuration in these subjects. The penetrance of hearing loss in WZD8, WZD9, and WZD10 pedigrees were 46%, 46%, and 50%, respectively, when aminoglycoside-induced deafness was included. When the effect of aminoglycosides was excluded, the penetrance of hearing loss in these pedigrees were 23%, 31%, and 37.5%, respectively. Mutational analysis of the complete mitochondrial genomes showed the homoplasmic A1555G mutation and distinct sets of mitochondrial DNA variants belonging to haplogroups D4b2b, B5b1, and F2, respectively. Of these, the tRNA(Cys) T5802C, tRNA(Thr) A15924C, and ND5 T12338C variants are of special interest as these variants occur at positions which are highly evolutionarily conserved nucleotides of tRNAs or amino acid of polypeptide. These homoplasmic mtDNA variants were absent among 156 unrelated Chinese controls. The T5802C and G15927A variants disrupted a highly conserved A-U or C-G base-pairing at the anticodon-stem of tRNA(Cys) or tRNA(Thr), while the ND5 T12338C mutation resulted in the replacement of the translation-initiating methionine with a threonine, and also located in two nucleotides adjacent to the 3' end of the tRNA(Leu(CUN)). Thus, mitochondrial dysfunctions, caused by the A1555G mutation, would be worsened by these mtDNA variants. Therefore, these mtDNA mutations may have a potential modifier role in increasing the penetrance and expressivity of the deafness-associated 12S rRNA A1555G mutation in those Chinese pedigrees.

20157910	20100217	Directed evolution of an antitumor drug (arginine deiminase PpADI) for increased activity at physiological pH.	Arginine deiminase (ADI; EC 3.5.3.6) has been studied as a potential antitumor drug for the treatment of arginine-auxotrophic tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and melanomas. Studies with human lymphatic leukemia cell lines confirmed that ADI is an antiangiogenic agent for treating leukemia. The main limitation of ADI from Pseudomonas plecoglossicida (PpADI) lies in its pH-dependent activity profile, its pH optimum is at 6.5. A pH shift from 6.5 to 7.5 results in an approximately 80 % drop in activity. (The pH of human plasma is 7.35 to 7.45.) In order to shift the PpADI pH optimum, a directed-evolution protocol based on an adapted citrulline-screening protocol in microtiter-plate format was developed and validated. A proof of concept for ADI engineering resulted in a pH optimum of pH 7.0 and increased resistance under physiological and slightly alkaline conditions. At pH 7.4, variant M2 (K5T/D44E/H404R) is four times faster than the wild-type PpADI and retains approximately 50 % of its activity relative to its pH optimum, compared to approximately 10 % in the case of the wild-type PpADI.

24649029	20140321	Association of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T and A1298C polymorphisms with colorectal cancer risk: A meta-analysis.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. This meta-analysis was conducted to determine the effect of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) mutants on the risk of CRC. A literature search was conducted on PubMed, Medline and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. Eligible studies were collected based on rigorous criteria of inclusion. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by the fixed- or random-effects model. After all the studies were pooled, the OR of CRC for individuals carrying the MTHFR 677TT genotype, compared to the CC genotype, was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.82-0.97). When analyzed by ethnicity, Asians with the MTHFR 1298CC genotype exhibited a decreased risk of CRC (OR=0.69; 95% CI: 0.54-0.89). In a mixed population, a significantly reduced risk of CRC was observed among carriers of the 677TT (OR=0.86; 95% CI: 0.76-0.96) and the 1298CC (OR=0.82; 95% CI: 0.69-0.98) genotypes, compared to the wild-type homozygous genotype. In the subgroup of colon cancer, the OR of 677TT vs. CC+CT was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.72-0.96) and the OR of 1298CC vs. AA+AC was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.69-0.96). In the rectal cancer subgroup, the OR of 677TT vs. CC+CT was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77-0.97). Therefore, this meta-analysis suggested that the MTHFR 677T and 1298C alleles were associated with a low risk of CRC. 	Biomed_Rep	D016428
21383079	20110309	OATL1, a novel autophagosome-resident Rab33B-GAP, regulates autophagosomal maturation.	Macroautophagy is a bulk degradation system conserved in all eukaryotic cells. A ubiquitin-like protein, Atg8, and its homologues are essential for autophagosome formation and act as a landmark for selective autophagy of aggregated proteins and damaged organelles. In this study, we report evidence demonstrating that OATL1, a putative Rab guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein (GAP), is a novel binding partner of Atg8 homologues in mammalian cells. OATL1 is recruited to isolation membranes and autophagosomes through direct interaction with Atg8 homologues and is involved in the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes through its GAP activity. We further provide evidence that Rab33B, an Atg16L1-binding protein, is a target substrate of OATL1 and is involved in the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes, the same as OATL1. Because both its GAP activity and its Atg8 homologue-binding activity are required for OATL1 to function, we propose a model that OATL1 uses Atg8 homologues as a scaffold to exert its GAP activity and to regulate autophagosomal maturation.

22533991	20120427	Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A): a transcriptional target of PAX3-FKHR and mediates PAX3-FKHR-dependent motility in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cells.	Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) has a high propensity to metastasize, leading to its aggressiveness and a poor survival rate among those with the disease. More than 80% of aggressive ARMSs harbor a PAX3-FKHR fusion transcription factor, which regulates cell migration and promotes metastasis, most likely by regulating the fusion protein's transcriptional targets. Therefore, identifying druggable transcription targets of PAX3-FKHR that are also downstream effectors of PAX3-FKHR-mediated cell migration and metastasis may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for treating ARMS. To identify genes whose expression is directly affected by the level of PAX3-FKHR in an ARMS cellular-context, we first developed an ARMS cell line in which PAX3-FKHR is stably down-regulated, and showed that stably downregulating PAX3-FKHR in ARMS cells significantly decreased the cells' motility. We used microarray analysis to identify genes whose expression level decreased when PAX3-FKHR was downregulated. We used mutational analysis, promoter reporter assays, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays to determine whether PAX3-FKHR binds to the promoter region of the target gene. We used siRNA and pharmacologic inhibitor to downregulate the target gene of PAX3-FKHR and investigated the effect of such downregulation on cell motility. We found that when PAX3-FKHR was downregulated, the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) decreased. We showed that PAX3-FKHR binds to a paired-domain binding-site in the CPT1A promoter region, indicating that CPT1A is a novel transcriptional target of PAX3-FKHR. Furthermore, downregulating CPT1A decreased cell motility in ARMS cells, indicating that CPT1A is a downstream effector of PAX3-FKHR-mediated cell migration and metastasis. Taken together, we have identified CPT1A as a novel transcriptional target of PAX3-FKHR and revealed the novel function of CPT1A in promoting cell motility. CPT1A may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of ARMS. 	BMC_Cancer	D016428 D052061 D013485
23389246	20130208	Individual risk assessment of adverse pregnancy outcome by multivariate regression analysis may serve as basis for drug intervention studies: retrospective analysis of 426 high-risk patients including ethical aspects.	To identify patients at very high risk for adverse pregnancy outcome (APO) at the 20- to 23-week scan and to assess the effectiveness of Aspirin (ASS) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) starting after this examination. By applying an algorithm based on multivariate logistic regression analysis using the parameters maternal age, parity, body mass index (BMI), mean pulsatility index of both uterine arteries (meanPI), presence of uni- or bilateral notch, and depth of notch (mean notch index (meanNI), we retrospectively calculated the individual risk for APO of 21,302 singleton pregnancies. We isolated a subgroup of 426 patients with the highest calculated probability for APO (cpAPO &gt; 27.8 %). 147 had been treated with ASS; 73 with LMWH, 15 patients with a combination of ASS and LMWH, and 191 patients had not received anticoagulants. Administration of ASS starting after 20 gestational weeks in comparison to non-treated patients significantly reduced the frequency of intrauterine/neonatal death (IUD/NND), preeclampsia &lt;33 weeks (PE &lt; 33), and preterm delivery &lt;33 weeks (PD &lt; 33), while the frequency of IUGR showed a tendency to be elevated (P = 0.061). The subgroup of high-risk patients treated with LMWH was characterised by a higher a priori risk for APO and showed no significant reduction of any form of APO but an increased frequency of PE. Individual assessment of risk for APO by applying a simple algorithm based on biometrical/biographical as well as sonographic parameters may serve as basis for drug intervention studies. The administration of ASS in high-risk patients starting after 20 gestational weeks reduced the frequency of most of the severe forms of adverse pregnancy outcome in high-risk patients. A complication-reducing effect of LMWH starting after 20 weeks of gestation in patients could not be proven. From an ethical point of view, it may not be justified any more to preclude high-risk patients from administration of ASS or to perform studies of ASS against placebo. 	Arch._Gynecol._Obstet.

10464673	19990828	Mutations in the SLC3A1 gene in cystinuric patients: frequencies and identification of a novel mutation.	Cystinuria is a frequent autosomal recessive transport disorder characterized by defective renal resorption of cystine and other dibasic amino acids. Biochemically, three types of cystinuria can be defined. Here we present our results of screening for mutations in the SLC3A1 gene, which codes for a dibasic amino acid transporter protein and appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of cystinuria type I. Our study population consists of 5 Italian cystinuria type I patients and 10 cystinuric patients as yet unclassified as to clinical type. The latter were of different ethnic origin. In total, we found 13 point mutations and 8 genomic rearrangements in 15 cystinuric patients, i.e., our detection rate was 70% (23/30 chromosomes). Remarkably, in patients known to be suffering from cystinuria type I, the mutation detection rate was only 50%, whereas in patients unselected as to cystinuria type, we found 80% of mutations. Additionally, our results, as with those published in the literature, indicate a possible population specific distribution of mutations: Each of the 4 Greek patients analyzed here showed homozygosity for mutation T216M in exon 3. Analysis of a Yugoslavian patient showed homozygosity for a novel mutation, R365L, in exon 6 (nt1094G &gt; T). Findings from molecular genetic studies, as well as physiological investigations, suggest that there are further genes that play a role in the etiology of cystinuria. Nevertheless, our results show that screening for mutations in the SLC3A1 gene can be a meaningful step toward molecular genetic diagnosis of cystinuria in patients without biochemical classification. As with cystic fibrosis, the finding of specific mutations in particular ethnic populations, suggest that the diagnostic approach should take into consideration a patient's ethnic origins.

20884265	20101002	Molecular characterization of the AdeI mutant of Chinese hamster ovary cells: a cellular model of adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency.	Adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL, E. C. 4.3.2.2) carries out two non-sequential steps in de novo AMP synthesis, the conversion of succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (SAICAR) to aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribotide (AICAR) and the conversion of succinyl AMP (AMPS) to AMP. In humans, mutations in ADSL lead to an inborn error of metabolism originally characterized by developmental delay, often with autistic features. There is no effective treatment for ADSL deficiency. Hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis include toxicity of high levels of SAICAR, AMPS, or their metabolites, deficiency of the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway, or lack of a completely functional purine cycle in muscle and brain. One important approach to understand ADSL deficiency is to develop cell culture models that allow investigation of the properties of ADSL mutants and the consequences of ADSL deficiency at the cellular level. We previously reported the isolation and initial characterization of mutants of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells (AdeI) that lack detectable ADSL activity, accumulate SAICAR and AMPS, and require adenine for growth. Here we report the cDNA sequences of ADSL from CHO-K1 and AdeI cells and describe a mutation resulting in an alanine to valine amino acid substitution at position 291 (A291V) in AdeI ADSL. This substitution lies in the &quot;signature sequence&quot; of ADSL, inactivates the enzyme, and validates AdeI as a cellular model of ADSL deficiency. 	Mol._Genet._Metab.	D016428 D052061 D013485
19555453	20090627	In vivo localizations of membrane stress controllers PspA and PspG in Escherichia coli.	The phage shock protein (Psp) response in Gram-negative bacteria counteracts membrane stress. Transcription of the PspF regulon (pspABCDE and pspG) in Escherichia coli is induced upon stresses that dissipate the proton motive force (pmf). Using GFP fusions we have visualized the subcellular localizations of PspA (a negative regulator and effector of Psp) and PspG (an effector of Psp). It has previously been proposed that PspA evenly coates the inner membrane of the cell. We now demonstrate that instead of uniformly covering the entire cell, PspA (and PspG) is highly organized into what appear to be distinct functional classes (complexes at the cell pole and the lateral cell wall). Real-time observations revealed lateral PspA and PspG complexes are highly mobile, but absent in cells lacking MreB. Without the MreB cytoskeleton, induction of the Psp response is still observed, yet these cells fail to maintain pmf under stress conditions. The two spatial subspecies therefore appear to be dynamically and functionally distinct with the polar clusters being associated with sensory function and the mobile complexes with maintenance of pmf.

In order to understand the molecular mechanisms by which G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) activate G proteins, the K349P mutant of Galpha(i1) (K349P), which is unable to couple to the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, was prepared and its crystals were grown along with those of wild-type Galpha(i1) protein (WT). The two proteins were crystallized under almost identical conditions, thus enabling a detailed structural comparison. The crystallization conditions performed well irrespective of the identity of the bound nucleotide (GDP or GTPgammaS) and the crystals diffracted to resolutions of 2.2 A (WT.GDP), 2.8 A (WT.GTPgammaS), 2.6 A (K349P.GDP) and 3.2 A (K349P.GTPgammaS).

24473719	20140130	Influence of radiopaque fillers on physicochemical properties of a model epoxy resin-based root canal sealer.	To verify the influence of radiopaque fillers on an epoxy resin-based sealer. Experimental sealers were formulated by adding 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100% and 120% of calcium tungstate, ytterbium trifluoride or barium sulphate by weight to an epoxy-resin-base. Setting time, flow, film thickness, radiopacity, sorption, solubility, pH and push-out bond strength were evaluated. The setting time ranged from 373 to 612.66 min, the flow varied from 13.81?0.49 to 22.49?0.37 mm, and the film thickness ranged from 16.67?5.77 to 33.33?11.54 ?m. The lowest pH was 5.47?0.53, and the highest was 6.99?0.03. Radiopacity varied from 0.38?0.04 to 2.57?0.21 mmAl and increased with the amount of filler. Calcium tungstate sealers had a higher sorption and solubility than other sealers. There was no significant difference in the push-out bond strength among the fillers at the 120% concentration. The inorganic fillers evaluated and their concentrations affect the physicochemical properties of an epoxy resin-based root canal sealer. 	J_Appl_Oral_Sci	D023362 D016428
25093810	20140806	Analysis of functions of VIP1 and its close homologs in osmosensory responses of Arabidopsis thaliana.	VIP1 is a bZIP protein in Arabidopsis thaliana. VIP1 accumulates in the nucleus under hypo-osmotic conditions and interacts with the promoters of hypo-osmolarity-responsive genes, CYP707A1 and CYP707A3 (CYP707A1/3), but neither overexpression of VIP1 nor truncation of its DNA-binding region affects the expression of CYP707A3 in vivo, raising the possibility that VIP and other proteins are functionally redundant. Here we show further analyses on VIP1 and its close homologs, namely, Arabidopsis group I bZIP proteins. The patterns of the signals of the GFP-fused group I bZIP proteins were similar in onion and Arabidopsis cells, suggesting that they have similar subcellular localization. In a yeast one-hybrid assay, the group I bZIP proteins caused reporter gene activation in the yeast reporter strain. VIP1 and other group I bZIP proteins showed positive results in a yeast two-hybrid assay and a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay, suggesting that they physically interact. These results support the idea that they have somewhat similar functions. By gel shift assays, VIP1-binding sequences in the CYP707A1/3 promoters were confirmed to be AGCTGT/G. Their presence in the promoters of the genes that respond to hypo-osmotic conditions was evaluated using previously published microarray data. Interestingly, a significantly higher proportion of the promoters of the genes that were up-regulated by rehydration treatment and/or submergence treatment (treatment by a hypotonic solution) and a significantly lower proportion of the promoters of the genes that were down-regulated by such treatment shared AGCTGT/G. To further assess the physiological role of VIP1, constitutively nuclear-localized variants of VIP1 were generated. When overexpressed in Arabidopsis, some of them as well as VIP1 caused growth retardation under a mannitol-stressed condition, where VIP1 is localized mainly in the cytoplasm. This raises the possibility that the expression of VIP1 itself rather than its nuclear localization is responsible for regulating the mannitol responses. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
21770725	20110721	The P450 oxidoreductase *28 SNP is associated with low initial tacrolimus exposure and increased dose requirements in CYP3A5-expressing renal recipients.	Recently a SNP of the gene encoding P450 oxidoreductase (POR*28; rs1057868C&gt;T) has been associated with increased in vivo CYP3A activity using midazolam as a drug probe. Because tacrolimus is metabolized by CYP3A isoenzymes, this SNP might affect tacrolimus pharmacokinetics. To test this hypothesis we performed a study in a cohort of 298 de novo renal allograft recipients stratified according to CYP3A5 genotype, which has a known impact on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics. We found that in CYP3A5 expressers (CYP3A5*1 allele carriers) receiving a standard loading dose of 0.2 mg/kg, POR*28T allele carriers had lower tacrolimus C? levels in the first days post-transplantation and reached target C? levels significantly later as compared with POR*28CC homozygous patients. The POR*28T allele carriers had significantly higher tacrolimus dose requirements throughout the first year. In CYP3A5 nonexpressers (CYP3A5*3/*3) the POR*28 SNP did not affect tacrolimus pharmacokinetics. These data indicate that the POR*28 SNP is associated with additional increases in early tacrolimus dose-requirements in patients carrying a CYP3A5*1 allele. 	Pharmacogenomics	D016428
26442006	20151007	Influence of Rhizoctonia solani and Trichoderma spp. in growth of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and in the induction of plant defense-related genes.	Many Trichoderma species are well-known for their ability to promote plant growth and defense. We study how the interaction of bean plants with R. solani and/or Trichoderma affect the plants growth and the level of expression of defense-related genes. Trichoderma isolates were evaluated in vitro for their potential to antagonize R. solani. Bioassays were performed in climatic chambers and development of the plants was evaluated. The effect of Trichoderma treatment and/or R. solani infection on the expression of bean defense-related genes was analyzed by real-time PCR and the production of ergosterol and squalene was quantified. In vitro growth inhibition of R. solani was between 86 and 58%. In in vivo assays, the bean plants treated with Trichoderma harzianum T019 always had an increased size respect to control and the plants treated with this isolate did not decrease their size in presence of R. solani. The interaction of plants with R. solani and/or Trichoderma affects the level of expression of seven defense-related genes. Squalene and ergosterol production differences were found among the Trichoderma isolates, T019 showing the highest values for both compounds. T. harzianum T019 shows a positive effect on the level of resistance of bean plants to R. solani. This strain induces the expression of plant defense-related genes and produces a higher level of ergosterol, indicating its ability to grow at a higher rate in the soil, which would explain its positive effects on plant growth and defense in the presence of the pathogen.

22462770	20120403	Operational research to inform a sub-national surveillance intervention for malaria elimination in Solomon Islands.	Successful reduction of malaria transmission to very low levels has made Isabel Province, Solomon Islands, a target for early elimination by 2014. High malaria transmission in neighbouring provinces and the potential for local asymptomatic infections to cause malaria resurgence highlights the need for sub-national tailoring of surveillance interventions. This study contributes to a situational analysis of malaria in Isabel Province to inform an appropriate surveillance intervention. A mixed method study was carried out in Isabel Province in late 2009 and early 2010. The quantitative component was a population-based prevalence survey of 8,554 people from 129 villages, which were selected using a spatially stratified sampling approach to achieve uniform geographical coverage of populated areas. Diagnosis was initially based on Giemsa-stained blood slides followed by molecular analysis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Local perceptions and practices related to management of fever and treatment-seeking that would impact a surveillance intervention were also explored using qualitative research methods. Approximately 33% (8,554/26,221) of the population of Isabel Province participated in the survey. Only one subject was found to be infected with Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) (96 parasites/?L) using Giemsa-stained blood films, giving a prevalence of 0.01%. PCR analysis detected a further 13 cases, giving an estimated malaria prevalence of 0.51%. There was a wide geographical distribution of infected subjects. None reported having travelled outside Isabel Province in the previous three months suggesting low-level indigenous malaria transmission. The qualitative findings provide warning signs that the current community vigilance approach to surveillance will not be sufficient to achieve elimination. In addition, fever severity is being used by individuals as an indicator for malaria and a trigger for timely treatment-seeking and case reporting. In light of the finding of a low prevalence of parasitaemia, the current surveillance system may not be able to detect and prevent malaria resurgence. An adaption to the malERA surveillance framework is proposed and recommendations made for a tailored provincial-level surveillance intervention, which will be essential to achieve elimination, and to maintain this status while the rest of the country catches up.

24417729	20140115	Effect of flexibility and positive charge of the C-terminal domain on the activator P14K function for nitrile hydratase in Pseudomonas putida.	A self-subunit swapping chaperone is crucial for cobalt incorporation into nitrile hydratase. However, further information about its structural features is not available. The flexibility and positive charge of the C-terminal domain of the self-subunit swapping chaperone (P14K) of nitrile hydratase from Pseudomonas putida NRRL-18668 play an important role in cobalt incorporation. C-terminal domain truncation, alternation of C-terminal domain flexibility through mutant P14K(G86I), and elimination of the positive charge in the C-terminal domain sharply affected nitrile hydratase cobalt content and activity. The flexible, positively charged C-terminal domain most likely carries out an external action that allows a cobalt-free nitrile hydratase to overcome an energetic barrier, resulting in a cobalt-containing nitrile hydratase.

12399480	20021026	Expression, purification, and characterization of AknX anthrone oxygenase, which is involved in aklavinone biosynthesis in Streptomyces galilaeus.	In streptomycete anthracycline biosynthetic gene clusters, small open reading frames are located just upstream of minimal polyketide synthase genes. aknX is such a gene found in the aklavinone-aclacinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces galilaeus. In order to identify its function, the aknX gene was expressed in Escherichia coli. The cell extract prepared from E. coli cells overexpressing AknX protein exhibited anthrone oxygenase activity, which converted emodinanthrone to anthraquinone emodin. This indicates that AknX and related gene products such as DnrG and SnoaB are involved in the formation of aklanonic acid from its anthrone precursor, as suggested by their homology with TcmH and ActVA6. The AknX protein fused with a His(6) tag was efficiently purified to homogeneity by Ni(2+) affinity and anion-exchange column chromatography. The native molecular mass of AknX was estimated to be 42 kDa by gel filtration. Thus, native AknX is considered to have a homotrimeric subunit structure. AknX, like TcmH and ActVA6, possesses no apparent prosthetic group for oxygen activation. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to identify the key amino acid residue(s) involved in the oxygenation reaction. Of seven AknX mutants expressed, the W67F mutant showed significantly reduced oxygenase activity, suggesting the important role of the W67 residue in the AknX reaction. A possible mechanism for the reaction via peroxy anion intermediate is proposed. 	J._Bacteriol.	D016428 D013485
24198825	20131108	Genetics and epigenetics of arrhythmia and heart failure.	Heart failure (HF) is the end stage of several pathological cardiac conditions including myocardial infarction, cardiac hypertrophy and hypertension. Various molecular and cellular mechanisms are involved in the development of HF. At the molecular level, the onset of HF is associated with reprogramming of gene expression, including downregulation of the alpha-myosin heavy chain (?-MHC) gene and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca (2+) ATPase genes and reactivation of specific fetal cardiac genes such as atrial natriuretic factor and brain natriuretic peptide. These deviations in gene expression result in structural and electrophysiological changes, which eventually progress to HF. Cardiac arrhythmia is caused by altered conduction properties of the heart, which may arise in response to ischemia, inflammation, fibrosis, aging or from genetic factors. Because changes in the gene transcription program may have crucial consequences as deteriorated cardiac function, understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the process has become a priority in the field. In this context, various studies besides having identified different DNA methylation patterns in HF patients, have also focused on specific disease processes and their underlying mechanisms, also introducing new concepts such as epigenomics. This review highlights specific genetic mutations associated with the onset and progression of HF, also providing an introduction to epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications, DNA methylation and RNA-based modification, and highlights the relation between epigenetics, arrhythmogenesis and HF.

24355479	20131221	Frequency and genetic spectrum of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) in southern New Zealand.	Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) is a monogenic form of diabetes, consisting of a heterogeneous group of autosomal dominant inherited disorders. Typical onset is in individuals prior to twenty five years, and presentation can mimic type 1 or 2 diabetes. Molecular genetic testing can allow precise identification of the different MODY sub-types. Making a specific diagnosis of MODY can have important implications for the guidance of appropriate treatment, prognosis and genetic counselling.We present the cases of three children and their families diagnosed with MODY over the past two years. These families highlight the features of three of the more common MODY subtypes, including two with novel mutations, one of which segregates in a kindred that is strongly affected by both MODY and classic autoimmune mediated diabetes. To date, we have identified a prevalence of MODY in the paediatric diabetes population of the lower South Island, New Zealand, of approximately 2.5%. This prevalence, along with increasing access to molecular genetic testing, highlights the importance of consideration of MODY in atypical diabetes presentations in the paediatric/adolescent population.

26147900	20150707	Interleukin-28B polymorphisms and interferon gamma inducible protein-10 serum levels in seronegative occult hepatitis C virus infection.	Polymorphisms upstream interleukin (IL)-28B gene and serum levels of interferon gamma inducible protein-10 (IP-10) are associated with spontaneous and treatment-induced hepatitis C virus (HCV) clearance. Patients with seronegative occult HCV infection are anti-HCV and serum HCV-RNA negative but have viral RNA in liver and abnormal values of liver enzymes. We examined if the rs12979860 polymorphism of IL-28B and serum IP-10 levels differ between chronic and seronegative occult CV infection. IL-28B polymorphism was determined with allele specific TaqMan probes in total DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and IP-10 by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum from 99 patients with seronegative occult HCV infection and 130 untreated patients with chronic hepatitis C. IL-28B genotypes were also determined in 54 healthy volunteers. Prevalence of the IL-28B CC genotype was significantly higher in seronegative occult HCV infection (52/99; 52.5%) than in chronic hepatitis C (32/130; 24.6%, P?&lt;?0.0001) or healthy controls (19/54: 32.5%, P?=?0.039). Among patients with seronegative occult HCV infection, HCV-RNA load in liver was significantly lower in those with the IL-28B CC genotype than in those with CT?+?TT genotypes (2.8???10(5) ???5.8???10(4) vs. 4.1???10(5) ???5.9???10(4) ?copies/?g of total RNA respectively; P?=?0.023). Mean serum IP-10 levels were significantly lower in patients with seronegative occult HCV infection than in patients with chronic hepatitis C (160.8???17.9 vs. 288.7???13.3?pg/ml respectively; P?&lt;?0.0001). These findings suggest that the host immune response plays an important role in seronegative occult HCV infection in comparison with chronic hepatitis C. 	J._Med._Virol.	D016428 D013485
22066015	20111109	Recurrent DNMT3A R882 mutations in Chinese patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.	Somatic mutations of DNMT3A gene have recently been reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We examined the entire coding sequences of DNMT3A gene by high-resolution melting analysis and sequencing in Chinese patients with myeloid malignancies. R882 mutations were found in 12/182 AML and in 4/51 MDS, but not in either 79 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), or 57 myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), or 4 chronic monomyelocytic leukemia. No other DNMT3A mutations were detected in all patients. R882 mutations were associated with old age and more frequently present in monoblastic leukemia (M4 and M5, 7/52) compared to other subtypes (5/130). Furthermore, 14/16 (86.6%) R882 mutations were observed in patients with normal karyotypes. The overall survival of mutated MDS patients was shorter than those without mutation (median 9 and 25 months, respectively). We conclude that DNMT3A R882 mutations are recurrent molecular aberrations in AML and MDS, and may be an adverse prognostic event in MDS. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
23675353	20130516	Cold exposure enhances fat utilization but not non-esterified fatty acids, glycerol or catecholamines availability during submaximal walking and running.	Cold exposure modulates the use of carbohydrates (CHOs) and fat during exercise. This phenomenon has mostly been observed in controlled cycling studies, but not during walking and running when core temperature and oxygen consumption are controlled, as both may alter energy metabolism. This study aimed at examining energy substrate availability and utilization during walking and running in the cold when core temperature and oxygen consumption are maintained. Ten lightly clothed male subjects walked or ran for 60-min, at 50% and 70% of maximal oxygen consumption, respectively, in a climatic chamber set at 0?C or 22?C. Thermal, cardiovascular, and oxidative responses were measured every 15-min during exercise. Blood samples for serum non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), glycerol, glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), plasma catecholamines, and serum lipids were collected immediately prior, and at 30- and 60-min of exercise. Skin temperature strongly decreased while core temperature did not change during cold trials. Heart rate (HR) was also lower in cold trials. A rise in fat utilization in the cold was seen through lower respiratory quotient (RQ) (-0.03 ? 0.02), greater fat oxidation (+0.14 ? 0.13 g ? min(-1)) and contribution of fat to total energy expenditure (+1.62 ? 1.99 kcal ? min(-1)). No differences from cold exposure were observed in blood parameters. During submaximal walking and running, a greater reliance on derived fat sources occurs in the cold, despite the absence of concurrent alterations in NEFAs, glycerol, or catecholamine concentrations. This disparity may suggest a greater reliance on intra-muscular energy sources such as triglycerides during both walking and running. 	Front_Physiol	D016428
12952540	20030904	Expression and localization of P1 promoter-driven hepatocyte nuclear factor-4? (HNF4?) isoforms in human and rats.	Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4? (HNF4?; NR2A1) is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily involved in various processes that could influence endoderm development, glucose and lipid metabolism. A loss-of-function mutation in human HNF4? causes one form of diabetes mellitus called maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 1 (MODY1) which is characterized in part by a diminished insulin secretory response to glucose. The expression of HNF4? in a variety of tissues has been examined predominantly at the mRNA level, and there is little information regarding the cellular localization of the endogenous HNF4? protein, due, in part, to the limited availability of human HNF4?-specific antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies have been produced using baculovirus particles displaying gp64-HNF4? fusion proteins as the immunizing agent. The mouse anti-human HNF4? monoclonal antibody (K9218) generated against human HNF4?1/?2/?3 amino acids 3-49 was shown to recognize not only the transfected and expressed P1 promoter-driven HNF4? proteins, but also endogenous proteins. Western blot analysis with whole cell extracts from Hep G2, Huh7 and Caco-2 showed the expression of HNF4? protein, but HEK293 showed no expression of HNF4? protein. Nuclear-specific localization of the HNF4? protein was observed in the hepatocytes of liver cells, proximal tubular epithelial cells of kidney, and mucosal epithelial cells of small intestine and colon, but no HNF4? protein was detected in the stomach, pancreas, glomerulus, and distal and collecting tubular epithelial cells of kidney. The same tissue distribution of HNF4? protein was observed in humans and rats. Electron microscopic immunohistochemistry showed a chromatin-like localization of HNF4? in the liver and kidney. As in the immunohistochemical investigation using K9218, HNF4? mRNA was found to be localized primarily to liver, kidney, small intestine and colon by RT-PCR and GeneChip analysis. These results suggest that this method has the potential to produce valuable antibodies without the need for a protein purification step. Immunohistochemical studies indicate the tissue and subcellular specific localization of HNF4? and demonstrate the utility of K9218 for the detection of P1 promoter-driven HNF4? isoforms in humans and in several other mammalian species.

26672749	20151218	MHC Class I Chain-Related Gene A Polymorphisms and Linkage Disequilibrium with HLA-B and HLA-C Alleles in Ocular Toxoplasmosis.	This study investigated whether polymorphisms of the MICA (major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene A) gene are associated with eye lesions due to Toxoplasma gondii infection in a group of immunocompetent patients from southeastern Brazil. The study enrolled 297 patients with serological diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. Participants were classified into two distinct groups after conducting fundoscopic exams according to the presence (n = 148) or absence (n = 149) of ocular scars/lesions due to toxoplasmosis. The group of patients with scars/lesions was further subdivided into two groups according to the type of the ocular manifestation observed: primary (n = 120) or recurrent (n = 28). Genotyping of the MICA and HLA alleles was performed by the polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific oligonucleotide technique (PCR-SSO; One Lambda?) and the MICA-129 polymorphism (rs1051792) was identified by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR-RFLP). Significant associations involving MICA polymorphisms were not found. Although the MICA*002~HLA-B*35 haplotype was associated with increased risk of developing ocular toxoplasmosis (P-value = 0.04; OR = 2.20; 95% CI = 1.05-4.60), and the MICA*008~HLA-C*07 haplotype was associated with protection against the development of manifestations of ocular toxoplasmosis (P-value = 0.009; OR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.22-0.76), these associations were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. MICA polymorphisms do not appear to influence the development of ocular lesions in patients diagnosed with toxoplasmosis in this study population. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
25520849	20141219	Adrenal cancer in neurofibromatosis type 1: case report and DNA analysis.	Adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) has previously only been reported in eight patients with type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1). There has not been any clear evidence of a causal association between NF1 gene mutations and adrenocortical malignancy development. We report the case of a 49-year-old female, with no family history of endocrinopathy, who was diagnosed with ACC on the background of NF1, due to a novel germline frame shift mutation (c.5452_5453delAT) in exon 37 of the NF1 gene. A left adrenal mass was detected by ultrasound and characterised by contrast computerised tomography (CT) scan. Biochemical tests showed mild hypercortisolism and androgen excess. A 24-h urinary steroid profile and (18)flouro deoxy glucose PET suggested ACC. An open adrenalectomy was performed and histology confirmed ACC. This is the first reported case with DNA analysis, which demonstrated the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the NF1 locus in the adrenal cancer, supporting the hypothesis of an involvement of the NF1 gene in the pathogenesis of ACC. LOH analysis of the tumour suggests that the loss of neurofibromin in the adrenal cells may lead to tumour formation. ACC is rare but should be considered in a patient with NF1 and adrenal mass when plasma metanephrines are normal.Urinary steroid metabolites and PET/CT are helpful in supporting evidence for ACC.The LOH at the NF1 region of the adrenal tumour supports the role of loss of neurofibromin in the development of ACC.

19652440	20090805	Unique mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene of three cases of cystic fibrosis in Nagasaki, Japan.	Cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common lethal hereditary disorder in Caucasians, is quite rare in Southeast Asia including Japan. Here, we report three CF cases encountered in Nagasaki, Japan. Case 1; a 24-year-old man with dyspnea and cough was diagnosed as CF with a missense mutation Q98R in exon 4 and a polymorphic 125C in exon 1 in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Case 2; a 13-year-old woman born of consanguineous parents was diagnosed as CF with homozygous Q98R mutations in exon 4. Case 3; a 29-year-old woman complaining of cough and sputum was diagnosed as CF with a heterozygous R347H mutation in exon 7 and a polymorphic 125C in exon 1. These mutations have been previously reported in Caucasian patients, but are considered very rare. Although the numbers of individuals with CF are very limited, the profiles of CFTR mutations in those patients are likely diverse in Japan. 	Intern._Med.	D002363 D016428
23453470	20130305	Treatment responses in five patients with Ribbing disease including two with 466C&gt;T missense mutations in TGF?1.	To assess 5-year treatment responses and TGFB1 gene abnormalities in five patients with ribbing disease. PCR analysis and bidirectional sequencing of TGF?1 exons 1 through 7 were performed in all five patients. The five patients, four women and one man with a mean age of 34 years at symptom onset, shared the following features: severe diaphyseal pain predominating in the lower limbs with diaphyseal hyperostosis; increased radionuclide uptake at sites of pain and, in some cases at other cortical sites; asymmetric or asynchronous lesions; long symptom duration (5-18 years) despite a variety of treatments; and a delay of several years (2-15) between symptom onset and the diagnosis. Of our five patients, two had a heterozygous missense mutation in exon 2 of TGF?1 (c.466C&gt;T, p.Arg156Cys, previously described in Camurati-Engelmann syndrome) and three had commonly found TGF?1 polymorphisms. Intravenous bisphosphonate therapy was used in all five patients but induced substantial improvements in a single patient. Of the three patients given bolus methylprednisolone therapy, two experienced a lasting response; the exception was one of the two women with a TGF?1 mutation. Considerable heterogeneity in the clinical presentations, genetic abnormalities, and treatment responses contribute to the diagnostic challenges raised by ribbing disease. Detailed genetic studies are needed. 	Joint_Bone_Spine	D016428
21633511	20110603	Human endogenous retrovirus K106 (HERV-K106) was infectious after the emergence of anatomically modern humans.	HERV-K113 and HERV-K115 have been considered to be among the youngest HERVs because they are the only known full-length proviruses that are insertionally polymorphic and maintain the open reading frames of their coding genes. However, recent data suggest that HERV-K113 is at least 800,000 years old, and HERV-K115 even older. A systematic study of HERV-K HML2 members to identify HERVs that may have infected the human genome in the more recent evolutionary past is lacking. Therefore, we sought to determine how recently HERVs were exogenous and infectious by examining sequence variation in the long terminal repeat (LTR) regions of all full-length HERV-K loci. We used the traditional method of inter-LTR comparison to analyze all full length HERV-Ks and determined that two insertions, HERV-K106 and HERV-K116 have no differences between their 5' and 3' LTR sequences, suggesting that these insertions were endogenized in the recent evolutionary past. Among these insertions with no sequence differences between their LTR regions, HERV-K106 had the most intact viral sequence structure. Coalescent analysis of HERV-K106 3' LTR sequences representing 51 ethnically diverse individuals suggests that HERV-K106 integrated into the human germ line approximately 150,000 years ago, after the emergence of anatomically modern humans.

Genetic transfer of the ability to grow at 55 C in Bacillus subtilis. J. Bacteriol. 85:218-220. 1962.-Two strains of Bacillus subtilis, 168 and P1, were found to grow at 55 C (55(+)) on complete media; strain 168S(r) failed to grow at temperatures above 50 C (55(-)). When 168S(r) bacteria were grown in the presence of deoxyribonucleic acid extracted from 168, the ability to grow at 55 C was transformed at a frequency of 10(-4). An incubation period of 3 to 4 hr at 37 C was necessary for phenotypic expression of the 55(+) character. Only 10 to 20% of the 55(+) transformants retained the high-level streptomycin resistance (S(r)) of the recipient, indicating close linkage between the S(s) and 55(+) loci. 	J._Bacteriol.	D016428
23285048	20130104	Context- and cell-dependent effects of Delta-like 4 targeting in the bone marrow microenvironment.	Delta-like 4 (Dll4) is a ligand of the Notch pathway family which has been widely studied in the context of tumor angiogenesis, its blockade shown to result in non-productive angiogenesis and halted tumor growth. As Dll4 inhibitors enter the clinic, there is an emerging need to understand their side effects, namely the systemic consequences of Dll4:Notch blockade in tissues other than tumors. The present study focused on the effects of systemic anti-Dll4 targeting in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Here we show that Dll4 blockade with monoclonal antibodies perturbs the BM vascular niche of sub-lethally irradiated mice, resulting in increased CD31(+), VE-Cadherin(+) and c-kit(+) vessel density, and also increased megakaryocytes, whereas CD105(+), VEGFR3(+), SMA(+) and lectin(+) vessel density remained unaltered. We investigated also the expression of angiocrine genes upon Dll4 treatment in vivo, and demonstrate that IGFbp2, IGFbp3, Angpt2, Dll4, DHH and VEGF-A are upregulated, while FGF1 and CSF2 are reduced. In vitro treatment of endothelial cells with anti-Dll4 reduced Akt phosphorylation while maintaining similar levels of Erk 1/2 phosphorylation. Besides its effects in the BM vascular niche, anti-Dll4 treatment perturbed hematopoiesis, as evidenced by increased myeloid (CD11b(+)), decreased B (B220(+)) and T (CD3(+)) lymphoid BM content of treated mice, with a corresponding increase in myeloid circulating cells. Moreover, anti-Dll4 treatment also increased the number of CFU-M and -G colonies in methylcellulose assays, independently of Notch1. Finally, anti-Dll4 treatment of donor BM improved the hematopoietic recovery of lethally irradiated recipients in a transplant setting. Together, our data reveals the hematopoietic (BM) effects of systemic anti-Dll4 treatment result from qualitative vascular changes and also direct hematopoietic cell modulation, which may be favorable in a transplant setting.

27273296	20160609	Management of asymptomatic gene carriers of transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy.	Transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) is a rare, severe, and irreversible, adult-onset, hereditary disorder caused by autosomal-dominant mutations in the TTR gene that increase the intrinsic propensity of transthyretin protein to misfold and deposit systemically as insoluble amyloid fibrils in nerve tissues, the heart, and other organs. TTR-FAP is characterized by relentless, progressively debilitating polyneuropathy, and leads to death, on average, within 10 years of symptom onset without treatment. With increased availability of disease-modifying treatment options for a wider spectrum of patients with TTR-FAP, timely detection of the disease may offer substantial clinical benefits. This review discusses mutation-specific predictive genetic testing in first-degree relatives of index patients diagnosed with TTR-FAP and the structured clinical follow-up of asymptomatic gene carriers for prompt diagnosis and early therapeutic intervention before accumulation of substantial damage.

18599571	20080705	Cataract surgery and the risk of aging macula disorder: the rotterdam study.	To investigate still-controversial associations between prior cataract surgery and aging macula disorder (AMD) in a general population. Baseline lens status and risk of incident AMD (iAMD) were examined in participants of the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study at risk for AMD (n = 6032). Slit lamp examination was used to determine lens status and stereoscopic color fundus photography to determine the presence of AMD. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with generalized estimating equation (GEE) models. Stratified analyses were also performed for CFH Y402H genotype. After adjusting for age, sex, follow-up time, and the correlation between eyes, a history of cataract surgery was associated with incident dry late AMD (OR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.82-6.49). This association remained significant after additional adjustment for smoking status and AMD stage at baseline (OR, 3.44; 95% CI, 1.68-7.08). No statistically significant association was found between prior cataract surgery and the incidence of wet late AMD or early AMD. Homozygous CFH Y402H carriers had higher risks for all types of AMD compared to heterozygotes and noncarriers after cataract surgery, particularly for dry AMD. The findings imply that cataract surgery increases the risk of dry AMD, particularly in homozygous CFH Y402H carriers. The risk of AMD progression should be considered before recommending cataract surgery to patients with cataract and early AMD. 	Invest._Ophthalmol._Vis._Sci.	D003160 D016428 D013485
24714764	20140410	Molecular genetics of colorectal cancer.	Approximately 90% of colorectal cancer cases are sporadic without family history or genetic predisposition, while in less than 10% a causative genetic event has been identified. Historically, colorectal cancer classification was only based on clinical and pathological features. Many efforts have been made to discover the genetic and molecular features of colorectal cancer, and there is more and more evidence that these features determine the prognosis and response to (targeted) treatment. Colorectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease, with three known major molecular groups. The most common is the chromosomal instable group, characterized by an accumulation of mutations in specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. The second is the microsatellite instable group, caused by dysfunction of DNA mismatch repair genes leading to genetic hypermutability. The CpG Island Methylation phenotype is the third group, distinguished by hypermethylation. Colorectal cancer subtyping has also been addressed using genome-wide gene expression profiling in large patient cohorts and recently several molecular classification systems have been proposed. In this review we would like to provide an up-to-date overview of the genetic aspects of colorectal cancer. 	Ann_Gastroenterol	D016454
24935095	20140618	Distinct functions of the laminin ? LN domain and collagen IV during cardiac extracellular matrix formation and stabilization of alary muscle attachments revealed by EMS mutagenesis in Drosophila.	The Drosophila heart (dorsal vessel) is a relatively simple tubular organ that serves as a model for several aspects of cardiogenesis. Cardiac morphogenesis, proper heart function and stability require structural components whose identity and ways of assembly are only partially understood. Structural components are also needed to connect the myocardial tube with neighboring cells such as pericardial cells and specialized muscle fibers, the so-called alary muscles. Using an EMS mutagenesis screen for cardiac and muscular abnormalities in Drosophila embryos we obtained multiple mutants for two genetically interacting complementation groups that showed similar alary muscle and pericardial cell detachment phenotypes. The molecular lesions underlying these defects were identified as domain-specific point mutations in LamininB1 and Cg25C, encoding the extracellular matrix (ECM) components laminin ? and collagen IV ?1, respectively. Of particular interest within the LamininB1 group are certain hypomorphic mutants that feature prominent defects in cardiac morphogenesis and cardiac ECM layer formation, but in contrast to amorphic mutants, only mild defects in other tissues. All of these alleles carry clustered missense mutations in the laminin LN domain. The identified Cg25C mutants display weaker and largely temperature-sensitive phenotypes that result from glycine substitutions in different Gly-X-Y repeats of the triple helix-forming domain. While initial basement membrane assembly is not abolished in Cg25C mutants, incorporation of perlecan is impaired and intracellular accumulation of perlecan as well as the collagen IV ?2 chain is detected during late embryogenesis. Assembly of the cardiac ECM depends primarily on laminin, whereas collagen IV is needed for stabilization. Our data underscore the importance of a correctly assembled ECM particularly for the development of cardiac tissues and their lateral connections. The mutational analysis suggests that the ?6/?3/?8 interface of the laminin ? LN domain is highly critical for formation of contiguous cardiac ECM layers. Certain mutations in the collagen IV triple helix-forming domain may exert a semi-dominant effect leading to an overall weakening of ECM structures as well as intracellular accumulation of collagen and other molecules, thus paralleling observations made in other organisms and in connection with collagen-related diseases.

20573977	20100625	Regulation of exocytosis and fusion pores by synaptotagmin-effector interactions.	Synaptotagmin (syt) serves as a Ca(2+) sensor in the release of neurotransmitters and hormones. This function depends on the ability of syt to interact with other molecules. Syt binds to phosphatidylserine (PS)-containing lipid bilayers as well as to soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor receptors (SNAREs) and promotes SNARE assembly. All these interactions are regulated by Ca(2+), but their specific roles in distinct kinetic steps of exocytosis are not well understood. To explore these questions we used amperometry recording from PC12 cells to investigate the kinetics of exocytosis. Syt isoforms and syt I mutants were overexpressed to perturb syt-PS and syt-SNARE interactions to varying degrees and evaluate the effects on fusion event frequency and the rates of fusion pore transitions. Syt I produced more rapid dilation of fusion pores than syt VII or syt IX, consistent with its role in synchronous synaptic release. Stronger syt-PS interactions were accompanied by a higher frequency of fusion events and more stable fusion pores. By contrast, syt-SNARE interactions and syt-induced SNARE assembly were uncorrelated with rates of exocytosis. This associates the syt-PS interaction with two distinct kinetic steps in Ca(2+) triggered exocytosis and supports a role for the syt-PS interaction in stabilizing open fusion pores.

2722967	19890401	The role of Asp-49 and other conserved amino acids in phospholipases A2 and their importance for enzymatic activity.	The role of aspartic acid-49 (Asp-49) in the active site of porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2 was studied by recombinant DNA techniques: two mutant proteins were constructed containing either glutamic acid (Glu) or lysine (Lys) at position 49. Enzymatic characterization indicated that the presence of Asp-49 is essential for effective hydrolysis of phospholipids. Conversion of Asp-49 to either Glu or Lys strongly reduces the binding of Ca2+ ions, in particular for the lysine mutant, but the affinity for substrate analogues is hardly affected. Extensive purification of naturally occurring Lys-49 phospholipase A2 from the venom of Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus yielded a protein that was nearly inactive. Inhibition studies showed that this residual activity was due to a small amount of contaminating enzyme and that the Lys-49 homologue itself has no enzymatic activity. Our results indicate that Asp-49 is essential for the catalytic action of phospholipase A2. The importance of Asp-49 was further evaluated by comparison of the primary sequences of 53 phospholipases A2 and phospholipase homologues showing that substitutions at position 49 are accompanied by structural variations of otherwise conserved residues. The occurrence of several nonconserved substitutions appeared to be a general characteristic of nonactive phospholipase A2 homologues. 	J._Cell._Biochem.	D016428 D013485
22615207	20120523	Dimerization of NKp46 receptor is essential for NKp46-mediated lysis: characterization of the dimerization site by epitope mapping.	NKp46 is a primary activating receptor of NK cells that is involved in lysis of target cells by NK cells. Previous studies showed that the membrane-proximal domain of NKp46 (NKp46D2) retained the binding of NKp46 to its ligands and is involved in lysis. We studied NKp46D2 by using a peptide-based epitope mapping approach and identified an NKp46D2-derived linear epitope that inhibited NKp46-mediated lysis. The epitope, designated as pep4 (aa 136-155), interacted with NKp46, and lysis by NK cells was inhibited by the presence of pep4. Through modeling and mutagenesis, we showed that pep4 could be involved in NKp46 homodimerization. R145 and D147 contribute to the function of pep4, and R145Q mutation in recombinant NKp46 reduced its binding to target cells. At the cellular level, fluorescent resonance energy transfer analysis revealed that pep4 is indeed involved in dimerization of cell membrane-associated NKp46. We suggest that the NKp46-derived pep4 site is part of the dimerization surface of NKp46 and that NKp46 dimerization contributes to NKp46-mediated lysis by NK cells. 	J._Immunol.

22888217	20120814	Significant neutralizing activities against H2N2 influenza A viruses in human intravenous immunoglobulin lots manufactured from 1993 to 2010.	Influenza A H2N2 virus, also known as the Asian flu, spread worldwide from 1957 to 1967, although there have been no cases reported in humans in the past 40 years. A vaccination program was introduced in Japan in the 1960s. Older Japanese donors could have been naturally infected with the H2N2 virus or vaccinated in the early 1960s. Human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) reflects the epidemiological status of the donating population in a given time period. Here, the possible viral neutralizing (VN) activities of IVIG against the H2N2 virus were examined. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and VN activities of IVIG lots manufactured from 1993 to 2010 in Japan and the United States were evaluated against H2N2 viruses. High HI and VN activities against H2N2 viruses were found in all the IVIG lots investigated. HI titers were 32-64 against the isolate in 1957 and 64-128 against the isolates in 1965. VN titers were 80-320 against the isolate in 1957 and 1280-5120 against the isolates in 1965. Both the HI and VN titers were higher against the isolate in 1965 than in 1957. Thus, antibody titers of IVIG against influenza viruses are well correlated with the history of infection and the vaccine program in Japan. Therefore, evaluation of antibody titers provides valuable information about IVIGs, which could be used for immune stimulation when a new influenza virus emerges in the human population.

24625733	20140315	BH3-mimetic gossypol-induced autophagic cell death in mutant BRAF melanoma cells with high expression of p21Cip?.).	The aim of the present study was to identify the potential therapeutic effects of BH3-mimetic gossypol on melanoma cells with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors. The IC50 values of gossypol were determined using MTT assays in three melanoma cell lines with different resistances to BRAF inhibitor. The effects of gossypol on three melanoma cell lines were further examined by immunoblotting analysis, cell cycle analysis, flow cytometric apoptotic assay and autophagy assay. The functional role of autophagy in gossypol-induced growth inhibition was investigated using siRNA-mediated knockdown of Beclin-1. Gossypol retained its efficacy in BRAF-V600E melanoma clones with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors through a mechanism independent of MEK-ERK inhibition. Gossypol caused G2/M arrest in both BRAF mutant A375P and A375P/Mdr cells with high expression of p21(Cip1), regardless of their drug resistance. Interestingly, we determined that the lack of gossypol-induced mitotic arrest in BRAF-WT-harboring SK-MEL-2 cells was associated with a low level of p21(Cip1) expression. In addition, gossypol preferentially induced autophagy and apoptosis in the gossypol-sensitive cells and not in the gossypol-resistant SK-MEL-2 cells. In particular, alleviation of autophagy by knockdown of Beclin-1 partially caused a resistance to gossypol-induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M in BRAF-V600E cells with a concomitant decreased induction of apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that gossypol may exhibit potential for the treatment of BRAF inhibitor-resistant tumors, but a functional p21(Cip1) is a prerequisite for a positive response to its clinical application.

26563278	20151114	ADRA2A Germline Gene Polymorphism is Associated to the Severity, but not to the Risk, of Breast Cancer.	Breast cancer (BC) prognosis and risk were associated to obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Two Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) of the adrenergic receptor-2a gene (ADRA2A): rs1800544 and rs553668, have been associated to these metabolic disorders. We investigated these SNPs in BC risk and prognosis. A total of 102 BC patients and 102 healthy controls were included. The rs1800544 and rs553668 were determined by real-time PCR. Genotypes and haplotypes frequencies between patients and controls, and for different clinico-pathologic parameters were compared. We found a significant association of rs1800544 GG genotype with young age at diagnosis, premenopausal status, higher tumor size, metastasis in lymph nodes, advanced TNM stages and higher Nottingham Prognosis Indicator (NPI) (p &lt; 0.05). There was no association between rs1800544 and SBR stages, Her2, ER and PR statuses and the molecular classification. The rs553668 AA genotype was associated to young age at diagnosis and premenopausal status (p &lt; 0.05). The haplotype GA was associated to the early age of diagnosis (p = 0.03), and the haplotype GG to higher tumor size, lymph node involvement, advanced TNM stages and Her2 positive status (p &lt; 0.05). There was no polymorphism or haplotype association with BC risk (p &gt; 0.05). ADRA2A polymorphism is associated with indicators BC poor prognosis but not with BC susceptibility. This is the first report suggesting that ADRA2A germline gene polymorphism could represent a predictor factor for BC outcome. Further investigation of other ADRA2A polymorphisms in BC risk or prognosis are needed and may lead to a genotype-based therapy. 	Pathol._Oncol._Res.	D016428 D013485
20613954	20100709	Management of the adult with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.	Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), most commonly due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD), has been studied by pediatric endocrinologists for decades. Advances in the care of these patients have enabled many of these children to reach adulthood. In contrast to the course and management of the disease in childhood, little is known about CAH in adults. In many patients, the proclivity to salt-wasting crises decreases. Linear growth ceases, and reproductive function becomes an issue. Most importantly, management must minimize the potential for long-term consequences of conventional therapies. Here we review the existing literature regarding comorbidities of adults with 21OHD, goals of treatment, and approaches to therapy, with an emphasis on need for improved management strategies.

16711746	20060523	A quantum and deductive chemical study for all congeners of polybromo/chlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and polybromo/chlorodibenzofuran.	We have performed semiempirical quantum chemical calculations to obtain the optimized structure and the free energy (DeltaG) for all congeners (1701) of polybromo/chlorodibenzo-p-dioxins, which include all the isomers of all the homologues, and those for (3321) polybromo/chlorodibenzofurans. Then, to apply the &quot;Quantum and Deductive Chemistry Approach&quot; on the dioxin chemistry, we have carried out the multiple linear regression (MLR) as functions of temperature and the substituted numbers and positions of chlorine and bromine. The optimized structure of dibenzo-p-dioxin and the dibenzofuran ring is significantly influenced by the substitutions of the peri and lateral halogen atoms. The bond length between the aromatic ring and halogen atom also is influenced by the neighboring atoms. The bromine substitution at the 2 and 8 positions of dibenzofuran reduces the steric repulsion between the chlorine atoms at the 1 and 9 positions. The coefficients of the predicting equation of DeltaG derived by MLR suggest that the probabilities of chlorine elimination from the peri and lateral positions for polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxin are nearly equal.

21765365	20110719	Selection of HIV resistance associated with antiretroviral therapy initiated due to pregnancy and suspended postpartum.	Compare the risk of HIV drug resistance in women stopping suppressive nelfinavir (NFV)-based or Nevirapine (NVP)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) after pregnancy. Specimens collected after stopping ART were tested for drug resistance by an oligonucleotide ligation assay and consensus sequencing. When postpartum drug resistance was detected, specimens obtained at study entry and during ART were evaluated. Sixteen of 38 women with ART-induced suppression of viral replication suspended ART postpartum. Resistance mutations were detected in 75% who stopped NFV-ART and in 50% who stopped NVP-ART. M184V, associated with Lamivudine resistance, was more frequent among those randomized to NFV-ART compared with NVP-ART (6 of 8 versus 1 of 8; P = 0.04), and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance was detected in 4 of 8 stopping NVP-ART. HIV drug resistance was frequently observed among women who stopped suppressive NVP-ART or NFV-ART postpartum. This suggests that NFV-ART may have suboptimal potency, that staggering discontinuation of NVP-ART may be warranted, and/or ART adherence may be lax in women who choose to stop ART postpartum.

21080949	20101118	Common genetic variation in the Estrogen Receptor Beta (ESR2) gene and osteoarthritis: results of a meta-analysis.	The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between common genetic variation of the ESR2 gene and osteoarthritis. In the discovery study, the Rotterdam Study-I, 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped and tested for association with hip (284 cases, 2772 controls), knee (665 cases, 2075 controls), and hand OA (874 cases, 2184 controls) using an additive model. In the replication stage one SNP (rs1256031) was tested in an additional 2080 hip, 1318 knee and 557 hand OA cases and 4001, 2631 and 1699 controls respectively. Fixed- and random-effects meta-analyses were performed over the complete dataset including 2364 hip, 1983 knee and 1431 hand OA cases and approximately 6000 controls. The C allele of rs1256031 was associated with a 36% increased odds of hip OA in women of the Rotterdam Study-I (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.08-1.70, p = 0.009). Haplotype analysis and analysis of knee- and hand OA did not give additional information. With the replication studies, the meta-analysis did not show a significant effect of this SNP on hip OA in the total population (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.99-1.15, p = 0.10). Stratification according to gender did not change the results. In this study, we had 80% power to detect an odds ratio of at least 1.14 for hip OA (? = 0.05). This study showed that common genetic variation in the ESR2 gene is not likely to influence the risk of osteoarthritis with effects smaller than a 13% increase. 	BMC_Med._Genet.

27934832	20161210	In vitro</i>
sensitivity pattern of chloroquine and artemisinin in<i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>.	Artemisinin (ART) and its derivatives form the mainstay of antimalarial therapy. Emergence of resistance to them poses a potential threat to future malaria control and elimination on a global level. It is important to know the mechanism of action of drug and development of drug resistance. We put forwards probable correlation between the mode of action of chloroquine (CQ) and ART. Modified trophozoite maturation inhibition assay, WHO Mark III assay and molecular marker study for CQ resistance at K76T codon in Plasmodium falciparum CQ-resistant transporter gene were carried out on cultured P. falciparum. On comparing trophozoite and schizont growth for both CQ-sensitive (MRC-2) and CQ-resistant (RKL-9) culture isolates, it was observed that the clearance of trophozoites and schizonts was similar with both drugs. The experiment supports that CQ interferes with heme detoxification pathway in food vacuoles of parasite, and this may be correlated as one of the plausible mechanisms of ART.

18394967	20080409	Association of the interleukin (IL)-16 gene polymorphisms with Graves' disease.	Interleukin (IL)-16 was one of the cytokines with the function of T helper cell recruitment, whose expression in the thyrocyte and orbital fibroblast of Graves' disease (GD) patients was increased. Recently association of IL-16 gene polymorphisms with autoimmune diseases had been reported. However, there was little known about the impact of IL-16 gene polymorphisms on GD. In this study, we performed a case-control association study of three tagSNPs (rs4778889-rs1131445-rs4778641) within the IL-16 gene on 258 patients with GD and 208 healthy subjects in the Chinese population. Our data showed that common IL-16 variants were associated with GD (P=0.013-0.0186) and Graves' disease associated ophthalmopathy (GO) (P=0.0033-0.041). A novel protective haplotype containing the three tagSNPs (C-T-C) was observed in association with GO (P=0.013). In conclusion, IL-16 gene was significantly associated with susceptibility to Graves' disease and Graves' disease associated ophthalmopathy in the Chinese population. 	Clin._Immunol.	D016428 D013485
21424903	20110323	Oxidative stress and eNOS (Glu298Asp) gene polymorphism in preeclampsia in Indian population.	Oxidative stress causing widespread endothelial dysfunction has been proposed as a key factor involved in the development of preeclampsia (PE). With this background our objective was to study oxidative stress biomarkers like nitric oxide and malondialdehyde (MDA) and to correlate these markers with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (Glu298Asp) gene polymorphism. This cross-sectional study included 300 pregnant women diagnosed with PE and 200 women with normal pregnancy. Plasma NO and MDA levels were analyzed using student's t test and eNOS gene polymorphism was studied by performing polymerase chain reaction amplification and restriction length polymorphism and frequencies were distributed by using ?(2) analysis. The mean plasma levels of NO were significantly lower in study group while MDA levels were significantly higher in study group (P &lt; 0.001). Genotypic and allelic frequency of eNOS gene in both groups was found to be significant (P &lt; 0.05). The intergenotypic variation of NO and MDA levels was found to be significant (P &lt; 0.001). We concluded that the plasma levels of NO are decreased while MDA levels are increased in subjects with PE and that might contribute to the pathophysiology of PE. As observed in this study Glu298Asp eNOS gene polymorphism showed significant association with PE. 	Mol._Cell._Biochem.	D016428 D013485
20676401	20100803	Exposure to GSM RF fields does not affect calcium homeostasis in human endothelial cells, rat pheocromocytoma cells or rat hippocampal neurons.	In the course of modern daily life, individuals are exposed to numerous sources of electromagnetic radiation that are not present in the natural environment. The strength of the electromagnetic fields from sources such as hairdryers, computer display units and other electrical devices is modest. However, in many home and office environments, individuals can experience perpetual exposure to an &quot;electromagnetic smog&quot;, with occasional peaks of relatively high electromagnetic field intensity. This has led to concerns that such radiation can affect health. In particular, emissions from mobile phones or mobile phone masts have been invoked as a potential source of pathological electromagnetic radiation. Previous reports have suggested that cellular calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis is affected by the types of radiofrequency fields emitted by mobile phones. In the present study, we used a high-throughput imaging platform to monitor putative changes in cellular Ca2+ during exposure of cells to 900 MHz GSM fields of differing power (specific absorption rate 0.012-2 W/Kg), thus mimicking the type of radiation emitted by current mobile phone handsets. Data from cells experiencing the 900 Mhz GSM fields were compared with data obtained from paired experiments using continuous wave fields or no field. We employed three cell types (human endothelial cells, PC-12 neuroblastoma and primary hippocampal neurons) that have previously been suggested to be sensitive to radiofrequency fields. Experiments were designed to examine putative effects of radiofrequency fields on resting Ca2+, in addition to Ca2+ signals evoked by an InsP(3)-generating agonist. Furthermore, we examined putative effects of radiofrequency field exposure on Ca2+ store emptying and store-operated Ca2+ entry following application of the Ca2+ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin. Multiple parameters (e.g., peak amplitude, integrated Ca2+ signal, recovery rates) were analysed to explore potential impact of radiofrequency field exposure on Ca2+ signals. Our data indicate that 900 MHz GSM fields do not affect either basal Ca2+ homeostasis or provoked Ca2+ signals. Even at the highest field strengths applied, which exceed typical phone exposure levels, we did not observe any changes in cellular Ca2+ signals. We conclude that under the conditions employed in our experiments, and using a highly-sensitive assay, we could not detect any consequence of RF exposure. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
26592123	20151124	Benchmark Database for Ylidic Bond Dissociation Energies and Its Use for Assessments of Electronic Structure Methods.	We report a database of 18 ylidic bond dissociation energies obtained by using highly accurate quantum mechanical methods, and we use it to test approximate electronic structure methods. The new benchmark database is called YBDE18 and is used to test a large number of electronic structure methods, including eight wave function methods and 98 density functional exchange-correlation functionals. Among them, we include some very recent density functionals, including the SOGGA11 GGA functional, the SOGGA11-X hybrid GGA functional, the M11-L local meta-GGA functional, and the M11 range-separated hybrid meta-GGA functional. We also consider other functionals of these classes plus a local spin density approximation, global-hybrid meta-GGAs, range-separated hybrid GGAs, doubly hybrid GGAs, and doubly hybrid meta-GGAs. We found M05-2X-D3, MPWB1K-D3, M05-2X, LC-BLYP, PBE0-D3, and MC3MPWB to be the best DFT methods for this database. Although they do not place in the top four overall, our new-generation functionals show overall competitive performances; each of the new functionals provides the smallest mean signed error within its class, while in terms of mean unsigned errors, SOGGA11 is the best GGA, and SOGGA11-X and M11-L are among the first three best functionals in their categories, global-hybrid GGA and local meta-GGA. The best local functionals are VSXC and M06-L, the best global-hybrids are M05-2X, M08-HX, M06-2X, and MPWB1K, and the best range-separated hybrids are LC-BLYP, ?B97, ?B97X, and M11.

24100764	20131009	Use of short tandem repeat fingerprinting to validate sample origins in hepatitis C virus molecular epidemiology studies.	Sequence analysis is used to define the molecular epidemiology and evolution of the hepatitis C virus. Whilst most studies have shown that individual patients harbour viruses that are derived from a limited number of highly related strains, some recent reports have shown that some patients can be co-infected with very distinct variants whose frequency can fluctuate greatly. Whilst co-infection with highly divergent strains is possible, an alternative explanation is that such data represent contamination or sample mix-up. In this study, we have shown that DNA fingerprinting techniques can accurately assess sample provenance and differentiate between samples that are truly exhibiting mixed infection from those that harbour distinct virus populations due to sample mix-up. We have argued that this approach should be adopted routinely in virus sequence analyses to validate sample provenance. 	J._Gen._Virol.	D023362 D016428 D013485
25502654	20141216	Crystal structure of calcium binding protein-5 from Entamoeba histolytica and its involvement in initiation of phagocytosis of human erythrocytes.	Entamoeba histolytica is the etiological agent of human amoebic colitis and liver abscess, and causes a high level of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in developing countries. There are a number of studies that have shown a crucial role for Ca2+ and its binding protein in amoebic biology. EhCaBP5 is one of the EF hand calcium-binding proteins of E. histolytica. We have determined the crystal structure of EhCaBP5 at 1.9 ? resolution in the Ca2+-bound state, which shows an unconventional mode of Ca2+ binding involving coordination to a closed yet canonical EF-hand motif. Structurally, EhCaBP5 is more similar to the essential light chain of myosin than to Calmodulin despite its somewhat greater sequence identity with Calmodulin. This structure-based analysis suggests that EhCaBP5 could be a light chain of myosin. Surface plasmon resonance studies confirmed this hypothesis, and in particular showed that EhCaBP5 interacts with the IQ motif of myosin 1B in calcium independent manner. It also appears from modelling of the EhCaBP5-IQ motif complex that EhCaBP5 undergoes a structural change in order to bind the IQ motif of myosin. This specific interaction was further confirmed by the observation that EhCaBP5 and myosin 1B are colocalized in E. histolytica during phagocytic cup formation. Immunoprecipitation of EhCaBP5 from total E. histolytica cellular extract also pulls out myosin 1B and this interaction was confirmed to be Ca2+ independent. Confocal imaging of E. histolytica showed that EhCaBP5 and myosin 1B are part of phagosomes. Overexpression of EhCaBP5 increases slight rate (?20%) of phagosome formation, while suppression reduces the rate drastically (?55%). Taken together, these experiments indicate that EhCaBP5 is likely to be the light chain of myosin 1B. Interestingly, EhCaBP5 is not present in the phagosome after its formation suggesting EhCaBP5 may be playing a regulatory role. 	PLoS_Pathog.	D016428 D013485
15975957	20050625	Association of death receptor 4 haplotype 626C-683C with an increased breast cancer risk.	Dysregulation of apoptosis plays a crucial role in carcinogenesis. Tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand stimulates the extrinsic apoptotic pathway by binding to death receptor 4 (DR4). Thus, genetic alterations within the candidate tumour suppressor gene DR4 would be expected to provoke a deficient apoptotic signalling thereby facilitating the development of cancer. The DR4 variants Thr209Arg and Glu228Ala were genotyped in a series of 521 breast cancer cases and 1100 control subjects from Germany, determining their impact on breast cancer risk. Neither Thr209Arg (626C&gt;G) nor Glu228Ala (683A&gt;C) alone were significantly associated with breast cancer risk [odds ratio (OR) = 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.65-1.08, P = 0.18 and OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.72-1.12, P = 0.30]. However, haplotype analysis revealed a 3.5-fold risk for carriers of the 626C-683C haplotype (OR = 3.52, 95% CI = 1.45-8.52, P = 0.003). 	Carcinogenesis	D003160 D016428 D013485

19294531	20090319	Strategies for blocking the fibrogenic actions of connective tissue growth factor (CCN2): From pharmacological inhibition in vitro to targeted siRNA therapy in vivo.	Connective tissue growth factor (CCN2) is a major pro-fibrotic factor that frequently acts downstream of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)-mediated fibrogenic pathways. Much of our knowledge of CCN2 in fibrosis has come from studies in which its production or activity have been experimentally attenuated. These studies, performed both in vitro and in animal models, have demonstrated the utility of pharmacological inhibitors (e.g. tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), prostaglandins, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonists, statins, kinase inhibitors), neutralizing antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides, or small interfering RNA (siRNA) to probe the role of CCN2 in fibrogenic pathways. These investigations have allowed the mechanisms regulating CCN2 production to be more clearly defined, have shown that CCN2 is a rational anti-fibrotic target, and have established a framework for developing effective modalities of therapeutic intervention in vivo.

27144281	20160505	MAP3K19 Is a Novel Regulator of TGF-? Signaling That Impacts Bleomycin-Induced Lung Injury and Pulmonary Fibrosis.	Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, debilitating disease for which two medications, pirfenidone and nintedanib, have only recently been approved for treatment. The cytokine TGF-? has been shown to be a central mediator in the disease process. We investigated the role of a novel kinase, MAP3K19, upregulated in IPF tissue, in TGF-?-induced signal transduction and in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. MAP3K19 has a very limited tissue expression, restricted primarily to the lungs and trachea. In pulmonary tissue, expression was predominantly localized to alveolar and interstitial macrophages, bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes of the epithelium. MAP3K19 was also found to be overexpressed in bronchoalveolar lavage macrophages from IPF patients compared to normal patients. Treatment of A549 or THP-1 cells with either MAP3K19 siRNA or a highly potent and specific inhibitor reduced phospho-Smad2 &amp; 3 nuclear translocation following TGF-? stimulation. TGF-?-induced gene transcription was also strongly inhibited by both the MAP3K19 inhibitor and nintedanib, whereas pirfenidone had a much less pronounced effect. In combination, the MAP3K19 inhibitor appeared to act synergistically with either pirfenidone or nintedanib, at the level of target gene transcription or protein production. Finally, in an animal model of IPF, inhibition of MAP3K19 strongly attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis when administered either prophylactically ortherapeutically. In summary, these results strongly suggest that inhibition of MAP3K19 may have a beneficial therapeutic effect in the treatment of IPF and represents a novel strategy to target this disease.

26682887	20151220	A Modified Murine Embryonic Stem Cell Test for Evaluating the Teratogenic Effects of Drugs on Early Embryogenesis.	Mammalian fetal development is easily disrupted by exogenous agents, making it essential to test new drug candidates for embryotoxicity and teratogenicity. To standardize the testing of drugs that might be used to treat pregnant women, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) formulated special grade categories, labeled A, B, C, D and X, that define the level of risk associated with the use of a specific drug during pregnancy. Drugs in categories (Cat.) D and X are those with embryotoxic and/or teratogenic effects on humans and animals. However, which stages of pregnancy are affected by these agents and their molecular mechanisms are unknown. We describe here an embryonic stem cell test (EST) that classifies FDA pregnancy Cat.D and Cat.X drugs into 4 classes based on their differing effects on primitive streak formation. We show that ~84% of Cat.D and Cat.X drugs target this period of embryogenesis. Our results demonstrate that our modified EST can identify how a drug affects early embryogenesis, when it acts, and its molecular mechanism. Our test may thus be a useful addition to the drug safety testing armamentarium. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
21686713	20110621	G2019S LRRK2 mutation causing Parkinson's disease without Lewy bodies.	The G2019S leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) mutation has been identified in a significant proportion of familial and sporadic cases of Parkinson's disease (PD). Until now, information on the neuropathological changes associated with the G2019S LRRK2 mutation has been sparse. We report a 77-year-old patient who presented with a 14 year history of PD but, unexpectedly, histopathological examination disclosed mild neuronal loss in the substantia nigra without ?-synuclein, tau or ubiquitin cytoplasmic inclusions. A G2019S LRRK2 mutation was eventually detected. The present case confirms that clinical PD caused by G2019S mutations can be associated with non-specific nigral degeneration without Lewy.

12771212	20030529	The role of intercalating residues in chromosomal high-mobility-group protein DNA binding, bending and specificity.	Ubiquitous high-mobility-group (HMGB) chromosomal proteins bind DNA in a non-sequence- specific fashion to promote chromatin function and gene regulation. Minor groove DNA binding of the HMG domain induces substantial DNA bending toward the major groove, and several interfacial residues contribute by DNA intercalation. The role of the intercalating residues in DNA binding, bending and specificity was systematically examined for a series of mutant Drosophila HMGB (HMG-D) proteins. The primary intercalating residue of HMG-D, Met13, is required both for high-affinity DNA binding and normal DNA bending. Leu9 and Tyr12 directly interact with Met13 and are required for HMG domain stability in addition to linear DNA binding and bending, which is an important function for these residues. In contrast, DNA binding and bending is retained in truncations of intercalating residues Val32 and Thr33 to alanine, but DNA bending is decreased for the glycine substitutions. Furthermore, substitution of the intercalating residues with those predicted to be involved in the specificity of the HMG domain transcription factors results in increased DNA affinity and decreased DNA bending without increased specificity. These studies reveal the importance of residues that buttress intercalating residues and suggest that features of the HMG domain other than a few base-specific hydrogen bonds distinguish the sequence-specific and non-sequence-specific HMG domain functions.

25261570	20140928	Factors determining penetrance in familial atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome.	Inherited abnormalities of complement are found in ?60% of patients with atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS). Such abnormalities are not fully penetrant. In this study, we have estimated the penetrance of the disease in three families with a CFH mutation (c.3643C&gt;G; p. Arg1215Gly) in whom a common lineage is probable. 25 individuals have been affected with aHUS with three peaks of incidence-early childhood (n=6), early adulthood (n=11) and late adulthood (n=8). Eighteen individuals who have not developed aHUS carry the mutation. We estimated penetrance at the ages of 4, 27, 60 and 70 years as both a binary and a survival trait using MLINK and Mendel. We genotyped susceptibility factors in CFH, CD46 and CFHR1 in affected and unaffected carriers. We found that the estimates of penetrance at the age of 4?years ranged from &lt;0.01 to 0.10, at the age of 27?years from 0.16 to 0.29, at the age of 60 years from 0.39 to 0.51 and at the age of 70 years from 0.44 to 0.64. We found that the CFH haplotype on the allele not carrying the CFH mutation had a significant effect on disease penetrance. In this family, we did not find that the CD46 haplotypes had a significant effect on penetrance. 	J._Med._Genet.	D016428 D013485
25835743	20150404	Nxf1 natural variant E610G is a semi-dominant suppressor of IAP-induced RNA processing defects.	Endogenous retroviruses and retrotransposons contribute functional genetic variation in animal genomes. In mice, Intracisternal A Particles (IAPs) are a frequent source of both new mutations and polymorphism across laboratory strains. Intronic IAPs can induce alternative RNA processing choices, including alternative splicing. We previously showed IAP I?1 subfamily insertional mutations are suppressed by a wild-derived allele of the major mRNA export factor, Nxf1. Here we show that a wider diversity of IAP insertions present in the mouse reference sequence induce insertion-dependent alternative processing that is suppressed by Nxf1CAST alleles. These insertions typically show more modest gene expression changes than de novo mutations, suggesting selection or attenuation. Genome-wide splicing-sensitive microarrays and gene-focused assays confirm specificity of Nxf1 genetic modifier activity for IAP insertion alleles. Strikingly, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing demonstrates that a single amino acid substitution in Nxf1, E610G, is sufficient to recreate a quantitative genetic modifier in a co-isogenic background.

23776693	20130619	Variables involved in the discordance between HbA1c and fructosamine: the glycation gap revisited.	Glycation gap (GG) is defined as the difference between the measured level of HbA1c and the level that would be predicted from its regression on the fructosamine level. The aims of the study were: 1) To determine the reproducibility and consistency of GC; 2) To discover factors related to GG value. Given that metformin might increase glucose transport through the erythrocyte membrane, this treatment was also considered in the analyses of the results. GG was calculated in two blood samples separated 30.6 (SD 7.3) weeks, obtained in 508 type 2 diabetic patients. The following variables were considered: HbA1c, fructosamine, glucose, creatinine, hematological parameters and treatment with metformin. Multivariate and logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the variables independently related to CG. GG was reproducible and consistent over time. Creatinine, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and glycemia (inverse relationship); and HbA1c and treatment with metformin (direct relationship) were independently related to GG. Patients treated with metformin showed higher HbA1c values, despite similar fructosamine concentrations, than patients not treated with the drug. GG is independently related to serum levels of creatinine, MCHC and treatment with metformin. The spurious effect of metformin on Hb glycation could have serious clinical implications and should be considered when interpreting the results of clinical trials. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428
17827286	20070911	Pseudomonas syringae lytic transglycosylases coregulated with the type III secretion system contribute to the translocation of effector proteins into plant cells.	Pseudomonas syringae translocates virulence effector proteins into plant cells via a type III secretion system (T3SS) encoded by hrp (for hypersensitive response and pathogenicity) genes. Three genes coregulated with the Hrp T3SS system in P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 have predicted lytic transglycosylase domains: PSPTO1378 (here designated hrpH), PSPTO2678 (hopP1), and PSPTO852 (hopAJ1). hrpH is located between hrpR and avrE1 in the Hrp pathogenicity island and is carried in the functional cluster of P. syringae pv. syringae 61 hrp genes cloned in cosmid pHIR11. Strong expression of DC3000 hrpH in Escherichia coli inhibits bacterial growth unless the predicted catalytic glutamate at position 148 is mutated. Translocation tests involving C-terminal fusions with a Cya (Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase) reporter indicate that HrpH and HopP1, but not HopAJ1, are T3SS substrates. Pseudomonas fluorescens carrying a pHIR11 derivative lacking hrpH is poorly able to translocate effector HopA1, and this deficiency can be restored by HopP1 and HopAJ1, but not by HrpH(E148A) or HrpH(1-241). DC3000 mutants lacking hrpH or hrpH, hopP1, and hopAJ1 combined are variously reduced in effector translocation, elicitation of the hypersensitive response, and virulence. However, the mutants are not reduced in secretion of T3SS substrates in culture. When produced in wild-type DC3000, the HrpH(E148A) and HrpH(1-241) variants have a dominant-negative effect on the ability of DC3000 to elicit the hypersensitive response in nonhost tobacco and to grow and cause disease in host tomato. The three Hrp-associated lytic transglycosylases in DC3000 appear to have overlapping functions in contributing to T3SS functions during infection. 	J._Bacteriol.	D016428 D013486
22451790	20120328	Katatopygia gen. n., a monophyletic branch segregated from Boletina (Diptera, Mycetophilidae).	The genus Katatopygiagen. n. is proposed for the Boletina erythropyga/punctus-group that was first introduced by Garrett (1924, 1925) and currently comprises eight described species. Molecular studies have strongly indicated that this group forms a monophyletic sister-group to a clade consisting of all other Boletina, Coelosia and Gnoriste, and its monophyly is supported by morphological data as well. The new genus includes the following species: Katatopygia antoma (Garrett, 1924), comb. n., Katatopygia antica (Garrett, 1924), comb. n., Katatopygia erythropyga (Holmgren, 1883), comb. n.,Katatopygia hissarica (Zaitzev &amp; Polevoi, 2002), comb. n., Katatopygia magna (Garrett, 1925), comb. n., Katatopygia laticauda (Saigusa, 1968), comb. n., Katatopygia neoerythropyga (Zaitzev &amp; Polevoi, 2002), comb. n. andKatatopygia sahlbergi (Lundstr?m, 1906), comb. n., all transferred from Boletina. Katatopygia sahlbergi is found to be a senior synonym of Boletina punctus Garrett, 1925, syn. n. A phylogeny based on morphological data and using parsimony analysis yielded four most parsimonious trees where the new genus is retrieved as monophyletic with high support. Katatopygia neoerythropyga is found to be the sister-taxon to all other species that form two clades, one with Katatopygia sahlbergi-like species and one with Katatopygia erythropyga-like species. A key to males of Katatopygia is provided. 	Zookeys	D016428
22201619	20111229	FOXP3 and TGF-? gene polymorphisms in allergic rhinitis.	Regulatory CD4+ T (Treg) cells are effective in maintaining immune tolerance. To investigate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Transforming Growth Factor ?-1 (TGF-?1) and Forkhead Box Protein 3 (FOXP3) genes in Iranian patients with allergic rhinitis (AR). Variations at codons 10 and 25 of TGF-?1 and FOXP3 at positions -3279 A&gt;C and -924 A&gt;G were evaluated in AR patients and compared with controls. In a case-control study, 155 AR patients and 163 allergy-free controls were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primer (PCR-SSP) technique. The analysis of the frequency of these SNPs showed that the haplotype formed by FOXP3 -3279 A allele occurred significantly more frequently in patients than controls (odds ratio=1.44, 95% CI=1.312-2.66; p=0.001). Our results suggest that polymorphism in FOXP3 gene is associated with susceptibility to AR. 	Iran_J_Immunol	D016428 D013485
22677033	20120609	Compromised function in the Na(v)1.2 Dravet syndrome mutation R1312T.	Ion channels, specifically voltage-gated sodium channels (Na(v)s), are common culprits in inheritable seizure disorders. Some Na(v) isoforms are particularly susceptible, while others are only weakly associated with neuronal hyperexcitability. Representative of the latter group is Na(v)1.2 (gene name SCN2A): despite its abundance in the brain, Na(v)1.2-related epilepsy is rare and only few studies have been conducted as to the pathophysiological basis of Na(v)1.2 in neuronal hyperexcitability. We here present a detailed functional analysis of Na(v)1.2 mutant, R1312T, which was originally found in a child with Dravet syndrome (formerly known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy or SMEI). Whole-cell voltage clamp analysis revealed clearly compromised function: the mutant channels fast- and slow-inactivated at markedly more negative potentials and recovered from fast inactivation more slowly, which resulted in a use-dependent current reduction to less than 50% of wildtype levels. We also noted a small hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation. Our findings expand the spectrum of abnormal Na(v) channel behavior in epilepsy and raise the question as to how loss-of-function in a sodium channel predominantly expressed in excitatory neurons can lead to hyperexcitability.

26617177	20151201	CCR6(+) Th cell populations distinguish ACPA positive from ACPA negative rheumatoid arthritis.	Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can be separated into two major subpopulations based on the absence or presence of serum anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs). The more severe disease course in ACPA(+) RA and differences in treatment outcome between these subpopulations suggest that ACPA(+) and ACPA(-) RA are different disease subsets. The identification of T-helper (Th) cells specifically recognizing citrullinated peptides, combined with the strong association between HLA-DRB1 and ACPA positivity, point toward a pathogenic role of Th cells in ACPA(+) RA. In this context we recently identified a potential pathogenic role for CCR6(+) Th cells in RA. Therefore, we examined whether Th cell population distributions differ by ACPA status. We performed a nested matched case-control study including 27 ACPA(+) and 27 ACPA(-) treatment-naive early RA patients matched for disease activity score in 44 joints, presence of rheumatoid factor, sex, age, duration of complaints and presence of erosions. CD4(+)CD45RO(+) (memory) Th cell distribution profiles from these patients were generated based on differential chemokine receptor expression and related with disease duration. ACPA status was not related to differences in total CD4(+) T cell or memory Th cell proportions. However, ACPA(+) patients had significantly higher proportions of Th cells expressing the chemokine receptors CCR6 and CXCR3. Similar proportions of CCR4(+) and CCR10(+) Th cells were found. Within the CCR6(+) cell population, four Th subpopulations were distinguished based on differential chemokine receptor expression: Th17 (CCR4(+)CCR10(-)), Th17.1 (CXCR3(+)), Th22 (CCR4(+)CCR10(+)) and CCR4/CXCR3 double-positive (DP) cells. In particular, higher proportions of Th22 (p = 0.02), Th17.1 (p = 0.03) and CCR4/CXCR3 DP (p = 0.01) cells were present in ACPA(+) patients. In contrast, ACPA status was not associated with differences in Th1 (CCR6(-)CXCR3(+); p = 0.90), Th2 (CCR6(-)CCR4(+); p = 0.27) and T-regulatory (CD25(hi)FOXP3(+); p = 0.06) cell proportions. Interestingly, CCR6(+) Th cells were inversely correlated with disease duration in ACPA(-) patients (R(2)?=?-0.35; p &lt; 0.01) but not in ACPA(+) (R(2)?&lt; 0.01; p = 0.94) patients. These findings demonstrate that increased peripheral blood CCR6(+) Th cells proportions distinguish ACPA(+) RA from ACPA(-) RA. This suggests that CCR6(+) Th cells are involved in the differences in disease severity and treatment outcome between ACPA(+) and ACPA(-) RA. 	Arthritis_Res._Ther.	D016428
21698367	20110624	Effect of LEPR Gln223Arg polymorphism on breast cancer risk in different ethnic populations: a meta-analysis.	Leptin and leptin receptor have been implicated in processes leading to breast cancer initiation and progression. An A to G transition mutation in codon 223, in exon 6 of the leptin receptor gene (LEPR) can result in glutamine to arginine substitution (Gln223Arg). A variety of case-control studies have been published evaluating the association between LEPR Gln223Arg polymorphism and breast cancer. However, published studies have yielded contradictory conclusions. This meta-analysis enrolled eight studies to estimate the overall risk of LEPR Gln223Arg polymorphism associated with breast cancer. The pooled ORs were performed for codominant model (Arg/Arg versus Gln/Gln; Arg/Gln versus Gln/Gln), dominant model (Arg/Arg + Arg/Gln versus Gln/Gln), recessive model (Arg/Arg versus Arg/Gln + Gln/Gln). Overall significantly elevated breast cancer risk was found for recessive model (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.03-1.69) and for genotype Arg/Gln versus Gln/Gln (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.34). In the stratified analysis by ethnicity, significantly increased risks were also found among Africans for genotype Arg/Arg versus Gln/Gln: OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.28-2.71, Arg/Gln versus Gln/Gln: OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.10-1.99, dominant model: OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.21-2.11 and recessive model: OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.07-2.05; for Asians, Arg/Arg versus Gln/Gln: OR 6.79, 95% CI 3.42-13.47 and dominant model: OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.42-2.90. However, no significantly increased risk was found among Europeans for all genetic models. In conclusion, the LEPR 223Arg is a low-penetrant risk for developing breast cancer, especially for black African women. 	Mol._Biol._Rep.	D016428 D017418 D013485
25101996	20140808	The cohesin subunit Rad21 is required for synaptonemal complex maintenance, but not sister chromatid cohesion, during Drosophila female meiosis.	Replicated sister chromatids are held in close association from the time of their synthesis until their separation during the next mitosis. This association is mediated by the ring-shaped cohesin complex that appears to embrace the sister chromatids. Upon proteolytic cleavage of the ?-kleisin cohesin subunit at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition by separase, sister chromatids are separated and segregated onto the daughter nuclei. The more complex segregation of chromosomes during meiosis is thought to depend on the replacement of the mitotic ?-kleisin cohesin subunit Rad21/Scc1/Mcd1 by the meiotic paralog Rec8. In Drosophila, however, no clear Rec8 homolog has been identified so far. Therefore, we have analyzed the role of the mitotic Drosophila ?-kleisin Rad21 during female meiosis. Inactivation of an engineered Rad21 variant by premature, ectopic cleavage during oogenesis results not only in loss of cohesin from meiotic chromatin, but also in precocious disassembly of the synaptonemal complex (SC). We demonstrate that the lateral SC component C(2)M can interact directly with Rad21, potentially explaining why Rad21 is required for SC maintenance. Intriguingly, the experimentally induced premature Rad21 elimination, as well as the expression of a Rad21 variant with destroyed separase consensus cleavage sites, do not interfere with chromosome segregation during meiosis, while successful mitotic divisions are completely prevented. Thus, chromatid cohesion during female meiosis does not depend on Rad21-containing cohesin. 	PLoS_Genet.	D016428 D013485
19604081	20090717	Relevance of CYP2D6 -1584C&gt;G polymorphism for thioridazine:mesoridazine plasma concentration ratio in psychiatric patients.	The CYP2D6 -1584C&gt;G (rs1080985) polymorphism has been identified as another major factor for CYP2D6 function that is possibly associated with ultrarapid metabolism. The mutant -1584G promoter genotype seems to be consistently related to a higher protein expression than -1584C. However, the impact this SNP in the CYP2D6 promoter region has on plasma levels of patients taking CYP2D6 substrates, such as thioridazine, has not been studied. Previously, we showed the validity of the mesoridazine:thioridazine ratio to assess CYP2D6 activity in clinical settings. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between the presence of the CYP2D6 -1584C&gt;G polymorphism and the plasma concentrations of thioridazine and its metabolites in a previously studied population of patients in order to evaluate the implications for CYP2D6 hydroxylation capacity. The CYP2D6 -1584C&gt;G polymorphism was determined by using a PCR-RFLP method in 61 Caucasian psychiatric patients receiving thioridazine monotherapy. Among patients with two active CYP2D6 genes, there were significant differences in the thioridazine:mesoridazine plasma concentrations ratio (p &lt; 0.05) among the three CYP2D6 -1584C&gt;G genotype groups. Moreover, in this group of patients the thioridazine:mesoridazine ratio was lower (p &lt; 0.05) in carriers of CYP2D6 -1584G allele than in patients homozygous for CYP2D6 -1584C allele. However, no differences in thioridazine or its metabolite concentrations between homozygous CYP2D6 -1584C allele carriers and carriers of the -1584G allele were found. According to the present results the concentration ratio of thioridazine to mesoridazine was related to the CYP2D6 -1584C&gt;G polymorphism. It is likely that individuals who carry CYP2D6 -1584G versus homozygotes for the -1584C allele may present an increased CYP2D6 activity. 	Pharmacogenomics	D003160 D016428 D013485
11072248	20001110	Genetic analysis of a breast-ovarian cancer family, with 7 cases of colorectal cancer linked to BRCA1, fails to support a role for BRCA1 in colorectal tumorigenesis.	Mutations in the BRCA1 gene cause strongly elevated risks of breast and ovarian cancers but may also confer a 3-fold increased risk for colorectal cancer. To address the relationship between BRCA1 carriership and colorectal tumorigenesis, we studied the genetics of a breast-ovarian cancer family with 7 cases of colorectal cancer. A germline 3938insG mutation in BRCA1 was found in 5 breast-cancer patients, 1 with ductal carcinoma in situ, ovarian cancer and an adenoma of the colon, and in 4/5 colorectal-cancer patients investigated. However, the youngest patient, diagnosed at age 23, was a non-carrier. Loss of the wild-type BRCA1 allele was observed in 3/3 breast tissues (2 breast carcinomas and 1 ductal carcinoma in situ) but in 0/6 colorectal tissues (5 carcinomas and 1 adenoma), suggesting that BRCA1 loss is not critical for colorectal tumorigenesis. To examine the possibility that an as yet unknown gene linked to BRCA1 was involved in the colorectal cancers, chromosome 17 segregation was studied with 7 polymorphic markers encompassing a 20 cM region including BRCA1. None of these markers showed complete allele sharing among all 5 colorectal-cancer patients studied. Clinical history, mutation analysis and microsatellite instability analysis excluded a role for any of the known colorectal-cancer susceptibility genes. In 4 other Dutch families carrying the same BRCA1 mutation, only 1 colorectal-cancer case was reported, of which the carrier status is unknown. 	Int._J._Cancer	D016428 D013485
16437556	20060127	Effect of a mutation on the structure and dynamics of an alpha-helical antifreeze protein in water and ice.	One strategy of psychrophilic organisms to survive subzero temperature is to produce antifreeze protein (AFPs), which inhibit the growth of macromolecular ice. To better understand the binding mechanism, the structure and dynamics of several AFPs have been studied by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray crystallography. The results have shown that different organisms can use diverse structures (alpha-helix, beta-helix, or different globular folds) to achieve the same function. A number of studies have focused on understanding the relationship between the alpha-helical structure of fish type I AFP and its function as an inhibitor of ice growth. The results have not explained whether the 90% activity loss caused by the conservative mutation of two threonines to serines (Thr13Ser/Thr24Ser) is attributable to a change in protein structure in solution or in ice. We examine here the structure and dynamics of the winter flounder type I AFP and the mutant Thr13Ser/Thr24Ser in both solution and solid states using a wide range of NMR approaches. Both proteins remain fully alpha-helical at all temperatures and in ice, demonstrating that the activity change must therefore not be attributable to changes in the protein fold or dynamics but differences in surface properties.

25871372	20150415	Quercitrin, an inhibitor of Sortase A, interferes with the adhesion of Staphylococcal aureus.	Sortase A (SrtA) is a cysteine transpeptidase of most Gram-positive bacteria that is responsible for the anchorage of many surface protein virulence factors to the cell wall layer. SrtA mutants are unable to display surface proteins and are defective in the establishment of infections without affecting microbial viability. In this study, we report that quercitrin (QEN), a natural compound that does not affect Staphylococcus aureus growth, can inhibit the catalytic activity of SrtA in fibrinogen (Fg) cell-clumping and immobilized fibronectin (Fn) adhesion assays. Molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis assays suggest that QEN binds to the binding sites of the SrtA G167A and V193A mutants. These findings indicate that QEN is a potential lead compound for the development of new anti-virulence agents against S. aureus infections. 	Molecules	D016428 D013485
7378467	19800529	Hemoglobin Tampa:beta 79 (EF3) aspartic acid replaced by tyrosine.	Hemoglobin Tampa was detected in a 6-year-old male caucasian who is homozygous for this variant hemoglobin. The variant hemoglobin has an electrophoretic mobility between Hb F and Hb S on cellulose acetate (pH 8.5) and a mobility between Hb S and Hb C on citrate agar (pH 6.0). In acid buffer globin chain analysis revealed an abnormal beta chain with a mobility between the beta A and beta S chains, and in alkaline buffer the mobility of the chain was at the beta S position. Structural characterization of the variant beta chain indicates that aspartic acid is replaced with tyrosine at position 79, the site of a previously reported mutation, Asp replaced by Gly (Hb Hsi-Tsou). The clinical histories of the available family members including the homozygous propositus appear to be unremarkable. 	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428
21581975	20110518	N-(Diphenyl-carbamothio-yl)-3-methyl-benzamide.	The synthesis of the title compound, C(21)H(18)N(2)OS, involves the reaction of 3-methyl-benzoyl chloride with potassium thio-cyanate in dry acetone followed by condensation of the 3-methyl-benzoyl isothio-cyanate with diphenyl-amine. The carbonyl [C-O = 1.215?(2)??] and thio-carbonyl [C-S = 1.6721?(17)??] distances indicate that these correspond to double bonds. The short C-N bonds at the center of the mol-ecule reveal the effects of resonance in this part of the mol-ecule. The conformation of the mol-ecule with respect to the thio-carbonyl and carbonyl groups is twisted. The 3-methyl-phenyl and two phenyl rings are also twisted, with dihedral angles of 75.67?(9) and 14.91?(9)?. The phenyl rings are rotated out of the mean plane of the N-C-S-N atoms by 66.87?(8) and 78.40?(9)?. Pairs of mol-ecules are linked into centrosymmetric dimers via inter-molecular N-H?S inter-actions and a C-H?O link also occurs. The dimers are stacked along the a axis.

19665683	20090812	Molecular diagnostics in hemostatic disorders.	The use of molecular diagnostic techniques in clinical and research hemostasis laboratories is increasing as genetic factors that affect the procoagulant and anticoagulant systems are identified. Many of these molecular alterations are associated with thrombotic tendencies, whereas others tip the hemostatic balance in favor of bleeding. In either scenario, molecular testing may serve as a primary diagnostic modality or may provide information that complements clot-based &quot;functional&quot; assays. The clinical application of DNA-based testing continues to expand since the discoveries of the factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A gene mutations. Indications for genetic testing continue to evolve as the underlying causes of hemostatic disorders are better understood. Further development of molecular assays depends on their proved utility in the clinical management and treatment of these complex multifactorial disorders. 	Clin._Lab._Med.	D016428 D016454
17918838	20071009	Spectroscopic and kinetic studies of perturbed trinuclear copper clusters: the role of protons in reductive cleavage of the O-O bond in the multicopper oxidase Fet3p.	The multicopper oxidase Fet3p couples four 1e(-) oxidations of substrate to the 4e(-) reduction of O2 to H2O. Fet3p uses four Cu atoms to accomplish this reaction: the type 1, type 2, and coupled binuclear type 3 sites. The type 2 and type 3 sites together form a trinuclear Cu cluster (TNC) which is the site of O2 reduction. This study focuses on mutants of two residues, E487 and D94, which lie in the second coordination sphere of the TNC and defines the role that each plays in the structural integrity of the TNC, its reactivity with O2, and in the directional movement of protons during reductive cleavage of the O-O bond. The E487D, E487A, and D94E mutants have been studied in the holo and type 1 depleted (T1D) forms. Residue E487, located near the T3 center, is found to be responsible for donation of a proton during the reductive cleavage of the O-O bond in the peroxide intermediate and an inverse kinetic solvent isotope effect, which indicates that this proton is already transferred when the O-O bond is cleaved. Residue D94, near the T2 site, plays a key role in the reaction of the reduced TNC with O2 and drives electron transfer from the T2 Cu to cleave the O-O bond by deprotonating the T2 Cu water ligand. A mechanism is developed where these second sphere residues participate in the proton assisted reductive cleavage of the O-O bond at the TNC. 	J._Am._Chem._Soc.	D016428 D052061 D013486
26662429	20151215	Tumor necrosis factor-? and interleukin-6 gene polymorphism association with susceptibility to celiac disease in Italian patients.	The aim of this research was to study polymorphisms in the genes encoding cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-?) in patients with celiac disease (CD) antigens DQ2 (DQ2-positive) or DQ8 (DQ8-positive). We compared the results with healthy controls to determine whether any of the polymorphisms have a role in susceptibility to CD. A case-control of 192 patients with CD (96 DQ2-positive and 96 DQ8-positive) and 96 healthy controls from northeast Italy were included in the study. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was carried out using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Significant differences for the TNF-?(-308 G&gt;A) polymorphism were observed when we compared the flowing groups: DQ2-positive with controls [odds ratio (OR) = 0.45, P = 0.0002]; DQ8-positive with controls (OR = 3.55, P &lt; 0.0001); and DQ2-positive with DQ8-positive (OR = 0.12, P &lt; 0.0001). We did not observe a statistically significant association between IL-6 (-174 G&gt;C) polymorphism and CD (P &gt; 0.05). Our results suggest that TNF-?(-308 G&gt;A) polymorphism may play a role in susceptibility to CD in Italian patients. 	Genet._Mol._Res.	D016428 D013485
12714082	20030426	Solvent influence on excited-state intramolecular proton transfer in 3-hydroxychromone derivatives studied by cryogenic high-resolution fluorescence spectroscopy.	High-resolution Shpol'skii spectra (recorded at 10 K in n-octane) of 3-hydroxychromone (3HC) substituted at the 2-position with a furan (3HC-F), a benzofuran (3HC-BF) or a naphthofuran group (3HC-NF) are presented. Being close analogues of 3-hydroxyflavone (3HF), these compounds can undergo excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). Luminescence can occur from the normal N* state (blue) or from the tautomeric T* state (green). Whether blue or green emission is observed is strongly dependent on hydrogen-bonding interactions with the environment. For all three chromones studied, high-resolution emission spectra in the green region (T*--&gt;T) were obtained in pure n-octane, showing four sites with distinct emission bands and detailed vibrational structures, whereas no blue emission was detected. Contrary to the spectra published for 3HF, the emission lines were very narrow (line-broadening effects beyond detection) which implies that the ESIPT rate constants are &gt;10(12) s(-1), at least 25 times lower than for 3HF. In order to study the effects of hydrogen-bonding solvents, four isomers of octanol (1-, 2-, 3- and 4-octanol) were added, forming 1:1 complexes with the 3HC derivatives. For all the combinations considered both blue and additional green emission was observed and in some cases narrow-banded spectra were obtained, mostly in the green. Only for the 3HC-NF/2-octanol complex, narrow-banded emission was found both in the blue and in the green region. It is demonstrated that these emissions come from different configurations of the complex. Possible structures for the two complex species are proposed, supported by semi-empirical calculations on complex formation enthalpies. 	Spectrochim_Acta_A_Mol_Biomol_Spectrosc	D016428
27764769	20161030	Establishing the involvement of the novel gene AGBL5 in retinitis pigmentosa by whole genome sequencing.	While more than 250 genes are known to cause inherited retinal degenerations (IRD), nearly 40-50% of families have the genetic basis for their disease unknown. In this study we sought to identify the underlying cause of IRD in a family by whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis. Clinical characterization including standard ophthalmic examination, fundus photography, visual field testing, electroretinography, and review of medical and family history was performed. WGS was performed on affected and unaffected family members using Illumina HiSeq X10. Sequence reads were aligned to hg19 using BWA-MEM and variant calling was performed with Genome Analysis Toolkit. The called variants were annotated with SnpEff v4.11, PolyPhen v2.2.2, and CADD v1.3. Copy number variations were called using Genome STRiP (svtoolkit 2.00.1611) and SpeedSeq software. Variants were filtered to detect rare potentially deleterious variants segregating with disease. Candidate variants were validated by dideoxy sequencing. Clinical evaluation revealed typical adolescent-onset recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) in affected members. WGS identified about 4 million variants in each individual. Two rare and potentially deleterious compound heterozygous variants p.Arg281Cys and p.Arg487* were identified in the gene ATP/GTP binding protein like 5 (AGBL5) as likely causal variants. No additional variants in IRD genes that segregated with disease were identified. Mutation analysis confirmed the segregation of these variants with the IRD in the pedigree. Homology models indicated destabilization of AGBL5 due to the p.Arg281Cys change. Our findings establish the involvement of mutations in AGBL5 in RP and validate the WGS variant filtering pipeline we designed. 	Physiol._Genomics	D016428
25303981	20141012	Genetic polymorphism in DTNBP1 gene is associated with methamphetamine-induced panic disorder.	The dysbindin-1 (dystrobrevin-binding protein-1 [DTNBP-1]) gene has repeatedly been shown to be associated with psychotic disorder across diverse populations. In this study, we attempted to investigate the association of the rs3213207 (P1635) genetic polymorphism of the DTNBP1 gene with methamphetamine dependence and with methamphetamine-induced psychosis, manic episodes, and panic disorder in a male Malaysian population. This polymorphism was genotyped in 233 male methamphetamine-dependent subjects and in 301 male controls of the following 4 different ethnicities: Malay, Chinese, Kadazan-Dusun, and Bajau. Intergroup statistical analyses were performed by using the ?(2) test and the Fisher exact test where necessary. In cases of multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni correction was performed. Our results indicated that the DTNBP1 rs3213207 polymorphism did not show any significant association with risk of methamphetamine dependence, either in the pooled subjects or after stratification into the 4 different ethnic groups (P &gt; 0.05). Furthermore, we did not find any association of this polymorphism with methamphetamine-induced psychosis and episodes of methamphetamine-induced mania. However, there was a strong association between this polymorphism and the occurrence of methamphetamine-induced panic disorder in the pooled subjects (odds ratio [OR] = 6.739, P &lt; 0.001) and in the Malay (OR = 11.93, P = 0.022) and Kadazan-Dusun (OR = 115.0, P &lt; 0.001) groups. Our findings suggest that the DTNBP1 rs3213207 polymorphism may contribute to methamphetamine-induced panic disorder in the pooled Malaysian male population, especially in the Malay and Kadazan-Dusun ethnic groups. However, no association was found with methamphetamine dependence, methamphetamine-induced psychosis, or methamphetamine-induced mania. 	J_Addict_Med	D016428 D013485
24391152	20140107	Ecology drives the distribution of specialized tyrosine metabolism modules in fungi.	Gene clusters encoding accessory or environmentally specialized metabolic pathways likely play a significant role in the evolution of fungal genomes. Two such gene clusters encoding enzymes associated with the tyrosine metabolism pathway (KEGG #00350) have been identified in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. The l-tyrosine degradation (TD) gene cluster encodes a functional module that facilitates breakdown of the phenolic amino acid, l-tyrosine through a homogentisate intermediate, but is also involved in the production of pyomelanin, a fungal pathogenicity factor. The gentisate catabolism (GC) gene cluster encodes a functional module likely involved in phenolic compound degradation, which may enable metabolism of biphenolic stilbenes in multiple lineages. Our investigation of the evolution of the TD and GC gene clusters in 214 fungal genomes revealed spotty distributions partially shaped by gene cluster loss and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Specifically, a TD gene cluster shows evidence of HGT between the extremophilic, melanized fungi Exophiala dermatitidis and Baudoinia compniacensis, and a GC gene cluster shows evidence of HGT between Sordariomycete and Dothideomycete grass pathogens. These results suggest that the distribution of specialized tyrosine metabolism modules is influenced by both the ecology and phylogeny of fungal species. 	Genome_Biol_Evol	D016428 D013485 D013486
9575187	19980620	Secreted beta-amyloid precursor protein counteracts the proapoptotic action of mutant presenilin-1 by activation of NF-kappaB and stabilization of calcium homeostasis.	Mutations in the presenilin-1 (PS-1) gene account for approximately 50% of the cases of autosomal dominant, early onset, inherited forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PS-1 is an integral membrane protein expressed in neurons and is localized primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). PS-1 mutations may promote neuronal degeneration by altering the processing of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and/or by engaging apoptotic pathways. Alternative processing of APP in AD may increase production of neurotoxic amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) and reduce production of the neuroprotective alpha-secretase-derived form of APP (sAPPalpha). In differentiated PC12 cells expressing an AD-linked PS-1 mutation (L286V), sAPPalpha activated the transcription factor NF-kappaB and prevented apoptosis induced by Abeta. Treatment of cells with kappaB decoy DNA blocked the antiapoptotic action of sAPPalpha, demonstrating the requirement for NF-kappaB activation in the cytoprotective action of sAPPalpha. Cells expressing mutant PS-1 exhibited an aberrant pattern of NF-kappaB activity following exposure to Abeta, which was characterized by enhanced early activation of NF-kappaB followed by a prolonged depression of activity. Blockade of NF-kappaB activity in cells expressing mutant PS-1 by kappaB decoy DNA was associated with enhanced Abeta-induced increases of [Ca2+]i and mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of cells with sAPPalpha stabilized [Ca2+]i and mitochondrial function and suppressed oxidative stress by a mechanism involving activation of NF-kappaB. Blockade of ER calcium release prevented (and stimulation of ER calcium release by thapsigargin induced) apoptosis in cells expressing mutant PS-1, suggesting a pivotal role for ER calcium release in the proapoptotic action of mutant PS-1. Finally, a role for NF-kappaB in preventing apoptosis induced by ER calcium release was demonstrated by data showing that sAPPalpha prevents thapsigargin-induced apoptosis, an effect blocked by kappaB decoy DNA. We conclude that sAPPalpha stabilizes cellular calcium homeostasis and protects neural cells against the proapoptotic action of mutant PS-1 by a mechanism involving activation of NF-kappaB. The data further suggest that PS-1 mutations result in aberrant NF-kappaB regulation that may render neurons vulnerable to apoptosis. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013487
6138350	19831025	Selective inhibition of synaptosomal proline uptake by leucine and methionine enkephalins.	The high affinity, sodium-dependent uptake of proline by rat brain synaptosomes was inhibited by the opioid pentapeptides, Leu-enkephalin and Met-enkephalin. The synaptosomal uptake of other putative neurotransmitter amino acids including glutamic acid, aspartic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and taurine was not altered in the presence of enkephalins. The uptake of a neuroinactive amino acid, leucine, was also unaffected by enkephalins. The extent of proline uptake was half-maximal at a Leu-enkephalin concentration of 1 microM. Both the initial rate of transport and the overall capacity for proline accumulation were reduced. The effect of the enkephalins was vectorial since carrier-mediated efflux of proline was not altered in the presence of enkephalins. Morphine and the opioid peptides, dynorphin and beta-endorphin, were without effect on proline uptake. The inhibition of proline uptake by enkephalins was not diminished by prior incubation of the synaptosomal preparation with naloxone; however, the inhibition was attenuated by 1-butanol. The des-tyrosyl fragments of the enkephalins were as inhibitory as the intact pentapeptides. A modified enkephalin ([D-Ser2]Leu-enkephalin-Thr) with selective affinity for the delta subclass of enkephalin receptor was effective in inhibiting proline uptake. On the basis of the selectivity of these effects, we propose that there is a specific population of nerve endings in the cerebral cortex that contains both a proline-transport system and binding sites for Leu- and Met-enkephalin and furthermore, that these binding sites may be related to the putative delta receptor.

Of the thiophene derivatives tested, only thiophene-2-carboxylate (T2C), thiophene-2-acetate and thiophene-2-carbonyl chloride supported growth, but a total of seven were significantly oxidised by resting cells. Furan-2-carboxylate (F2C) and pyrrole-2-carboxylate (P2C) also supported growth and were oxidised. The heteroatoms of T2C and P2C were released into the media as sulphate and ammonia and served as sole sources of sulphur and nitrogen for growth.

26102685	20150624	8C.07: DETECTION OF FREE-CIRCULATING DNA IN PATIENTS WITH ALDOSTERONE PRODUCING ADENOMA.	Tumor cells undergoing apoptosis or necrosis release cell-free DNA fragments (cf-DNA) of different sizes into the bloodstream. Primary aldosteronism (PA) caused by aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), but not by bilateral hyperplasia (BAH), has somatic mutations in KCNJ5 gene. Hence, the detection of KCNJ5 mutations in cf-DNA from peripheral blood could allow pinpointing PA patients with APA that must be submitted to Adrenal Vein Sampling (AVS). The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of using cf-DNA to detect KCNJ5 mutations in plasma of PA patients. Plasma was collected from the right/left adrenal veins from 6 APA patients undergoing AVS. Plasma from 7 patients with stomach cancer and from 6 healthy subjects was used as positive/negative control, respectively, for cf-DNA quality. The integrity index (DII) was calculated as a ratio of 400pb/200pb amplicons.A DII cut off equal or greater than 1.0 was assumed to denote cf-DNA integrity. DNA sequences entailing the region with KCNJ5 gene mutations (G151R, L168R, T158A) were amplified using PCR real time (qPCR) to obtain long (400?bp) and short (200?bp) fragments. The DII for KCNJ5 amplicons on average was consistently?&gt;?1.0 in gastric cancer samples, 1.0 in healthy subjects whereas it was?&lt;?1.0 in APA patients. The cf-DNA concentration of KCNJ5 amplicons was 10-fold higher in gastric cancer patients than in AVS plasma (4.8???1 vs 0.4???0.1?ng/ul p?&lt;?0.01). The latter showed no significant differences between the APA and the contralateral side (0.41???0.1 vs 0.36???0.1). These results confirm the feasibility of isolating cf-DNA not only from patients with malignancies, but also with PA. With current technology the cf-DNA amount and integrity that were obtained suggest the feasibility of using this strategy to detect malignancies. However, at present the results obtained in this study do not support the use of this approach to pinpoint PA with APA based on identification of KCNJ5 mutations. Therefore, further work is needed to develop this innovative and non-invasive strategy that could be useful to pinpoint the patients with APA before the AVS. 	J._Hypertens.	D016428
27302742	20160616	Translational and post-translational regulation of mouse cation transport regulator homolog 1.	Cation transport regulator homolog 1 (Chac1) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducible gene that has a function as a ?-glutamyl cyclotransferase involved in the degradation of glutathione. To characterize the translation and stability of Chac1, we found that the Kozak-like sequence present in the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the Chac1 mRNA was responsible for Chac1 translation. In addition, the short form (?Chac1), which translated from the second ATG codon, was generated in the absence of the 5'UTR. The proteasome pathway predominantly participated in the stability of the Chac1 protein; however, its expression was remarkably up-regulated by co-transfection with ubiquitin genes. Using an immunoprecipitation assay, we revealed that ubiquitin molecule was directly conjugated to Chac1, and that mutated Chac1 with all lysine residues replaced by arginine was also ubiquitinated. Finally, we showed that WT Chac1 but not ?Chac1 reduced the intracellular level of glutathione. Taken together, our results suggest that the Chac1 protein expression is regulated in translational and post-translational fashion due to the Kozak-like sequence in the 5'UTR and the ubiquitin-mediated pathways. The bidirectional roles of ubiquitination in regulating Chac1 stabilization might give us a new insight into understanding the homeostasis of glutathione under pathophysiological conditions.

10606045	19991222	Competition between Li+ and Mg2+ for red blood cell membrane phospholipids: A 31P, 7Li, and 6Li nuclear magnetic resonance study.	The mode of action of the lithium ion (Li+) in the treatment of manic depression or bipolar illness is still under investigation, although this inorganic drug has been in clinical use for 50 yr. Several research reports have provided evidence for Li+/Mg2+ competition in biomolecules. We carried out this study to characterize the interactions of Li+ and Mg2+ with red blood cell (RBC) membrane components to see whether Li+/Mg2+ competition occurs. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift measurements of the phospholipids extracted from the RBC membranes indicated that the anionic phospholipids, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol, bind Li+ and Mg2+ most strongly. From 6Li relaxation measurements, the Li+ binding constant to the phospholipid extract was found to be 45 +/- 5 M(-1). Thus, these studies showed that the phospholipids play a major role in metal ion binding. 7Li spin-lattice relaxation measurements conducted on unsealed and cytoskeleton-depleted RBC membrane in the presence of magnesium indicated that the removal of the cytoskeleton increases lithium binding to the more exposed anionic phospholipids (357 +/- 24 M(-1)) when compared to lithium binding in the unsealed RBC membrane (221 +/- 21 M(-1)). Therefore, it can be seen that the cytoskeleton does not play a major role in Li+ binding or in Li+/Mg2+ competition. 	Lipids	D016428 D013485 D013487
22363536	20120225	DRB1*03:01 haplotypes: differential contribution to multiple sclerosis risk and specific association with the presence of intrathecal IgM bands.	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a multifactorial disease with a genetic basis. The strongest associations with the disease lie in the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region. However, except for the DRB1*15:01 allele, the main risk factor associated to MS so far, no consistent effect has been described for any other variant. One example is HLA-DRB1*03:01, with a heterogeneous effect across populations and studies. We postulate that those discrepancies could be due to differences in the diverse haplotypes bearing that allele. Thus, we aimed at studying the association of DRB1*03:01 with MS susceptibility considering this allele globally and stratified by haplotypes. We also evaluated the association with the presence of oligoclonal IgM bands against myelin lipids (OCMB) in cerebrospinal fluid. Genotyping of HLA-B, -DRB1 and -DQA1 was performed in 1068 MS patients and 624 ethnically matched healthy controls. One hundred and thirty-nine MS patients were classified according to the presence (M+, 58 patients)/absence (M-, 81 patients) of OCMB. Comparisons between groups (MS patients vs. controls and M+ vs. M-) were performed with the chi-square test or the Fisher exact test. Association of DRB1*03:01 with MS susceptibility was observed but with different haplotypic contribution, being the ancestral haplotype (AH) 18.2 the one causing the highest risk. Comparisons between M+, M- and controls showed that the AH 18.2 was affecting only M+ individuals, conferring a risk similar to that caused by DRB1*15:01. The diverse DRB1*03:01-containing haplotypes contribute with different risk to MS susceptibility. The AH 18.2 causes the highest risk and affects only to individuals showing OCMB.

We carried out an association study between T-cell receptor beta polymorphism (TCRB) and endometriosis to investigate the difference in allelic frequency. Polymorphisms in T-cell receptor genes can provide important information for the study of the immune response and autoimmune diseases; indeed, rs1800907, a very common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the TCRB, has been extensively studied in autoimmune diseases in the 1990s using Southern blot analysis and more recently polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. An autoimmune etiology for endometriosis has been strongly suggested for the presence of antibodies against endometrium, high rates of autoimmune disorders and associated atopic diseases. We investigated 70 patients with endometriosis and 120 controls. DNA of patients and controls was studied by PCR followed by restriction digestion and sequencing to determine genotype and presence of linkage disequilibrium (LD). Statistical analysis was carried out using STATA Routine GENHW (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) for estimation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and test power calculation. The difference of allele distribution between patients and controls was calculated according to Pearson's and Fisher's tests. Test power for the estimation of linkage disequilibrium is low (0.16). We performed an association study of the SNP rs1800907 of TCRB between 70 patients with endometriosis and 120 controls, and did not find any significant difference (?(2) = 0.27 and P = 0.87). Fisher's test confirmed a P-value of 0.872. Our study does not suggest an evidential and major involvement of TCRB in the pathogenesis of endometriosis in an Italian population in a small case control study. 	J._Obstet._Gynaecol._Res.

6412686	19830801	The source of oxygen in the reaction catalysed by collagen lysyl hydroxylase.	The synthetic peptides (Pro-Pro-Gly)5 and (Ile-Lys-Gly)5-Phe were hydroxylated with collagen prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase in an 18O2 atmosphere. The oxygen atoms in the hydroxy groups of hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine were 87% and 6.5% respectively derived from the atmospheric 18O2. The results are consistent with those reported previously for proline hydroxylation in vivo [Fujimoto &amp; Tamiya (1962) Biochem. J. 84, 333-335; Prockop, Kaplan &amp; Udenfriend (1962) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 9, 192-196; Fujimoto &amp; Tamiya (1963) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 10, 498-501; Prockop, Kaplan &amp; Udenfriend (1963) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 101, 499-503] and in vitro [Cardinale, Rhoads &amp; Udenfriend (1971) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 43, 537-543] and for lysine hydroxylation in vivo [Fujimoto &amp; Tamiya (1963) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 10, 498-501]. In view of the similarities of these two oxygenase-type hydroxylation reactions the participation of intermediates is proposed, the oxygen atoms of which are exchangeable with those of water. The atmospheric oxygen atoms incorporated into the intermediate must be equilibrated with water oxygen atoms in the slower lysyl hydroxylase reaction. 	Biochem._J.	D016428
19021900	20081122	Mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum cytochrome b gene are associated with delayed parasite recrudescence in malaria patients treated with atovaquone-proguanil.	Fixed-dose combination antimalarial drugs have played an increasingly important role in the treatment and chemoprophylaxis of falciparum malaria since the worldwide failure of monotherapy with chloroquine. Atovaquone-proguanil is one such combination drug used both for prophylaxis in travellers, and for treatment of acute malaria cases in European hospitals and clinics. A series of eight atovaquone-proguanil treatment failures and two prophylaxis breakthroughs from four UK hospitals from 2004-2008 were analysed for evidence of mutations in the pfcyt-b gene, previously found to be associated with failure of the atovaquone component. Parasites carrying pfcyt-b mutations were found in five falciparum malaria patients with recrudescent parasitaemia occurring weeks after apparently successful treatment of a primary infection with atovaquone-proguanil. Four of these cases carried parasites with the Tyr268Cys mutation in pfcyt-b, previously reported in two French patients with malaria. In contrast, mutations in pfcyt-b were not found in three patients treated with atovaquone-proguanil who exhibited delayed clearance of the primary infection, nor in two returning travellers with malaria who had used the combination for prophylaxis. Using current and previously published data, mean time to recrudescence of parasites carrying pfcytb codon 268 mutations was estimated as 28.0 days after treatment (95% C.I. 23.0 - 33.0 days), whereas treatment failures without codon 268 mutations received rescue treatment an average of 4.71 days after initial AP treatment (95% C.I. 1.76 - 7.67 days). Genetically-determined parasite resistance to atovaquone is associated with delayed recrudescence of resistant parasites three weeks or more after initial clearance of parasitaemia by atovaquone/proguanil therapy. The 268-Cys allele of pfcyt-b may have been overlooked in previous studies of atovaquone-proguanil treatment failure as it is not detected by current RFLP methods. 	Malar._J.	D016428 D013485
16820065	20060706	Beta3-adrenergic receptor gene, body mass index, bone mineral density and fracture risk in elderly men and women: the Dubbo Osteoporosis Epidemiology Study (DOES).	Recent studies have suggested that the Arg allele of beta3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) gene is associated with body mass index (BMI), which is an important predictor of bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk. However, whether the ADRB3 gene polymorphism is associated with fracture risk has not been investigated. The aim of study was to examine the inter-relationships between ADRB3 gene polymorphisms, BMI, BMD and fracture risk in elderly Caucasians. Genotypes of the ADRB3 gene were determined in 265 men and 446 women aged 60+ in 1989 at entry into the study, whose BMD were measured by DXA (GE Lunar, WI USA) at baseline. During the follow-up period (between 1989 and 2004), fractures were ascertained by reviewing radiography reports and personal interviews. The allelic frequencies of the Trp and the Arg alleles were 0.925 and 0.075 respectively, and the relative frequencies of genotypes Trp/Trp, Trp/Arg and Arg/Arg 0.857, 0.138 and 0.006 respectively. There was no significant association between BMI and ADRB3 genotypes (p = 0.10 in women and p = 0.68 in men). There was also no significant association between ADRB3 genotypes and lumbar spine or femoral neck BMD in either men and women. Furthermore, there were no significant association between ADRB3 genotypes and fracture risk in both women and men, either before or after adjusting for and, BMD and BMI. The present data suggested that in Caucasian population the contribution of ADRB3 genotypes to the prediction of BMI, BMD and fracture risk is limited. 	BMC_Med._Genet.	D016428 D013485
26221627	20150730	An Optimal CDS Construction Algorithm with Activity Scheduling in Ad Hoc Networks.	A new energy efficient optimal Connected Dominating Set (CDS) algorithm with activity scheduling for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) is proposed. This algorithm achieves energy efficiency by minimizing the Broadcast Storm Problem [BSP] and at the same time considering the node's remaining energy. The Connected Dominating Set is widely used as a virtual backbone or spine in mobile ad hoc networks [MANETs] or Wireless Sensor Networks [WSN]. The CDS of a graph representing a network has a significant impact on an efficient design of routing protocol in wireless networks. Here the CDS is a distributed algorithm with activity scheduling based on unit disk graph [UDG]. The node's mobility and residual energy (RE) are considered as parameters in the construction of stable optimal energy efficient CDS. The performance is evaluated at various node densities, various transmission ranges, and mobility rates. The theoretical analysis and simulation results of this algorithm are also presented which yield better results. 	ScientificWorldJournal	D016428
24109591	20131011	The Role of Bystander Effects in the Antitumor Activity of the Hypoxia-Activated Prodrug PR-104.	Activation of prodrugs in tumors (e.g., by bioreduction in hypoxic zones) has the potential to generate active metabolites that can diffuse within the tumor microenvironment. Such &quot;bystander effects&quot; may offset spatial heterogeneity in prodrug activation but the relative importance of this effect is not understood. Here, we quantify the contribution of bystander effects to antitumor activity for the first time, by developing a spatially resolved pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (SR-PK/PD) model for PR-104, a phosphate ester pre-prodrug that is converted systemically to the hypoxia-activated prodrug PR-104A. Using Green's function methods we calculated concentrations of oxygen, PR-104A and its active metabolites, and resultant cell killing, at each point of a mapped three-dimensional tumor microregion. Model parameters were determined in vitro, using single cell suspensions to determine relationships between PR-104A metabolism and clonogenic cell killing, and multicellular layer (MCL) cultures to measure tissue diffusion coefficients. LC-MS/MS detection of active metabolites in the extracellular medium following exposure of anoxic single cell suspensions and MCLs to PR-104A confirmed that metabolites can diffuse out of cells and through a tissue-like environment. The SR-PK/PD model estimated that bystander effects contribute 30 and 50% of PR-104 activity in SiHa and HCT116 tumors, respectively. Testing the model by modulating PR-104A-activating reductases and hypoxia in tumor xenografts showed overall clonogenic killing broadly consistent with model predictions. Overall, our data suggest that bystander effects are important in PR-104 antitumor activity, although their reach may be limited by macroregional heterogeneity in hypoxia and reductase expression in tumors. The reported computational and experimental techniques are broadly applicable to all targeted anticancer prodrugs and could be used to identify strategies for rational prodrug optimization.

3490581	19861101	Relationship between mitogenic activity of influenza viruses and the receptor-binding specificity of their hemagglutinin molecules.	The relationship between the mitogenic activity of influenza type A viruses for murine B lymphocytes and the receptor-binding specificity of their hemagglutinin was examined. Receptor-binding specificity was determined by the ability of the virus to agglutinate erythrocytes that had been sialidase treated and then enzymatically resialylated to contain sialyloligosaccharides with defined sequences. Distinct differences in receptor-binding specificity were observed between strongly and weakly mitogenic viruses of the H3 subtype, with strong mitogenic activity correlating with the ability of the virus to recognize the sequence N-glycolylneuraminic acid alpha 2,6 galactose (NeuGc alpha 2,6Gal). Viruses isolated early in the evolution of the H3 subtype (from 1968 to 1971) are relatively weak mitogens and recognize the sequence N-acetylneuraminic acid alpha 2,6 galactose (NeuAc alpha 2,6Gal) but not NeuGc alpha 2,6Gal. H3 viruses isolated since 1972 are strongly mitogenic, and these viruses recognize both NeuGc alpha 2,6Gal and NeuAc alpha 2,6Gal. The amino acid substitution of Tyr for Thr at residue 155 of HA1 may be critical to this change in receptor-binding specificity and mitogenic activity of the later H3 viruses. Horse serum-resistant variants of H3 viruses, which bind preferentially to the sequence NeuAc alpha 2,3Gal, are poorly mitogenic. Differences were also observed between the receptor-binding specificity of the strongly mitogenic H3 viruses and viruses of the H2 and H6 subtypes, the mitogenic activity of which is limited to strains of mice that express the class II major histocompatibility complex glycoprotein I-E. The results indicate that the receptor-binding specificity of the hemagglutinin plays a critical role in determining the mitogenic activity of influenza viruses. 	J._Virol.

22286341	20120131	Semireplication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus as a novel platform for oncolytic virotherapy.	Among oncolytic viruses, the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is especially potent and a highly promising agent for the treatment of cancer. But, even though effective against multiple tumor entities in preclinical animal models, replication-competent VSV exhibits inherent neurovirulence, which has so far hindered clinical development. To overcome this limitation, replication-defective VSV vectors for cancer gene therapy have been tested and proven to be safe. However, gene delivery was inefficient and only minor antitumor efficacy was observed. Here, we present semireplication-competent vector systems for VSV (srVSV), composed of two trans-complementing, propagation-deficient VSV vectors. The de novo generated deletion mutants of the two VSV polymerase proteins P (phosphoprotein) and L (large catalytic subunit), VSV?P and VSV?L respectively, were used mutually or in combination with VSV?G vectors. These srVSV systems copropagated in vitro and in vivo without recombinatory reversion to replication-competent virus. The srVSV systems were highly lytic for human glioblastoma cell lines, spheroids, and subcutaneous xenografts. Especially the combination of VSV?G/VSV?L vectors was as potent as wild-type VSV (VSV-WT) in vitro and induced long-term tumor regression in vivo without any associated adverse effects. In contrast, 90% of VSV-WT-treated animals succumbed to neurological disease shortly after tumor clearance. Most importantly, even when injected into the brain, VSV?G/VSV?L did not show any neurotoxicity. In conclusion, srVSV is a promising platform for virotherapeutic approaches and also for VSV-based vector vaccines, combining improved safety with an increased coding capacity for therapeutic transgenes, potentially allowing for multipronged approaches.

9744100	19980923	Characterization of exon skipping mutants of the COP1 gene from Arabidopsis.	The removal of introns from pre-mRNA requires accurate recognition and selection of the intron splice sites. Mutations which alter splice site selection and which lead to skipping of specific exons are indicative of intron/exon recognition mechanisms involving an exon definition process. In this paper, three independent mutants to the COP1 gene in Arabidopsis which show exon skipping were identified and the mutations which alter the normal splicing pattern were characterized. The mutation in cop1-1 was a G--&gt;A change 4 nt upstream from the 3' splice site of intron 5, while the mutation in cop1-2 was a G--&gt;A at the first nucleotide of intron 6, abolishing the conserved G within the 5' splice site consensus. The effect of these mutations was skipping of exon 6. The mutation in cop1-8 was G--&gt;A in the final nucleotide of intron 10 abolishing the conserved G within the 3' splice site consensus and leading to skipping of exon 11. The splicing patterns surrounding exons 6 and 11 of COP1 in these three mutant lines of Arabidopsis provide evidence for exon definition mechanisms operating in plant splicing. 	Plant_J.

18182444	20080110	Genetic variation in the CRP promoter: association with systemic lupus erythematosus.	The pentraxin C-reactive protein (CRP), an innate immune system opsonin which binds nuclear debris and apoptotic bodies, may protect against autoimmunity. A relative deficiency of CRP levels in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) might contribute to altered handling of self-antigens. We report that the proximal 5' promoter region of CRP contains several polymorphisms that exhibit association with SLE in multiple populations. Strongest association was observed at the proximal promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3093061 (CRP-707) (P = 6.41 x 10(-7) and P = 2.13 x 10(-6) in African-American and Caucasian case-control samples respectively). This association remains after adjustment for admixture. Linkage disequilibrium exists between SNPs in the proximal promoter and association of functional haplotypes containing rs3091244/rs3093062 (CRP-409/-390) appear to be driven by the rs3093061 (CRP-707) association. These data demonstrate that rs3093061 at the -707 site within the CRP gene is an SLE susceptibility locus. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013486
11485765	20010804	Peripherin/RDS gene mutation (Pro210Leu) and polymorphisms in Japanese patients with retinal dystrophies.	To determine the frequency of peripherin/RDS (retinal degeneration slow) gene mutations in Japanese patients with retinal dystrophies. We analyzed the peripherin/RDS gene in 54 unrelated Japanese patients with retinal dystrophies. Genomic DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the PCR products were sequenced. We also examined 100 healthy subjects, seeking mutations or variations of the peripherin/RDS gene. Of the 54 Japanese patients, one with retinitis pigmentosa had a heterozygous C to T change at the second nucleotide at codon 210 of exon 2 (CCT to CTT/Pro210Leu) of the peripherin/RDS gene. None of the 100 individuals with normal fundi had the Pro210Leu mutation of the peripherin/RDS gene. Three variants of the peripherin/RDS gene (GTC to GTT/Val106Val, Glu304Gln, and Gly338Asp) were also found. The first variation (GTC to GTT/Val106Val) was silent. Two concurrent missense variations (Glu304Gln and Gly338Asp) were seen in 25.9% of the affected patients and in 29% of the healthy individuals. A novel mutation (Pro210Leu) of the peripherin/RDS gene has been found in one Japanese patient with retinitis pigmentosa. The alterations of Val106Val, Glu304Gln, and Gly338Asp may be polymorphic variants in the Japanese population. 	Jpn._J._Ophthalmol.	D016428
24885352	20140603	Biofertilizers function as key player in sustainable agriculture by improving soil fertility, plant tolerance and crop productivity.	Current soil management strategies are mainly dependent on inorganic chemical-based fertilizers, which caused a serious threat to human health and environment. The exploitation of beneficial microbes as a biofertilizer has become paramount importance in agriculture sector for their potential role in food safety and sustainable crop production. The eco-friendly approaches inspire a wide range of application of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs), endo- and ectomycorrhizal fungi, cyanobacteria and many other useful microscopic organisms led to improved nutrient uptake, plant growth and plant tolerance to abiotic and biotic stress. The present review highlighted biofertilizers mediated crops functional traits such as plant growth and productivity, nutrient profile, plant defense and protection with special emphasis to its function to trigger various growth- and defense-related genes in signaling network of cellular pathways to cause cellular response and thereby crop improvement. The knowledge gained from the literature appraised herein will help us to understand the physiological bases of biofertlizers towards sustainable agriculture in reducing problems associated with the use of chemicals fertilizers.

24685274	20140402	Arsenic trioxide inhibits Hedgehog, Notch and stem cell properties in glioblastoma neurospheres.	Notch and Hedgehog signaling have been implicated in the pathogenesis and stem-like characteristics of glioblastomas, and inhibitors of the pathways have been suggested as new therapies for these aggressive tumors. It has also been reported that targeting both pathways simultaneously can be advantageous in treating glioblastoma neurospheres, but this is difficult to achieve in vivo using multiple agents. Since arsenic trioxide has been shown to inhibit both Notch and Hedgehog in some solid tumors, we examined its effects on these pathways and on stem cell phenotype in glioblastoma. We found that arsenic trioxide suppresses proliferation and promotes apoptosis in three stem-like glioblastoma neurospheres lines, while inhibiting Notch and Hedgehog target genes. Importantly, arsenic trioxide markedly reduced clonogenic capacity of the tumor neurospheres, and the stem-like CD133-positive fraction was also diminished along with expression of the stem cell markers SOX2 and CD133. Our results suggest that arsenic trioxide may be effective in targeting stem-like glioblastoma cells in patients by inhibiting Notch and Hedgehog activity. 	Acta_Neuropathol_Commun	D016428 D052061
27503138	20160810	A combination of TERT promoter mutation and MGMT methylation status predicts clinically relevant subgroups of newly diagnosed glioblastomas.	The prognostic impact of TERT mutations has been controversial in IDH-wild tumors, particularly in glioblastomas (GBM). The controversy may be attributable to presence of potential confounding factors such as MGMT methylation status or patients' treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of TERT status on patient outcome in association with various factors in a large series of adult diffuse gliomas. We analyzed a total of 951 adult diffuse gliomas from two cohorts (Cohort 1, n?=?758; Cohort 2, n?=?193) for IDH1/2, 1p/19q, and TERT promoter status. The combined IDH/TERT classification divided Cohort 1 into four molecular groups with distinct outcomes. The overall survival (OS) was the shortest in IDH wild-type/TERT mutated groups, which mostly consisted of GBMs (P?&lt;?0.0001). To investigate the association between TERT mutations and MGMT methylation on survival of patients with GBM, samples from a combined cohort of 453 IDH-wild-type GBM cases treated with radiation and temozolomide were analyzed. A multivariate Cox regression model revealed that the interaction between TERT and MGMT was significant for OS (P?=?0.0064). Compared with TERT mutant-MGMT unmethylated GBMs, the hazard ratio (HR) for OS incorporating the interaction was the lowest in the TERT mutant-MGMT methylated GBM (HR, 0.266), followed by the TERT wild-type-MGMT methylated (HR, 0.317) and the TERT wild-type-MGMT unmethylated GBMs (HR, 0.542). Thus, patients with TERT mutant-MGMT unmethylated GBM have the poorest prognosis. Our findings suggest that a combination of IDH, TERT, and MGMT refines the classification of grade II-IV diffuse gliomas. 	Acta_Neuropathol_Commun	D016428 D016448 D013485
10904101	20000725	Prothrombin G20210A, factor V Leiden, and factor XIII Val34Leu: common mutations of blood coagulation factors and deep vein thrombosis in Austria.	Mutations in the gene for prothrombin (F2 20210A) and factor V (F5 1691A, factor V Leiden) are established risk factors for deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Recently, a mutation in the gene for factor XIII (F13 100T) leading to a Valine-Leucine exchange at amino acid position 34 has been reported to be protective against DVT. To analyze the role of these mutations for DVT in Austria, we analyzed their prevalence in 154 patients with documented DVT and 308 sex- and age-matched control subjects. Allele frequencies of F2 20210A, F5 1691A, and F13 100T were 0.018, 0.039, and 0.274 among controls, and 0.045, 0.120, and 0.211 among patients, respectively. Odds ratios for DVT associated with F2 20210A, F5 1691A, and F13 100T alleles were 2.5 (95% CI: 1.1-5.7), 3.4 (95% CI: 1.9-5.8), and 0.7 (95% CI: 0.5-1.0). We conclude that F2 20210A, F5 1691A, and F13 100T are common mutations in the Austrian population. F2 20210A and F5 1691 increase the risk for DVT, whereas F13 100T is associated with a decreased risk for DVT. Routinely, analysis of these mutations may help to analyze the individual risk for DVT.

20502676	20100527	Mutation in archain 1, a subunit of COPI coatomer complex, causes diluted coat color and Purkinje cell degeneration.	Intracellular trafficking is critical for delivering molecules and organelles to their proper destinations to carry out normal cellular functions. Disruption of intracellular trafficking has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, a number of genes involved in vesicle/organelle trafficking are also essential for pigmentation, and loss of those genes is often associated with mouse coat-color dilution and human hypopigmentary disorders. Hence, we postulated that screening for mouse mutants with both neurological defects and coat-color dilution will help identify additional factors associated with intracellular trafficking in neuronal cells. In this study, we characterized a mouse mutant with a unique N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutation, named nur17. nur17 mutant mice exhibit both coat-color dilution and ataxia due to Purkinje cell degeneration in the cerebellum. By positional cloning, we identified that the nur17 mouse carries a T-to-C missense mutation in archain 1 (Arcn1) gene which encodes the delta subunit of the coat protein I (COPI) complex required for intracellular trafficking. Consistent with this function, we found that intracellular trafficking is disrupted in nur17 melanocytes. Moreover, the nur17 mutation leads to common characteristics of neurodegenerative disorders such as abnormal protein accumulation, ER stress, and neurofibrillary tangles. Our study documents for the first time the physiological consequences of the impairment of the ARCN1 function in the whole animal and demonstrates a direct association between ARCN1 and neurodegeneration.

10756027	20010207	Mutations in the 2C region of poliovirus responsible for altered sensitivity to benzimidazole derivatives.	MRL-1237, [1-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-imino-1,4-dihydropyridin-1-yl) methylbenzimidazole hydrochloride], is a potent and selective inhibitor of the replication of enteroviruses. To reveal the target molecule of MRL-1237 in viral replication, we selected spontaneous MRL-1237-resistant poliovirus mutants. Of 15 MRL-1237-resistant mutants obtained, 14 were cross-resistant to guanidine hydrochloride (mrgr), while 1 was susceptible (mrgs). Sequence analysis of the 2C region revealed that the 14 mrgr mutants contained a single nucleotide substitution that altered an amino acid residue from Phe-164 to Tyr. The mrgs mutant, on the other hand, contained a substitution of Ile-120 to Val. Through the construction of a cDNA-derived mutant, we confirmed that the single mutation at Phe-164 was really responsible for the reduced susceptibility to MRL-1237. MRL-1237 inhibited poliovirus-specific RNA synthesis in HeLa cells infected with a wild strain but not with an F164Y mutant. We furthermore examined the effect of mutations of the 2C region on the drug sensitivity of cDNA-derived guanidine-resistant and -dependent mutants. Two guanidine-resistant mutants were cross-resistant to MRL-1237 but remained susceptible to another benzimidazole, enviroxime. Either MRL-1237 or guanidine stimulated the viral replication of two guanidine-dependent mutants, but enviroxime did not. These results indicate that MRL-1237, like guanidine, targets the 2C protein of poliovirus for its antiviral effect. 	J._Virol.	D016428 D013485
7734346	19950301	alpha-Thalassaemia in the population of Cyprus.	We have determined the alpha-thalassaemia (alpha-thal) determinants in 78 patients with Hb H disease from Cyprus; 25 were Turkish Cypriots and 53 were Greek Cypriots. Four deletional and three non-deletional alpha-thal alleles were present; the -alpha(3.7 kb) alpha-thal-2 and the --MED-I alpha-thal-1 were most frequently seen; --MED-II and -(alpha)20.5 deletions occurred at considerably lower frequencies. About 15% of all chromosomes carried a non-deletional alpha-thal-2 allele; of these the 5 nucleotide (nt) deletion at the first intervening sequence (IVS-I) donor splice site was present in approximately 8% of all chromosomes. Two types of polyadenylation signal (poly A) mutations were observed. No striking frequency differences were seen between Greek and Turkish Cypriot patients. Combinations of the various types of alpha-thal resulted in eight different forms of Hb H disease. The phenotypes were comparable except for great variations in the level of Hb H which was highest (average approximately 22%) in the 12 patients with the alpha 5nt alpha/--MED-I combination. One patient with the same form of Hb H disease but with an additional beta-thal (IVS-I-110,G--&gt;A) heterozygosity had a most severe microcytosis and hypochromia with &lt; 1% Hb H. Variations in the level of Hb H might correlate with the severity of the disease, although this was not evident from the haematological data. 	Br._J._Haematol.	D016428 D013485 D013487
27545674	20160823	Biallelic Variants in UBA5 Link Dysfunctional UFM1?Ubiquitin-like Modifier Pathway to Severe Infantile-Onset Encephalopathy.	The ubiquitin fold modifier 1 (UFM1) cascade is a recently identified evolutionarily conserved ubiquitin-like modification system whose function and link to human disease have remained largely uncharacterized. By using exome sequencing in Finnish individuals with severe epileptic syndromes, we identified pathogenic compound heterozygous variants in UBA5, encoding an activating enzyme for UFM1, in two unrelated families. Two additional individuals with biallelic UBA5 variants were identified from the UK-based Deciphering Developmental Disorders study and one from the Northern Finland Intellectual Disability cohort. The affected individuals (n = 9) presented in early infancy with severe irritability, followed by dystonia and stagnation of development. Furthermore, the majority of individuals display postnatal microcephaly and epilepsy and develop spasticity. The affected individuals were compound heterozygous for a missense substitution, c.1111G&gt;A (p.Ala371Thr; allele frequency of 0.28% in Europeans), and a nonsense variant or c.164G&gt;A that encodes an amino acid substitution p.Arg55His, but also affects splicing by facilitating exon 2 skipping, thus also being in effect a loss-of-function allele. Using an in?vitro thioester formation assay and cellular analyses, we show that the p.Ala371Thr variant is hypomorphic with attenuated ability to transfer the activated UFM1 to UFC1. Finally, we show that the CNS-specific knockout of Ufm1 in mice causes neonatal death accompanied by microcephaly and apoptosis in specific neurons, further suggesting that the UFM1 system is essential for CNS development and function. Taken together, our data imply that the combination of a hypomorphic p.Ala371Thr variant in trans with a loss-of-function allele in UBA5 underlies a severe infantile-onset encephalopathy.

24934312	20140618	Inter-ethnic differences in genetic polymorphisms of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (CYP1A1, CYP2D6, NAT1 and NAT2) in healthy populations: correlation with the functional in silico prediction.	Several studies have shown that many polymorphisms of the xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (XME) affect either enzymatic functions or are associated with various aspects of human health. Owing to the presence of these single nucleotide variants (SNVs), differences in detoxification capacity have been observed between many ethnicities. The aim of this investigation was to study the prevalence of four polymorphisms in XME among various ethnic groups. Attention was focused on polymorphisms of CYP2D6 (rs1058172, G&gt;A, p.Arg365His), CYP1A1 (rs4646421, c.-26-728C&gt;T), NAT1 (rs4921880, c.-85-1014T&gt;A) and NAT2 (rs1208, A&gt;G, p.Arg268Lys). These polymorphisms were analyzed in 261 healthy Tunisians individuals in comparison with different ethnic backgrounds from hapmap database. In addition, in silico functional prediction was also performed to determine the loss of function variants. Our results demonstrated that population's origins widely affect the genetic variability of XME enzymes and Tunisians show a characteristic pattern. In silico predictions showed a deleterious effect for p.Arg268Lys substitution on CYP2D6 function, findings confirmed its key role played in cancer susceptibility. These data show that detoxification genes structures depend on the studied population. This suggests that ethnic differences impact on disease risk or response to drugs and therefore should be taken into consideration in genetic association studies focusing on XME enzymes. Our results provide the first report on these SNV in Tunisian population and could be useful for further epidemiological investigations including targeted therapy. 	Mol._Biol._Rep.	D016428 D013485

11286506	20010405	Recurrent mutations in P- and T-proteins of the glycine cleavage complex and a novel T-protein mutation (N145I): a strategy for the molecular investigation of patients with nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH).	Screening a DNA bank from 50 patients with enzymatic confirmation of their diagnosis of nonketotic hyperglycinemia gave allele frequencies of 5% for R515S of P-protein (glycine decarboxylase) and 7% for R320H of T-protein (aminomethyltransferase). In a previous report we found that 3% of the same patient alleles were positive for T-protein IVS7-1G&gt;A. In total, testing for these three mutations identified 15% of alleles and positive results (one or two mutations) were found in 11 of the 50 patients. In addition, a novel point mutation in T-protein, N145I, was found in a single case and a PCR/restriction enzyme assay was developed for its detection. 	Mol._Genet._Metab.	D016428 D013485
25296758	20141010	Exchange factor EFA6R requires C-terminal targeting to the plasma membrane to promote cytoskeletal rearrangement through the activation of ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6).	ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) small GTPase regulates membrane trafficking and cytoskeleton rearrangements at the plasma membrane (PM) by cycling between the GTP-bound active and GDP-bound inactive conformations. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate ARF6. The exchange factor for ARF6 (EFA6) R has been identified as a biomarker for ovarian cancer. EFA6R shares the catalytic Sec7, pleckstrin homology (PH), and coiled coil (CC) domains of the other EFA6 family GEFs. Here we report the functional characterization of EFA6R. Endogenous EFA6R was present in the plasma membrane fraction. The exogenously expressed FLAG- and GFP-tagged EFA6R were targeted to the PM. In vitro, GFP-EFA6R associated weakly but preferentially with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) through the PH domain. EFA6R required both its PH and CC domains localized at the C terminus to target the PM. Consistent with this, EFA6R lacking the CC domain (EFA6R?CC) was released from the PM into the cytosol upon PIP2 depletion, whereas EFA6R release from the PM required both PIP2 depletion and actin destabilization. These results suggest that the dual targeting via the PH and CC domains is important for the PM localization of EFA6R. EFA6R specifically catalyzed the GTP loading of ARF6 in mammalian cells. Moreover, EFA6R regulated ARF6 localization and thereby actin stress fiber loss. The GEF activity of EFA6R was dependent on the presence of the Sec7 domain. The PH and CC domains were also required for the in vivo GEF activity of EFA6R but could be functionally replaced by the CAAX motif of K-Ras, suggesting a role for these domains in the membrane targeting of EFA6R.

18330937	20080312	Polymorphism of -765G &gt; C COX-2 is a risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma and peptic ulcer disease in addition to H pylori infection: a study from northern India.	To investigate -765G &gt; C COX-2 polymorphism and H pylori infection in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD). We enrolled 348 adult patients (62 gastric adenocarcinoma, 45 PUD and 241 NUD) undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at two referral centers between September, 2002 and May, 2007. H pylori infection was diagnosed when any of the four tests (RUT, culture, histopathology and PCR) were positive. Genotyping for -765G &gt; C polymorphism of COX-2 was performed by PCR-RFLP analysis. Frequency of C carrier had significant association with gastric adenocarcinoma as compared to NUD [77.4% vs 29%, P &lt; 0.001, odds ratio (OR) 8.20; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 4.08-16.47] and PUD (77.4% vs 31.1%, P &lt; 0.001; OR 8.04; 95% CI, 3.25-19.90). Risk of gastric adenocarcinoma was significantly higher in patients having C carrier with (OR 7.83; 95% CI 3.09-19.85) and without H pylori infection (OR 7.06; 95% CI, 2.61-19.09). Patients with C carrier and H pylori infection had significant risk for the development of PUD (P &lt; 0.001; OR 5.65; 95% CI, 2.07-15.34). -765G &gt; C COX-2 polymorphism with or without H pylori could be a marker for genetic susceptibility to gastric adenocarcinoma. COX-2 polymorphism in presence of H pylori infection might be useful in predicting the risk of PUD. 	World_J._Gastroenterol.	D016428 D013485
27313626	20160618	Fabrication of Core-Shell PEI/pBMP2-PLGA Electrospun Scaffold for Gene Delivery to Periodontal Ligament Stem Cells.	Bone tissue engineering is the most promising technology for enhancing bone regeneration. Scaffolds loaded with osteogenic factors improve the therapeutic effect. In this study, the bioactive PEI (polyethylenimine)/pBMP2- (bone morphogenetic protein-2 plasmid-) PLGA (poly(D, L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)) core-shell scaffolds were prepared using coaxial electrospinning for a controlled gene delivery to hPDLSCs (human periodontal ligament stem cells). The pBMP2 was encapsulated in the PEI phase as a core and PLGA was employed to control pBMP2 release as a shell. First, the scaffold characterization and mechanical properties were evaluated. Then the gene release behavior was analyzed. Our results showed that pBMP2 was released at high levels in the first few days, with a continuous release behavior in the next 28 days. At the same time, PEI/pBMP2 showed high transfection efficiency. Moreover, the core-shell electrospun scaffold showed BMP2 expression for a much longer time (more than 28 days) compared with the single axial electrospun scaffold, as evaluated by qRT-PCR and western blot after culturing with hPDLSCs. These results suggested that the core-shell PEI/pBMP2-PLGA scaffold fabricated by coaxial electrospinning had a good gene release behavior and showed a prolonged expression time with a high transfection efficiency.

25267006	20141001	Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel 5-phenyl-1H-pyrazole derivatives as potential BRAF(V600E) inhibitors.	A series of novel 5-phenyl-1H-pyrazole derivatives (5 a-5 u) containing niacinamide moiety were synthesized and evaluated for biological activity as potential BRAF(V600E) inhibitors. Among them, compound 5h exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 0.33 ?M for BRAF(V600E). Antiproliferative assay results indicated that compound 5h has better antiproliferative activity against WM266.4 and A375 in vitro with IC50 value of 2.63 and 3.16 ?M, respectively, being comparable with the positive control vemurafenib. Molecular docking of 5h into the BRAF(V600E) active site was performed to determine the probable binding mode. Furthermore, molecular docking and 3D QSAR study by means of DS 3.5 (Discovery Studio 3.5, Accelrys, Co. Ltd) explored the binding modes and the structure and activity relationship (SAR) of these derivatives. 	Bioorg._Med._Chem.	D016428 D013485
24373879	20131231	Computational prediction and experimental characterization of a &quot;size switch type repacking&quot; during the evolution of dengue envelope protein domain III (ED3).	Dengue viruses (DEN) are classified into four serotypes (DEN1-DEN4) exhibiting high sequence and structural similarities, and infections by multiple serotypes can lead to the deadly dengue hemorrhagic fever. Here, we aim at characterizing the thermodynamic stability of DEN envelope protein domain III (ED3) during its evolution, and we report a structural analysis of DEN4wt ED3 combined with a systematic mutational analysis of residues 310 and 387. Molecular modeling based on our DEN3 and DEN4 ED3 structures indicated that the side-chains of residues 310/387, which are Val(310)/Ile(387) and Met(310)/Leu(387) in DEN3wt and DEN4wt, respectively, could be structurally compensated, and that a &quot;size switch type repacking&quot; might have occurred at these sites during the evolution of DEN into its four serotypes. This was experimentally confirmed by a 10?C and 5?C decrease in the thermal stability of, respectively, DEN3 ED3 variants with Met(310)/Ile(387) and Val(310)/Leu(387), whereas the variant with Met(310)/Leu(387), which contains a double mutation, had the same stability as the wild type DEN3. Namely, the Met310Val mutation should have preceded the Leu387Ile mutation in order to maintain the tight internal packing of ED3 and thus its thermodynamic stability. This view was confirmed by a phylogenetic reconstruction indicating that a common DEN ancestor would have Met(310)/Leu(387), and the intermediate node protein, Val(310)/Leu(387), which then mutated to the Val(310)/Ile(387) pair found in the present DEN3. The hypothesis was further confirmed by the observation that all of the present DEN viruses exhibit only stabilizing amino acid pairs at the 310/387 sites. 	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D013485
8970981	19961201	Mutation of lysine residues in the nucleotide binding segments of the poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.	The poliovirus 3D RNA-dependent RNA polymerase contains two peptide segments previously shown to cross-link to nucleotide substrates via lysine residues. To determine which lysine residue(s) might be implicated in catalytic function, we engineered mutations to generate proteins with leucine residues substituted individually for each of the lysine residues in the NTP binding regions. These proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and were examined for their abilities to bind nucleotides and to catalyze RNA chain elongation in vitro. Replacement of each lysine residue in the NTP binding segment located in the central portion of the 3D molecule (Lys-276, -278, or -283) with leucine produced no impairment of GTP binding or polymerase activity. Substitution of leucine for Lys-61 in the N-terminal portion of the protein, however, abolished the binding of protein to GTP-agarose and all detectable polymerase activity. A nearby lysine replacement with leucine at position 66 had no effect on enzyme activity. The three mutations in the central region of 3D were introduced into full-length viral cDNAs, and the infectivities of RNA transcripts were examined in transfected HeLa cells. Growth of virus containing 3D with a mutation at residue 278 (3Dmu278) or 3Dmu283 was indistinguishable from that of the wild type; however, 3Dmu276 generated extremely slow-growing, small-plaque virus. Polyprotein processing by 3CDmu276 was unaffected. Large-plaque variants, in which the Leu-276 codon had mutated again to an arginine codon, emerged at high frequency. The results suggest that a lysine residue at position 61 of 3Dpol is essential for polymerase catalytic function and that a basic (lysine or arginine) residue at position 276 is required for some other function of 3D important for virus growth but not for RNA chain elongation or polyprotein processing.

21390270	20110311	Nucleotide binding switches the information flow in ras GTPases.	The Ras superfamily comprises many guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) that are essential to intracellular signal transduction. The guanine nucleotide-dependent intrinsic flexibility patterns of five G proteins were investigated in atomic detail through Molecular Dynamics simulations of the GDP- and GTP-bound states (S(GDP) and S(GTP), respectively). For all the considered systems, the intrinsic flexibility of S(GDP) was higher than that of S(GTP), suggesting that Guanine Exchange Factor (GEF) recognition and nucleotide switch require higher amplitude motions than effector recognition or GTP hydrolysis. Functional mode, dynamic domain, and interaction energy correlation analyses highlighted significant differences in the dynamics of small G proteins and G? proteins, especially in the inactive state. Indeed, S(GDP) of G?(t), is characterized by a more extensive energy coupling between nucleotide binding site and distal regions involved in GEF recognition compared to small G proteins, which attenuates in the active state. Moreover, mechanically distinct domains implicated in nucleotide switch could be detected in the presence of GDP but not in the presence of GTP. Finally, in small G proteins, functional modes are more detectable in the inactive state than in the active one and involve changes in solvent exposure of two highly conserved amino acids in switches I and II involved in GEF recognition. The average solvent exposure of these amino acids correlates in turn with the rate of GDP release, suggesting for them either direct or indirect roles in the process of nucleotide switch. Collectively, nucleotide binding changes the information flow through the conserved Ras-like domain, where GDP enhances the flexibility of mechanically distinct portions involved in nucleotide switch, and favors long distance allosteric communication (in G? proteins), compared to GTP.

24863932	20140528	Signal transmission within the P2X2 trimeric receptor.	P2X2 receptor channel, a homotrimer activated by the binding of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to three intersubunit ATP-binding sites (each located ?50 ? from the ion permeation pore), also shows voltage-dependent activation upon hyperpolarization. Here, we used tandem trimeric constructs (TTCs) harboring critical mutations at the ATP-binding, linker, and pore regions to investigate how the ATP activation signal is transmitted within the trimer and how signals generated by ATP and hyperpolarization converge. Analysis of voltage- and [ATP]-dependent gating in these TTCs showed that: (a) Voltage- and [ATP]-dependent gating of P2X2 requires binding of at least two ATP molecules. (b) D315A mutation in the ?-14 strand of the linker region connecting the ATP-binding domains to the pore-forming helices induces two different gating modes; this requires the presence of the D315A mutation in at least two subunits. (c) The T339S mutation in the pore domains of all three subunits abolishes the voltage dependence of P2X2 gating in saturating [ATP], making P2X2 equally active at all membrane potentials. Increasing the number of T339S mutations in the TTC results in gradual changes in the voltage dependence of gating from that of the wild-type channel, suggesting equal and independent contributions of the subunits at the pore level. (d) Voltage- and [ATP]-dependent gating in TTCs differs depending on the location of one D315A relative to one K308A that blocks the ATP binding and downstream signal transmission. (e) Voltage- and [ATP]-dependent gating does not depend on where one T339S is located relative to K308A (or D315A). Our results suggest that each intersubunit ATP-binding signal is directly transmitted on the same subunit to the level of D315 via the domain that contributes K308 to the ?-14 strand. The signal subsequently spreads equally to all three subunits at the level of the pore, resulting in symmetric and independent contributions of the three subunits to pore opening. 	J._Gen._Physiol.

18518848	20080604	Genetic polymorphism analysis of CYP2C19 in Chinese Han populations from different geographic areas of mainland China.	Although many studies have been performed on CYP2C19, most of them have mainly examined the effects of the defective alleles CYP2C19(*)2 and CYP2C19(*)3. A comprehensive search for genetic polymorphisms of the CYP2C19 gene in the Chinese Han population has rarely been conducted. The present study was designed to determine the genetic basis of CYP2C19 polymorphisms. We investigated the 5 -regulatory region, all the exons and their surrounding introns of the CYP2C19 gene in 400 unrelated healthy Chinese Han volunteers from four different geographical locations, namely Shanghai, Shantou, Shenyang and Xi'an, with a sample of 100 subjects in each population, using direct sequencing. A total of 14 different CYP2C19 polymorphisms, including one novel variant (-2306G&gt;A) in the enhancer region and a novel nonsynonymous one (905C&gt;G, T302R) were identified. In addition, CYP2C19(*)1, (*)2, (*)3, (*)15 and (*)17 alleles showed frequencies of 69.7%, 24.7%, 3.3%, 1.2% and 1.2%, respectively, and CYP2C19(*)15 was the first detected in an Asian population. The frequencies of the prevalent defective alleles CYP2C19(*)2 and CYP2C19(*)3 in Chinese Han populations are similar to those in other Asians, and much higher than those reported in American European and other Caucasian populations. Haplotype analysis demonstrated CATCGG was the dominating haplotype with a frequency of 38.6% in the Chinese Han population. Furthermore, homology modeling analysis for CYP2C19 indicates that Thr302Arg could cause the displacement of heme. This is the first study that systematically screened the polymorphisms of the whole CYP2C19 gene in a large Chinese Han population. The results suggest that a few low frequent variants show significant differences among the four populations, while the prevalent polymorphisms show no differences. Therefore, our database provides important information on CYP2C19 polymorphisms in the Chinese population, and could be helpful for future personalized medicine studies in Asian populations generally.

19820021	20091013	Thyrotropin-stimulating hormone receptor gene analysis in pediatric patients with non-autoimmune subclinical hypothyroidism.	Mutations in TSH receptor (TSHR) are notoriously associated with congenital hypothyroidism as well as with non-autoimmune subclinical hypothyroidism, a mild form of TSH resistance that is not as well characterized by diagnostic procedures. The genetic analysis of the TSHR gene was performed to determine the prevalence of TSHR gene mutations in non-autoimmune subclinical hypothyroidism during the pediatric age. The new mutations were studied for genotypic-phenotypic correlation. Thirty-eight children (ages 0.5-18.0 yr) affected by non-autoimmune subclinical hypothyroidism diagnosed in our center (follow-up from 1 to 11.5 yr) and normal at neonatal screening were enrolled in the genetic study. In 11 cases, the relatives were included in the genetic analysis. Eleven different mutations of the TSHR gene were identified in 11 of the 38 patients. Two are new: the nonsense mutation C31X and the missense mutation P68S, which shows a decrease in TSH binding capacity but not in biological activity. In all cases the carrier parent was identified. To date, this study demonstrates the highest prevalence (29%) of TSHR gene mutations in children and adolescents with non-autoimmune subclinical hypothyroidism not selected by neonatal screening. Functional studies show that some mutations cause a slight inactivation of the TSHR. This reveals a possible limit of the in vitro study or of the knowledge of mechanisms involving TSHR, or that other candidate genes must be considered. 	J._Clin._Endocrinol._Metab.	D016428
11700365	20011109	Binding to sulfatide and enterotoxicity of various Escherichia coli STb mutants.	Binding of the 48 amino acid polypeptide of the mature heat-stable Escherichia coli enterotoxin b (STb) to the functional receptor sulfatide (SFT) constitutes the first step in inducing secretory diarrhoea in the intestinal lumen of animals. The NMR structure of this toxin dictated the choice of amino acids for site-directed mutagenesis to delineate the binding site of STb to SFT. Amino acids facing the solvent either in the loop or the hydrophobic alpha-helix were selected. Seventeen site-specific mutants of STb toxin were produced and purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Enterotoxicity of the 17 mutants was determined using a rat loop assay and binding was evaluated using a microtitre plate binding assay. Both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions are important for STb attachment. When mutations (F37K, I41S and M42S) were introduced into the hydrophobic alpha-helix to lessen hydrophobicity, binding activity and enterotoxicity decreased by more than sixfold. The loop defined by C21 and C36 also made specific contributions. Mutants generated at basic residues (K22, K23 and R29) within this region exhibited both reduced binding activities and reduced toxic activities. For all STb mutants constructed and analysed, when binding to SFT was reduced, a reduction in toxicity equivalent or greater was noted, indicating that binding to SFT is a step that precedes the toxic effect observed for STb toxin. Significantly, when the negatively charged D30 was substituted for either alanine or valine, the binding to SFT was about twice that of native STb, whereas the enterotoxicity was reduced by half.

19702578	20090826	Class I Rab11-family interacting proteins are binding targets for the Rab14 GTPase.	Rab11 and Rab14 are two related Rab GTPases that are believed to function in endosomal recycling and Golgi/endosome transport processes. We, and others, have identified a group of proteins that interact with Rab11 and function as Rab11 effectors, known as the Rab11-FIPs (family interacting proteins). This protein family has been sub-classified into two groups - class I FIPs [FIP2, RCP (Rab coupling protein) and Rip11 (Rab11-interacting protein)] and class II FIPs (FIP3 and FIP4). In the present study we identify the class I FIPs as dual Rab-binding proteins by demonstrating that they also interact with Rab14 in a GTP-dependent manner. We show that these interactions are specific for the class I FIPs and that they occur via their C-terminal regions, which encompass the previously described RBD (Rab11-binding domain). Furthermore, we show that Rab14 significantly co-localizes with the TfnR (transferrin receptor) and that Rab14 Q70L co-localizes with Rab11a and with the class I FIPs on the ERC (endosomal recycling compartment) during interphase. Additionally, we show that during cytokinesis Rab14 localizes to the cleavage furrow/midbody. The data presented in the present study, which identifies the class I FIPs as the first putative effector proteins for the Rab14 GTPase, indicates greater complexity in the Rab-binding specificity of the class I FIP proteins.

20619616	20100713	Searching for functional SNPs or rare variants in exonic regions of DRD3 in risperidone-treated patients.	Previously one intronic DRD3 SNP, rs167771, was associated with risperidone-induced extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS). The aim of the present study was to search hitherto unidentified common functional variants or rare variants, in DRD3 associated with risperidone-induced EPS. 126 subjects treated with risperidone participated in this study. We sequenced the seven exons of DRD3. After sequencing we localized five dbSNPs and four new rare variants. None of the dSNPs or rare variants seems to be functional after bioinformatics analysis. Our results suggest that, rather than exonic regions, regulatory regions and introns could be related to the associations reported for DRD3 and the incidence of locomotor side-effects.

24093224	20131008	Genome-wide transcriptional analysis of two soybean genotypes under dehydration and rehydration conditions.	Soybean is an important crop that provides valuable proteins and oils for human use. Because soybean growth and development is extremely sensitive to water deficit, quality and crop yields are severely impacted by drought stress. In the face of limited water resources, drought-responsive genes are therefore of interest. Identification and analysis of dehydration- and rehydration-inducible differentially expressed genes (DEGs) would not only aid elucidation of molecular mechanisms of stress response, but also enable improvement of crop stress tolerance via gene transfer. Using Digital Gene Expression Tag profiling (DGE), a new technique based on Illumina sequencing, we analyzed expression profiles between two soybean genotypes to identify drought-responsive genes. Two soybean genotypes - drought-tolerant Jindou21 and drought-sensitive Zhongdou33 - were subjected to dehydration and rehydration conditions. For analysis of DEGs under dehydration conditions, 20 cDNA libraries were generated from roots and leaves at two different time points under well-watered and dehydration conditions. We also generated eight libraries for analysis under rehydration conditions. Sequencing of the 28 libraries produced 25,000-33,000 unambiguous tags, which were mapped to reference sequences for annotation of expressed genes. Many genes exhibited significant expression differences among the libraries. DEGs in the drought-tolerant genotype were identified by comparison of DEGs among treatments and genotypes. In Jindou21, 518 and 614 genes were differentially expressed under dehydration in leaves and roots, respectively, with 24 identified both in leaves and roots. The main functional categories enriched in these DEGs were metabolic process, response to stresses, plant hormone signal transduction, protein processing, and plant-pathogen interaction pathway; the associated genes primarily encoded transcription factors, protein kinases, and other regulatory proteins. The seven most significantly expressed (|log2 ratio|???8) genes - Glyma15g03920, Glyma05g02470, Glyma15g15010, Glyma05g09070, Glyma06g35630, Glyma08g12590, and Glyma11g16000 - are more likely to determine drought stress tolerance. The expression patterns of eight randomly-selected genes were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR; the results of QRT-PCR analysis agreed with transcriptional profile data for 96 out of 128 (75%) data points. Many soybean genes were differentially expressed between drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive genotypes. Based on GO functional annotation and pathway enrichment analysis, some of these genes encoded transcription factors, protein kinases, and other regulatory proteins. The seven most significant DEGs are candidates for improving soybean drought tolerance. These findings will be helpful for analysis and elucidation of molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance; they also provide a basis for cultivating new varieties of drought-tolerant soybean.

23669388	20130515	Characterization of antiviral activity of benzamide derivative AH0109 against HIV-1 infection.	In the absence of an effective vaccine against HIV-1 infection, anti-HIV-1 strategies play a major role in disease control. However, the rapid emergence of drug resistance against all currently used anti-HIV-1 molecules necessitates the development of new antiviral molecules and/or strategies against HIV-1 infection. In this study, we have identified a benzamide derivative named AH0109 that exhibits potent anti-HIV-1 activity at an 50% effective concentration of 0.7 ?M in HIV-1-susceptible CD4(+) C8166 T cells. Mechanistic analysis revealed that AH0109 significantly inhibits both HIV-1 reverse transcription and viral cDNA nuclear import. Furthermore, our infection experiments indicated that AH0109 is capable of disrupting the replication of HIV-1 strains that are resistant to the routinely used anti-HIV-1 drugs zidovudine, lamivudine, nevirapine, and raltegravir. Together, these findings provide evidence for a newly identified antiviral molecule that can potentially be developed as an anti-HIV-1 agent. 	Antimicrob._Agents_Chemother.	D016428 D013485
23921803	20130808	Cloning and mutagenesis of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene from the gram-positive Planococcus sp. strain S5.	In this study, the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene that encodes a 307- amino-acid protein was cloned from Planococcus sp. S5. The protein was identified to be a member of the superfamily I, subfamily 2A of extradiol dioxygenases. In order to study residues and regions affecting the enzyme's catalytic parameters, the c23o gene was randomly mutated by error-prone PCR. The wild-type enzyme and mutants containing substitutions within either the C-terminal or both domains were functionally produced in Escherichia coli and their activity towards catechol was characterized. The C23OB65 mutant with R296Q substitution showed significant tolerance to acidic pH with an optimum at pH 5.0. In addition, it showed activity more than 1.5 as high as that of the wild type enzyme and its Km was 2.5 times lower. It also showed altered sensitivity to substrate inhibition. The results indicate that residue at position 296 plays a role in determining pH dependence of the enzyme and its activity. Lower activity toward catechol was shown for mutants C23OB58 and C23OB81. Despite lower activity, these mutants showed higher affinity to catechol and were more sensitive to substrate concentration than nonmutated enzyme. 	J._Mol._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428
15863042	20050503	The relevant effect of an intramolecular hydrogen bond on the conformational equilibrium of cis-3-methoxycyclohexanol compared to trans-3-methoxycyclohexanol and cis-1,3-dimethoxycyclohexane.	1H NMR data show that an increase in the concentration of cis-3-methoxycyclohexanol (cis-3-MCH) shifts the conformational equilibrium from the 1aa conformer, stabilized by an intramolecular hydrogen bond (IAHB), to the 1ee conformer [X(ee) = 44% (at 0.05 molL(-1)) to 59% (at 0.40 molL(-1)), in CCl4], which forms intermolecular hydrogen bonds (IEHB), as confirmed by IR data. The percentage of 1ee conformer increases with the solvent polarity, from 33% (DeltaG(ee-aa) = 1.72 kJmol(-1)) in cyclohexane (C6D12) to 97% (DeltaG(ee-aa) = -8.41 kJmol(-1)) in DMSO. For trans-3-methoxycyclohexanol (trans-3-MCH), 1ae and 1ea conformers are almost equally present in the studied solvents, 1ae increasing from 41%, in C6D12 (DeltaG(ae-ea) = 0.84 kJmol(-1)), to 49%, in DMSO (DeltaG(ae-ea) = 0.13 kJmol(-1)). A value of 18.4 kJmol(-1) for the strength of IAHB in cis-3-MCH was obtained, from the theoretical data, through the CBS-4M method. 	Spectrochim_Acta_A_Mol_Biomol_Spectrosc	D016428 D013485
25435355	20141202	Exome-wide mutation profile in benzo[a]pyrene-derived post-stasis and immortal human mammary epithelial cells.	Genetic mutations are known to drive cancer progression and certain tumors have mutation signatures that reflect exposures to environmental carcinogens. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) has a known mutation signature and has proven capable of inducing changes to DNA sequence that drives normal pre-stasis human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) past a first tumor suppressor barrier (stasis) and toward immortality. We analyzed normal, pre-stasis HMEC, three independent BaP-derived post-stasis HMEC strains (184Aa, 184Be, 184Ce) and two of their immortal derivatives(184A1 and 184BE1) by whole exome sequencing. The independent post-stasis strains exhibited between 93 and 233 BaP-induced mutations in exons. Seventy percent of the mutations were C:G&gt;A:T transversions, consistent with the known mutation spectrum of BaP. Mutations predicted to impact protein function occurred in several known and putative cancer drivers including p16, PLCG1, MED12, TAF1 in 184Aa; PIK3CG, HSP90AB1, WHSC1L1, LCP1 in 184Be and FANCA, LPP in 184Ce. Biological processes that typically harbor cancer driver mutations such as cell cycle, regulation of cell death and proliferation, RNA processing, chromatin modification and DNA repair were found to have mutations predicted to impact function in each of the post-stasis strains. Spontaneously immortalized HMEC lines derived from two of the BaP-derived post-stasis strains shared greater than 95% of their BaP-induced mutations with their precursor cells. These immortal HMEC had 10 or fewer additional point mutations relative to their post-stasis precursors, but acquired chromosomal anomalies during immortalization that arose independent of BaP. The results of this study indicate that acute exposures of HMEC to high dose BaP recapitulate mutation patterns of human tumors and can induce mutations in a number of cancer driver genes.

23544078	20130402	Constitutive expression of Yes-associated protein (Yap) in adult skeletal muscle fibres induces muscle atrophy and myopathy.	The aim of this study was to investigate the function of the Hippo pathway member Yes-associated protein (Yap, gene name Yap1) in skeletal muscle fibres in vivo. Specifically we bred an inducible, skeletal muscle fibre-specific knock-in mouse model (MCK-tTA-hYAP1 S127A) to test whether the over expression of constitutively active Yap (hYAP1 S127A) is sufficient to drive muscle hypertrophy or stimulate changes in fibre type composition. Unexpectedly, after 5-7 weeks of constitutive hYAP1 S127A over expression, mice suddenly and rapidly lost 20-25% body weight and suffered from gait impairments and kyphosis. Skeletal muscles atrophied by 34-40% and the muscle fibre cross sectional area decreased by ?40% when compared to control mice. Histological analysis revealed evidence of skeletal muscle degeneration and regeneration, necrotic fibres and a NADH-TR staining resembling centronuclear myopathy. In agreement with the histology, mRNA expression of markers of regenerative myogenesis (embryonic myosin heavy chain, Myf5, myogenin, Pax7) and muscle protein degradation (atrogin-1, MuRF1) were significantly elevated in muscles from transgenic mice versus control. No significant changes in fibre type composition were detected using ATPase staining. The phenotype was largely reversible, as a cessation of hYAP1 S127A expression rescued body and muscle weight, restored muscle morphology and prevented further pathological progression. To conclude, high Yap activity in muscle fibres does not induce fibre hypertrophy nor fibre type changes but instead results in a reversible atrophy and deterioration. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
22991685	20120920	Reactive Oxygen Species, SUMOylation, and Endothelial Inflammation.	Although the exact mechanism through which NADPH oxidases (Nox's) generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) is still not completely understood, it is widely considered that ROS accumulation is the cause of oxidative stress in endothelial cells. Increasing pieces of evidence strongly indicate the role for ROS in endothelial inflammation and dysfunction and subsequent development of atherosclerotic plaques, which are causes of various pathological cardiac events. An overview for a causative relationship between ROS and endothelial inflammation will be provided in this review. Particularly, a crucial role for specific protein SUMOylation in endothelial inflammation will be presented. Given that SUMOylation of specific proteins leads to increased endothelial inflammation, targeting specific SUMOylated proteins may be an elegant, effective strategy to control inflammation. In addition, the involvement of ROS production in increasing the risk of recurrent coronary events in a sub-group of non-diabetic, post-infarction patients with elevated levels of HDL-cholesterol will be presented with the emphasis that elevated HDL-cholesterol under certain inflammatory conditions can lead to increased incidence of cardiovascular events.

8615682	19960301	Reaction of wild-type C365S, and C458S saccharomyces cerevisiae phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinases with fluorescent iodoacetamide derivatives.	The reactivities of Cys365 and Cys458 of ATP-dependent Saccharomyces cerevisiae phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase against a range of sulfhydryl reagents have been investigated. The effect of pH on the second order reaction constants of N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide with mutant C458S and C365S PEP carboxykinases allowed the determination of pKa values of 9.4 and 9.1 for Cys365 and Cys458, respectively. The analysis of the inactivation rates of C458S and C365S mutant enzymes by several sulfhydryl reagents of different hydrophobicity showed that the microenvironment of these residues is rather polar. Anisotrophy measurements and acrylamide quenching experiments carried out with N-(iodoacetyl)-N'-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine-labeled mutant enzymes indicated a higher rotational freedom and solvent exposure for the probe linked to Cys458 than to Cys365. These findings point to differences in the protein microenvironments around Cys365 and Cys458 in S. cerevisiae PEP carboxykinase. A comparison of the results obtained with published data for GTP-dependent PEP carboxykinases, suggest significant differences for the protein region around the reactive cysteinyl residues in these enzymes.

10488121	19990917	The protein-tyrosine phosphatase TCPTP regulates epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent signaling.	In this study we have investigated the down-regulation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signaling by protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in COS1 cells. The 45-kDa variant of the PTP TCPTP (TC45) exits the nucleus upon EGF receptor activation and recognizes the EGF receptor as a cellular substrate. We report that TC45 inhibits the EGF-dependent activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but does not alter the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2. These data demonstrate that TC45 can regulate selectively mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways emanating from the EGF receptor. In EGF receptor-mediated signaling, the protein kinase PKB/Akt and the mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2, function downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). We have found that TC45 and the TC45-D182A mutant, which is capable of forming stable complexes with TC45 substrates, inhibit almost completely the EGF-dependent activation of PI 3-kinase and PKB/Akt. TC45 and TC45-D182A act upstream of PI 3-kinase, most likely by inhibiting the recruitment of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase by the EGF receptor. Recent studies have indicated that the EGF receptor can be activated in the absence of EGF following integrin ligation. We find that the integrin-mediated activation of PKB/Akt in COS1 cells is abrogated by the specific EGF receptor protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478, and that TC45 and TC45-D182A can inhibit activation of PKB/Akt following the attachment of COS1 cells to fibronectin. Thus, TC45 may serve as a negative regulator of growth factor or integrin-induced, EGF receptor-mediated PI 3-kinase signaling. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485 D013487
22668561	20120607	Two novel de novo mutations of KRT6A and KRT16 genes in two Chinese pachyonychia congenita pedigrees with fissured tongue or diffuse plantar keratoderma.	Mutations in the KRT6A or KRT16 gene cause pachyonychia congenita type 1 (PC-1), while mutations in KRT16 or KRT6C underlie focal palmoplantar keratoderma (FPPK). A new classification system of PC has been adopted based on the mutated gene. PC rarely presents the symptoms of diffuse plantar keratoderma. Mutation in the tail domain of keratins is rarely reported. PC combined with fissured tongue has never been described. To investigate the genotype-phenotype correlations between clinical features and gene mutational sites in two unrelated southern Chinese PC pedigrees (one family presented with specific fissured tongue, the other with diffuse plantar keratoderma). The whole coding regions of the KRT6A/KRT16/KRT17/KRT6B genes were amplified and directly sequenced to detect the mutation. To confirm the effect of the IVS8-2A&gt;C mutation in KRT6A at the mRNA level, total RNA from the plantar lesion of a patient was extracted and reverse-transcribed to cDNA for sequence analysis. Two novel de novo mutations, a splice acceptor site variant IVS8-2A&gt;C (p.S487FfsX72) in KRT6A and a heterozygous substitution c.AA373_374GG (p.N125G) within exon 1 of KRT16, were found separately in the two PC families. Genotype-phenotype correlations among PC patients with codon-125 mutation in KRT16 were established, while the phenotypes caused by the IVS8-2A&gt;C mutation in KRT6A need further studies to confirm the rare feature of fissured tongue.

21539976	20110505	Characterizing behavior of corpus cavernosum in chloride-free condition.	To elucidate the role of chloride currents in erectile function through characterizing the behavior of corpus cavernosum (CC) in chloride-free (Cf) medium, which has not been evaluated before. Isolated rabbit CC strips were suspended in thermo-regulated organ baths containing oxygenated Tyrode for isometric tension recording. Cf Tyrode was prepared by substituting sodium chloride, calcium chloride, and potassium chloride (KCl) with equivalent molar concentrations of sodium acetate, calcium acetate, and potassium acetate salts. Resting cavernosal tone and contractions by noradrenaline, histamine, and KCl were assessed in Cf Tyrode with or without chloride channel blockers, niflumic acid (NFA), and anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (A9C). Withdrawal of extracellular chloride caused myogenic contractions in the unstimulated CC strips (n = 18). In addition, peak contractions by noradrenaline (n = 14) and histamine (n = 13) were augmented in Cf buffer by 47.2 ? 5.9% and 85.4 ? 13.2%, respectively (P &lt;.05), whereas KCl contractions were not significantly altered (17.6 ? 4.6%; n = 7). Interestingly, Cf buffer exerted opposing effects, potentiation and reduction, respectively, on the plateau phase of contractions mediated by noradrenaline and histamine. The stimulatory effect of Cf buffer on the intrinsic myogenic tone was diminished by NFA (30 ?M), and A9C (300 ?M-1 mM). NFA (30-100 ?M), however, specifically reduced the plateau phase without significantly modifying the peak contraction of noradrenaline in Cf buffer. These results reiterate the importance of chloride currents as a mechanism underlying the maintenance of penile cavernosal tone. Thus, chloride channel could be an effective alternative target to regulate penile erection. 	Urology	D016428
24141193	20131022	The Fic protein Doc uses an inverted substrate to phosphorylate and inactivate EF-Tu.	Fic proteins are ubiquitous in all of the domains of life and have critical roles in multiple cellular processes through AMPylation of (transfer of AMP to) target proteins. Doc from the doc-phd toxin-antitoxin module is a member of the Fic family and inhibits bacterial translation by an unknown mechanism. Here we show that, in contrast to having AMPylating activity, Doc is a new type of kinase that inhibits bacterial translation by phosphorylating the conserved threonine (Thr382) of the translation elongation factor EF-Tu, rendering EF-Tu unable to bind aminoacylated tRNAs. We provide evidence that EF-Tu phosphorylation diverged from AMPylation by antiparallel binding of the NTP relative to the catalytic residues of the conserved Fic catalytic core of Doc. The results bring insights into the mechanism and role of phosphorylation of EF-Tu in bacterial physiology as well as represent an example of the catalytic plasticity of enzymes and a mechanism for the evolution of new enzymatic activities.

25661869	20150210	Rab40C is a novel Varp-binding protein that promotes proteasomal degradation of Varp in melanocytes.	Varp (VPS9-ankyrin repeat protein) was originally identified as an activator of small GTPase Rab21 through its VPS9 domain, but it has subsequently been shown to function as a Rab32/38 effector through its first ANKR1 domain. Although these functions of Varp are important for melanogenesis, Varp contains a second ANKR2 domain, whose function remained completely unknown. Here we identified Rab40C, an atypical Rab containing a SOCS box that recruits a ubiquitin ligase complex, as a novel ANKR2-binding protein and investigated its involvement in melanogenic enzyme trafficking in melanocytes. The results showed that overexpression of Rab40C in melanocytes caused a dramatic reduction in melanogenic enzyme Tyrp1 signals by promoting proteasomal degradation of Varp in a SOCS-box-dependent manner and that knockdown of Rab40C in melanocytes caused an increase in the amount of Varp. Intriguingly, Rab40C knockdown also caused a dramatic reduction in Tyrp1 signals, the same as Varp overexpression did. These findings indicated that Rab40C is a previously unexpected regulator of Tyrp1 trafficking in melanocytes through controlling the proteasomal degradation of Varp. 	Biol_Open	D016428
16453014	20060203	SIDS: genetic and environmental influences may cause arrhythmia in this silent killer.	In this issue of the JCI, Bowers et al. show that the common polymorphism of the cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel, type Valpha (SCN5A), designated S1103Y, found in African Americans is associated with an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Wild-type and mutant SCN5A channels both functioned typically under normal conditions in vitro, but exposure to acidic intracellular pH levels such as those found in respiratory acidosis--a known risk factor for SIDS--produced abnormal gain-of-function late reopenings of S1103Y channels, behavior that is often associated with cardiac arrhythmias. These pathologic late reopenings were suppressed by low levels of the channel-blocking drug mexiletine. These findings provide an excellent illustration of a causal relationship between the interaction of the environment and genetic background in SIDS and also raise interesting questions about the linkage of a genetic abnormality with a clinical phenotype.

8195074	19940601	A role for residue 151 of LamB in bacteriophage lambda adsorption: possible steric effect of amino acid substitutions.	LamB is the cell surface receptor for bacteriophage lambda. LamB missense mutations yielding resistance to lambda have been previously grouped in two classes. Class I mutants block growth of lambda with wild-type host range (lambda h+) but support growth of one-step extended-host-range mutants (lambda h). Class II mutants block lambda h but support growth of two-step extended host range mutants (lambda hh*). While Class I mutations occur at 11 different amino acid sites, in five distinct portions of LamB, all the Class II mutations analyzed previously correspond to the same G-to-D change at amino acid 151. We generated by in vitro mutagenesis four different new substitutions at site 151 (to S, V, R, and C). Two of the mutants (G-151--&gt;V [G151V] and G151R) were of Class II, while the two others (G151S and G151C) were of Class I, demonstrating that not only the site but also the nature of the substitutions at residue 151 was critical for the phage sensitivity phenotypes. The introduction of a negatively charged, a positively charged, or an aliphatic nonpolar residue at site 151 of LamB prevented both lambda h+ and lambda h adsorption, indicating that the block is not due to a charge effect. In contrast to G151D, which was sensitive to all the lambda hh* phages, G151V and G151R conferred sensitivity to only four of the five lambda hh* phages. Thus, G151V and G151R represent a new subclass of Class II LamB mutations that is more restrictive with respect to the growth of lambda hh*. Our results agree with the hypothesis that residue 151 belongs to an accessibility gate controlling the access to the phage tight-binding site and that substitutions at this residue affect the access of the phage to the binding site in relation to the size of the substitute side chain (surface area): the most restrictive changes are G151V and G151R, followed to a lesser extent by G151D and they by G151S and G151C.

20011240	20091217	Feature selection and classification of MAQC-II breast cancer and multiple myeloma microarray gene expression data.	Microarray data has a high dimension of variables but available datasets usually have only a small number of samples, thereby making the study of such datasets interesting and challenging. In the task of analyzing microarray data for the purpose of, e.g., predicting gene-disease association, feature selection is very important because it provides a way to handle the high dimensionality by exploiting information redundancy induced by associations among genetic markers. Judicious feature selection in microarray data analysis can result in significant reduction of cost while maintaining or improving the classification or prediction accuracy of learning machines that are employed to sort out the datasets. In this paper, we propose a gene selection method called Recursive Feature Addition (RFA), which combines supervised learning and statistical similarity measures. We compare our method with the following gene selection methods: Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVMRFE), Leave-One-Out Calculation Sequential Forward Selection (LOOCSFS), Gradient based Leave-one-out Gene Selection (GLGS). To evaluate the performance of these gene selection methods, we employ several popular learning classifiers on the MicroArray Quality Control phase II on predictive modeling (MAQC-II) breast cancer dataset and the MAQC-II multiple myeloma dataset. Experimental results show that gene selection is strictly paired with learning classifier. Overall, our approach outperforms other compared methods. The biological functional analysis based on the MAQC-II breast cancer dataset convinced us to apply our method for phenotype prediction. Additionally, learning classifiers also play important roles in the classification of microarray data and our experimental results indicate that the Nearest Mean Scale Classifier (NMSC) is a good choice due to its prediction reliability and its stability across the three performance measurements: Testing accuracy, MCC values, and AUC errors.

22804629	20120719	Structural switching of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutases at loop VI: insights from the crystal structure of 2-mercaptoethanol-modified enzyme.	Cu,Zn SOD1 (superoxide dismutase 1) is implicated in FALS (familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) through the accumulation of misfolded proteins that are toxic to neuronal cells. Loop VI (residues 102-115) of the protein is at the dimer interface and could play a critical role in stability. The free cysteine residue, Cys111 in the loop, is readily oxidized and alkylated. We have found that modification of this Cys111 with 2-ME (2-mercaptoethanol; 2-ME-SOD1) stabilizes the protein and the mechanism may provide insights into destabilization and the formation of aggregated proteins. Here, we determined the crystal structure of 2-ME-SOD1 and find that the 2-ME moieties in both subunits interact asymmetrically at the dimer interface and that there is an asymmetric configuration of segment Gly108 to Cys111 in loop VI. One loop VI of the dimer forms a 310-helix (Gly108 to His110) within a unique ?-bridge stabilized by a hydrogen bond between Ser105-NH and His110-CO, while the other forms a ?-turn without the H-bond. The H-bond (H-type) and H-bond free (F-type) configurations are also seen in some wild-type and mutant human SOD1s in the Protein Data Bank suggesting that they are interconvertible and an intrinsic property of SOD1s. The two structures serve as a basis for classification of these proteins and hopefully a guide to their stability and role in pathophysiology. 	Biosci._Rep.	D016428 D013485

17187507	20061226	Ethnicity-related polymorphisms and haplotypes in the human ABCB1 gene.	The human multidrug resistance gene ATP-binding cassette B1 (ABCB1) codes for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an important membrane-bound efflux transporter known to confer anticancer drug resistance as well as affect the pharmacokinetics of many drugs and xenobiotics. A number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified throughout the ABCB1 gene that may have an effect on P-gp expression levels and function. Haplotype as well as genotype analysis of SNPs is becoming increasingly important in identifying genetic variants underlying susceptibility to human disease. Three SNPs, 1236C--&gt;T, 2677G--&gt;T and 3435C--&gt;T, have been repeatedly shown to predict changes in the function of P-gp. The frequencies with which these polymorphisms exist in a population have also been shown to be ethnically related. In this study, 95 individuals representative of the entire ethnic make-up of the USA were compared with 101 individuals from an Ashkenazi-Jewish population. These individuals were analyzed by genomic sequencing and polymerase chain reaction, using restriction fragment length polymorphisms, to calculate their genotype frequencies. A total of 25 SNPs were located in the exons of the ABCB1 gene. All of the polymorphisms identified were in parts of the ABCB1 gene product predicted to be intracellular, and 16 appear to be novel as compared with those listed by the National Center for Biotechnological Information. Frequencies of the 1236C--&gt;T and 2677G--&gt;T/A/C SNPs were similar for the US and Ashkenazi populations (64.2 and 60.4%, respectively for 1236C--&gt;T [chi2: 0.30; p &lt; or = 1]; 55.8 and 64.4%, respectively for 2677G--&gt;T/A/C [chi2: 1.49; p &lt; or = 1]), but were different for 3435C--&gt;T (24.2% for the US population and 69.3% for the Ashkenazi population [chi2: 39.927; p &lt; or = 0.001]). The 1236T/ 2677T/3435T haplotype occurred in 23.6% (standard error: 0.013) of the Ashkenazi population. The SNP at location 3435C--&gt;T plays a significant role in the ABCB1 gene. The haplotype and genotype analysis from these data may be used as a basis for studies on the relationship between ABCB1 genotypes and drug efficacy, drug toxicity, disease susceptibility or other phenotypes.

18320024	20080306	The human TPR protein TTC4 is a putative Hsp90 co-chaperone which interacts with CDC6 and shows alterations in transformed cells.	The human TTC4 protein is a TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat) motif-containing protein. The gene was originally identified as being localized in a genomic region linked to breast cancer and subsequent studies on melanoma cell lines revealed point mutations in the TTC4 protein that may be associated with the progression of malignant melanoma. Here we show that TTC4 is a nucleoplasmic protein which interacts with HSP90 and HSP70, and also with the replication protein CDC6. It has significant structural and functional similarities with a previously characterised Drosophila protein Dpit47. We show that TTC4 protein levels are raised in malignant melanoma cell lines compared to melanocytes. We also see increased TTC4 expression in a variety of tumour lines derived from other tissues. In addition we show that TTC4 proteins bearing some of the mutations previously identified from patient samples lose their interaction with the CDC6 protein. Based on these results and our previous work with the Drosophila Dpit47 protein we suggest that TTC4 is an HSP90 co-chaperone protein which forms a link between HSP90 chaperone activity and DNA replication. We further suggest that the loss of the interaction with CDC6 or with additional client proteins could provide one route through which TTC4 could influence malignant development of cells.

12746437	20030515	Defective discoidin domain structure, subunit assembly, and endoplasmic reticulum processing of retinoschisin are primary mechanisms responsible for X-linked retinoschisis.	Retinoschisin is a 24-kDa discoidin domain-containing protein that is secreted from photoreceptor and bipolar cells as a large disulfide-linked multisubunit complex. It functions as a cell adhesion protein to maintain the cellular organization and synaptic structure of the retina. Over 125 different mutations in the RS1 gene are associated with X-linked juvenile retinoschisis, the most common form of early onset macular degeneration in males. To identify molecular determinants important for retinoschisin structure and function and elucidate molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for X-linked juvenile retinoschisis, we have analyzed the expression, protein folding, disulfide-linked subunit assembly, intracellular localization, and secretion of wild-type retinoschisin, 15 Cys-to-Ser variants and 12 disease-linked mutants. Our studies, together with molecular modeling of the discoidin domain, identify Cys residues involved in intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds essential for protein folding and subunit assembly. We show that misfolding of the discoidin domain, defective disulfide-linked subunit assembly, and inability of retinoschisin to insert into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane as part of the protein secretion process are three primary mechanisms responsible for the loss in the function of retinoschisin as a cell adhesion protein and the pathogenesis of X-linked juvenile retinoschisis.

27591539	20160904	Evaluation of a blood-specific DNA methylated region and trial for allele-specific blood identification from mixed body fluid DNA.	The identification of blood samples obtained from crime scenes has been an important step in forensic investigation. Recently, a novel approach using the blood-specific methylated CpG site cg06379435 has been reported. In this study, we developed a real-time polymerase-chain-reaction-based method that can simply and rapidly quantitate the methylation ratio of cg06379435 and its neighboring CpGs and set the threshold ratios for blood identification by analyzing various body fluid samples. Blood identification using the thresholds was successfully performed in the analysis of a small amount (1ng) of DNA from blood and various aged blood samples, including 29-year-old stains. We also demonstrated a test for allele-specific blood identification from a mixed DNA sample by bisulfite sequencing analysis of these CpG sites and their neighboring single nucleotide polymorphism, rs7359943 (A/G), which is of relevance in cases where mixed samples are obtained from crime scenes. The stability of DNA methylation in aged samples and the usefulness of neighboring genetic information shown in this study suggest that DNA-methylation-based body fluid identification will play a major role in future forensic investigations.

20809970	20100903	Promoter methylation and large intragenic rearrangements of DPYD are not implicated in severe toxicity to 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy in gastrointestinal cancer patients.	Severe toxicity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) based chemotherapy in gastrointestinal cancer has been associated with constitutional genetic alterations of the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene (DPYD). In this study, we evaluated DPYD promoter methylation through quantitative methylation-specific PCR and screened DPYD for large intragenic rearrangements in peripheral blood from 45 patients with gastrointestinal cancers who developed severe 5-FU toxicity. DPYD promoter methylation was also assessed in tumor tissue from 29 patients Two cases with the IVS14+1G &gt; A exon 14 skipping mutation (c.1905+1G &gt; A), and one case carrying the 1845 G &gt; T missense mutation (c.1845G &gt; T) in the DPYD gene were identified. However, DPYD promoter methylation and large DPYD intragenic rearrangements were absent in all cases analyzed. Our results indicate that DPYD promoter methylation and large intragenic rearrangements do not contribute significantly to the development of 5-FU severe toxicity in gastrointestinal cancer patients, supporting the need for additional studies on the mechanisms underlying genetic susceptibility to severe 5-FU toxicity.

18787525	20080913	FTO polymorphisms are associated with obesity but not diabetes risk in postmenopausal women.	The FTO gene was recently identified as a susceptibility locus for both obesity and type 2 diabetes by whole-genome association analyses of several European populations. We tested for an association between FTO risk alleles and obesity and diabetes in a well-characterized multiethnic cohort of postmenopausal women in the United States. We genotyped two most significantly associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs9939609 and rs8050136) in intron 1 of FTO gene in a nested case-control study of 1,517 diabetes cases and 2,123 controls from the Women's Health Initiative-Observational Study (WHI-OS). The allelic frequencies of either rs9939609 or rs8050136 differed widely across four ethnic groups. The frequency of the rare allele A of rs9939609 among controls was much lower in Asians/Pacific Islanders (17%) than in blacks (45%), whites (40%), and Hispanics (31%). We found significant associations of rs9939609 with BMI and waist circumference in white and Hispanic women, but not among black and Asian/Pacific Islander women. On average, each copy of the risk-allele A at rs9939609 was significantly associated with 0.45 kg/m(2) increase in BMI (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16-0.74; P = 0.004) and 0.97 cm increase in waist circumference (95% CI: 0.21-0.65; P = 0.0002). Similar results were observed for rs8050136. However, we found no significant genetic associations with diabetes risk, either within the full study sample or in any ethnic group. In conclusion, common genetic variants in the intron 1 of FTO gene may confer a modest susceptibility to obesity in an ethnicity-specific manner, but may be unlikely to contribute to a clinically significant diabetes risk.

26819710	20160129	Interleukin 20 regulates dendritic cell migration and expression of co-stimulatory molecules.	Psoriasis is an inflammatory disease characterized by leukocyte skin infiltration. Interestingly, recent works suggest that the migration of dendritic cells (DCs) is abnormal in psoriatic skin. DCs have significant role in regulating the function of T lymphocytes, at least in part influenced by the local environment of cytokines. In psoriatic skin lesions the expression of IL-20 is highly up-regulated. It is unclear if this cytokine has any influence on DCs. Here, we investigated the influence of IL-20 in monocyte-derived dendritic cell (MDDCs) in vitro. This work addressed IL-20 effects on DC maturation, receptor expression and signaling. By use of extra cellular matrix components mimicking the skin environment, we also studied the functional effects of IL-20 on the chemotactic migration of DCs. Based on the recent finding that CD18 integrin are shed during migration of myeloid leukocytes, the concentration of these adhesion molecules was measured in MDDCs culture supernatants post migration. Following stimulation with IL-20, immature human MDDCs enhanced the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD86, further enabling activation of the p38 MAPK, but not the STAT3, pathway. IL-20 increased the migration of MDDCs in a biphasic response narrowly controlled by the interleukin concentration. A concomitant change in the shedding of CD18 integrins suggested that these adhesion molecules play a role in the migration of the MDDCs through the extracellular matrix layer. Taken together, our findings points to a possible, yet subtle, role of IL-20 in DCs migration. The biphasic response suggests that the aberrant IL-20 expression in psoriasis impedes DC migration, which could be a part of the processes that precipitates the dysregulated inflammatory response associated with this disease.

7811233	19941230	Alterations of binding mode and cutting site by G--&gt;I replacement in preferred cleavage sequences 5'-AGG of chromoprotein C-1027.	Replacement of guanosine by inosine at the center position of a target trinucleotide 5'-AGG resulted in greatly diminished DNA cleavage by C-1027 chromophore, indicating that the guanine 2-amino group significantly participates to DNA binding and cleavage by the chromophore of C-1027. This notion was supported by fluorescence titrations of the chromophore with [poly(dG-dC)]2 and [poly(dI-dC)]2. In preferred cleavage sequence 5'-AGG of the enediyne chromophore of C-1027, the G--&gt;I substitution clearly induces change of DNA binding mode and cutting site. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.

17805195	20070907	Effect of the Ala12 allele in the PPARgamma-2 gene on the relationship between birth weight and body composition in adolescents: the AVENA study.	The intent of this study was to assess whether the effect of birth weight on later body composition is modified by Pro12Pro, Pro12Ala, and Ala12Ala genotypes of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-2 (PPARgamma-2) gene. The PPARgamma-2 gene polymorphism was genotyped in 273 adolescents aged 13-18.5 y, born at term and whose birth weight was known. They were selected from a cross-sectional multicenter study conducted in five Spanish cities in 2000-2002. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from weight and height measurements, and body composition and fat distribution were estimated from skinfold thickness. A total of 229 subjects (111 males and 118 females) carried the Pro12Pro genotype and 44 (22 males and 22 females) the Pro12Ala and Ala12Ala PPARgamma-2 genotypes. In the Pro12Pro group, birth weight Z score was positively associated with both fat-free mass (FFM) (p &lt; 0.05) and fat mass (FM) (p &lt; 0.05), but these relationships disappeared after controlling for age, gestational age, socioeconomic status (SES), physical activity, Tanner stage, sex, and BMI. In the Ala12 group, birth weight Z score was positively associated with FFM (p &lt; 0.01), and this relationship remained significant after controlling for confounding variables (p &lt; 0.05). Small body weight at birth may program lower FFM in adolescents carrying the Ala12 allele in the PPARgamma-2 gene. 	Pediatr._Res.	D016428 D016448 D013485
1911886	19910923	Conformational energy analysis of the substitution of Val for Gly 233 in a functional region of platelet GPIb alpha in platelet-type von Willebrand disease.	Platelet-type von Willebrand disease (PT-vWD) is an autosomal dominant bleeding disorder in which patient platelets exhibit an abnormally increased binding of circulating von Willebrand factor (vWF). We have recently shown that this abnormality is associated with a point mutation resulting in substitution of Val for Gly 233 in platelet membrane glycoprotein Ib alpha (GPIb alpha), a major component of the platelet GPIb/IX receptor for vWF. To investigate the effect of this substitution on the three-dimensional structure of this region of the protein, we have generated the allowed (low energy) conformations of the region of the GPI alpha protein containing residues 228-238 (with 5 residues on either side of the critical residue 233) with Gly 233 (wild type) and Val 233 (PT-vWD) using the computer program ECEPP (Empirical Conformational Energies of Peptides Program). The wild-type sequence is Tyr-Val-Trp-Lys-Gln-Gly-Val-Asp-Val-Lys-Ala. We find that the Gly 233-containing peptide can exist in two low energy conformers. The lowest energy conformer is a structure containing a beta-turn at Gln 232-Gly 233 while the alternative conformation is an amphipathic helical structure. Only the amphipathic helical structure is allowed for the Val 233-containing peptide which contains a hydrophobic 'face' consisting of Val 229, Val 233 and Val 236 and another hydrophilic surface composed of such residues as Lys 231 and Asp 235. No such surfaces exist for the lowest energy bend conformer for the Gly 233-containing peptide, but do exist in the higher energy helical structure. The amphipathic surfaces in the 228-238 region of the Val 233-containing GPIb alpha protein may associate strongly with complementary surfaces during vWF binding to the GPIb/IX receptor complex and may help explain heightened association of vWF with this receptor in PT-vWD.

10824601	20000529	Photocurrent from oriented membrane films containing acid-blue and acid-purple bacteriorhodopsin and its mutants.	This paper investigates the fast photocurrent components, B1 and B2, from oriented bacteriorhodopsin (BR) membrane films at low pH, under pulsed laser excitation. Adding chloride ion changes the acid-blue BR to its acid-purple form. In the presence of chloride, the acid-purple BR shows a positive B2 component in the same direction as that of BR at neutral pH, indicating a rapid intramolecular charge transfer. In the absence of chloride, the acid-blue BR shows only a negative B1 with multi-components, indicating a rapid charge separation process associated with retinal photoisomerization. The multi-components in B1 are possibly formed due to the heterogeneity of the acid-blue BR. In addition, BR mutants, D85N and D115N, at low pH and in the presence of chloride, generate the B2 component as well. The observation of chloride-dependent B2 component in various cases at low pH, is in favor of a possible transient chloride ion transfer, although the nature of the charge being transferred cannot be identified so far.

24071855	20130928	Investigation of MGMT and DAPK1 methylation patterns in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma using allelic MSP-pyrosequencing.	The tumor suppressor genes MGMT and DAPK1 become methylated in several cancers including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, allelic methylation patterns have not been investigated in DLBCL. We developed a fast and cost-efficient method for the analysis of allelic methylation based on pyrosequencing of methylation specific PCR (MSP) products including a SNP. Allelic methylation patterns were reliably analyzed in standards of known allelic methylation status even when diluted in unmethylated DNA to below 1% methylation. When studying 148 DLBCL patients MGMT and DAPK1 methylation was observed in 19% and 89%, respectively, and among methylated and heterozygous patients 29% and 55%, respectively, were biallelically methylated. An association between the T-allele of the rs16906252 SNP and MGMT methylation was observed (p-value=0.04), and DAPK1 methylation of the A-allele was associated with shorter overall survival (p-value=0.006). In future cancer research allelic MSP-pyrosequencing may be used to study a wide range of other loci. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D013485
10964705	20000831	Crystal structures of the ribonuclease MC1 from bitter gourd seeds, complexed with 2'-UMP or 3'-UMP, reveal structural basis for uridine specificity.	Ribonuclease MC1 (RNase MC1) isolated from seeds of bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) consists of 190 amino acids and is characterized by a preferential cleavage at the 5'-side of uridine. This uridine specificity distinguishes RNase MC1 from other enzymes belonging to the RNase T2 family. The three-dimensional structures of RNase MC1, in a complex with either 2'-UMP or 3'-UMP, were determined at 1.48 and 1.77 A resolutions, respectively. The side chains of Gln9 and Asn71 interact with O4 and N3, respectively, of the uracil base by hydrogen bondings. In addition, the uracil base is sandwiched by the hydrophobic side chains of Leu73 and Phe80. Compared with these amino acid residues and corresponding residues in RNases in the RNase T2 family, Gln9 and Phe80 are highly conserved in the RNases in T2 family, while Asn71 and Leu73 in RNase MC1 are variant in sequences. It is thus likely that interactions of the side chains of Asn71 and Leu73 with the uracil base are responsible for the absolute uridine specificity of RNase MC1. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed that replacement of Asn by Thr decreased both the catalytic efficiency and the binding affinity by 2.3- and 7.0-fold, respectively, and substitution of Leu73 for Ala predominantly decreased the binding affinity by 14. 5-fold, compared with findings in case of wild-type RNase MC1. It is thus demonstrated that Asn71 and Leu73 play an essential role in uridine preference for RNase MC1. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.	D016428 D013485
9882287	19990109	Addition of a missense mutation present in the L gene of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cpts530/1030 to RSV vaccine candidate cpts248/404 increases its attenuation and temperature sensitivity.	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cpts530/1030 is an attenuated, temperature-sensitive subgroup A vaccine candidate derived previously from cold-passaged RSV (cpRSV) by two sequential rounds of chemical mutagenesis and biological selection. Here, cpts530/1030 was shown to be highly attenuated in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of seronegative chimpanzees. However, evaluation in seropositive children showed that it retains sufficient replicative capacity and virulence to preclude its direct use as a live attenuated vaccine. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the genome of cpts530/1030 showed that it had acquired two nucleotide substitutions (compared to its cpts530 parent), both of which were in the L gene: a silent mutation at nucleotide position 8821 (amino acid 108) and a missense mutation at nucleotide position 12458 resulting in a tyrosine-to-asparagine change at amino acid 1321, herein referred to as the 1030 mutation. It also contained the previously identified 530 missense mutation at nucleotide 10060 in the L gene. The genetic basis of attenuation of cpts530/1030 was defined by the introduction of the 530 and 1030 mutations into a cDNA clone of cpRSV, from which recombinant RSV was derived and analyzed to determine the contribution of each mutation to the temperature sensitivity (ts) and attenuation (att) phenotypes of cpts530/1030. The 530 mutation, derived from cpts530, was previously shown to be responsible for the ts and att phenotypes of that virus. In the present study, the 1030 mutation was shown to be responsible for the increased temperature sensitivity of cpts530/1030. In addition, the 1030 mutation was shown to be responsible for the increased level of attenuation of cpts530/1030 in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of mice. The 530 and 1030 mutations were additive in their effects on the ts and att phenotypes. It was possible to introduce the 1030 mutation, but not the 530 mutation, into an attenuated vaccine candidate with residual reactogenicity in very young infants, namely, cpts248/404, by use of reverse genetics. The inability to introduce the 530 mutation into the cpts248/404 virus was shown to be due to its incompatibility with the 248 missense mutation at the level of L protein function. The resulting rA2cp248/404/1030 mutant virus was more temperature sensitive and more attenuated than the cpts248/404 parent virus, making it a promising new RSV vaccine candidate created by use of reverse genetics to improve upon an existing vaccine virus.

16763049	20060610	Identification of bifunctional delta12/omega3 fatty acid desaturases for improving the ratio of omega3 to omega6 fatty acids in microbes and plants.	We report the identification of bifunctional Delta12/omega3 desaturases from Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium graminearum, and Magnaporthe grisea. The bifunctional activity of these desaturases distinguishes them from all known Delta12 or omega3 fatty acid desaturases. The omega3 desaturase activity of these enzymes also shows a broad omega6 fatty acid substrate specificity by their ability to convert linoleic acid (LA), gamma-linolenic acid, di-homo-gamma-linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid to the omega3 fatty acids, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), stearidonic acid, eicosatetraenoic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that omega3 desaturases arose by independent gene duplication events from a Delta12 desaturase ancestor. Expression of F. moniliforme Delta12/omega3 desaturase resulted in high ALA content in both Yarrowia lipolytica, an oleaginous yeast naturally deficient in omega3 desaturation, and soybean. In soybean, seed-specific expression resulted in 70.9 weight percent of total fatty acid (%TFA) ALA in a transformed seed compared with 10.9%TFA in a null segregant seed and 53.2%TFA in the current best source of ALA, linseed oil. The ALA/LA ratio in transformed seed was 22.3, a 110- and 7-fold improvement over the null segregant seed and linseed oil, respectively. Thus, these desaturases have potential for producing nutritionally desirable omega3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as EPA, with a significantly improved ratio of omega3/omega6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in both oilseeds and oleaginous microbes.

26161813	20150711	Results of an abbreviated phase-II study with the Akt Inhibitor MK-2206 in Patients with Advanced Biliary Cancer.	Biliary cancers (BC) are rare, chemoresistant and are associated with a poor prognosis. Targeting the Akt pathway is of significance in BC. We hypothesized that the allosteric inhibitor MK-2206 will be active in BC. This was a multi-institutional phase II study of MK-2206 given to patients with advanced, refractory BC. The primary end point was overall response rate. We also characterized pharmacokinetic profiles of MK-2206 in these patients and explored its potential correlation with clinical outcomes. Eight patients were enrolled prior to early termination of the trial. All patients had received prior systemic therapy. The best response observed was stable disease, exceeding 12 weeks in two patients. Toxicities were mild and tolerable. MK-2206 exhibited a pharmacokinetic profile with an apparent slow absorption followed by biphasic elimination in these patients with BC. No significant association was observed between the pharmacokinetic properties of MK-2206 and clinical outcomes. MK-2206 as a single-agent in BC is tolerable with pharmacokinetic properties similar to patients with other solid tumors. No clinical activity was observed in this limited population. Further development of Akt inhibitors may need to focus on combinations with other molecular targeted agents, conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy and prospective patient selection.

24420545	20140115	Role for germline mutations and a rare coding single nucleotide polymorphism within the KCNJ5 potassium channel in a large cohort of sporadic cases of primary aldosteronism.	Primary aldosteronism (autonomous aldosterone production with suppressed renin) plays an important pathophysiological role in what has been previously labeled as essential hypertension. Besides the recently described germline mutations in the KCNJ5 potassium channel associated with familial primary aldosteronism, somatic mutations in the same channel have been identified within aldosterone-producing adenomas. In this study, we have resequenced the flanking and coding region of KCNJ5 in peripheral blood DNA from 251 white subjects with primary aldosteronism to look for rare variants that might be important for the pathophysiology of sporadic primary aldosteronism. We have identified 3 heterozygous missense mutations (R52H, E246K, and G247R) in the cohort and found that 12 (5% of the cohort) were carriers for the rare nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism rs7102584 causing E282Q substitution of KCNJ5. By expressing the channels in Xenopus oocytes and human adrenal H295R cells, we have shown that the R52H, E246K, and E282Q substitutions are functional, but the G247R mutation is indistinguishable from wild type. Although the functional substitutions are remote from the selectivity filter, they affect the inward-rectification, the ability of the KCNJ5 channels to conduct Na(+) currents and ATII-induced aldosterone release from the H295R cell line. Together these data suggest that germline variation in the KCNJ5 gene has a role to play in the common sporadic form as well as the much rarer syndromic forms of primary aldosteronism.

19949035	20091202	Autosomal recessive Bethlem myopathy.	Bethlem myopathy is a well-defined clinical entity among collagen VI disorders, featuring proximal muscle weakness and contractures of the fingers, wrists, and ankles. It is an early-onset, slowly progressive, and relatively mild disease, invariably associated to date with heterozygous dominant mutations in the 3 collagen VI genes. We have characterized the clinical, laboratory, and genetic features of autosomal recessive Bethlem myopathy in 2 unrelated patients. This study is based on clinical, histochemical, immunocytochemical, and electron microscope evaluation of the muscle and dermal fibroblasts, CT imaging of the muscles, and biochemical and molecular analysis. Both patients carry a truncating COL6A2 mutation (Q819X; R366X) associated with missense changes in the partnering allele lying within the C2 domain of the alpha2(VI) chain (D871N; R843W-R830Q). They show decreased amounts of collagen VI in the basal lamina of muscle fibers and in dermal fibroblast cultures and altered behavior of collagen VI tetramers. Biochemical studies supported the pathogenic effect of identified amino acid substitutions, which involve strictly conserved residues. The reported patients illustrate the occurrence of Bethlem myopathy with a recessive mode of inheritance. This observation completes the hereditary pattern in collagen VI myopathies with both Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy and Bethlem myopathy underlined by either recessive or dominant effecting mutations. This finding has relevant implications for genetic counseling and molecular characterization of patients with Bethlem myopathy, as well as for genotype-phenotype correlations in collagen VI disorders.

23086275	20121023	High FLT3 expression and IL10 (G1082A) polymorphism in poor overall survival in calla acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia presenting the immunophenotypic marker CD10+?(calla), usually has treatment profile good. The FLT3 molecular marker is listed as a prognostic factor, an important leukaemogenic marker in acute leukemias, also the polymorphism (G1082A) of the IL10 interleukin can to present pleiotropic effects in many diseases and could is associated to development of ALL. However, the FLT3 expression is variability among patients with calla-ALL. The aim of this study was to determine the FLT3 expression, to associate with the genotypes and allelic of G1082A (IL10) in 50 patients with calla-ALL and assess the overall survival at 98?months follow-up. The expression was assessed by quantitative real time PCR (RT-PCR), the G1082A polymorphism was identified by allele-specific PCR and for immunophenotypic classification was used specific markers of B lineage-calla. We observed that patients who died showed higher FLT3 expression (p?=?0.005), worse survival (p?=?0.0137) and the IL10G allele may favor the survival, because the IL10 GG and IL10 GA genotypes showed a low FLT3 expression (p?&lt;?0.05).

22334096	20120216	N-succinylaspart-1-yl celecoxib is a potential colon-specific prodrug of celecoxib with improved therapeutic properties.	To develop a colon-specific prodrug of celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor, which could improve cardiovascular toxicity and therapeutic effectiveness for chemoprevention of colorectal cancer, aspart-1-yl celecoxib (A1C) or aspart-4-yl celecoxib (A4C), succinyl celecoxib (SC), and N-succinylaspart-1-yl celecoxib (SA1C) or N-succinylaspart-4-yl celecoxib (SA4C) were prepared and evaluated as a prodrug with such beneficial properties. On incubation with the small intestinal contents while SC, SA1C, and SA4C were stable, A1C and A4C were degraded to liberate celecoxib. In the cecal contents, the other conjugates except for SC and SA4C were cleaved to release celecoxib. These results suggest the colon-specific delivery and activation of SA1C. On oral administration of SA1C or celecoxib, no SA1C was detected in the blood and urine, indicating the limited absorption of SA1C. SA1C delivered a much greater amount of celecoxib to the large intestine while keeping the plasma concentration of celecoxib at much lower level, which is consistent with no change of the serum level of 6-ketoprostaglandin F(1?) whose decrease is associated with the cardiovascular toxicity of celecoxib. Moreover, SA1C administered orally supplied a greater concentration of celecoxib for the whole colonic tissue. Taken together, SA1C may be a colon-specific prodrug of celecoxib with improved therapeutic properties. 	J_Pharm_Sci	D016428 D013485
26934861	20160304	4C-seq revealed long-range interactions of a functional enhancer at the 8q24 prostate cancer risk locus.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified &gt;100 independent susceptibility loci for prostate cancer, including the hot spot at 8q24. However, how genetic variants at this locus confer disease risk hasn't been fully characterized. Using circularized chromosome conformation capture (4C) coupled with next-generation sequencing and an enhancer at 8q24 as &quot;bait&quot;, we identified genome-wide partners interacting with this enhancer in cell lines LNCaP and C4-2B. These 4C-identified regions are distributed in open nuclear compartments, featuring active histone marks (H3K4me1, H3K4me2 and H3K27Ac). Transcription factors NKX3-1, FOXA1 and AR (androgen receptor) tend to occupy these 4C regions. We identified genes located at the interacting regions, and found them linked to positive regulation of mesenchymal cell proliferation in LNCaP and C4-2B, and several pathways (TGF beta signaling pathway in LNCaP and p53 pathway in C4-2B). Common genes (e.g. MYC and POU5F1B) were identified in both prostate cancer cell lines. However, each cell line also had exclusive genes (e.g. ELAC2 and PTEN in LNCaP and BRCA2 and ZFHX3 in C4-2B). In addition, BCL-2 identified in C4-2B might contribute to the progression of androgen-refractory prostate cancer. Overall, our work reveals key genes and pathways involved in prostate cancer onset and progression. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D052061
22329956	20120215	Psychiatric symptoms of patients with primary mitochondrial DNA disorders.	The aim of our study was to assess psychiatric symptoms in patients with genetically proven primary mutation of the mitochondrial DNA. 19 adults with known mitochondrial mutation (MT) have been assessed with the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire 20-item Disability Index (HAQ-DI), the Symptom Check List-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), the Beck Depression Inventory-Short Form (BDI-SF), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the clinical version of the Structured Clinical Interview for the the DSM-IV (SCID-I and SCID-II) As control, 10 patients with hereditary sensorimotor neuropathy (HN), harboring the peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22) mutation were examined with the same tools. The two groups did not differ significantly in gender, age or education. Mean HAQ-DI score was 0.82 in the MT (range: 0-1.625) and 0.71 in the HN group (range: 0-1.625). Level of disability between the two groups did not differ significantly (p = 0.6076). MT patients scored significantly higher on the BDI-SF and HDRS than HN patients (12.85 versus 4.40, p = 0.031, and 15.62 vs 7.30, p = 0.043, respectively). The Global Severity Index (GSI) of SCL-90-R also showed significant difference (1.44 vs 0.46, p = 0.013) as well as the subscales except for somatization. SCID-I interview yielded a variety of mood disorders in both groups. Eight MT patient (42%) had past, 6 (31%) had current, 5 (26%) had both past and current psychiatric diagnosis, yielding a lifetime prevalence of 9/19 (47%) in the MT group. In the HN group, 3 patients had both past and current diagnosis showing a lifetime prevalence of 3/10 (30%) in this group.

26220966	20150730	Genomic Adaptations to the Loss of a Conserved Bacterial DNA Methyltransferase.	CcrM is an orphan DNA methyltransferase nearly universally conserved in a vast group of Alphaproteobacteria. In Caulobacter crescentus, it controls the expression of key genes involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and cell division. Here, we demonstrate, using an experimental evolution approach, that C. crescentus can significantly compensate, through easily accessible genetic changes like point mutations, the severe loss in fitness due to the absence of CcrM, quickly improving its growth rate and cell morphology in rich medium. By analyzing the compensatory mutations genome-wide in 12 clones sampled from independent ?ccrM populations evolved for ~300 generations, we demonstrated that each of the twelve clones carried at least one mutation that potentially stimulated ftsZ expression, suggesting that the low intracellular levels of FtsZ are the major burden of ?ccrM mutants. In addition, we demonstrate that the phosphoenolpyruvate-carbohydrate phosphotransfer system (PTS) actually modulates ftsZ and mipZ transcription, uncovering a previously unsuspected link between metabolic regulation and cell division in Alphaproteobacteria. We present evidence that point mutations found in genes encoding proteins of the PTS provide the strongest fitness advantage to ?ccrM cells cultivated in rich medium despite being disadvantageous in minimal medium. This environmental sign epistasis might prevent such mutations from getting fixed under changing natural conditions, adding a plausible explanation for the broad conservation of CcrM. In bacteria, DNA methylation has a variety of functions, including the control of DNA replication and/or gene expression. The cell cycle-regulated DNA methyltransferase CcrM modulates the transcription of many genes and is critical for fitness in Caulobacter crescentus. Here, we used an original experimental evolution approach to determine which of its many targets make CcrM so important physiologically. We show that populations lacking CcrM evolve quickly, accumulating an excess of mutations affecting, directly or indirectly, the expression of the ftsZ cell division gene. This finding suggests that the most critical function of CcrM in C. crescentus is to promote cell division by enhancing FtsZ intracellular levels. During this work, we also discovered an unexpected link between metabolic regulation and cell division that might extend to other Alphaproteobacteria. 	MBio	D016428 D013485
16269960	20051105	Impact of genes related to immune tolerance and inflammation (tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6) on blood pressure, protein excretion and oedema in pregnancy.	To test the hypothesis that genetically determined alterations of maternal immune tolerance to a foetal semi-allograft are important for the pathogenesis of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. A genetic association study was performed to analyse the impact of genetic polymorphisms known to be involved in immune tolerance on markers of pre-eclampsia. The study was conducted at the Obstetrics Department of the Charit? University Hospital, Berlin, Germany. A total of 1480 Caucasian women were consecutively included after delivery and genotyped for two polymorphisms: tumour necrosis factor-alpha -308G&gt;A and interleukin-6 -174G&gt;C. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures, urinary protein excretion and oedema during pregnancy. Only women carrying at least one mutant allele of both polymorphisms (tumour necrosis factor-alpha A and interleukin-6 C) have a significantly elevated mean systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure at the end of pregnancy. The tumour necrosis factor-alpha A allele on its own is significantly associated with urinary protein excretion in the last trimenon, and the interleukin-6 C allele is independently and significantly associated with new-onset oedema. We demonstrate in a large population that common maternal polymorphisms of genes related to immune tolerance and inflammation are associated with blood pressure regulation, urinary protein excretion and oedema during pregnancy. The analysed polymorphisms seem to contribute to the multifactorial pathogenesis of gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia. The findings support the hypothesis that genetically determined factors of maternal immune tolerance play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. 	J._Hypertens.	D016428
25076994	20140801	Saudi Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pulmonary Hypertension: Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective tissue diseases.	The explosive growth of medical literature on pulmonary hypertension (PH) has led to a steady increase in awareness of this disease within the medical community during the past decade. The recent revision of the classification of PH is presented in in the main guidelines. Group 1 PH or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a heterogeneous group and includes PH due to inheritable, drug-induced, and toxin-induced causes and to such underlying systemic causes as connective tissue diseases, human immunodeficiency viral infection, portal hypertension, congenital heart disease, and schistosomiasis. Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune multisystem disorder, which affects over 240 persons per million in the United States.[1] Its manifestations are not confined to the skin but may also involve the lungs, kidneys, peripheral circulation, musculoskeletal system, gastrointestinal tract, and heart. The outcome of PAH associated with SSc is worse when compared to other subtypes of PAH. In this review, we summarize available information about the pulmonary vascular and cardiac manifestations of SSc with special emphasis on their prognostic implications as well as the peculiarity of their detection.

12885917	20030730	Intracellular trafficking of a palmitoylated membrane-associated protein component of enveloped vaccinia virus.	The F13L protein of vaccinia virus, an essential and abundant palmitoylated peripheral membrane component of intra- and extracellular enveloped virions, associates with Golgi, endosomal, and plasma membranes in the presence or absence of other viral proteins. In the present study, the trafficking of a fully functional F13L-green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimera in transfected and productively infected cells was analyzed using specific markers and inhibitors. We found that Sar1(H79G), a trans-dominant-negative protein inhibitor of cargo transport from the endoplasmic reticulum, had no apparent effect on the intracellular distribution of F13L-GFP, suggesting that the initial membrane localization occurs at a downstream compartment of the secretory pathway. Recycling of F13L-GFP from the plasma membrane was demonstrated by partial colocalization with FM4-64, a fluorescent membrane marker of endocytosis. Punctate F13L-GFP fluorescence overlapped with clathrin and Texas red-conjugated transferrin, suggesting that endocytosis occurred via clathrin-coated pits. The inhibitory effects of chlorpromazine and trans-dominant-negative forms of dynamin and Eps15 protein on the recycling of F13L-GFP provided further evidence for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In addition, the F13L protein was specifically coimmunoprecipitated with alpha-adaptin, a component of the AP-2 complex that interacts with Eps15. Nocodazole and wortmannin perturbed the intracellular trafficking of F13L-GFP, consistent with its entry into late and early endosomes through the secretory and endocytic pathways, respectively. The recycling pathway described here provides a mechanism for the reutilization of the F13L protein following its deposition in the plasma membrane during the exocytosis of enveloped virions.

770429	19760401	Molecular nature of two beta-lactamase-specifying plasmids isolated from Haemophilus influenzae type b.	The molecular nature of two beta-lactamase-specifying plasmids isolated from two separate ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae type b strains was examined. A 30 X 10(6)-dalton (30-Mdal) plasmid (RSF007) had a copy number of approximately 3 per chromosomal equivalent and a mole fraction guanine plus cytosine content of 0.39. By heteroduplex analysis the 30-Mdal plasmid was found to contain the entire ampicillin translocation DNA segment (TnA) found on R factors of enteric origin. A 3.0-Mdal plasmid (RSF0885) was found as a multicopy pool of approximately 28 copies per chromosomal equivalent, had a mole fraction guanine plus cytosine content of 0.40, and contained only about one-third of the transposable TnA sequence. RSF007 and RSF0885 appeared to be unrelated plasmids in that they share base sequence homology only within the confines of the TnA segment. The 3.0-Mdal Haemophilus plasmid was used to transform E. coli to ampicillin resistance but was found to be unstable in this host in the absence of antibiotic. The possibility that R-plasmids arose in Haemophilus by the translocation of TnA from a donor R-factor onto an indigenous H. influenzae plasmid is discussed. 	J._Bacteriol.	D016428 D013486 D013487
24916189	20140612	Entropy-based selection for maternal-fetal genotype incompatibility with application to preterm prelabor rupture of membranes.	Maternal-fetal genotype incompatibility (MFGI) is increasingly reported to influence human diseases, especially pregnancy-related complications. In practice, it is challenging to identify the ideal incompatibility model for analysis, since the true MFGI mechanism is generally unknown. The underlying MFGI mechanism for different genetic variants can vary, and to use a single incompatibility model for all circumstances would cause power loss in testing MFGI. In this article, we propose a practical 2-step procedure that incorporates a model selection strategy based on an entropy measurement to select the most appropriate MFGI model represented by data and test the significance of the MFGI effect using the chosen model within the generalized linear regression framework. Our simulation studies show that the proposed two-step procedure controls the type I error rate and increase the testing power under various scenarios. In a real data application, our analysis reveals genes having an MFGI effect, which may not be detected with a non-model selection counterpart. 	BMC_Genet.	D016428 D052060 D013485 D013486

9769326	19981014	Effects of mutations in the human uncoupling protein 3 gene on the respiratory quotient and fat oxidation in severe obesity and type 2 diabetes.	Human uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) is a mitochondrial transmembrane carrier that uncouples oxidative ATP phosphorylation. With the capacity to participate in thermogenesis and energy balance, UCP3 is an important obesity candidate gene. A missense polymorphism in exon 3 (V102I) was identified in an obese and diabetic proband. A mutation introducing a stop codon in exon 4 (R143X) and a terminal polymorphism in the splice donor junction of exon 6 were also identified in a compound heterozygote that was morbidly obese and diabetic. Allele frequencies of the exon 3 and exon 6 splice junction polymorphisms were determined and found to be similar in Gullah-speaking African Americans and the Mende tribe of Sierra Leone, but absent in Caucasians. Moreover, in exon 6-splice donor heterozygotes, basal fat oxidation rates were reduced by 50%, and the respiratory quotient was markedly increased compared with wild-type individuals, implicating a role for UCP3 in metabolic fuel partitioning.

22536152	20120427	Loss of anti-viral immunity by infection with a virus encoding a cross-reactive pathogenic epitope.	T cell cross-reactivity between different strains of the same virus, between different members of the same virus group, and even between unrelated viruses is a common occurrence. We questioned here how an intervening infection with a virus containing a sub-dominant cross-reactive T cell epitope would affect protective immunity to a previously encountered virus. Pichinde virus (PV) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) encode subdominant cross-reactive NP??????? CD8 T cell epitopes sharing 6 of 8 amino acids, differing only in the MHC anchoring regions. These pMHC epitopes induce cross-reactive but non-identical T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires, and structural studies showed that the differing anchoring amino acids altered the conformation of the MHC landscape presented to the TCR. PV-immune mice receiving an intervening infection with wild type but not NP205-mutant LCMV developed severe immunopathology in the form of acute fatty necrosis on re-challenge with PV, and this pathology could be predicted by the ratio of NP205-specific to the normally immunodominant PV NP?????-specific T cells. Thus, cross-reactive epitopes can exert pathogenic properties that compromise protective immunity by impairing more protective T cell responses. 	PLoS_Pathog.	D016428 D052061 D013485
20657062	20100727	Epidemiological, demographic, and molecular characteristics of laboratory-confirmed pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in Turkey, May 15-November 30, 2009.	A total of 19,973 clinical specimens obtained from suspected cases of pandemic influenza A virus infection were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) gene and alteration at position 275 in neuraminidase (NA) gene of the randomly selected 29 isolates were detected by sequencing analysis. The virus RNA was detected in 47.3% of the clinical specimens. The pandemic flu cases increased from the 42nd week and peaked in the 46th week of 2009. This intensity continued to the end of the study period. Pandemic flu mainly affected children in the 5-14 year age group, without any gender predominance. The analyzed strains had &gt;98.9% homology with vaccine strains and with each other. More than 37% of the isolates had mutation at position D222E/N on HA gene. There was no isolate harbored mutation at the position H275Y of the NA gene, indicating that the virus isolates currently circulating in Turkey are sensitive to oseltamivir. 	Jpn._J._Infect._Dis.

26164085	20150713	Exploring response signals and targets in aggressive unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: an analysis of targeted therapy phase 1 trials.	Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have limited effective therapeutic options. Given the rapid advanced in drug development and emergence of novel agents, we analyzed the characteristics and outcomes of HCC patients treated on early phase trials with an emphasis on targeted therapies. We reviewed the records of consecutive HCC patients evaluated in the Phase I Clinical Trials Program at MD Anderson from March 2004. Thirty-nine patients were not treated due to poor performance status (n = 22, 56%) and decision to pursue alternate therapies (n = 10, 27%). Of 61 treated patients (median age, 60 years; median prior therapies, 3), eight patients (13%) attained stable disease lasting ?6 months; four (7%) had a partial response, mainly with anti-angiogenic or multikinase inhibitors. Median Phase I progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.6 months versus 4.4 months (p 0.019) and 4.1 months (p 0.27) for their first-, and second-line FDA-approved therapy. Molecular analysis showed frequent PTEN loss (10/19 patients, 53%) and P53 mutation (4/4 patients tested). On multivariate analysis, independent factors predicting shorter survival were white ethnicity/race (p 0.031), cirrhosis (p 0.016), and serum sodium (p 0.0013). In our heavily-pretreated HCC patients, the phase I PFS was comparable to that of 2nd-line therapy, highlighting a potential role for clinical trials after progression on first-line therapy. The response rate (SD&gt;6 months/PR) of 20% was observed with early signals of activity in regimens combining inhibitors of angiogenesis, multiple kinases and mTOR with preliminary molecular analysis revealing prevalence of PTEN loss.

27601974	20160908	Emerging Relationships between Exercise, Sensory Nerves, and Neuropathic Pain.	The utilization of physical activity as a therapeutic tool is rapidly growing in the medical community and the role exercise may offer in the alleviation of painful disease states is an emerging research area. The development of neuropathic pain is a complex mechanism, which clinicians and researchers are continually working to better understand. The limited therapies available for alleviation of these pain states are still focused on pain abatement and as opposed to treating underlying mechanisms. The continued research into exercise and pain may address these underlying mechanisms, but the mechanisms which exercise acts through are still poorly understood. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of how the peripheral nervous system responds to exercise, the relationship of inflammation and exercise, and experimental and clinical use of exercise to treat pain. Although pain is associated with many conditions, this review highlights pain associated with diabetes as well as experimental studies on nerve damages-associated pain. Because of the global effects of exercise across multiple organ systems, exercise intervention can address multiple problems across the entire nervous system through a single intervention. This is a double-edged sword however, as the global interactions of exercise also require in depth investigations to include and identify the many changes that can occur after physical activity. A continued investment into research is necessary to advance the adoption of physical activity as a beneficial remedy for neuropathic pain. The following highlights our current understanding of how exercise alters pain, the varied pain models used to explore exercise intervention, and the molecular pathways leading to the physiological and pathological changes following exercise intervention.

22040608	20111102	Immortalized pathological human myoblasts: towards a universal tool for the study of neuromuscular disorders.	Investigations into both the pathophysiology and therapeutic targets in muscle dystrophies have been hampered by the limited proliferative capacity of human myoblasts. Isolation of reliable and stable immortalized cell lines from patient biopsies is a powerful tool for investigating pathological mechanisms, including those associated with muscle aging, and for developing innovative gene-based, cell-based or pharmacological biotherapies. Using transduction with both telomerase-expressing and cyclin-dependent kinase 4-expressing vectors, we were able to generate a battery of immortalized human muscle stem-cell lines from patients with various neuromuscular disorders. The immortalized human cell lines from patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophy, and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B had greatly increased proliferative capacity, and maintained their potential to differentiate both in vitro and in vivo after transplantation into regenerating muscle of immunodeficient mice. Dystrophic cellular models are required as a supplement to animal models to assess cellular mechanisms, such as signaling defects, or to perform high-throughput screening for therapeutic molecules. These investigations have been conducted for many years on cells derived from animals, and would greatly benefit from having human cell models with prolonged proliferative capacity. Furthermore, the possibility to assess in vivo the regenerative capacity of these cells extends their potential use. The innovative cellular tools derived from several different neuromuscular diseases as described in this report will allow investigation of the pathophysiology of these disorders and assessment of new therapeutic strategies.

24013560	20130910	Mechanical properties of DNA-like polymers.	The molecular structure of the DNA double helix has been known for 60 years, but we remain surprisingly ignorant of the balance of forces that determine its mechanical properties. The DNA double helix is among the stiffest of all biopolymers, but neither theory nor experiment has provided a coherent understanding of the relative roles of attractive base stacking forces and repulsive electrostatic forces creating this stiffness. To gain insight, we have created a family of double-helical DNA-like polymers where one of the four normal bases is replaced with various cationic, anionic or neutral analogs. We apply DNA ligase-catalyzed cyclization kinetics experiments to measure the bending and twisting flexibilities of these polymers under low salt conditions. Interestingly, we show that these modifications alter DNA bending stiffness by only 20%, but have much stronger (5-fold) effects on twist flexibility. We suggest that rather than modifying DNA stiffness through a mechanism easily interpretable as electrostatic, the more dominant effect of neutral and charged base modifications is their ability to drive transitions to helical conformations different from canonical B-form DNA.

10545198	19991105	Catalytic mechanism of phosphorylase kinase probed by mutational studies.	The contributions to catalysis of the conserved catalytic aspartate (Asp149) in the phosphorylase kinase catalytic subunit (PhK; residues 1-298) have been studied by kinetic and crystallographic methods. Kinetic studies in solvents of different viscosity show that PhK, like cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase, exhibits a mechanism in which the chemical step of phosphoryl transfer is fast and the rate-limiting step is release of the products, ADP and phosphoprotein, and possibly viscosity-dependent conformational changes. Site-directed mutagenesis of Asp149 to Ala and Asn resulted in enzymes with a small increase in K(m) for glycogen phosphorylase b (GPb) and ATP substrates and dramatic decreases in k(cat) (1.3 x 10(4) for Asp149Ala and 4.7 x 10(3) for Asp149Asn mutants, respectively). Viscosometric kinetic measurements with the Asp149Asn mutant showed a reduction in the rate-limiting step for release of products by 4.5 x 10(3) and a significant decrease (possibly as great as 2.2 x 10(3)) in the rate constant characterizing the chemical step. The date combined with the crystallographic evidence for the ternary PhK-AMPPNP-peptide complex [Lowe et al. (1997) EMBO J. 6, 6646-6658] provide powerful support for the role of the carboxyl of Asp149 in binding and orientation of the substrate and in catalysis of phosphoryl transfer. The constitutively active subunit PhK has a glutamate (Glu182) residue in the activation segment, in place of a phosphorylatable serine, threonine, or tyrosine residue in other protein kinases that are activated by phosphorylation. Site-directed mutagenesis of Glu182 and other residues involved in a hydrogen bond network resulted in mutant proteins (Glu182Ser, Arg148Ala, and Tyr206Phe) with decreased catalytic efficiency (approximate average decrease in k(cat)/K(m) by 20-fold). The crystal structure of the mutant Glu182Ser at 2.6 A resolution showed a phosphate dianion about 2.6 A from the position previously occupied by the carboxylate of Glu182. There was no change in tertiary structure from the native protein, but the activation segment in the region C-terminal to residue 182 showed increased disorder, indicating that correct localization of the activation segment is necessary in order to recognize and present the protein substrate for catalysis.

24097980	20131008	Analysis of hyperekplexia mutations identifies transmembrane domain rearrangements that mediate glycine receptor activation.	Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) mediate numerous physiological processes and are therapeutic targets for a wide range of clinical indications. Elucidating the structural differences between their closed and open states may help in designing improved drugs that bias receptors toward the desired conformational state. We recently showed that two new hyperekplexia mutations, Q226E and V280M, induced spontaneous activity in ?1 glycine receptors. Gln-226, located near the top of transmembrane (TM) 1, is closely apposed to Arg-271 at the top of TM2 in the neighboring subunit. Using mutant cycle analysis, we inferred that Q226E induces activation via an enhanced electrostatic attraction to Arg-271. This would tilt the top of TM2 toward TM1 and hence away from the pore axis to open the channel. We also concluded that the increased side chain volume of V280M, in the TM2-TM3 loop, exerts a steric repulsion against Ile-225 at the top of TM1 in the neighboring subunit. We infer that this steric repulsion would tilt the top of TM3 radially outwards against the stationary TM1 and thus provide space for TM2 to relax away from the pore axis to create an open channel. Because the transmembrane domain movements inferred from this functional analysis are consistent with the structural differences evident in the x-ray atomic structures of closed and open state bacterial pLGICs, we propyose that the model of pLGIC activation as outlined here may be broadly applicable across the eukaryotic pLGIC receptor family.

8804580	19960401	The functional involvement of Lys-38 in the heavy subunit of rat kidney gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase: chemical modification and mutagenesis studies.	Rat kidney gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma GCS) was inactivated by reaction with trinitrobenzene sulfonate (TNBS), and the reaction followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. Inactivation kinetics revealed that only one of the amino acid residues modified by TNBS was essential for gamma GCS activity. The addition of 10 mM Mg2+ to the TNBS inactivation reaction resulted in a 16-fold increase in the rate of inactivation. Chromatographic analysis on the tryptic hydrolyzates of trinitrophenylated (TNP) derivatives showed that Lys-38 in the gamma GCS heavy subunit was significantly modified in the presence of Mg2+. In contrast to small changes in the catalytic properties observed by mutation of Lys-38 to Arg, the mutants K38N and K38E had a marked decrease in enzymatic activity and about twofold increase in Km for glutamate. These results suggest that the positively charged Lys-38 may be involved in the binding of glutamate to gamma GCS. 	J._Protein_Chem.	D016428 D013485
10022448	19990218	Mutational analysis of the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) receptor in normal and infertile men: identification and characterization of two discrete FSH receptor isoforms.	In a search for pathophysiological causes of idiopathic male infertility we investigated the occurrence of mutations of the FSH receptor in 48 men with this disorder. The entire FSH receptor gene was analyzed by single stranded conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP). A heterozygous point mutation without functional consequences, exchanging Val to Ala in codon 341, was found in one patient. SSCP analysis led to the identification of 2 polymorphisms in exon 10 associated in 2 discrete FSH receptor allelic variants, i.e. Thr307-Asn680 and Ala307-Ser680. The frequency and distribution of the two allelic variants was further analyzed in 86 proven fathers and 75 infertile men by SSCP (codon 307) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (codon 680). The 2 receptor isoforms showed similar Mendelian distribution in proven fathers and in infertile men. Serum FSH, inhibin B, and combined testicular volume did not differ between subjects with different receptor isoforms. Binding studies in transiently transfected COS-7 cells showed similar binding affinity for the two receptor variants. Moreover, the Ala307-Ser680 and the Thr307-Asn680 FSH receptors responded in vitro to FSH with comparable cAMP production. These data suggest that different isoforms of the FSH receptor with similar functional properties exist in normal and infertile men. We conclude that mutations of the FSH receptor or the FSH receptor genotype do not play a pathogenic role in male idiopathic infertility. The possibility that different FSH isoforms might interact differently with the 2 receptor variants remains to be investigated. 	J._Clin._Endocrinol._Metab.	D016428 D013485
20678187	20100804	A new family of phosphoinositide phosphatases in microorganisms: identification and biochemical analysis.	Phosphoinositide metabolism is essential to membrane dynamics and impinges on many cellular processes, including phagocytosis. Modulation of phosphoinositide metabolism is important for pathogenicity and virulence of many human pathogens, allowing them to survive and replicate in the host cells. Phosphoinositide phosphatases from bacterial pathogens are therefore key players in this modulation and constitute attractive targets for chemotherapy. MptpB, a virulence factor from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has phosphoinositide phosphatase activity and a distinct active site P-loop signature HCXXGKDR that shares characteristics with eukaryotic lipid phosphatases and protein tyrosine phosphatases. We used this P-loop signature as a &quot;diagnostic motif&quot; to identify related putative phosphatases with phosphoinositide activity in other organisms. We found more than 200 uncharacterised putative phosphatase sequences with the conserved signature in bacteria, with some related examples in fungi and protozoa. Many of the sequences identified belong to recognised human pathogens. Interestingly, no homologues were found in any other organisms including Archaea, plants, or animals. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these proteins are unrelated to classic eukaryotic lipid phosphatases. However, biochemical characterisation of those from Listeria monocytogenes and Leishmania major, demonstrated that, like MptpB, they have phosphatase activity towards phosphoinositides. Mutagenesis studies established that the conserved Asp and Lys in the P-loop signature (HCXXGKDR) are important in catalysis and substrate binding respectively. Furthermore, we provide experimental evidence that the number of basic residues in the P-loop is critical in determining activity towards poly-phosphoinositides. This new family of enzymes in microorganisms shows distinct sequence and biochemical characteristics to classic eukaryotic lipid phosphatases and they have no homologues in humans. This study provides a foundation for examining the biological role of this new family of phosphatases and their potential as pharmaceutical targets against infectious diseases.

26460486	20151014	RelA-Induced Interferon Response Negatively Regulates Proliferation.	Both oncogenic and tumor-suppressor activities are attributed to the Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-kB) pathway. Moreover, NF-kB may positively or negatively regulate proliferation. The molecular determinants of these opposing roles of NF-kB are unclear. Using primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) as a model, we show that increased RelA levels and consequent increase in basal transcriptional activity of RelA induces IRF1, a target gene. Induced IRF1 upregulates STAT1 and IRF7, and in consort, these factors induce the expression of interferon response genes. Activation of the interferon pathway down-regulates CDK4 and up-regulates p27 resulting in Rb hypo-phosphorylation and cell cycle arrest. Stimulation of HMEC with IFN-? elicits similar phenotypic and molecular changes suggesting that basal activity of RelA and IFN-? converge on IRF1 to regulate proliferation. The anti-proliferative RelA-IRF1-CDK4 signaling axis is retained in ER+/HER2- breast tumors analyzed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Using immuno-histochemical analysis of breast tumors, we confirm the negative correlation between RelA levels and proliferation rate in ER+/HER2- breast tumors. These findings attribute an anti-proliferative tumor-suppressor role to basal RelA activity. Inactivation of Rb, down-regulation of RelA or IRF1, or upregulation of CDK4 or IRF2 rescues the RelA-IRF1-CDK4 induced proliferation arrest in HMEC and are points of disruption in aggressive tumors. Activity of the RelA-IRF1-CDK4 axis may explain favorable response to CDK4/6 inhibition observed in patients with ER+ Rb competent tumors. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485

The sequence of HLA-G*0111 (EU290673) is identical to G*010404 at exons 2, 3, and 4 except for a single nucleotide difference at codon 31 (ACG --&gt; ATG), resulting in a coding change from threonine to methionine. These new alleles are detected in several other individuals in our study population and the functional relevance of these new alleles must be studied. 	Hum._Immunol.	D016428
17052134	20061021	Participation of the surface structure of Pharaonis phoborhodopsin, ppR and its A149S and A149V mutants, consisting of the C-terminal alpha-helix and E-F loop, in the complex-formation with the cognate transducer pHtrII, as revealed by site-directed 13C solid-state NMR.	We have recorded 13C solid state NMR spectra of [3-13C]Ala-labeled pharaonis phoborhodopsin (ppR) and its mutants, A149S and A149V, complexed with the cognate transducer pharaonis halobacterial transducer II protein (pHtrII) (1-159), to gain insight into a possible role of their cytoplasmic surface structure including the C-terminal alpha-helix and E-F loop for stabilization of the 2:2 complex, by both cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) and dipolar decoupled (DD)-MAS NMR techniques. We found that 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra of [3-13C]Ala-ppR, A149S and A149V complexed with the transducer pHtrII are very similar, reflecting their conformation and dynamics changes caused by mutual interactions through the transmembrane alpha-helical surfaces. In contrast, their DD-MAS NMR spectral features are quite different between [3-13C]Ala-A149S and A149V in the complexes with pHtrII: 13C DD-MAS NMR spectrum of [3-13C]Ala-A149S complex is rather similar to that of the uncomplexed form, while the corresponding spectral feature of A149V complex is similar to that of ppR complex in the C-terminal tip region. This is because more flexible surface structure detected by the DD-MAS NMR spectra are more directly influenced by the dynamics changes than the CP-MAS NMR. It turned out, therefore, that an altered surface structure of A149S resulted in destabilized complex as viewed from the 13C NMR spectrum of the surface areas, probably because of modified conformation at the corner of the helix E in addition to the change of hydropathy. It is, therefore, concluded that the surface structure of ppR including the C-terminal alpha-helix and the E-F loops is directly involved in the stabilization of the complex through conformational stability of the helix E.

22119538	20111129	Influence of matrix metalloproteinase-12 on fibrinogen level.	In vitro studies have shown that matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP12) can degrade fibrinogen, a clotting factor whose level predicts risk of advanced atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. In this study, we found that mean plasma fibrinogen level was approximately 10-fold higher in MMP12 knockout mice than wildtype mice (p=0.0006). Differential allelic expression analysis of human MMP12 gene polymorphism rs17368582 in human vascular tissues showed an allele-specific effect on MMP12 expression, with one allele (T) having 1.6 fold higher expression level than the other allele (C) (p=0.0006). In a population cohort, we found that individuals homozygous for the MMP12 low expression allele had higher plasma fibrinogen levels (2.95 mg/mL compared with 2.61 mg/mL in other individuals, p=0.029) and increased risk of advanced atherosclerosis [odds ratio 6.3 (95% CI 1.9-20.8), p=0.003] and myocardial infarction [hazard ratio 5.6 (95% CI 1.7-18.3), p=0.005]. In summary, our study in mouse and humans provides in vivo evidence of an effect of MMP12 on fibrinogen level. 	Atherosclerosis	D016428 D013485
23826323	20130705	Cannabinoid Receptor 2 (CB2) Plays a Role in the Generation of Germinal Center and Memory B Cells, but Not in the Production of Antigen-Specific IgG and IgM, in Response to T-dependent Antigens.	The cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) has been reported to modulate B cell functions including migration, proliferation and isotype class switching. Since these processes are required for the generation of the germinal center (GC) and antigen-specific plasma and memory cells following immunization with a T-dependent antigen, CB2 has the capacity to alter the quality and magnitude of T-dependent immune responses. To address this question, we immunized WT and CB2(-/-) mice with the T-dependent antigen 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP)-chicken-gamma-globulin (CGG) and measured GC B cell formation and the generation of antigen-specific B cells and serum immunoglobulin (Ig). While there was a significant reduction in the number of splenic GC B cells in CB2(-/-) mice early in the response there was no detectable difference in the number of NP-specific IgM and IgG1 plasma cells. There was also no difference in NP-specific IgM and class switched IgG1 in the serum. In addition, we found no defect in the homing of plasma cells to the bone marrow (BM) and affinity maturation, although memory B cell cells in the spleen were reduced in CB2(-/-) mice. CB2-deficient mice also generated similar levels of antigen-specific IgM and IgG in the serum as WT following immunization with sheep red blood cells (sRBC). This study demonstrates that although CB2 plays a role in promoting GC and memory B cell formation/maintenance in the spleen, it is dispensable on all immune cell types required for the generation of antigen-specific IgM and IgG in T-dependent immune responses.

26732700	20160107	Molecular Screening for Vel- Blood Donors in Southwestern Germany.	The SMIM1 protein carries the Vel blood group antigen, and homozygosity for a 17 bp deletion in the coding region of the SMIM1 gene represents the molecular basis of the Vel- blood group phenotype. We developed PCR-based methods for typing the SMIM1 17 bp (64-80del) gene deletion and performed a molecular screening for the Vel- blood type in German blood donors. For SMIM1 genotyping, TaqMan-PCR and PCR-SSP methods were developed and validated using reference samples. Both methods were used for screening of donors with blood group O from southwestern Germany. Heterozygotes and homozygotes for the SMIM1 64-80del allele were serologically typed for the Vel blood group antigen. In addition, the rs1175550 SNP in SMIM1 was typed and correlated to the results of the phenotyping. Both genotyping methods, TaqMan-PCR and PCR-SSP, represent reliable methods for the detection of the SMIM1 64-80del allele. Screening of 10,598 blood group O donors revealed 5 individuals homozygous for the deletional allele. They were confirmed Vel- by serological typing. Heterozygotes for the 64-80del allele showed different antigen expressions ranging from very weak to regular positive. Molecular screening of blood donors for the Vel- blood type is feasible and avoids the limitations of serological typing which might show false-negative results with heterozygous individuals. The identification of Vel- blood donors significantly contributes to the adequate blood supply of patients with anti-Vel. 	Transfus_Med_Hemother	D016428
27445650	20160723	Stochastic Synapses Enable Efficient Brain-Inspired Learning Machines.	Recent studies have shown that synaptic unreliability is a robust and sufficient mechanism for inducing the stochasticity observed in cortex. Here, we introduce Synaptic Sampling Machines (S2Ms), a class of neural network models that uses synaptic stochasticity as a means to Monte Carlo sampling and unsupervised learning. Similar to the original formulation of Boltzmann machines, these models can be viewed as a stochastic counterpart of Hopfield networks, but where stochasticity is induced by a random mask over the connections. Synaptic stochasticity plays the dual role of an efficient mechanism for sampling, and a regularizer during learning akin to DropConnect. A local synaptic plasticity rule implementing an event-driven form of contrastive divergence enables the learning of generative models in an on-line fashion. S2Ms perform equally well using discrete-timed artificial units (as in Hopfield networks) or continuous-timed leaky integrate and fire neurons. The learned representations are remarkably sparse and robust to reductions in bit precision and synapse pruning: removal of more than 75% of the weakest connections followed by cursory re-learning causes a negligible performance loss on benchmark classification tasks. The spiking neuron-based S2Ms outperform existing spike-based unsupervised learners, while potentially offering substantial advantages in terms of power and complexity, and are thus promising models for on-line learning in brain-inspired hardware.

25219456	20140916	Interactions of the EGFR juxtamembrane domain with PIP2-containing lipid bilayers: Insights from multiscale molecular dynamics simulations.	The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is the best characterised member of the receptor tyrosine kinases, which play an important role in signalling across mammalian cell membranes. The EGFR juxtamembrane (JM) domain is involved in the mechanism of activation of the receptor, interacting with the anionic lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the intracellular leaflet of the cell membrane. Multiscale MD simulations were used to characterize PIP2-JM interactions. Simulations of the transmembrane helix plus JM region (TM-JM) dimer (PDB:2M20) in both PIP2-containing and PIP2-depleted lipid bilayer membranes revealed the interactions of the JM with PIP2 and other lipids. PIP2 forms strong interactions with the basic residues in the R645-R647 motif of the JM domain resulting in clustering of PIP2 around the protein. This association of PIP2 and the JM domain aids stabilization of JM-A dimer away from the membrane. Mutation (R645N/R646N/R647N) or PIP2-depletion results in deformation of the JM-A dimer and changes in JM-membrane interactions. These simulations support the proposal that the positively charged residues at the start of the JM-A domain stabilize the JM-A helices in an orientation away from the membrane surface through binding to PIP2, thus promoting a conformation corresponding to an asymmetric (i.e. activated) kinase. This study indicates that MD simulations may be used to characterise JM/lipid interactions, thus helping to define their role in the mechanisms of receptor tyrosine kinases. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Recent developments of molecular dynamics. 	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D013485
18509486	20080530	Citrus genomics.	Citrus is one of the most widespread fruit crops globally, with great economic and health value. It is among the most difficult plants to improve through traditional breeding approaches. Currently, there is risk of devastation by diseases threatening to limit production and future availability to the human population. As technologies rapidly advance in genomic science, they are quickly adapted to address the biological challenges of the citrus plant system and the world's industries. The historical developments of linkage mapping, markers and breeding, EST projects, physical mapping, an international citrus genome sequencing project, and critical functional analysis are described. Despite the challenges of working with citrus, there has been substantial progress. Citrus researchers engaged in international collaborations provide optimism about future productivity and contributions to the benefit of citrus industries worldwide and to the human population who can rely on future widespread availability of this health-promoting and aesthetically pleasing fruit crop.

25698190	20150221	Frequency-specific alterations of large-scale functional brain networks in patients with Alzheimer's disease.	Previous studies have indicated that the cognitive deficits in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be due to topological deteriorations of the brain network. However, whether the selection of a specific frequency band could impact the topological properties is still not clear. Our hypothesis is that the topological properties of AD patients are also frequency-specific. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 10 right-handed moderate AD patients (mean age: 64.3 years; mean mini mental state examination [MMSE]: 18.0) and 10 age and gender-matched healthy controls (mean age: 63.6 years; mean MMSE: 28.2) were enrolled in this study. The global efficiency, the clustering coefficient (CC), the characteristic path length (CpL), and &quot;small-world&quot; property were calculated in a wide range of thresholds and averaged within each group, at three different frequency bands (0.01-0.06 Hz, 0.06-0.11 Hz, and 0.11-0.25 Hz). At lower-frequency bands (0.01-0.06 Hz, 0.06-0.11 Hz), the global efficiency, the CC and the &quot;small-world&quot; properties of AD patients decreased compared to controls. While at higher-frequency bands (0.11-0.25 Hz), the CpL was much longer, and the &quot;small-world&quot; property was disrupted in AD, particularly at a higher threshold. The topological properties changed with different frequency bands, suggesting the existence of disrupted global and local functional organization associated with AD. This study demonstrates that the topological alterations of large-scale functional brain networks in AD patients are frequency dependent, thus providing fundamental support for optimal frequency selection in future related research.

24857848	20140527	Endothelin signalling in iridophore development and stripe pattern formation of zebrafish.	Colour patterns of adult fish are composed of several different types of pigment cells distributing in the skin during juvenile development. The zebrafish, Danio rerio, displays a striking pattern of dark stripes of melanophores interspersed with light stripes of xanthophores. A third cell type, silvery iridophores, contributes to both stripes and plays a crucial role in adult pigment pattern formation. Several mutants deficient in iridophore development display similar adult phenotypes with reduced numbers of melanophores and defects in stripe formation. This indicates a supporting role of iridophores for melanophore development and maintenance. One of these mutants, rose (rse), encodes the Endothelin receptor b1a. Here we describe a new mutant in zebrafish, karneol (kar), which has a phenotype similar to weak alleles of rse with a reduction in iridophore numbers and defects of adult pigment patterning. We show that, unlike rse, kar is not required in iridophores. The gene defective in the kar mutant codes for an endothelin-converting enzyme, Ece2, which activates endothelin ligands by proteolytic cleavage. By morpholino-mediated knockdown, we identify Endothelin 3b (Edn3b) as the ligand for endothelin receptor signalling in larval iridophores. Thus, Endothelin signalling is involved in iridophore development, proliferation and stripe morphogenesis in larvae as well as adult zebrafish. In mammals the pathway is required for melanocyte development; therefore, our results indicate a previously unrecognized close evolutionary relationship between iridophores in zebrafish and melanocytes in mammals.

27350879	20160629	Targeted therapeutics in SLE: emerging strategies to modulate the interferon pathway.	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease characterized by impaired immune tolerance, resulting in the generation of pathogenic autoantibodies and immune complexes. Although autoreactive B lymphocytes have been the first targets for biologic therapies in SLE, the importance of the innate immune system, and in particular, pathways involved in interferon (IFN) signaling, has emerged. There are now data supporting a central role for a plasmacytoid dendritic cell-derived type I IFN pathway in SLE, with a number of biologic therapeutics and small-molecule inhibitors undergoing clinical trials. Monoclonal antibodies targeting IFN-? have completed phase II clinical trials, and an antibody against the type I IFN receptor is entering a phase III trial. However, other IFNs, such as IFN gamma, and the more recently discovered type III IFNs, are also emerging as targets in SLE; and blockade of upstream components of the IFN signaling pathway may enable inhibition of more than one IFN subtype. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of IFNs in SLE, focusing on emerging therapies. 	Clin_Transl_Immunology	D016428 D016454
9566913	19980505	Carbon source-dependent phosphorylation of hexokinase PII and its role in the glucose-signaling response in yeast.	The HXK2 gene is required for a variety of regulatory effects leading to an adaptation for fermentative metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the molecular basis of the specific role of Hxk2p in these effects is still unclear. One important feature in order to understand the physiological function of hexokinase PH is that it is a phosphoprotein, since protein phosphorylation is essential in most metabolic signal transductions in eukaryotic cells. Here we show that Hxk2p exists in vivo in a dimeric-monomeric equilibrium which is affected by phosphorylation. Only the monomeric form appears phosphorylated, whereas the dimer does not. The reversible phosphorylation of Hxk2p is carbon source dependent, being more extensive on poor carbon sources such as galactose, raffinose, and ethanol. In vivo dephosphorylation of Hxk2p is promoted after addition of glucose. This effect is absent in glucose repression mutants cat80/grr1, hex2/reg1, and cid1/glc7. Treatment of a glucose crude extract from cid1-226 (glc7-T152K) mutant cells with lambda-phosphatase drastically reduces the presence of phosphoprotein, suggesting that CID1/GLC7 phosphatase together with its regulatory HEX2/REG1 subunit are involved in the dephosphorylation of the Hxk2p monomer. An HXK2 mutation encoding a serine-to-alanine change at position 15 [HXK2 (S15A)] was to clarify the in vivo function of the phosphorylation of hexokinase PII. In this mutant, where the Hxk2 protein is unable to undergo phosphorylation, the cells could not provide glucose repression of invertase. Glucose induction of HXT gene expression is also affected in cells expressing the mutated enzyme. Although we cannot rule out a defect in the metabolic state of the cell as the origin of these phenomena, our results suggest that the phosphorylation of hexokinase is essential in vivo for glucose signal transduction.

22514613	20120420	The crest phenotype in chicken is associated with ectopic expression of HOXC8 in cranial skin.	The Crest phenotype is characterised by a tuft of elongated feathers atop the head. A similar phenotype is also seen in several wild bird species. Crest shows an autosomal incompletely dominant mode of inheritance and is associated with cerebral hernia. Here we show, using linkage analysis and genome-wide association, that Crest is located on the E22C19W28 linkage group and that it shows complete association to the HOXC-cluster on this chromosome. Expression analysis of tissues from Crested and non-crested chickens, representing 26 different breeds, revealed that HOXC8, but not HOXC12 or HOXC13, showed ectopic expression in cranial skin during embryonic development. We propose that Crest is caused by a cis-acting regulatory mutation underlying the ectopic expression of HOXC8. However, the identification of the causative mutation(s) has to await until a method becomes available for assembling this chromosomal region. Crest is unfortunately located in a genomic region that has so far defied all attempts to establish a contiguous sequence. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
26524520	20151103	Conformational control of DNA target cleavage by CRISPR-Cas9.	Cas9 is an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease that targets foreign DNA for destruction as part of a bacterial adaptive immune system mediated by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). Together with single-guide RNAs, Cas9 also functions as a powerful genome engineering tool in plants and animals, and efforts are underway to increase the efficiency and specificity of DNA targeting for potential therapeutic applications. Studies of off-target effects have shown that DNA binding is far more promiscuous than DNA cleavage, yet the molecular cues that govern strand scission have not been elucidated. Here we show that the conformational state of the HNH nuclease domain directly controls DNA cleavage activity. Using intramolecular F?rster resonance energy transfer experiments to detect relative orientations of the Cas9 catalytic domains when associated with on- and off-target DNA, we find that DNA cleavage efficiencies scale with the extent to which the HNH domain samples an activated conformation. We furthermore uncover a surprising mode of allosteric communication that ensures concerted firing of both Cas9 nuclease domains. Our results highlight a proofreading mechanism beyond initial protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) recognition and RNA-DNA base-pairing that serves as a final specificity checkpoint before DNA double-strand break formation.

25337792	20141023	Genetic association study of TNFAIP3, IFIH1, IRF5 polymorphisms with polymyositis/dermatomyositis in Chinese Han population.	Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TNFAIP3, IFIH1, and IRF5 genes have been associated with several auto-inflammation diseases, while the susceptibility between these genes and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) were not reported. This study aimed to investigate whether TNFAIP3, IFIH1, and IRF5 gene polymorphisms confer susceptibility for the IIMs in Chinese Han population. A large case-control study of Chinese subjects with polymyositis (PM) (n?=?298) and dermatomyositis (DM) (n?=?530) was accomplished. 968 healthy and ethnically matched controls were available for comparison. Six SNPs in the TNFAIP3 region (rs2230926 and rs5029939), the IFIH1 gene (rs1990760 and rs3747517) and the IRF5 region (rs4728142 and rs729302) were assessed and genotyped using the Sequenom MassArray iPLEX platform. Our study indicated a strong allele association was observed in PM/DM and PM patients for rs2230926 (OR: 1.61, 95%CI: 1.20-2.16, P(c)?=?7.5?10(-3); OR: 1.88, 95%CI: 1.30-2.74, P(c)?=?4.0?10(-3), respectively) and rs5029939 (OR: 1.64, 95%CI: 1.21-2.21, P(c)?=?6.0?10(-3); OR: 1.88, 95%CI: 1.28-2.76, P(c)?=?5.5?10(-3), respectively). And rs2230926 and rs5029939 were significantly associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD) in PM/DM and PM patients (P(c)?=?0.04 and P(c)?=?0.016; P(c)?=?0.02 and P(c)?=?0.03, respectively). In addition, rs4728142 allele and genotype had significant association with PM/DM patients (P(c)?=?0.026 and P(c)?=?0.048, respectively). Further analysis with three logistic regression genetic models revealed statistically significant difference in the genotypic distribution in the PM/DM, PM or DM patients when the additive and dominant models were used. This was the first study to reveal TNFAIP3 and IRF5 polymorphisms were associated with PM/DM patients or these patients with ILD, indicating that TNFAIP3 and IRF5 might be the susceptibility gene for PM/DM patients in Chinese Han population.

12185072	20020820	Phosphorylation and mutations of Ser(16) in human phenylalanine hydroxylase. Kinetic and structural effects.	Phosphorylation of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) at Ser(16) by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase is a post-translational modification that increases its basal activity and facilitates its activation by the substrate l-Phe. So far there is no structural information on the flexible N-terminal tail (residues 1-18), including the phosphorylation site. To get further insight into the molecular basis for the effects of phosphorylation on the catalytic efficiency and enzyme stability, molecular modeling was performed using the crystal structure of the recombinant rat enzyme. The most probable conformation and orientation of the N-terminal tail thus obtained indicates that phosphorylation of Ser(16) induces a local conformational change as a result of an electrostatic interaction between the phosphate group and Arg(13) as well as a repulsion by Glu(280) in the loop at the entrance of the active site crevice structure. The modeled reorientation of the N-terminal tail residues (Met(1)-Leu(15)) on phosphorylation is in agreement with the observed conformational change and increased accessibility of the substrate to the active site, as indicated by circular dichroism spectroscopy and the enzyme kinetic data for the full-length phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated human PAH. To further validate the model we have prepared and characterized mutants substituting Ser(16) with a negatively charged residue and found that S16E largely mimics the effects of phosphorylation of human PAH. Both the phosphorylated enzyme and the mutants with acidic side chains instead of Ser(16) revealed an increased resistance toward limited tryptic proteolysis and, as indicated by circular dichroism spectroscopy, an increased content of alpha-helical structure. In agreement with the modeled structure, the formation of an Arg(13) to Ser(16) phosphate salt bridge and the conformational change of the N-terminal tail also explain the higher stability toward limited tryptic proteolysis of the phosphorylated enzyme. The results obtained with the mutant R13A and E381A further support the model proposed for the molecular mechanism for the activation of the enzyme by phosphorylation. 	J._Biol._Chem.

17062624	20061026	Mimicking damaged DNA with a small molecule inhibitor of human UNG2.	Human nuclear uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG2) is a cellular DNA repair enzyme that is essential for a number of diverse biological phenomena ranging from antibody diversification to B-cell lymphomas and type-1 human immunodeficiency virus infectivity. During each of these processes, UNG2 recognizes uracilated DNA and excises the uracil base by flipping it into the enzyme active site. We have taken advantage of the extrahelical uracil recognition mechanism to build large small-molecule libraries in which uracil is tethered via flexible alkane linkers to a collection of secondary binding elements. This high-throughput synthesis and screening approach produced two novel uracil-tethered inhibitors of UNG2, the best of which was crystallized with the enzyme. Remarkably, this inhibitor mimics the crucial hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions previously observed in UNG2 complexes with damaged uracilated DNA. Thus, the environment of the binding site selects for library ligands that share these DNA features. This is a general approach to rapid discovery of inhibitors of enzymes that recognize extrahelical damaged bases. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D052061 D013486
26543876	20151107	Tolerogenic Dendritic Cells on Transplantation: Immunotherapy Based on Second Signal Blockage.	Dendritic cells (DCs), the most important professional antigen-presenting cells (APC), play crucial role in both immunity and tolerance. It is well known that DCs are able to mount immune responses against foreign antigens and simultaneously tolerate self-antigens. Since DCs can be modulated depending on the surrounding microenvironment, they can act as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity. However, the mechanisms that support this dual role are not entirely clear. Recent studies have shown that DCs can be manipulated ex vivo in order to trigger their tolerogenic profile, what can be a tool to be used in clinical trials aiming the treatment of various diseases and the prevention of transplant rejection. In this sense, the blockage of costimulatory molecules on DC, in the attempt of inhibiting the second signal in the immunological synapse, can be considered as one of the main strategies under development. This review brings an update on current therapies using tolerogenic dendritic cells modulated with costimulatory blockers with the aim of reducing transplant rejection. However, although there are current clinical trials using tolerogenic DC to treat allograft rejection, the actual challenge is to modulate these cells in order to maintain a permanent tolerogenic profile.

12107262	20020711	Familial mutation in the testis-determining gene SRY shared by an XY female and her normal father.	In humans, mutations in the testis-determining gene SRY result in XY sex reversal with pure gonadal dysgenesis (PGD). However, only about 10-15% of the cases of PGD can be explained by mutations within the SRY open reading frame, suggesting the existence of other sex-determining genes. Although SRY is known to bind and bend DNA, its target and mode of action remain elusive. Here, we describe a novel mutation in SRY at codon 127, resulting in a tyrosine (Y) to phenylalanine (F) substitution in the protein. This sequence variant was found not only in the XY female patient but also in her father, who is a phenotypically normal male. However, this Y127F variant was not found in the SRY sequences of 93 other randomly chosen males. This substitution affects a highly conserved tyrosine residue in the HMG box of SRY, in which two de novo mutations have been described previously in XY females with PGD. Furthermore, electromobility shift studies demonstrate that SRY protein harboring the Y127F variant is incapable of binding consensus SRY binding sites in vitro. Taken together, these data suggest that the Y127F variant is a novel mutation with functional consequences and not simply a polymorphism. The allelic variant of SRY transmitted in this family and shared by both a phenotypic female (proband) and a phenotypic male (proband's father) emphasizes the importance of modifier genes in the sex determination pathway.

25918226	20150429	The yeast ERAD-C ubiquitin ligase Doa10 recognizes an intramembrane degron.	Aberrant endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins are eliminated by ER-associated degradation (ERAD). This process involves protein retrotranslocation into the cytosol, ubiquitylation, and proteasomal degradation. ERAD substrates are classified into three categories based on the location of their degradation signal/degron: ERAD-L (lumen), ERAD-M (membrane), and ERAD-C (cytosol) substrates. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the membrane proteins Hrd1 and Doa10 are the predominant ERAD ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s). The current notion is that ERAD-L and ERAD-M substrates are exclusively handled by Hrd1, whereas ERAD-C substrates are recognized by Doa10. In this paper, we identify the transmembrane (TM) protein Sec61 ?-subunit homologue 2 (Sbh2) as a Doa10 substrate. Sbh2 is part of the trimeric Ssh1 complex involved in protein translocation. Unassembled Sbh2 is rapidly degraded in a Doa10-dependent manner. Intriguingly, the degron maps to the Sbh2 TM region. Thus, in contrast to the prevailing view, Doa10 (and presumably its human orthologue) has the capacity for recognizing intramembrane degrons, expanding its spectrum of substrates. 	J._Cell_Biol.

24567120	20140226	A comprehensive functional and clinical analysis of ABCC2 and its impact on treatment response to carbamazepine.	At the blood-brain barrier, overexpression of the drug efflux transporter ABCC2 (also known as MRP2) has been proposed as a mechanism for impaired carbamazepine (CBZ) treatment response in epilepsy. However, investigation of the impact of ABCC2 polymorphisms on CBZ treatment efficacy has produced conflicting and inconclusive results. A series of in vitro cell efflux and plasma membrane vesicle uptake assays were undertaken to investigate whether CBZ was an ABCC2 substrate. In addition, the effect of three common ABCC2 polymorphisms, -24C&gt;T, c.1249G&gt;A and c.3972C&gt;T, on the efficacy of CBZ in epilepsy (assessed using the clinical end points time to first seizure and time to 12-month remission from the SANAD (Standard and New Antiepileptic Drugs) trial) was determined. CBZ was found not to be a substrate for human ABCC2 in vitro. Clinically, no significant association was observed for the ABCC2 genetic variants and CBZ treatment outcomes. This comprehensive analysis does not support a role for ABCC2 in CBZ treatment efficacy. 	Pharmacogenomics_J.	D016428 D013485
12238589	20020920	Order-parameter tensor description of HPr in a medium of oriented bicelles.	Residual dipolar couplings between 15N and 1H nuclear spins in HPr were used to determine the protein's orientation in a medium of bicelles, oriented by a magnetic field. In the case of wild-type HPr the protein's non-spherical shape can explain its orientation in this medium. In the case of the F48W mutant it was found that at least one other mechanism contributes to the observed orientation of the protein, to a degree that depends on the concentration of phosphate ions in the medium. We propose that the F48W mutant has a weak affinity towards the bicelle-surfaces that decreases with increasing phosphate concentrations. We used an order-parameter description to analyse this situation and to determine the axis of main order and the sign of the order parameter pertaining to this additional orientation mechanism.

21743564	20110712	Dispersion-optimized optical fiber for high-speed long-haul dense wavelength division multiplexing transmission.	Four non-zero-dispersion-shifted fibers with almost the same large effective area (A(eff)) and optimized dispersion properties are realized by novel index profile designing and modified vapor axial deposition and modified chemical vapor deposition processes. An A(eff) of greater than 71 ?m(2) is obtained for the designed fibers. Three of the developed fibers with positive dispersion are improved by reducing the 1550 nm dispersion slope from 0.072 ps/nm(2)/km to 0.063 ps/nm(2)/km or 0.05 ps/nm(2)/km, increasing the 1550 nm dispersion from 4.972 ps/nm/km to 5.679 ps/nm/km or 7.776 ps/nm/km, and shifting the zero-dispersion wavelength from 1500 nm to 1450 nm. One of these fibers is in good agreement with G655D and G.656 fibers simultaneously, and another one with G655E and G.656 fibers; both fibers are beneficial to high-bit long-haul dense wavelength division multiplexing systems over S-, C-, and L-bands. The fourth developed fiber with negative dispersion is also improved by reducing the 1550 nm dispersion slope from 0.12 ps/nm(2)/km to 0.085 ps/nm(2)/km, increasing the 1550 nm dispersion from -4 ps/nm/km to -6.016 ps/nm/km, providing facilities for a submarine transmission system. Experimental measurements indicate that the developed fibers all have excellent optical transmission and good macrobending and splice performances. 	Appl_Opt	D016428
20427658	20100430	Genetic variation in FGF20 modulates hippocampal biology.	We explored the effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the fibroblast growth factor 20 gene (FGF20) associated with risk for Parkinson's disease on brain structure and function in a large sample of healthy young-adult human subjects and also in elderly subjects to look at the interaction between genetic variations and age (N = 237; 116 men; 18-87 years). We analyzed high-resolution anatomical magnetic resonance images using voxel-based morphometry, a quantitative neuroanatomical technique. We also measured FGF20 mRNA expression in postmortem human brain tissue to determine the molecular correlates of these SNPs (N = 108; 72 men; 18-74 years). We found that the T allele carriers of rs12720208 in the 3'-untranslated region had relatively larger hippocampal volume (p = 0.0059) and diminished verbal episodic memory (p = 0.048) and showed steeper decreases of hippocampal volume with normal aging (p = 0.026). In postmortem brain, T allele carriers had greater expression of hippocampal FGF20 mRNA (p = 0.037), consistent with a previously characterized microRNA mechanism. The C allele matches a predicted miR-433 microRNA binding domain, whereas the T allele disrupts it, resulting in higher FGF20 protein translation. The strong FGF20 genetic effects in hippocampus are presumably mediated by activation of the FGFR1 (FGF receptor 1), which is expressed in mammalian brain most abundantly in the hippocampus. These associations, from mRNA expression to brain morphology to cognition and an interaction with aging, confirm a role of FGF20 in human brain structure and function during development and aging.

22097726	20111122	[The study on protective effect of sphingosine-1-phosphate in cardiomyocytes].	To explore the mechanism of protective effect of Sphingosine-1-phosphate(S1P) in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes dining simulated hypoxia/reoxygenation. On the basis of culturing neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, the model of hypoxia-reoxygennation was built by using method of Liquid Paraffin covering, the impact of S1P on apoptosis and p-Akt and mitochondrial membrane potential were studied by using method of Propidine Iodide staining and Western blot and Bhodanmine123 staining. SiP could reduce apoptosis rate (P &lt; 0.01) and stabilize the mitochondrial membrane potential (P &lt; 0.05) and improved the level of p-Akt1 (P &lt; 0.01) in hypoxia/reoxygenation cardiomyocytes significantly. But wonnannin could block these effects of S1P partially. SiP can obviously restrain apoptosis in curtured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes during simulated hypoxia/reoxygenation. Stabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential by P13K-AM signaling pathway is likely to play a role in protective action of S1P. 	Zhongguo_Ying_Yong_Sheng_Li_Xue_Za_Zhi	D004740 D016428
20472303	20100518	Associations between common arginine vasopressin 1b receptor and glucocorticoid receptor gene variants and HPA axis responses to psychosocial stress in a child psychiatric population.	On the one hand, a suitable response to daily stressors is crucial for adequate functioning in any natural environment. On the other hand, depending on the individual's genetic makeup, prolonged stress that is accompanied by an inappropriate level of responsiveness may lead to physiological and psychiatric disorders. Several psychiatric conditions have been linked with stress and alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity. While stress is a general phenomenon, illness is only seen in a proportion of individuals, suggesting that genetic factors may play a role in the ability to cope with stress. In children, relatively little research has been conducted to determine the impact of genetic factors on the variability in HPA axis functioning. In the present exploratory investigation, 106 prepubertal children were studied to estimate the impact of four glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) polymorphisms (NR3C1-1 [rs10482605], ER22/23EK [rs6190], N363S [rs6195], N766N [rs6196]) and five arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptor 1b gene (AVPR1b) polymorphisms (AVPR1b_s1 [rs28536160], AVPR1b_s2 [rs28373064], AVPR1b_s3 [rs33976516], AVPR1b_s4 [rs33985287], AVPR1b_s5 [rs33933482]) on cortisol responses after a psychosocial stress test (public speaking task). ER22/23EK carriers had significantly lower cortisol responses to psychosocial stress compared with noncarriers. These findings provide evidence for the relevance of the ER22/23EK polymorphism in childhood HPA axis regulation. However, the small number of ER22/23EK subjects does not allow us to draw definitive conclusions about the genotypic effect. 	Psychiatry_Res	D016428 D013485
23275708	20130101	Structure based design of compounds from natural sources for diabetes and inflammation.	Medicinal plants and marine sources are important elements of indigenous medical systems worldwide. The natural drugs from medicinal plants and marine sources have received considerable interest in treatment of diabetes and inflammation. Based on literature, alpha glucosidase, aldose reductase and PTP1B enzymes were chosen as anti-diabetes targets and PLA(2) was chosen for the anti-inflammatory target. In our study, plant and bromophenols (BPs) inhibitors were screened using High Throughput Virtual screening (HTVS) followed by Induced Fit Docking (IFD) studies were carried out against diabetes and inflammation targets. The IFD result of natural inhibitors has showed favorable docking score, glide energy and hydrogen bonds interactions with the active site residues. Some of the natural inhibitors successively satisfied all the in silico parameters among the others and seem to be potent inhibitors against diabetes and inflammation. 	Bioinformation	D016428
22647463	20120601	Survey of pyrethroid and organophosphate resistance in Brazilian field populations of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus: detection of C190A mutation in domain II of the para-type sodium channel gene.	The cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus causes expressive damage to livestock in Brazil and other countries. Its control is becoming more difficult due to the development of resistance in populations. Early detection of resistance can help in developing effective control strategies. This study evaluated the susceptibility of R. microplus to cypermethrin and chlorpyriphos and was the first attempt to identify the mechanism of resistance (target site insensitivity) in cattle tick populations from Minas Gerais state (Southeastern Brazil). Engorged female ticks were collected from 10 ranches within the state of Minas Gerais, and susceptibility was evaluated with the larval packet test (LPT) using technical grade cypermethrin and chlorpyriphos. It was possible to analyze LPT results of seven populations. Target site insensitivity was investigated in all 10 isolates by using molecular approaches for detection of the T2134A substitution within the domain III S6 segment and the C190A in the domain II S4-5 linker from the para-type sodium channel gene. LPT showed that all seven populations were resistant to cypermethrin with resistance ratio (RR) ranging from 16.0 to 25.0 and 85.7% were resistant to chlorpyriphos (RR=2.2-15.6). Although the T2134A mutation was not detected, the C190A mutation was highly prevalent, being present in 82-100% of the alleles sampled in field populations. A significant correlation was found between the LC50 values for cypermethrin and the frequency of the C190A mutation suggesting that it might be responsible for the phenotypic resistance detected.

12097806	20020705	A polymorphism of the norepinephrine transporter gene in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia: lack of association.	Norepinephrine is one of the neurotransmitters which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of mood disorders and schizophrenia. The norepinephrine transporter (NET) gene may be a candidate gene for the study of the genetics of these disorders. In this study, 198 patients with schizophrenia and 100 patients with bipolar disorder were analysed for a silent mutation 1287 A/G, located in the coding region (exon 9) of the NET gene, to determine the association between this polymorphism of the NET gene and bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. No association was found between the studied polymorphism of the NET gene and either bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. 	Neuropsychobiology	D003160 D016428 D013485
23550137	20130404	Physical and Genetic Interactions Between Uls1 and the Slx5-Slx8 SUMO-Targeted Ubiquitin Ligase.	The Slx5-Slx8 complex is a ubiquitin ligase that preferentially ubiquitylates SUMOylated substrates, targeting them for proteolysis. Mutations in SLX5, SLX8, and other SUMO pathway genes were previously identified in our laboratory as genomic suppressors of a point mutation (mot1-301) in the transcriptional regulator MOT1 To further understand the links between the SUMO and ubiquitin pathways, a screen was performed for high-copy suppressors of mot1-301, yielding three genes (MOT3, MIT1, and ULS1). MOT3 and MIT1 have characteristics of prions, and ULS1 is believed to encode another SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) that functionally overlaps with Slx5-Slx8. Here we focus on ULS1, obtaining results suggesting that the relationship between ULS1 and SLX5 is more complex than expected. Uls1 interacted with Slx5 physically in to yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays, a uls1 mutation that blocked the interaction between Uls1 and Slx5 interfered with ULS1 function, and genetic analyses indicated an antagonistic relationship between ULS1 and SLX5 Combined, our results challenge the assumption that Uls1 and Slx5 are simply partially overlapping STUbLs and begin to illuminate a regulatory relationship between these two proteins.

22759583	20120705	Modeling regionalized volumetric differences in protein-ligand binding cavities.	Identifying elements of protein structures that create differences in protein-ligand binding specificity is an essential method for explaining the molecular mechanisms underlying preferential binding. In some cases, influential mechanisms can be visually identified by experts in structural biology, but subtler mechanisms, whose significance may only be apparent from the analysis of many structures, are harder to find. To assist this process, we present a geometric algorithm and two statistical models for identifying significant structural differences in protein-ligand binding cavities. We demonstrate these methods in an analysis of sequentially nonredundant structural representatives of the canonical serine proteases and the enolase superfamily. Here, we observed that statistically significant structural variations identified experimentally established determinants of specificity. We also observed that an analysis of individual regions inside cavities can reveal areas where small differences in shape can correspond to differences in specificity. 	Proteome_Sci	D016428
22822383	20120724	In-Frame Deletion and Missense Mutations of the C-Terminal Helicase Domain of SMARCA2 in Three Patients with Nicolaides-Baraitser Syndrome.	Using high-resolution molecular karyotyping with SNP arrays to identify candidate genes for etiologically unexplained intellectual disability, we identified a 32-kb de novo in-frame deletion of the C-terminal helicase domain of the SMARCA2 gene in a patient with severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, sparse hair, prominent joints, and distinct facial anomalies. Sequencing of the gene in patients with a similar phenotype revealed de novo missense mutations in this domain in 2 further patients, pointing to a crucial role of the SMARCA2 C-terminal helicase domain. The clinical features observed in all 3 patients are typical of Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome, an only rarely reported syndrome with mainly moderate to severe intellectual disability. Notably, one of our patients with a p.Gly1132Asp mutation showed typical morphological features but an exceptional good development with borderline overall IQ and learning difficulties, thus expanding the phenotypic spectrum of Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome.

23900445	20130801	Genetic association analysis of 30 genes related to obesity in a European American population.	Obesity, which is frequently associated with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, is primarily the result of a net excess of caloric intake over energy expenditure. Human obesity is highly heritable, but the specific genes mediating susceptibility in non-syndromic obesity remain unclear. We tested candidate genes in pathways related to food intake and energy expenditure for association with body mass index (BMI). We reanalyzed 355 common genetic variants of 30 candidate genes in seven molecular pathways related to obesity in 1982 unrelated European Americans from the New York Cancer Project. Data were analyzed by using a Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model. The BMIs were log-transformed and then adjusted for covariates, including age, age(2), gender and diabetes status. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were modeled as additive effects. With the stipulated adjustments, nine SNPs in eight genes were significantly associated with BMI: ghrelin (GHRL; rs35683), agouti-related peptide (AGRP; rs5030980), carboxypeptidase E (CPE; rs1946816 and rs4481204), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R; rs2268641), serotonin receptors (HTR2A; rs912127), neuropeptide Y receptor (NPY5R;Y5R1c52), suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3; rs4969170) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3; rs4796793). We also found a gender-by-SNP interaction (rs1745837 in HTR2A), which indicated that variants in the gene HTR2A had a stronger association with BMI in males. In addition, NPY1R was detected as having a significant gene effect even though none of the SNPs in this gene was significant. Variations in genes AGRP, CPE, GHRL, GLP1R, HTR2A, NPY1R, NPY5R, SOCS3 and STAT3 showed modest associations with BMI in European Americans. The pathways in which these genes participate regulate energy intake, and thus these associations are mechanistically plausible in this context. 	Int_J_Obes_(Lond)	D016428 D052061 D013485
12361251	20021004	Pseudomonas grimontii sp. nov.	The vernacular name 'fluorescent Pseudomonas group 97-514' was coined for a group of 43 strains isolated from two French natural mineral waters. All these strains were gram-negative, rod-shaped and motile by means of a single polar flagellum. They produced fluorescent pigment (pyoverdin) on King B medium, catalase and cytochrome oxidase. They were capable of respiratory but not fermentative metabolism. They were not able to accumulate poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate and possessed an arginine dihydrolase system. DNA-DNA relatedness studies (S1 nuclease method) showed that the 43 strains of 'fluorescent Pseudomonas group 97-514' formed a genetically homogeneous group (DNA-DNA relatedness ranged from 70 to 100%). A total of 76 strains representing well-known or partially characterized species of the genus Pseudomonas sensu stricto had 7-56% DNA hybridization with strain CFML 97-514T. The highest DNA binding values were found with Pseudomonas veronii CIP 104663T (52%), Pseudomonas rhodesiae CIP 104664T (56%), Pseudomonas marginalis ATCC 10844T (56%), Pseudomonas gessardii CIP 105469T (53%) and Pseudomonas cedrella CIP 105541T (52%). Their unrelatedness was confirmed by deltaTm values greater than 7 degrees C. On the basis of the results of phenotypic and DNA-DNA hybridization studies, a novel Pseudomonas species, Pseudomonas grimontii sp. nov., is proposed for the 43 strains of 'fluorescent Pseudomonas group 97-514'. The type strain is strain CFML 97-514T (= CIP 106645T = ATCC BAA-140T). The G+C content of the DNA of the type strain was 58 mol%. A comparison of the complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of the type strain CFML 97-514T and the sequence of other strains of the genus Pseudomonas revealed that the novel species fell within the 'Pseudomonas fluorescens intrageneric cluster'. Members of P. grimontii grew at 4 degrees C but not at 41 degrees C. They were able to use D-xylose, alpha-L-rhamnose, alpha-aminobutyrate, meso-erythritol and itaconate as sole sources of carbon and energy and formed levan from sucrose. Strains do not possess lecithinase or Tween esterase activities. The clinical significance of P. grimontii is unknown. 	Int._J._Syst._Evol._Microbiol.	D016428
24442397	20140121	Recent progress on molecular breeding of rice in China.	Molecular breeding of rice for high yield, superior grain quality, and strong environmental adaptability is crucial for feeding the world's rapidly growing population. The increasingly cloned quantitative trait loci and genes, genome variations, and haplotype blocks related to agronomically important traits in rice have provided a solid foundation for direct selection and molecular breeding, and a number of genes have been successfully introgressed into mega varieties of rice. Here we summarize China's great achievements in molecular breeding of rice in the following five traits: high yield, biotic stress resistance, abiotic stress resistance, quality and physiology. Further, the prospect of rice breeding by molecular design is discussed. 	Plant_Cell_Rep.	D016428 D016454
9746514	19980924	Mutations in the EF-hand motif impair the inactivation of barium currents of the cardiac alpha1C channel.	Calcium-dependent inactivation has been described as a negative feedback mechanism for regulating voltage-dependent calcium influx in cardiac cells. Most recent evidence points to the C-terminus of the alpha1C subunit, with its EF-hand binding motif, as being critical in this process. The EF-hand binding motif is mostly conserved between the C-termini of six of the seven alpha1 subunit Ca2+ channel genes. The role of E1537 in the C-terminus of the alpha1C calcium channel inactivation was investigated here after expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Whole-cell currents were measured in the presence of 10 mM Ba2+ or 10 mM Ca2+ after intracellular injection of 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. Against all expectations, our results showed a significant reduction in the rate of voltage-dependent inactivation as measured in Ba2+ solutions for all E1537 mutants, whereas calcium-dependent inactivation appeared unscathed. Replacing the negatively charged glutamate residue by neutral glutamine, glycine, serine, or alanine significantly reduced the rate of Ba2+-dependent inactivation by 1.5-fold (glutamine) to 3.5-fold (alanine). The overall rate of macroscopic inactivation measured in Ca2+ solutions was also reduced, although a careful examination of the distribution of the fast and slow time constants suggests that only the slow time constant was significantly reduced in the mutant channels. The fast time constant, the hallmark of Ca2+-dependent inactivation, remained remarkably constant among wild-type and mutant channels. Moreover, inactivation of E1537A channels, in both Ca2+ and Ba2+ solutions, appeared to decrease with membrane depolarization, whereas inactivation of wild-type channels became faster with positive voltages. All together, our results showed that E1537 mutations impaired voltage-dependent inactivation and suggest that the proximal part of the C-terminus may play a role in voltage-dependent inactivation in L-type alpha1C channels.

24950683	20140622	A feasibility study to develop a diabetes prevention program for young adults with prediabetes by using digital platforms and a handheld device.	The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an age-specific diabetes prevention program in young adults with prediabetes. A one-group pretest-posttest design was used. The inclusion criteria were age 18 to 29 years and the presence of prediabetes (either impaired fasting glucose of 100-125 mg/dL [5.55-6.94 mmol/L] or A1C of 5.7%-6.4%). Fifteen participants were enrolled in the study. A technology-based lifestyle coaching program focused on diet and physical activity and incorporating a handheld device and digital platforms was developed and tested. Psychosocial factors (health literacy, illness perception, self-efficacy, therapeutic efficacy) based on social cognitive theory, changes in diet and physical activity, and cardiometabolic risk factors were assessed at baseline and week 12 after the intervention. A paired-samples t test was performed to examine changes between baseline and postintervention on each psychosocial and physical variable. Participants' (n = 13 completers) mean age was 24.4 ? 2.2 years, 23.1% were male, and 53.8% were African American. Overall, the participants were satisfied with the intervention (mean score, 4.15 on a 5-point, Likert-type scale). Between pre- and posttesting, mean body mass index and mean A1C decreased from 41.0 ? 7.3 kg/m(2) and 6.0 ? 0.5% to 40.1 ? 7.0 kg/m(2) and 5.6 ? 0.5%, respectively, whereas mean fasting glucose did not significantly change (from 92.6 ? 11 to 97.6 ? 14.3 mg/dL [5.14 ? 0.61 to 5.42 ? 0.79 mmol/L]). The intervention resulted in reduced A1C and a trend toward decreased body mass index in obese sedentary young adults with prediabetes after 12 weeks. Further study through a randomized clinical trial with a longer intervention period is warranted. 	Diabetes_Educ	D016428 D052061 D013485
11529872	20010901	HFE mutations, iron deficiency and overload in 10,500 blood donors.	People with genetic haemochromatosis (GH) accumulate iron from excessive dietary absorption. In populations of northern European origin, over 90% of patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. While about 1 in 200 people in the general population have this genotype the proportion who develop clinical haemochromatosis is not known. The influence of HFE genotype on iron status was investigated in 10 556 blood donors. The allele frequencies of the C282Y and H63D mutations were 8.23% and 15.3% respectively. Heterozygosity for C282Y occurred in 1 in 7.9 donors, for H63D in 1 in 4.2 donors, and 1 in 42 were compound heterozygotes. Homozygosity for H63D occurred in 1 in 42 donors and 1 in 147 (72) were homozygous for C282Y. Mean values increased for transferrin saturation (TS) and serum ferritin (sFn), and decreased for unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) in the order: donors lacking the mutations, H63D heterozygotes, C282Y heterozygotes, H63D homozygotes, compound heterozygotes and C282Y homozygotes, but serum ferritin (sFn) concentrations were no higher in H63D heterozygotes and C282Y heterozygous women than in donors lacking mutations. The percentage of donors failing the screening test for anaemia or of those with sFn &lt; 15 microg/l did not differ among the genotype groups. C282Y and H63D heterozygotes and donors homozygous for H63D were at no greater risk of iron accumulation than donors lacking mutations, of whom 1 in 1200 had both a raised TS and sFn. The risk was higher for compound heterozygotes (1 in 80, P = 0.003) and for C282Y homozygotes (1 in 5, P &lt; 0.0001). There was no correlation between sFn and either age or donation frequency in C282Y homozygotes. None of the 63 C282Y homozygous donors interviewed showed physical signs of overload or were aware of relatives with haemochromatosis. The Welsh Blood Service collects blood from about 140 000 people each year including an estimated 950 who are homozygous for HFE C282Y. They are probably healthy and unaware of any family history of iron overload. 	Br._J._Haematol.	D016428 D013485
1468623	19921101	N-terminal mutations modulate yeast SNF1 protein kinase function.	The SNF1 protein kinase is required for expression of glucose-repressed genes in response to glucose deprivation. The SNF4 protein is physically associated with SNF1 and positively affects the kinase activity. We report here the characterization of a dominant mutation, SNF1-G53R, that was isolated as a suppressor of the requirement for SNF4. The mutant SNF1-G53R protein is still responsive to SNF4 but has greatly elevated kinase activity in immune complex assays; in contrast, the activity is wild type in a protein blot assay. Deletion of the region N-terminal to the kinase domain (codons 5-52) reduces kinase activity in vitro, but the mutant SNF1-delta N kinase is still dependent on SNF4. The N terminus is not required for the regulatory response to glucose. In gel filtration chromatography, the SNF1, SNF1-G53R and SNF1-delta N protein showed different elution profiles, consistent with differential formation of high molecular weight complexes. Taken together, the results suggest that the N terminus positively affects the function of the SNF1 kinase and may be involved in interaction with a positive effector other than SNF4. We also showed that the conserved threonine residue 210 in subdomain VIII, which is a phosphorylation site in other kinases, is essential for SNF1 activity. Finally, we present evidence that when the C terminus is deleted, overexpression of the SNF1 kinase domain is deleterious to the cell. 	Genetics	D016428 D013485 D013486 D013487
26497743	20151027	Complexity of FGFR signalling in metastatic urothelial cancer.	Urothelial cancers (UC) are the fourth most common tumours worldwide after prostate (or breast), lung and colorectal cancer. Despite recent improvements in their management, UC remain an aggressive disease associated with a poor outcome. Following disease progression on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, very few effective treatment options are available and none of them have shown significant improvement in overall survival. Alterations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) pathway including amplification, mutations and overexpression are common in UC. Pre-clinical data suggest that the presence of such dysregulations may confer sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors. We present here the case of a patient with a metastatic UC of the renal pelvis with lymph node metastases treated with the selective FGFR inhibitor AZD4547. To date, the patient has been on a study drug for 32?months with acceptable tolerance and maintained radiological partial response as per RECIST 1.1 criteria. Exploratory biomarker analysis showed FGFR3, FGFR1, FGF-ligand and fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2) expression in the patient's tumour, together with the presence of a germ-line mutation in the FGFR3 extracellular binding domain. This is not a known hotspot mutation, and the functional significance remains unclear. The FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 exhibits antitumour activity in a metastatic urothelial cancer displaying FGFR1, FGFR3, FGF-ligand and FRS2 expression. This lends support to the further exploration of FGFR inhibitors in urothelial cancer. Further studies are required to determinate the most effective way to select those patients most likely to respond. 	J_Hematol_Oncol	D002363 D016428
15820214	20050412	The requirement for the hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of Ypk1 in yeast differs depending on the downstream events, including endocytosis, cell growth, and resistance to a sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibitor, ISP-1.	ISP-1 inhibits de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis and induces growth defects in both mammals and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). In our previous study, YPK1/SLI2 was identified as one of multicopy suppressor genes for ISP-1 in yeast. Ypk1 is proposed to be a downstream serine/threonine kinase of the sphingolipid signaling pathway in yeast. Other than resistance against ISP-1, Ypk1 is involved in at least two downstream events, namely cell growth and endocytosis. In this study, the effect of mutants of Ypk1 on these three downstream events was investigated. Among Ypk1 mutants, no 'kinase-dead' mutants complemented the defects in any of these three downstream events in the ypk1 null strain. One of the hydrophobic motif phosphorylation-deficient mutants of Ypk1, Ypk1(T662A) had the moderate kinase activity compared with the wild-type Ypk1. Ypk1(T662A) and the wild-type Ypk1 completely restored the slow-growth phenotype and fluid-phase endocytosis defect of the ypk1 null strain. However, unlike the wild-type Ypk1, Ypk1(T662A) lost the ability for the recovery of the ISP-1 resistance in the ypk1 null strain. Furthermore, the expression of Ypk1(T662A) in the wild-type strain showed a dominant-negative effect on the ISP-1-resistance activity. On the other hand, the cell growth revertant of the ypk1 null strain still showed the hypersensitive phenotype to ISP-1. These data suggest that the ISP-1-resistance pathway is under the regulation of the hydrophobic motif phosphorylation and is separated from the other pathways downstream of Ypk1.

21627550	20110602	Innate immune system gene polymorphisms in maternal and child genotype and risk of preterm delivery.	There is little information about the combination of genetic variability in pregnant women and their children in relation to the risk of preterm delivery (PTD). In a sub-cohort of 487 non-Hispanic white and 288 African-American mother/child pairs, the Pregnancy Outcomes and Community Health Study assessed 10 functional polymorphisms in 9 genes involved in innate immune function. Race-stratified weighted logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios for genotype and PTD/PTD subtypes. Polymorphisms significantly associated with PTD/PTD subtypes were tested for mother/child genotype interactions. Three maternal polymorphisms (IL-1 receptor antagonist intron two repeat (IL-1RN), matrix metalloproteinase- -C1562T, and TNF receptor two M196R (TNFR2)) and three child polymorphisms (IL1-RN, tumor necrosis factor-alpha -G308A, and TNFR2) were associated with PTD, but associations varied by PTD subtype and race. Two interactions were detected for maternal and child genotype. Among non-Hispanic white women, the odds of PTD was higher when both mother and child carried the IL-1RN allele two (additive interaction p &lt; 0.05). Among African-American women, the odds of PTD were higher when both mother and child carried the TNFR2 R allele (multiplicative interaction p &lt; 0.05). These results highlight the importance of assessing both maternal and child genotype in relation to PTD risk. 	J._Matern._Fetal._Neonatal._Med.	D016428 D052061 D013487
11916071	20020328	Factor XIII-circulating levels and the Val34Leu polymorphism in the healthy male relatives of patients with severe coronary artery disease.	We aimed to investigate whether increased levels of FXIII and/or a low prevalence of the protective Leu allele (of the Val34Leu FXIII polymorphism) occur in relatives of patients with severe CAD. 185 healthy male relatives aged 65 or less were recruited from 125 patients with multi-vessel CAD and compared to 185 healthy, age-matched controls. The relatives and controls were similar in terms of clinical parameters. FXIII B-subunit levels were elevated in relatives, 1.11 microg/mL (1.08-1.14), compared with controls, 1.00 microg/mL (0.97-1.04), P &lt;0.0001 but FXIII A2B2 levels did not differ between the groups. There was a strong correlation between FXIII B-subunit and the insulin resistance syndrome, however, adjusted B-subunit levels remained significantly higher in relatives. There was no difference in genotype frequency at the FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism between relatives and controls. FXIII B-subunit levels are elevated in the relatives of CAD patients and this is independent of other cardiovascular risk factors. 	Thromb._Haemost.	D016428 D013485
19590397	20090711	5-HTR1A, 5-HTR2A, 5-HTR6, TPH1 and TPH2 polymorphisms and major depression.	Genes that regulate the serotonin signalling system are potential targets for research in the aetiology of mood disorders and also in the treatment response of serotonin reuptake inhibitors. In this study, we evaluated the association of seven serotonin signal transduction-linked single nucleotide polymorphisms [HTR1A (rs6295), HTR2A (rs6313, rs6311 and rs7997012), HTR6 (rs1805054), TPH1 (rs1800532) and TPH2 (rs1386494)] with major depressive disorder and/or treatment outcome with serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Patients who met the criteria for major depressive disorder were treated for 6 weeks with fluoxetine, paroxetine or citalopram. The treatment response was evaluated with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and according to predefined response criteria, the patients were divided into responders, nonresponders, remitters and nonremitters. Altogether, 86 patients completed the entire study according to the study protocol. We had also a control population (N = 395) of healthy blood donors. None of the seven single nucleotide polymorphisms was associated with major depressive disorder or with treatment response in our study population of Finnish individuals.

23383341	20130206	A reliable way to detect endogenous murine ?-amyloid.	Unraveling the normal physiologic role of ?-amyloid is likely crucial to understanding the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. However, progress on this question is currently limited by the high background of many ELISAs for murine ?-amyloid. Here, we examine the background signal of several murine ?-amyloid ELISAs, and conclude that the majority of the background is from non-APP derived proteins. Most importantly, we identify ELISAs that eliminate this background signal. 	PLoS_ONE	D003160 D023362 D016428 D052061 D013485
23110512	20121101	Strategies for implementing genomic selection in family-based aquaculture breeding schemes: double haploid sib test populations.	Simulation studies have shown that accuracy and genetic gain are increased in genomic selection schemes compared to traditional aquaculture sib-based schemes. In genomic selection, accuracy of selection can be maximized by increasing the precision of the estimation of SNP effects and by maximizing the relationships between test sibs and candidate sibs. Another means of increasing the accuracy of the estimation of SNP effects is to create individuals in the test population with extreme genotypes. The latter approach was studied here with creation of double haploids and use of non-random mating designs. Six alternative breeding schemes were simulated in which the design of the test population was varied: test sibs inherited maternal (Mat), paternal (Pat) or a mixture of maternal and paternal (MatPat) double haploid genomes or test sibs were obtained by maximum coancestry mating (MaxC), minimum coancestry mating (MinC), or random (RAND) mating. Three thousand test sibs and 3000 candidate sibs were genotyped. The test sibs were recorded for a trait that could not be measured on the candidates and were used to estimate SNP effects. Selection was done by truncation on genome-wide estimated breeding values and 100 individuals were selected as parents each generation, equally divided between both sexes. Results showed a 7 to 19% increase in selection accuracy and a 6 to 22% increase in genetic gain in the MatPat scheme compared to the RAND scheme. These increases were greater with lower heritabilities. Among all other scenarios, i.e. Mat, Pat, MaxC, and MinC, no substantial differences in selection accuracy and genetic gain were observed. In conclusion, a test population designed with a mixture of paternal and maternal double haploids, i.e. the MatPat scheme, increases substantially the accuracy of selection and genetic gain. This will be particularly interesting for traits that cannot be recorded on the selection candidates and require the use of sib tests, such as disease resistance and meat quality. 	Genet._Sel._Evol.

24821953	20140514	Blue-light-activated phototropin2 trafficking from the cytoplasm to Golgi/post-Golgi vesicles.	Phototropins are plasma membrane-localized UVA/blue light photoreceptors which mediate phototropism, inhibition of primary hypocotyl elongation, leaf positioning, chloroplast movements, and stomatal opening. Blue light irradiation activates the C-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain of phototropin which autophosphorylates the receptor. Arabidopsis thaliana encodes two phototropins, phot1 and phot2. In response to blue light, phot1 moves from the plasma membrane into the cytosol and phot2 translocates to the Golgi complex. In this study the molecular mechanism and route of blue-light-induced phot2 trafficking are demonstrated. It is shown that Atphot2 behaves in a similar manner when expressed transiently under 35S or its native promoter. The phot2 kinase domain but not blue-light-mediated autophosphorylation is required for the receptor translocation. Using co-localization and western blotting, the receptor was shown to move from the cytoplasm to the Golgi complex, and then to the post-Golgi structures. The results were confirmed by brefeldin A (an inhibitor of the secretory pathway) which disrupted phot2 trafficking. An association was observed between phot2 and the light chain2 of clathrin via bimolecular fluorescence complementation. The fluorescence was observed at the plasma membrane. The results were confirmed using co-immunoprecipitation. However, tyrphostin23 (an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis) and wortmannin (a suppressor of receptor endocytosis) were not able to block phot2 trafficking, indicating no involvement of receptor endocytosis in the formation of phot2 punctuate structures. Protein turnover studies indicated that the receptor was continuously degraded in both darkness and blue light. The degradation of phot2 proceeded via a transport route different from translocation to the Golgi complex. 	J._Exp._Bot.	D016428 D013485
1486703	19921101	Deletion delta F508 and clinical expression of cystic fibrosis-related liver disease.	A study of liver function in 108 adult cystic fibrosis patients showed that 20 had established liver disease, and that these had significantly better pulmonary function than the subgroup without liver disease. The relative risk of liver disease for homozygotes vs heterozygotes was 2:1 in our series. Four of the liver patients had a sibling with CF, but three of the sibships were discordant for liver disease. Environmental or genetic factors other than the deletion Delta F508 may influence the development of cystic fibrosis-related liver disease. 	Clin._Genet.	D016428
9374476	19971231	Dual specificity of the interleukin 1- and tumor necrosis factor-activated beta casein kinase.	Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 1 (IL1) activate a protein kinase, TIP kinase, which phosphorylates beta casein in vitro. We have now identified its main phosphorylation site on beta casein, Ser124 (Km approximately 28 mu M), and a minor phosphorylation site, Ser142 (Km approximately 0.7 mM). The sequence motif that determined the phosphorylation of Ser124 by the kinase was studied with synthetic peptides bearing deletions or substitutions of the neighboring residues. This allowed synthesis of improved substrates (Km approximately 6 mu M) and showed that efficient phosphorylation of Ser124 was favored by the presence of large hydrophobic residues at positions +1, +9, +11, and +13 (counted relative to the position of the phosphoacceptor amino acid) and of a cysteine at position -2. Peptides in which Ser124 was replaced by tyrosine were also phosphorylated by TIP kinase, showing it to have dual specificity. It is unable to phosphorylate the MAP kinases in vitro and is therefore not directly involved in their activation. Its biochemical characteristics indicate that TIP kinase is a novel dual specificity kinase, perhaps related to the mixed lineage kinases. It copurified with a phosphoprotein of about 95 kDa, which could correspond either to the autophosphorylated kinase or to an associated substrate. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
27308339	20160617	Epigenetic regulation of LSD1 during mammary carcinogenesis.	Inheritable epigenetic regulation is integral to the dynamic control of gene expression under different stimuli for cellular homeostasis and disease progression. Histone methylation is a common and important type of chromatin modification. LSD1, the first known histone lysine-specific demethylase, operates as a key component of several corepressor complexes during development and in disease states. In this review, we focus on the regulation of LSD1 in mammary carcinogenesis. LSD1 plays a role in promoting mammary tumor metastasis and proliferation and in maintaining mammary cancer stem cells. Therefore, LSD1 represents a viable therapeutic target for effective treatment of mammary carcinogenesis. 	Mol_Cell_Oncol	D016428 D016454
27422051	20160717	Transthyretin amyloid neuropathy has earlier neural involvement but better prognosis than primary amyloid counterpart: an answer to the paradox?	To systematically compare transthyretin with primary amyloid neuropathy to define their natural history and the underlying mechanisms for differences in phenotype and natural history. All patients with defined amyloid subtype and peripheral neuropathy who completed autonomic testing and electromyography at Mayo Clinic Rochester between 1993 and 2013 were included. Medical records were reviewed for time of onset of defined clinical features. The degree of autonomic impairment was quantified using the composite autonomic severity scale. Comparisons were made between acquired and inherited forms of amyloidosis. One hundred one cases of amyloidosis with peripheral neuropathy were identified, 60 primary and 41 transthyretin. Twenty transthyretin cases were found to have Val30Met mutations; 21 had other mutations. Compared to primary cases, transthyretin cases had longer survival, longer time to diagnosis, higher composite autonomic severity scale scores, greater reduction of upper limb nerve conduction study amplitudes, more frequent occurrence of weakness, and later non-neuronal systemic involvement. Four systemic markers (cardiac involvement by echocardiogram, weight loss?&gt;?10 pounds, orthostatic intolerance, fatigue) in combination were highly predictive of poor survival in both groups. These findings suggest that transthyretin has earlier and greater predilection for neural involvement and more delayed systemic involvement. The degree and rate of systemic involvement is most closely related to prognosis. Ann Neurol 2016;80:401-411. 	Ann._Neurol.	D003160 D016428
27533707	20160818	Mutations in the D'D3 region of VWF traditionally associated with type 1 VWD lead to quantitative and qualitative deficiencies of VWF.	Type 1 von Willebrand disease (VWD) is characterized by low plasma levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and clinical bleeding. Several mechanisms have been described that cause a decrease in plasma VWF levels in VWD, and the goal of this study was to elucidate the pathogenic origins of VWD for a group of mutations in the VWF D'D3 region traditionally associated with type 1 VWD. Varying ratios of mutant-to-wild-type VWF were expressed in two cell lines in order to study the intracellular location, multimer assembly, secretion and function of VWF. We identified four mutants (M771I, Y1146C, T1156M, R782Q) that caused defective intracellular packaging and markedly reduced VWF secretion. Consistent with previous reports, Y1146C and T1156M VWF led to a loss of high molecular weight multimers. In a functional analysis, Y1146C demonstrated a novel FVIII binding defect. Mutations R924W and I1094T were processed normally and did not show abnormal FVIII binding suggesting that other mechanisms such as plasma clearance or platelet binding defects may contribute to the pathogenicity of these mutants.

24031026	20130914	Targeting of magnolin on ERKs inhibits Ras/ERKs/RSK2-signaling-mediated neoplastic cell transformation.	Mitogen-activated protein kinases play a key role in cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and cell transformation, and activated Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs)/ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) signaling pathways have been widely identified in many solid tumors. In this study, we found that magnolin, a compound found in the Magnolia species, directly targeted and inhibited ERK1 and ERK2 kinase activities with IC50 values of 87 and 16.5 nM by competing with adenosine triphosphate in an active pocket. Further, we demonstrated that magnolin inhibited epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced p90RSKs phosphorylation at Thr359/Ser363, but not ERKs phosphorylation at Thr202/Tyr204, and this resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation by suppression of the G1/S cell cycle transition. Additionally, p38 kinases, Jun N-terminal kinases and Akts were not involved in the magnolin-mediated inhibitory signaling. Magnolin targeting of ERK1 and 2 activities suppressed the phosphorylation of RSK2 and downstream target proteins including ATF1 and c-Jun and AP-1, a dimer of Jun/Fos, and the transactivation activities of ATF1 and AP-1. Notably, ERKs inhibition by magnolin suppressed EGF-induced anchorage-independent cell transformation and colony growth of Ras(G12V)-harboring A549 human lung cancer cells and NIH3T3 cells stably expressing Ras(G12V) in soft agar. Taken together, these results demonstrated that magnolin might be a naturally occurring chemoprevention and therapeutic agent capable of inhibiting cell proliferation and transformation by targeting ERK1 and ERK2.

24643471	20140320	Common ?2A and ?2C adrenergic receptor polymorphisms do not affect plasma membrane trafficking.	Various naturally occurring polymorphic forms of human G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been identified and linked to diverse pathological diseases, including receptors for vasopressin type 2 (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) and gonadotropin releasing hormone (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism). In most cases, polymorphic amino acid mutations disrupt protein folding, altering receptor function as well as plasma membrane expression. Other pathological GPCR variants have been found that do not alter receptor function, but instead affect only plasma membrane trafficking (e.g., delta opiate and histamine type 1 receptors). Thus, altered membrane trafficking with retained receptor function may be another mechanism causing polymorphic GPCR dysfunction. Two common human ?2A and ?2C adrenergic receptor (AR) variants have been identified (?2A N251K and ?2C ?322-325 ARs), but pharmacological analysis of ligand binding and second messenger signaling has not consistently demonstrated altered receptor function. However, possible alterations in plasma membrane trafficking have not been investigated. We utilized a systematic approach previously developed for the study of GPCR trafficking motifs and accessory proteins to assess whether these ?2 AR variants affected intracellular trafficking or plasma membrane expression. By combining immunofluorescent microscopy, glycosidic processing analysis, and quantitative fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS), we demonstrate that neither variant receptor had altered intracellular localization, glycosylation, nor plasma membrane expression compared to wild-type ?2 ARs. Therefore, pathopharmacological properties of ?2A N251K and ?2C ?322-325 ARs do not appear to be due to altered receptor pharmacology or plasma membrane trafficking, but may involve interactions with other intracellular signaling cascades or proteins.

10702204	20000304	Polarized transport of hydrophilic compounds across rat colonic mucosa from serosa to mucosa is temperature dependent.	In both clinical and experimental studies, intestinal epithelial barrier function is routinely assessed by measuring mucosal permeability to various hydrophilic compounds. We performed experiments to determine whether permeation of several hydrophilic compounds across rat colonic mucosa is polarized. Sheets of colonic mucosa, stripped of the underlying seromuscular coats, were mounted in Ussing chambers. The rates of permeation across colonic mucosa by numerous hydrophilic compounds (fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC]-dextrans with molecular weights of 4000 [FD4] and 70,000 [FD70] daltons, fluorescein disulfonic acid [FS], lucifer yellow [LY], lactulose, and mannitol) were several times greater in the serosal-to-mucosal (S--&gt;M) direction than in the opposite direction. Increased S--&gt;M permeation by FD4, lactulose, and mannitol was evident at 37 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C. Efflux of FD4 and FS in the S--&gt;M direction was dose-dependently inhibited by verapamil, an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein efflux system. Indomethacin, an anion transporter inhibitor, showed no effect on the S--&gt;M permeation of FD4, FD70, FS, or LY. Adding an excess of unlabeled dextran (mol wt, 10,000 daltons) dose-dependently decreased the S--&gt;M efflux of FD4, but not FS or LY. The transport across rat colonic mucosa of a number of hydrophilic substances, including some compounds that are commonly used to measure intestinal permeability in clinical practice, is greater in the S--&gt;M than in the M--&gt;S direction. S--&gt;M transport of these hydrophilic solutes is temperature dependent, suggesting that the process is an active one. S--&gt;M transport of FD4 may occur via a process that manifests some degree of substrate specificity for polysaccharides. 	Gastroenterology	D016428 D013487
19175981	20090130	[Molecular mechanisms of Glanzmann thrombasthenia caused by alpha II b L721R and Q860X compound heterozygous mutation].	To explore the molecular mechanisms of Glanzmann thrombasthenia caused by alpha II b L721R and Q860X compound heterozygous mutation. All exons and exon-intron boundaries of alpha II b and beta3 gene were amplified by PCR and analyzed by direct DNA sequencing. Gene polymorphisms were excluded by direct DNA sequencing. Alpha II b L721R and Q860X mutants expressing vectors were constructed by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis. The expression of alpha II b L721R and Q860X mutants on transfected cell membrane were analyzed by flow cytometry and the whole expression level was confirmed by Western blot. The subcellular localizations of alpha II b L721R and Q860X mutants were determined by immunofluorescent confocal scanning microscopy. The alpha II b compound heterozygous mutations, T2255G (L721R) and C2671T (Q860X), were identified in the proband, the former being inherited from the maternal side and the latter the paternal side. The 293T cells cotransfected with mutated alpha II b L721R and wild-type beta3 expression plasmids expressed 2.1% of normal amount of alpha II b on the cell surface as shown by FACS, in contrast to 31.9% of normal amount of alpha II b on the cells cotransfected with cDNAs of mutated alpha II b Q860X and wildtype beta3 expression plasmids. Western blot of the cell lysates showed no detectable mature alpha II b in cells lysates with L721R mutant. While, truncated alpha II b protein was detected in cell lystes with Q860X mutant. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that both L721R and Q860X mutant pro-alpha II bbeta33 complex colocalized in endoplasmic reticulum, but a little in Golgi. The L721R and Q860X mutations of alpha II b prevent transport of the pro-alpha II bbeta3 complex from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, hindering its maturation and surface expression. The impaired alpha II bbeta3 transport is responsible for the thrombasthenia. 	Zhonghua_Xue_Ye_Xue_Za_Zhi	D002363 D004740 D016428
26432564	20151004	Actinoplanes rhizophilus sp. nov., an actinomycete isolated from the rhizosphere of Sansevieria trifasciata Prain.	A novel actinomycete, designated strain NEAU-A-2T, was isolated from the rhizosphere soil of Sansevieria trifasciata Prain collected from Heilongjiang province, north-east China. The taxonomic status of this organism was established using a polyphasic approach. The isolate formed irregular sporangia containing motile spores on the substrate mycelium. The whole-cell sugars were xylose and galactose. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H10), MK-9(H2), MK-10(H2) and MK-10(H4). The major fatty acids were iso-C15?:?0, iso-C16?:?0 and anteiso-C15?:?0. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, three unidentified phospholipids and an unidentified glycolipid. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity studies showed that strain NEAU-A-2T belongs to the genus Actinoplanes with the highest sequence similarities to Actinoplanes globisporus NBRC 13912T (97.7?% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Actinoplanes ferrugineus IMSNU 22125T (97.5?%), Actinoplanes toevensis MN07-A0368T (97.2?%) and Actinoplanes rishiriensis NBRC 108556T (97.2?%); similarities to type strains of other species of this genus were &lt;?97?%. Two tree-making algorithms showed that strain NEAU-A-2T formed a distinct clade with A. globisporus NBRC 13912T and A. rishiriensis NBRC 108556T. However, low DNA-DNA relatedness values allowed the isolate to be differentiated from the above-mentioned two species of the genus Actinoplanes. Moreover, strain NEAU-A-2T could also be distinguished from the most closely related species by morphological and physiological characteristics. Therefore, in conclusion, isolate NEAU-A-2T represents a novel species of the genus Actinoplanes, for which the name Actinoplanes rhizophilus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NEAU-A-2T (?=?CGMCC 4.7133T?=?DSM 46672T). 	Int._J._Syst._Evol._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485
26951758	20160309	When intensity of deltamethrin resistance in Anopheles gambiae s.l. leads to loss of Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets bio-efficacy: a case study in north Cameroon.	In Cameroon, insecticide resistance in Anopheles (An.) gambiae s.l. has been reported in several foci, prompting further investigations on associated patterns of Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) bio-efficacy. The current study, conducted from June to August 2011, explored the intensity of deltamethrin resistance in An. gambiae s.l. from Pitoa and its impact on the residual bio-efficacy of LifeNet, a LLIN with deltamethrin incorporated into polypropylene nets (PND). Two-four days old females An. gambiae s.l. reared from larval collections in Pitoa were tested for susceptibility to DDT, permethrin and deltamethrin, using standard World Health Organization (WHO) tube assays. Intensity of deltamethrin resistance was explored using WHO tube assays, but across six working concentrations from 0.001 % to 0.5 %. Bio-efficacy of unwashed and washed PND was assessed using WHO cone test. Species identification and kdr 1014 genotyping were performed on mosquito samples that were not exposed to insecticides, using PCR-RFLP and HOLA methods respectively. The Kisumu reference susceptible strain of An. gambiae s.s. was used for comparisons. A total of 1895 An. gambiae s.l. specimens from Pitoa were used for resistance and PND bio-efficacy testing. This mosquito population was resistant to DDT, permethrin and deltamethrin, with 18-40 min knockdown times for 50 % of tested mosquitoes and 59-77 % mortality. Deltamethrin Resistance Ratio compared with the Kisumu strain was estimated at ?500 fold. LifeNets were effective against the susceptible Kisumu (100 % knockdown (KD60min) and mortality) and the resistant Pitoa samples (95 % KD60min, 83-95 % mortality). However, the bio-efficacy gradually dropped against the Pitoa samples when nets were washed (X (2)?=?35.887, df?=?8, p?&lt;?0.001), and fell under the WHO efficacy threshold (80 % mortality and/or 95 % KD60min) between 10 and 15 washes. The Pitoa samples were composed of three sibling species: An. arabiensis (132/154, 86 %), An. coluzzii (19/154, 12 %) and An. gambiae s.s. (3/154, 2 %). The kdr L1014F allele was found only in An. coluzzii (Npositive?=?13/19), at 34 % frequency and heterozygote stage. No specimen carried the kdr L1014S allele. The current study showed that LifeNet might still offer some protection against the resistant An. gambiae s.l. population from Pitoa, provided appropriate dose of insecticide is available on the nets.

23824842	20130705	Pelger-huet anomaly and a mild skeletal phenotype secondary to mutations in LBR.	The Lamin B receptor (LBR) gene has been described to encode a bifunctional protein. Mutations in the LBR gene can affect neutrophil segmentation and sterol reductase activity and have been associated with two different recognized clinical conditions, Pelger-Huet anomaly (PHA) and Greenberg skeletal dysplasia. PHA is a benign autosomal co-dominant laminopathy resulting in bilobed neutrophil nuclei in heterozygotes, and unsegmented (ovoid) neutrophil nuclei in homozygotes. Some putative PHA homozygotes have been reported with minor skeletal malformations. Greenberg skeletal dysplasia is a severe autosomal recessive, perinatal lethal dwarfing disorder in which heterozygous carriers are usually without clinical manifestations. We here report a girl who has bilobed neutrophil nuclei and a mild skeletal dysplasia. Mutation analysis showed two novel mutations in the LBR gene: c.651_653 delinsTGATGAGAAA (p.Ile218Aspfs*19) and c.1757G?&gt;?A (p.Arg586His). These mutations were found to be in trans, and, thus, she is a compound heterozygote. Sterol analysis found trace amounts of cholesta-8,14-dien-3beta-ol, which is normally undetected in healthy individuals. This and previously reported cases suggest that mutations in LBR can result in a continuum of phenotypic manifestations. 	Am._J._Med._Genet._A	D002363 D016428
26934472	20160303	EspP, an Extracellular Serine Protease from Enterohemorrhagic E. coli, Reduces Coagulation Factor Activities, Reduces Clot Strength, and Promotes Clot Lysis.	EspP (E. coli secreted serine protease, large plasmid encoded) is an extracellular serine protease produced by enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7, a causative agent of diarrhea-associated Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (D+HUS). The mechanism by which EHEC induces D+HUS has not been fully elucidated. We investigated the effects of EspP on clot formation and lysis in human blood. Human whole blood and plasma were incubated with EspP(WT )at various concentrations and sampled at various time points. Thrombin time (TT), prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), coagulation factor activities, and thrombelastgraphy (TEG) were measured. Human whole blood or plasma incubated with EspP(WT) was found to have prolonged PT, aPTT, and TT. Furthermore, human whole blood or plasma incubated with EspP(WT) had reduced activities of coagulation factors V, VII, VIII, and XII, as well as prothrombin. EspP did not alter the activities of coagulation factors IX, X, or XI. When analyzed by whole blood TEG, EspP decreased the maximum amplitude of the clot, and increased the clot lysis. Our results indicate that EspP alters hemostasis in vitro by decreasing the activities of coagulation factors V, VII, VIII, and XII, and of prothrombin, by reducing the clot strength and accelerating fibrinolysis, and provide further evidence of a functional role for this protease in the virulence of EHEC and the development of D+HUS.

16476820	20060216	A missense mutation in the coiled-coil domain of the KIF5A gene and late-onset hereditary spastic paraplegia.	To our knowledge, up to now, only 2 mutations in the KIF5A gene, a member of the kinesin superfamily, have been identified as the molecular cause of early-onset autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraparesis (ADHSP). To assess the genetic defect in a family with late-onset ADHSP. Only the proband agreed to undergo complete neurological testing and mutational analysis. The proband was screened for mutations in the spastin, atlastin, NIPA1, and KIF5A genes, either by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography or sequence analysis. The history of the family was consistent with ADHSP characterized by late onset of the disease. Mutational analysis results were negative for the spastin, atlastin, and NIPA1 genes but identified a missense mutation (c.1082C&gt;T) in the coiled-coil coding region of the KIF5A gene. This finding enlarges the phenotypic spectrum of ADHSP linked to KIF5A and enhances the role of that gene in the epidemiology of this disease. We propose that the KIF5A gene should be routinely analyzed in patients with hereditary spastic paraplegia negative for spastin and atlastin mutations. 	Arch._Neurol.	D002363 D016428 D013485
27099990	20160422	Role of Side Chains in ?-Sheet Self-Assembly into Peptide Fibrils. IR and VCD Spectroscopic Studies of Glutamic Acid-Containing Peptides.	Poly(glutamic acid) at low pH self-assembles after incubation at higher temperature into fibrils composed of antiparallel sheets that are stacked in a ?2-type structure whose amide carbonyls have bifurcated H-bonds involving the side chains from the next sheet. Oligomers of Glu can also form such structures, and isotope labeling has provided insight into their out-of-register antiparallel structure [ Biomacromolecules 2013 , 14 , 3880 - 3891 ]. In this paper we report IR and VCD spectra and transmission electron micrograph (TEM) images for a series of alternately sequenced oligomers, Lys-(Aaa-Glu)5-Lys-NH2, where Aaa was varied over a variety of polar, aliphatic, or aromatic residues. Their spectral and TEM data show that these oligopeptides self-assemble into different structures, both local and morphological, that are dependent on both the nature of the Aaa side chains and growth conditions employed. Such alternate peptides substituted with small or polar residues, Ala and Thr, do not yield fibrils; but with ?-branched aliphatic residues, Val and Ile, that could potentially pack with Glu side chains, these oligopeptides do show evidence of ?2-stacking. By contrast, for Leu, with longer side chains, only ?1-stacking is seen while with even larger Phe side chains, either ?-form can be detected separately, depending on preparation conditions. These structures are dependent on high temperature incubation after reducing the pH and in some cases after sonication of initial fibril forms and reincubation. Some of these fibrillar peptides, but not all, show enhanced VCD, which can offer evidence for formation of long, multistrand, often twisted structures. Substitution of Glu with residues having selected side chains yields a variety of morphologies, leading to both ?1- and ?2-structures, that overall suggests two different packing modes for the hydrophobic side chains depending on size and type.

24824375	20140515	NOS3 tagSNPs does not modify the chronic kidney disease progression in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary and progressive renal disorder. It is also recognised as the most frequent genetic cause of chronic kidney diseases (CKD). In the present study, four tagging SNPs and two more well studied polymorphisms (Intron 4 VNTR and Glu298Asp) the NOS3 gene were investigated to unravel the potential modifier effect of NOS3 gene on the progression of CKD in ADPKD. A total of 102 ADPKD patients and 106 controls were selected for the study. The tagSNPs and Glu298Asp polymorphisms were genotyped using FRET-based KASPar method and intron-4 VNTR by polymerase chain reaction electrophoresis. The genotypes and haplotypes in the controls and ADPKD subjects were analysed by ?(2) tests and haploview software. Mantel-Haenszel stratified and univariate analyses were performed to estimate the influence of different genotypes between different CKD stages and hypertension. The tagSNPs of NOS3 genotypes and haplotypes did not exhibit any significant differences between controls and ADPKD patients. The significant linkage disequilibrium was observed between the rs3918184 and rs2853796 by forming LD block. In univariate analysis, the age and family history of Diabetes mellitus (DM) showed significant association with advancement of CKD, but not with the eNOS polymorphisms. Our data suggests that there is no evidence for the involvement of NOS3 tag SNPs in the progression to CKD in ADPKD patients. A systematic study using well validated functional SNPs is necessary to clarify the role of the NOS3 gene in the development of CKD in ADPKD. 	Nephrology_(Carlton)	D016428 D013485
23193256	20121130	ESTHER, the database of the ?/?-hydrolase fold superfamily of proteins: tools to explore diversity of functions.	The ESTHER database, which is freely available via a web server (http://bioweb.ensam.inra.fr/esther) and is widely used, is dedicated to proteins with an ?/?-hydrolase fold, and it currently contains &gt;30 000 manually curated proteins. Herein, we report those substantial changes towards improvement that we have made to improve ESTHER during the past 8 years since our 2004 update. In particular, we generated 87 new families and increased the coverage of the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB). We also renewed the ESTHER website and added new visualization tools, such as the Overall Table and the Family Tree. We also address two topics of particular interest to the ESTHER users. First, we explain how the different enzyme classifications (bacterial lipases, peptidases, carboxylesterases) used by different communities of users are combined in ESTHER. Second, we discuss how variations of core architecture or in predicted active site residues result in a more precise clustering of families, and whether this strategy provides trustable hints to identify enzyme-like proteins with no catalytic activity.

15599558	20041216	Molecular characterization of the porcine testis-specific phosphoglycerate kinase 2 (PGK2) gene and its association with male fertility.	We have isolated and characterized the porcine testis-specific phosphoglycerate kinase 2 (PGK2) gene, and 1665 bp of full-length PGK2 cDNA were also compiled using modified rapid amplification 5'-RACE and 3'-RACE information. The results of genomic and cDNA sequences of the porcine PGK2 gene demonstrated that it is a single-exon intronless gene with a complete open reading frame of 1251 bp encoding a PGK protein of 417 amino acids. Real-time quantitative PCR results showed that PGK2 mRNA was solely expressed in the testis. There was a lower amount of PGK2 expression in the testis of a 10-month-old herniated boar and a very small amount of PGK2 expression in the testis of an 8-week-old cryptorchid piglet compared to an adult boar. Two SNPs in the PGK2 gene (SNP-A: T427C; SNP-B: C914A) resulting in amino acid substitutions (SNP-A: Ser102-Pro102; SNP-B: Thr264-Lys264) were detected and genotyped among six pig breeds. The nucleotide C at SNP-A responsible for the amino acid exchange to proline could lead to the loss of a casein kinase II (CK2) phosphorylation site in the PGK2 peptide. Association analyses between PGK2 genotypes and several traits of sperm quantity and quality were performed. The results showed that SNP-B has a positive significant effect on semen volume in the breed Pietrain (p = 0.08), i.e., boars carrying genotype CC revealed an increased volume of 49 ml compared with boars having the genotype AA.

21461649	20110405	A high density genetic map of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) obtained from large scale microsatellite marker development.	Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) is a species in the large family of the Solanaceae and is important as an agronomic crop and as a model system in plant biotechnology. Despite its importance, only limited molecular marker resources are available that can be used for genome analysis, genetic mapping and breeding. We report here on the development and characterization of 5,119 new and functional microsatellite markers and on the generation of a high-resolution genetic map for the tetraploid tobacco genome. The genetic map was generated using an F2 mapping population derived from the intervarietal cross of Hicks Broadleaf ? Red Russian and merges the polymorphic markers from this new set with those from a smaller set previously used to produce a lower density map. The genetic map described here contains 2,317 microsatellite markers and 2,363 loci, resulting in an average distance between mapped microsatellite markers which is less than 2 million base pairs or 1.5 cM. With this new and expanded marker resource, a sufficient number of markers are now available for multiple applications ranging from tobacco breeding to comparative genome analysis. The genetic map of tobacco is now comparable in marker density and resolution with the best characterized genomes of the Solanaceae: tomato and potato. 	Theor._Appl._Genet.	D016428 D013485
26460857	20151014	A JAZ Protein in Astragalus sinicus Interacts with a Leghemoglobin through the TIFY Domain and Is Involved in Nodule Development and Nitrogen Fixation.	Leghemoglobins (Lbs) play an important role in legumes-rhizobia symbiosis. Lbs bind O2 and protect nitrogenase activity from damage by O2 in nodules, therefore, they are regarded as a marker of active nitrogen fixation in nodules. Additionally, Lbs are involved in the nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway, acting as a NO scavenger during nodule development and nitrogen fixation. However, regulators responsible for Lb expression and modulation of Lb activity have not been characterized. In our previous work, a Jasmonate-Zim-domain (JAZ) protein interacting with a Lb (AsB2510) in Astragalus sinicus was identified and designated AsJAZ1. In this study, the interaction between AsJAZ1 and AsB2510 was verified using a yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays, resulting in identification of the interaction domain as a TIFY (previously known as zinc-finger protein expressed in inflorescence meristem, ZIM) domain. TIFY domain is named after the most conserved amino acids within the domain. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) was used to confirm the interaction between AsJAZ1 and AsB2510 in tobacco cells, demonstrating that AsJAZ1-AsB2510 interaction was localized to the cell membrane and cytoplasm. Furthermore, the expression patterns and the symbiotic phenotypes of AsJAZ1 were investigated. Knockdown of AsJAZ1 expression via RNA interference led to decreased number of nodules, abnormal development of bacteroids, accumulation of poly-x-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and loss of nitrogenase activity. Taken together, our results suggest that AsJAZ1 interacts with AsB2510 and participates in nodule development and nitrogen fixation. Our results provide novel insights into the functions of Lbs or JAZ proteins during legume-rhizobia symbiosis. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
22891265	20120815	A steep phosphoinositide bis-phosphate gradient forms during fungal filamentous growth.	Membrane lipids have been implicated in many critical cellular processes, yet little is known about the role of asymmetric lipid distribution in cell morphogenesis. The phosphoinositide bis-phosphate PI(4,5)P(2) is essential for polarized growth in a range of organisms. Although an asymmetric distribution of this phospholipid has been observed in some cells, long-range gradients of PI(4,5)P(2) have not been observed. Here, we show that in the human pathogenic fungus Candida albicans a steep, long-range gradient of PI(4,5)P(2) occurs concomitant with emergence of the hyphal filament. Both sufficient PI(4)P synthesis and the actin cytoskeleton are necessary for this steep PI(4,5)P(2) gradient. In contrast, neither microtubules nor asymmetrically localized mRNAs are critical. Our results indicate that a gradient of PI(4,5)P(2), crucial for filamentous growth, is generated and maintained by the filament tip-localized PI(4)P-5-kinase Mss4 and clearing of this lipid at the back of the cell. Furthermore, we propose that slow membrane diffusion of PI(4,5)P(2) contributes to the maintenance of such a gradient. 	J._Cell_Biol.	D016428 D013485
27471715	20160730	Enhancement of antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity: a new era in cancer treatment.	The therapeutic efficacy of some anti-tumor monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) depends on the capacity of the mAb to recognize the tumor-associated antigen and induce cytotoxicity via a network of immune effector cells. This process of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against tumor cells is triggered by the interaction of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) portion of the mAb with the Fc receptors on effector cells like natural killer cells, macrophages, ?? T cells, and dendritic cells. By augmenting ADCC, the antitumor activity of mAbs can be significantly increased. Currently, identifying and developing therapeutic agents that enhance ADCC is a growing area of research. Combining existing tumor-targeting mAbs and ADCC-promoting agents that stimulate effector cells will translate to greater clinical responses. In this review, we discuss strategies for enhancing ADCC and emphasize the potential of combination treatments that include US Food and Drug Administration-approved mAbs and immunostimulatory therapeutics.

18165086	20080101	Calcification of Hydroview H60M intraocular lenses: aqueous humor analysis and comparisons with other intraocular lens materials.	To compare the level of calcification on Hydroview H60M hydrophilic acrylic intraocular lenses (IOLs) (Bausch &amp; Lomb) and other IOL materials. Omori Medical Center, Department of Ophthalmology, Toho University, Tokyo, Japan. The levels of calcification on Hydroview H60M hydrophilic acrylic IOLs, AcrySof SA60AT hydrophobic acrylic IOLs (Alcon Surgical, Inc.), Sensar AR40e hydrophobic acrylic IOLs (Advanced Medical Optics), ClariFlex (Advanced Medical Optics) silicone IOLs, and the MeniFlex ENV13 (Menicon) poly(methyl methacrylate) IOLs were compared in a calcium phosphate solution containing albumin. In a concentration-change experiment, the calcium and phosphate concentration levels were changed and the results observed by scanning electron microscopy. The Hydroview H60M IOL had the largest amount of deposits. Small amounts of deposits were found on the other IOLs in the following decreasing order: AcrySof SA60AT, Sensar AR40e, ClariFlex, and MeniFlex ENV13. The amount of deposits on the Hydroview H60M IOLs was statistically significantly greater than the amount on the other IOLs (P&lt;.01). The hydrophilic acrylic IOLs (Hydroview H60M) had significantly higher amounts of calcified deposits than IOLs of other materials, indicating that hydrophilic acrylic IOLs easily accumulate calcified deposits in the body when the concentrations of calcium, phosphate, and albumin in the aqueous humor fluctuate as a result of a blood-aqueous barrier breakdown.

24624954	20140315	Heteroplasmy of the cytochrome b gene in Venturia inaequalis and its involvement in quantitative and practical resistance to trifloxystrobin.	Quantitative (partial) and qualitative (complete) resistance responses to quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) fungicides have been documented for the apple scab pathogen Venturia inaequalis. Resistance monitoring efforts have traditionally focused on the detection of qualitative resistance based on a single point mutation, G143A, within the cytochrome b (cyt b) gene. In order to better understand the role of heteroplasmy of the cyt b gene in the QoI resistance response for isolates and populations of V. inaequalis, an allele-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction was developed to quantify the relative abundance of the A143 (resistant) allele in 45 isolates of V. inaequalis with differing in vitro resistance responses to the QoI fungicide trifloxystrobin. Although a high relative abundance of the A143 allele (&gt;62%) was associated with isolates with high resistance responses (50 to 100% relative growth on trifloxystrobin-amended medium), heteroplasmy of the cyt b gene was not the primary factor involved in isolates with moderate resistance responses (29 to 49% relative growth). The relative abundance of the A143 allele in isolates with moderate resistance to trifloxystrobin rarely exceeded 8%, suggesting that other resistance mechanisms are involved in moderate resistance and, therefore, that the Qol resistance response is polygenic. In research orchards where QoI fungicides failed to control apple scab (practical resistance), field trials were conducted to demonstrate the link between practical resistance and the abundance of the A143 allele. Relative abundance of the A143 allele in these orchard populations exceeded 20% in 2011 and 2012. Similarly, of the eight additional commercial orchards screened in 2011, the relative abundance of the A143 allele always exceeded 20% in those with QoI practical resistance. Although heteroplasmy of the cyt b gene did not entirely explain the response of isolates with moderate resistance to QoIs, the relative abundance of A143 in orchard populations of V. inaequalis helps to explain the point of emergence for practical resistance to trifloxystrobin across several orchard populations with differing production histories.

22521161	20120424	Brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in Egyptian schizophrenia patients.	Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been advanced as a candidate gene for schizophrenia. BDNF promote the function and growth of 5-HT neurons in the brain and modulate the synaptic plasticity of DRD3-secreting neurons in the striatum, suggesting involvement of BDNF in the mediation of obsessive-compulsive disorder. To test the hypothesis that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism influence obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) in schizophrenia, we examined the association between the BDNF Val66Met genotypes and OCS in a group of patients with schizophrenia. 320 schizophrenia patients were assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was genotyped using PCR-RFLP method, and severity of OCS were compared between the genotype groups. Out of the 320 schizophrenia patients, 120 patients (37.5%) had significant OCS. There was a significant excess of valine allele in the schizophrenia with-OCS group compared to the without-OCS group. The mean YBOCS scores were significantly different among the three genotype groups. Val/Val homozygote patients had higher mean YBOCS scores compared to Val/Met genotype (p = 0.0001) as well as to the Met/Met homozygote group (p = 0.003). Our data suggested an association between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and OCS in Egyptian schizophrenia patients. 	J_Psychiatr_Res	D016428
22872237	20120809	Alterations in lipid signaling underlie lipodystrophy secondary to AGPAT2 mutations.	Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL), secondary to AGPAT2 mutation is characterized by the absence of adipocytes and development of severe insulin resistance. In the current study, we investigated the adipogenic defect associated with AGPAT2 mutations. Adipogenesis was studied in muscle-derived multipotent cells (MDMCs) isolated from vastus lateralis biopsies obtained from controls and subjects harboring AGPAT2 mutations and in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes after knockdown or overexpression of AGPAT2. We demonstrate an adipogenic defect using MDMCs from control and CGL human subjects with mutated AGPAT2. This defect was rescued in CGL MDMCs with a retrovirus expressing AGPAT2. Both CGL-derived MDMCs and 3T3-L1 cells with knockdown of AGPAT2 demonstrated an increase in cell death after induction of adipogenesis. Lack of AGPAT2 activity reduces Akt activation, and overexpression of constitutively active Akt can partially restore lipogenesis. AGPAT2 modulated the levels of phosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol species, as well as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?) inhibitor cyclic phosphatidic acid. The PPAR? agonist pioglitazone partially rescued the adipogenic defect in CGL cells. We conclude that AGPAT2 regulates adipogenesis through the modulation of the lipome, altering normal activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and PPAR? pathways in the early stages of adipogenesis.

10973995	20000907	Endothelial cell-surface gp60 activates vesicle formation and trafficking via G(i)-coupled Src kinase signaling pathway.	We tested the hypothesis that the albumin-docking protein gp60, which is localized in caveolae, couples to the heterotrimeric GTP binding protein G(i), and thereby activates plasmalemmal vesicle formation and the directed migration of vesicles in endothelial cells (ECs). We used the water-soluble styryl pyridinium dye N-(3-triethylaminopropyl)-4-(p-dibutylaminostyryl) pyridinium dibromide (FM 1-43) to quantify vesicle trafficking by confocal and digital fluorescence microscopy. FM 1-43 and fluorescently labeled anti-gp60 antibody (Ab) were colocalized in endocytic vesicles within 5 min of gp60 activation. Vesicles migrated to the basolateral surface where they released FM 1-43, the fluid phase styryl probe. FM 1-43 fluorescence disappeared from the basolateral EC surface without the loss of anti-gp60 Ab fluorescence. Activation of cell-surface gp60 by cross-linking (using anti-gp60 Ab and secondary Ab) in EC grown on microporous filters increased transendothelial (125)I-albumin permeability without altering liquid permeability (hydraulic conductivity), thus, indicating the dissociation of hydraulic conductivity from the albumin permeability pathway. The findings that the sterol-binding agent, filipin, prevented gp60-activated vesicle formation and that caveolin-1 and gp60 were colocalized in vesicles suggest the caveolar origin of endocytic vesicles. Pertussis toxin pretreatment and expression of the dominant negative construct encoding an 11-amino acid G(alphai) carboxyl-terminal peptide inhibited endothelial (125)I-albumin endocytosis and vesicle formation induced by gp60 activation. Expression of dominant negative Src (dn-Src) and overexpression of wild-type caveolin-1 also prevented gp60-activated endocytosis. Caveolin-1 overexpression resulted in the sequestration of G(alphai) with the caveolin-1, whereas dn-Src inhibited G(alphai) binding to caveolin-1. Thus, vesicle formation induced by gp60 and migration of vesicles to the basolateral membrane requires the interaction of gp60 with caveolin-1, followed by the activation of the downstream G(i)-coupled Src kinase signaling pathway.

26454161	20151011	BACE1 modulates gating of KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) and cardiac delayed rectifier KCNQ1/KCNE1 (IKs).	KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) proteins form a homotetrameric channel, which produces a voltage-dependent K(+) current. Co-assembly of KCNQ1 with the auxiliary ?-subunit KCNE1 strongly up-regulates this current. In cardiac myocytes, KCNQ1/E1 complexes are thought to give rise to the delayed rectifier current IKs, which contributes to cardiac action potential repolarization. We report here that the type I membrane protein BACE1 (?-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1), which is best known for its detrimental role in Alzheimer's disease, but is also, as reported here, present in cardiac myocytes, serves as a novel interaction partner of KCNQ1. Using HEK293T cells as heterologous expression system to study the electrophysiological effects of BACE1 and KCNE1 on KCNQ1 in different combinations, our main findings were the following: (1) BACE1 slowed the inactivation of KCNQ1 current producing an increased initial response to depolarizing voltage steps. (2) Activation kinetics of KCNQ1/E1 currents were significantly slowed in the presence of co-expressed BACE1. (3) BACE1 impaired reconstituted cardiac IKs when cardiac action potentials were used as voltage commands, but interestingly augmented the IKs of ATP-deprived cells, suggesting that the effect of BACE1 depends on the metabolic state of the cell. (4) The electrophysiological effects of BACE1 on KCNQ1 reported here were independent of its enzymatic activity, as they were preserved when the proteolytically inactive variant BACE1 D289N was co-transfected in lieu of BACE1 or when BACE1-expressing cells were treated with the BACE1-inhibiting compound C3. (5) Co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) supported our hypothesis that BACE1 modifies the biophysical properties of IKs by physically interacting with KCNQ1 in a ?-subunit-like fashion. Strongly underscoring the functional significance of this interaction, we detected BACE1 in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and murine cardiac tissue and observed decreased IKs in atrial cardiomyocytes of BACE1-deficient mice.

22022270	20111025	The anti-sigma factor TcdC modulates hypervirulence in an epidemic BI/NAP1/027 clinical isolate of Clostridium difficile.	Nosocomial infections are increasingly being recognised as a major patient safety issue. The modern hospital environment and associated health care practices have provided a niche for the rapid evolution of microbial pathogens that are well adapted to surviving and proliferating in this setting, after which they can infect susceptible patients. This is clearly the case for bacterial pathogens such as Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus (VRE) species, both of which have acquired resistance to antimicrobial agents as well as enhanced survival and virulence properties that present serious therapeutic dilemmas for treating physicians. It has recently become apparent that the spore-forming bacterium Clostridium difficile also falls within this category. Since 2000, there has been a striking increase in C. difficile nosocomial infections worldwide, predominantly due to the emergence of epidemic or hypervirulent isolates that appear to possess extended antibiotic resistance and virulence properties. Various hypotheses have been proposed for the emergence of these strains, and for their persistence and increased virulence, but supportive experimental data are lacking. Here we describe a genetic approach using isogenic strains to identify a factor linked to the development of hypervirulence in C. difficile. This study provides evidence that a naturally occurring mutation in a negative regulator of toxin production, the anti-sigma factor TcdC, is an important factor in the development of hypervirulence in epidemic C. difficile isolates, presumably because the mutation leads to significantly increased toxin production, a contentious hypothesis until now. These results have important implications for C. difficile pathogenesis and virulence since they suggest that strains carrying a similar mutation have the inherent potential to develop a hypervirulent phenotype.

26083735	20150618	Isolation of Novel CreERT2-Driver Lines in Zebrafish Using an Unbiased Gene Trap Approach.	Gene manipulation using the Cre/loxP-recombinase system has been successfully employed in zebrafish to study gene functions and lineage relationships. Recently, gene trapping approaches have been applied to produce large collections of transgenic fish expressing conditional alleles in various tissues. However, the limited number of available cell- and tissue-specific Cre/CreERT2-driver lines still constrains widespread application in this model organism. To enlarge the pool of existing CreERT2-driver lines, we performed a genome-wide gene trap screen using a Tol2-based mCherry-T2a-CreERT2 (mCT2aC) gene trap vector. This cassette consists of a splice acceptor and a mCherry-tagged variant of CreERT2 which enables simultaneous labeling of the trapping event, as well as CreERT2 expression from the endogenous promoter. Using this strategy, we generated 27 novel functional CreERT2-driver lines expressing in a cell- and tissue-specific manner during development and adulthood. This study summarizes the analysis of the generated CreERT2-driver lines with respect to functionality, expression, integration, as well as associated phenotypes. Our results significantly enlarge the existing pool of CreERT2-driver lines in zebrafish and combined with Cre-dependent effector lines, the new CreERT2-driver lines will be important tools to manipulate the zebrafish genome.

19737400	20090910	Rac1 activation inhibits E-cadherin-mediated adherens junctions via binding to IQGAP1 in pancreatic carcinoma cells.	Monomeric GTPases of the Rho family control a variety of cellular functions including actin cytoskeleton organisation, cell migration and cell adhesion. Defects in these regulatory processes are involved in tumour progression and metastasis. The development of metastatic carcinoma is accompanied by deregulation of adherens junctions, which are composed of E-cadherin/beta- and alpha-catenin complexes. Here, we show that the activity of the monomeric GTPase Rac1 contributes to inhibition of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in pancreatic carcinoma cells. Stable expression of constitutively active Rac1(V12) reduced the amount of E-cadherin on protein level in PANC-1 pancreatic carcinoma cells, whereas expression of dominant negative Rac1(N17) resulted in an increased amount of E-cadherin. Extraction of proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton as well as coimmunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated markedly decreased amounts of E-cadherin/catenin complexes in Rac1(V12)-expressing cells, but increased amounts of functional E-cadherin/catenin complexes in cells expressing Rac1(N17). Cell aggregation and migration assays revealed, that cells containing less E-cadherin due to expression of Rac1(V12), exhibited reduced cell-cell adhesion and increased cell motility. The Rac/Cdc42 effector protein IQGAP1 has been implicated in regulating cell-cell adhesion. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed a decrease in the association between IQGAP1 and beta-catenin in Rac1(V12)-expressing PANC-1 cells and an association of IQGAP1 with Rac1(V12). Elevated association of IQGAP1 with the E-cadherin adhesion complex via beta-catenin correlated with increased intercellular adhesion of PANC-1 cells. These results indicate that active Rac1 destabilises E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in pancreatic carcinoma cells by interacting with IQGAP1 which is associated with a disassembly of E-cadherin-mediated adherens junctions. Inhibition of Rac1 activity induced increased E-cadherin-mediated cellular adhesion. 	Cell_Commun._Signal	D016428

Despite the importance for plasticity of inhibitory transmission, less is known about cellular mechanisms involved in more dynamic changes in KCC2 function. In this study, we investigated the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in KCC2 localization and function in hippocampal neurons and in cultured GT1-7 cells. Mutation to the putative tyrosine phosphorylation site within the long intracellular carboxyl terminus of KCC2(Y1087D) or application of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein shifted the GABA reversal potential (E(GABA)) to more depolarized values, indicating reduced KCC2 function. This was associated with a change in the expression pattern of KCC2 from a punctate distribution to a more uniform distribution, suggesting that functional tyrosine-phosphorylated KCC2 forms clusters in restricted membrane domains. Sodium vanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, increased the proportion of KCC2 associated with lipid rafts membrane domains. Loss of tyrosine phosphorylation also reduced oligomerization of KCC2. A loss of the punctuate distribution and oligomerization of KCC2 and a more depolarized E(GABA) were seen when the 28-amino-acid carboxyl terminus of KCC2 was deleted. These results indicate that direct tyrosine phosphorylation of KCC2 results in membrane clusters and functional transport activity, suggesting a mechanism by which intracellular Cl(-) concentrations and GABA responses can be rapidly modulated.

20485341	20100521	Helical assembly in the MyD88-IRAK4-IRAK2 complex in TLR/IL-1R signalling.	MyD88, IRAK4 and IRAK2 are critical signalling mediators of the TLR/IL1-R superfamily. Here we report the crystal structure of the MyD88-IRAK4-IRAK2 death domain (DD) complex, which surprisingly reveals a left-handed helical oligomer that consists of 6 MyD88, 4 IRAK4 and 4 IRAK2 DDs. Assembly of this helical signalling tower is hierarchical, in which MyD88 recruits IRAK4 and the MyD88-IRAK4 complex recruits the IRAK4 substrates IRAK2 or the related IRAK1. Formation of these Myddosome complexes brings the kinase domains of IRAKs into proximity for phosphorylation and activation. Composite binding sites are required for recruitment of the individual DDs in the complex, which are confirmed by mutagenesis and previously identified signalling mutations. Specificities in Myddosome formation are dictated by both molecular complementarity and correspondence of surface electrostatics. The MyD88-IRAK4-IRAK2 complex provides a template for Toll signalling in Drosophila and an elegant mechanism for versatile assembly and regulation of DD complexes in signal transduction.

23152371	20121116	Upregulation of TRIM5? gene expression after live-attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus vaccination in Mauritian cynomolgus macaques, but TRIM5? genotype has no impact on virus acquisition or vaccination outcome.	Polymorphism in the TRIM5?/TRIMcyp gene, which interacts with the lentiviral capsid, has been shown to impact on simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication in certain macaque species. Here, in the context of a live-attenuated SIV vaccine study conducted in Mauritian-origin cynomolgus macaques (MCM), we demonstrate upregulation of TRIM5? expression in multiple lymphoid tissues immediately following vaccination. Despite this, the restricted range of TRIM5? genotypes and lack of TRIMcyp variants had no or only limited impact on the replication kinetics in vivo of either the SIVmac viral vaccine or wild-type SIVsmE660 challenge. Additionally, there appeared to be no impact of TRIM5? genotype on the outcome of homologous or heterologous vaccination/challenge studies. The limited spectrum of TRIM5? polymorphism in MCM appears to minimize host bias to provide consistency of replication for SIVmac/SIVsm viruses in vivo, and therefore on vaccination and pathogenesis studies conducted in this species.

18076786	20071214	Characterization of the M918T sodium channel gene mutation associated with strong resistance to pyrethroid insecticides in the peach-potato aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer).	Recent advances in the characterisation of insect sodium channel gene sequences have identified a small number of point mutations within the channel protein that are implicated in conferring target-site resistance to pyrethroid insecticides (so-called knockdown resistance or kdr). The L1014F (leucine-to-phenylalanine) mutation located in the centre of segment 6 of the domain II region (IIS6) of the sodium channel (the so-called kdr trait) has been detected in the peach-potato aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), and is considered to be the primary cause of pyrethroid resistance in this species. Here we report on the characterisation of a second mutation, M918T (methione-to-threonine), within the nearby IIS4-S5 intracellular linker (the so-called super-kdr trait) in a field clone also possessing L1014F, with both mutations present in heterozygous form. The resistance phenotype of M. persicae clones possessing various combinations of L1014F and M918T to a wide range of pyrethroids (both Type I and II) was assessed in leaf-dip bioassays and to lambda-cyhalothrin applied at up to ten times the recommended field rate as foliar sprays to aphids feeding on whole plants. Bioassay results demonstrated that presence of both mutations was associated with extreme resistance to all the pyrethroids tested relative to aphids lacking the mutations. Furthermore, this resistance well exceeded that shown by aphids that were homozygous for L1014F but lacking M918T. However, pre-treatment with piperonyl butoxide in the leaf-dip bioassays failed to suppress pyrethroid resistance in aphids carrying one or both of the mutations. The relevance of these findings for monitoring and managing pyrethroid resistance in M. persicae populations in the field is discussed. 	Bull._Entomol._Res.	D003160 D016428 D013485
25170961	20140830	Correlation between the promoter basal core and precore mutations and HBsAg quantification in French blood donors infected with hepatitis B virus.	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) basal core promoter (BCP) and precore (PC) mutations, HBV viral load and HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) quantitation were screened to assess correlations between these HBV markers in asymptomatic chronic hepatitis B carriers in France. From January 2006 to July 2007, 200 sera were collected from patients who were discovered to be HBsAg-positive when they volunteered to give blood. Direct sequencing of precore/core gene was used to detect A1762T/G1764A mutations in the BCP and G1896A in the PC region. HBV viral load and HBsAg were quantified with two commercials assays. The prevalence of the BCP and PC mixed/mutants were 37% and 60% respectively (P?=?0.0001). HBV DNA level and HBsAg titer were significantly lower in subjects harboring the mixed/mutant PC virus compared to those infected by the wild phenotype. No significant difference was observed in HBV viral loads of blood donors infected by wild or mixed/mutant BCP viruses. Mutant or mixed PC virus was associated with male gender, HBeAb-positive status and HBV/D and HBV/E genotypes. BCP mutations were associated with age, and both HBV/A-HBV/E genotypes.The genetic properties of HBV in this cohort showed that most of the blood donors had a negative HBeAg serological status and harbored the PC mutant phenotype in combination with low levels of both HBV DNA and HBsAg. As the study was conducted in healthy subjects who could be considered as asmptomatic carriers, these results suggest a possible protective effect of the G1896A mutation against severe liver lesions.

21350335	20110226	Protein expression profiles of C3H 10T1/2 murine fibroblasts and of isogenic cells transformed by the H1047R mutant of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K).	We have used stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry to characterize the proteomes of two isogenic cell lines that differ in the expression of a single oncoprotein,p110? of PI3K, carrying the H1047R mutation. 51,510 peptides were identified and assigned to 4,201 proteins. Most notable among the proteins that show increased expression in the oncogenically transformed cells are several involved in the interferon response including Isg15, Ifit1, Igtp and Oas2 (interferon stimulated gene 15, interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1, interferon gamma-inducible GTP-binding protein, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 2). Prominent among the downregulated proteins are several involved in cell adhesion as well as proteins that are affected by the negative feedback from PI3K signaling. The differential expressions documented in this analysis suggest novel links between oncogenic PI3K and several signaling pathways. These links will be explored in future studies.

18820595	20080930	Molecular investigation of the functional relevance of missense variants of ICAM-1.	In genome-wide studies, the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) locus has been associated with cardiovascular and inflammatory bowel diseases. To determine the functional relevance of five missense ICAM-1 variants (G241R; I316V; P352L; K469E; R478W), we generated wild-type and variant proteins [M2(241R); M3(469E); M4(352L); M5(478W); M6(316V); M7(352L/469E)] and transiently transfected CV1 cells. Reverse transcription PCR, western blot, and ELISA did not reveal any differences in mRNA and protein expression levels for any construct. Conversely, in pulse-chase experiments, compared with wild-type (90-120 min), M3 and M5 possessed a prolonged half-life of approximately 150 min, whereas M2, M4, and M7 displayed a decreased half-life of approximately 60-75 min, implying differences in protein degradation. Our results do not indicate a major impact of missense variants on ICAM-1 biological function, even if G241R and K469E were functional in pulse-chase experiments. Whether these differences in protein stability exert measurable functional consequences needs to be elucidated further. 	Pharmacogenet._Genomics	D016428 D013485
22411994	20120314	Tri-domain bifunctional inhibitor of metallocarboxypeptidases A and serine proteases isolated from marine annelid Sabellastarte magnifica.	This study describes a novel bifunctional metallocarboxypeptidase and serine protease inhibitor (SmCI) isolated from the tentacle crown of the annelid Sabellastarte magnifica. SmCI is a 165-residue glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 19.69 kDa (mass spectrometry) and 18 cysteine residues forming nine disulfide bonds. Its cDNA was cloned and sequenced by RT-PCR and nested PCR using degenerated oligonucleotides. Employing this information along with data derived from automatic Edman degradation of peptide fragments, the SmCI sequence was fully characterized, indicating the presence of three bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor/Kunitz domains and its high homology with other Kunitz serine protease inhibitors. Enzyme kinetics and structural analyses revealed SmCI to be an inhibitor of human and bovine pancreatic metallocarboxypeptidases of the A-type (but not B-type), with nanomolar K(i) values. SmCI is also capable of inhibiting bovine pancreatic trypsin, chymotrypsin, and porcine pancreatic elastase in varying measures. When the inhibitor and its nonglycosylated form (SmCI N23A mutant) were overproduced recombinantly in a Pichia pastoris system, they displayed the dual inhibitory properties of the natural form. Similarly, two bi-domain forms of the inhibitor (recombinant rSmCI D1-D2 and rSmCI D2-D3) as well as its C-terminal domain (rSmCI-D3) were also overproduced. Of these fragments, only the rSmCI D1-D2 bi-domain retained inhibition of metallocarboxypeptidase A but only partially, indicating that the whole tri-domain structure is required for such capability in full. SmCI is the first proteinaceous inhibitor of metallocarboxypeptidases able to act as well on another mechanistic class of proteases (serine-type) and is the first of this kind identified in nature.

10353836	19990603	Flexibility of Acanthamoeba myosin rod minifilaments.	Previous electric birefringence experiments have shown that the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of Acanthamoeba myosin II correlates with the ability of minifilaments to cycle between flexible and stiff conformations. The cooperative transition between conformations was shown to depend on Mg2+ concentration, on ATP binding, and on the state of phosphorylation of three serines in the C-terminal end of the heavy chains. Since the junction between the heavy meromyosin (HMM) and light meromyosin (LMM) regions is expected to disrupt the alpha-helical coiled-coil structure of the rod, this region was anticipated to be the flexible site. We have now cloned and expressed the wild-type rod (residues 849-1509 of the full-length heavy chain) and rods mutated within the junction in order to test this. The sedimentation and electric birefringence properties of minifilaments formed by rods and by native myosin II are strikingly similar. In particular, the Mg2+-dependent flexible-to-stiff transitions of native myosin II and wild-type rod minifilaments are virtually superimposable. Mutations within the junction between the HMM and LMM regions of the rod modulate the ability of Mg2+ to stabilize the stiff conformation. Less Mg2+ is required to induce minifilament stiffening if proline-1244 is replaced with alanine. Deleting the entire junction region (25 amino acids) results in a even greater decrease in the Mg2+ concentration necessary for the transition. The HMM-LMM junction does indeed seem to act as a Mg2+-dependent flexible hinge. 	Biochemistry	D016428
21085499	20101119	Catalysis: transition-state molecular recognition?	THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING THE FUNDAMENTAL PROCESSES OF CATALYSIS IS THE TRANSITION STATE (TS): indeed, catalysis is a transition-state molecular recognition event. Practical objectives, such as the design of TS analogues as potential drugs, or the design of synthetic catalysts (including catalytic antibodies), require prior knowledge of the TS structure to be mimicked. Examples, both old and new, of computational modelling studies are discussed, which illustrate this fundamental concept. It is shown that reactant binding is intrinsically inhibitory, and that attempts to design catalysts that focus simply upon attractive interactions in a binding site may fail. Free-energy changes along the reaction coordinate for S(N)2 methyl transfer catalysed by the enzyme catechol-O-methyl transferase are described and compared with those for a model reaction in water, as computed by hybrid quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical molecular dynamics simulations. The case is discussed of molecular recognition in a xylanase enzyme that stabilises its sugar substrate in a (normally unfavourable) boat conformation and in which a single-atom mutation affects the free-energy of activation dramatically.

11346402	20010518	Variation of codons 1961 and 2177 of the Stargardt disease gene is not associated with age-related macular degeneration.	To investigate the role of 2 specific alleles of the Stargardt disease gene (ABCA4) in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Secondary objectives were to investigate differences in frequency of the G1961E allele in selected ethnic groups as well as to examine the segregation of both G1961E and D2177N alleles in 5 multiplex families with AMD. Five hundred forty-four patients with AMD and 689 controls were ascertained from 3 continents. Blood samples from 62 normal individuals of Somalian ancestry were also obtained. Participants were screened for the presence of these ABCA4 alleles with a combination of restriction digestion and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplification products. Detected alleles were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The number of subjects exhibiting the G1961E or D2177N variants were compared between AMD and control groups using a 2-tailed Fisher exact test. There was no significant difference (P &gt;.1) in the frequency of the G1961E and D2177N alleles in patients with AMD (2.2%) vs controls (1.0%). In contrast, there was a significant difference (P&lt; .001) in the frequency of the G1961E alleles between normal individuals of Somali ancestry (11.3%) and normal individuals from other populations (0.4%). There was no evidence of cosegregation of these alleles and the AMD phenotype in the 5 multiplex families with AMD examined. These two ABCA4 alleles were slightly more frequent in patients with AMD with choroidal neovascularization (2.7%) than those without this complication (2.5%). Somali ancestry is more than 100 times more strongly associated with presence of the G1961E allele than the AMD phenotype. This study did not find any statistically significant evidence for involvement of the G1961E or D2177N alleles of the ABCA4 gene in AMD. The ABCA4 gene is definitively involved in the pathogenesis of Stargardt disease and some cases of photoreceptor degeneration. However, it does not seem to be involved in a statistically significant fraction of AMD cases. 	Arch._Ophthalmol.	D016428 D013485 D013487
24488035	20140204	Association between NQO1 C609T polymorphism and acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk: evidence from an updated meta-analysis based on 17 case-control studies.	Quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) C609T polymorphisms have been implicated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) risk, but previously published studies were inconsistent and recent meta-analyses were not adequate. The aim of this study was to determine more precise estimations for the relationship between the NQO1 C609T polymorphism and the risk of ALL. Electronic searches for all publications were conducted on association between this variant and ALL in several databases updated in May 2013. The quality of studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association. Seventeen studies were identified, including 2,264 ALL patients and 3,798 controls. Overall, significantly elevated ALL risk was associated with NQO1 C609T variant genotypes when all of the studies were pooled into the meta-analysis (TT vs. CC: OR 1.46, 95 % CI 1.18-1.79; dominant model: OR 1.45, 95 % CI 1.19-1.77). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significantly increased risks were found for non-Asians (T/T vs. C/C: OR 1.74, 95 % CI 1.29-2.36; dominant model: T/T + C/T vs. C/C: OR 1.7, 95 % CI 1.27-2.29). When stratified by adult or children studies, statistically significantly elevated risks were found among adult studies (codominant model: C/T vs. C/C: OR 1.38, 95 % CI 1.02-1.87; dominant model: T/T + C/T vs. C/C: OR 1.52, 95 % CI 1.18-1.97) and children studies (recessive model: T/T vs. C/T + C/C: OR 1.34, 95 % CI 1.05-1.7). Our results indicate that the C609T polymorphism of the NQO1 gene is an important genetic risk factor in ALL. 	J._Cancer_Res._Clin._Oncol.	D016428 D016454
24810334	20140510	A pathogenic mosaic TP53 mutation in two germ layers detected by next generation sequencing.	Li-Fraumeni syndrome is caused by germline TP53 mutations and is clinically characterized by a predisposition to a range of cancers, most commonly sarcoma, brain tumours and leukemia. Pathogenic mosaic TP53 mutations have only rarely been described. We describe a 2 years old child presenting with three separate cancers over a 6 month period; two soft tissue mesenchymal tumors and an aggressive metastatic neuroblastoma. As conventional testing of blood DNA by Sanger sequencing for mutations in TP53, ALK, and SDH was negative, whole exome sequencing of the blood DNA of the patient and both parents was performed to screen more widely for cancer predisposing mutations. In the patient's but not the parents' DNA we found a c.743 G&gt;A, p.Arg248Gln (CCDS11118.1) TP53 mutation in 3-20% of sequencing reads, a level that would not generally be detectable by Sanger sequencing. Homozygosity for this mutation was detected in all tumor samples analyzed, and germline mosaicism was demonstrated by analysis of the child's newborn blood spot DNA. The occurrence of separate tumors derived from different germ layers suggests that this de novo mutation occurred early in embryogenesis, prior to gastrulation. The case demonstrates pathogenic mosaicim, detected by next generation deep sequencing, that arose in the early stages of embryogenesis. 	PLoS_ONE	D002363 D016428 D013485
26598723	20151125	Loss of neurogenesis in Hydra leads to compensatory regulation of neurogenic and neurotransmission genes in epithelial cells.	Hydra continuously differentiates a sophisticated nervous system made of mechanosensory cells (nematocytes) and sensory-motor and ganglionic neurons from interstitial stem cells. However, this dynamic adult neurogenesis is dispensable for morphogenesis. Indeed animals depleted of their interstitial stem cells and interstitial progenitors lose their active behaviours but maintain their developmental fitness, and regenerate and bud when force-fed. To characterize the impact of the loss of neurogenesis in Hydra, we first performed transcriptomic profiling at five positions along the body axis. We found neurogenic genes predominantly expressed along the central body column, which contains stem cells and progenitors, and neurotransmission genes predominantly expressed at the extremities, where the nervous system is dense. Next, we performed transcriptomics on animals depleted of their interstitial cells by hydroxyurea, colchicine or heat-shock treatment. By crossing these results with cell-type-specific transcriptomics, we identified epithelial genes up-regulated upon loss of neurogenesis: transcription factors (Dlx, Dlx1, DMBX1/Manacle, Ets1, Gli3, KLF11, LMX1A, ZNF436, Shox1), epitheliopeptides (Arminins, PW peptide), neurosignalling components (CAMK1D, DDCl2, Inx1), ligand-ion channel receptors (CHRNA1, NaC7), G-Protein Coupled Receptors and FMRFRL. Hence epitheliomuscular cells seemingly enhance their sensing ability when neurogenesis is compromised. This unsuspected plasticity might reflect the extended multifunctionality of epithelial-like cells in early eumetazoan evolution. 	Philos._Trans._R._Soc._Lond.,_B,_Biol._Sci.	D016428 D013485
26566127	20151114	Evidence of Field-Evolved Resistance to Bifenthrin in Western Corn Rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte) Populations in Western Nebraska and Kansas.	Pyrethroid insecticides have been used to control larvae or adults of the western corn rootworm (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, a key pest of field corn in the United States. In response to reports of reduced efficacy of pyrethroids in WCR management programs in southwestern areas of Nebraska and Kansas the present research was designed to establish a baseline of susceptibility to the pyrethroid insecticide, bifenthrin, using susceptible laboratory populations and to compare this baseline with susceptibility of field populations. Concentration-response bioassays were performed to estimate the baseline susceptibility. From the baseline data, a diagnostic concentration (LC99) was determined and used to test adults of both laboratory and field populations. Larval susceptibility was also tested using both laboratory and field populations. Significant differences were recorded in adult and larval susceptibility among WCR field and laboratory populations. The highest LC50 for WCR adults was observed in populations from Keith 2 and Chase Counties, NE, with LC50s of 2.2 and 1.38 ?g/vial, respectively, and Finney County 1, KS, with 1.43 ?g/vial, as compared to a laboratory non-diapause population (0.24 ?g/vial). For larvae, significant differences between WCR field and laboratory populations were also recorded. Significant differences in mortalities at the diagnostic bifenthrin concentration (LC99) were observed among WCR adult populations with western Corn Belt populations exhibiting lower susceptibility to bifenthrin, especially in southwestern Nebraska and southwestern Kansas. This study provides evidence that resistance to bifenthrin is evolving in field populations that have been exposed for multiple years to pyrethroid insecticides. Implications to sustainable rootworm management are discussed. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
12913113	20030813	Spatial restriction of alpha4 integrin phosphorylation regulates lamellipodial stability and alpha4beta1-dependent cell migration.	Integrins coordinate spatial signaling events essential for cell polarity and directed migration. Such signals from alpha4 integrins regulate cell migration in development and in leukocyte trafficking. Here, we report that efficient alpha4-mediated migration requires spatial control of alpha4 phosphorylation by protein kinase A, and hence localized inhibition of binding of the signaling adaptor, paxillin, to the integrin. In migrating cells, phosphorylated alpha4 accumulated along the leading edge. Blocking alpha4 phosphorylation by mutagenesis or by inhibition of protein kinase A drastically reduced alpha4-dependent migration and lamellipodial stability. alpha4 phosphorylation blocks paxillin binding in vitro; we now find that paxillin and phospho-alpha4 were in distinct clusters at the leading edge of migrating cells, whereas unphosphorylated alpha4 and paxillin colocalized along the lateral edges of those cells. Furthermore, enforced paxillin association with alpha4 inhibits migration and reduced lamellipodial stability. These results show that topographically specific integrin phosphorylation can control cell migration and polarization by spatial segregation of adaptor protein binding. 	J._Cell_Biol.

Reductive amination of various ketones and aldehydes by transfer hydrogenation under aqueous conditions has been developed, by using cyclometallated iridium complexes as catalysts and formate as hydrogen source. The pH value of the solution is shown to be critical for a high catalytic chemoselectivity and activity, with the best pH value being 4.8. In comparison with that in organic solvents, the reductive amination in an aqueous phase is faster, and the molar ratio of the substrate to the catalyst (S/C) can be set as high as 1?10(5) , the highest S/C value ever reported in reductive amination reactions. The catalyst is easy to access and the reaction is operationally simple, allowing a wide range of ketones and aldehydes to react with various amines in high yields. The protocol provides a practical and environmental friendly new method for the synthesis of amine compounds. 	Chemistry	D016428 D013485

14755448	20040203	Clinical features of psychotic disorders and polymorphisms in HT2A, DRD2, DRD4, SLC6A3 (DAT1), and BDNF: a family based association study.	Schizophrenia is clinically heterogeneous and multidimensional, but it is not known whether this is due to etiological heterogeneity. Previous studies have not consistently reported association between any specific polymorphisms and clinical features of schizophrenia, and have primarily used case-control designs. We tested for the presence of association between clinical features and polymorphisms in the genes for the serotonin 2A receptor (HT2A), dopamine receptor types 2 and 4, dopamine transporter (SLC6A3), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Two hundred seventy pedigrees were ascertained on the basis of having two or more members with schizophrenia or poor outcome schizoaffective disorder. Diagnoses were made using a structured interview based on the SCID. All patients were rated on the major symptoms of schizophrenia scale (MSSS), integrating clinical and course features throughout the course of illness. Factor analysis revealed positive, negative, and affective symptom factors. The program QTDT was used to implement a family-based test of association for quantitative traits, controlling for age and sex. We found suggestive evidence of association between the His452Tyr polymorphism in HT2A and affective symptoms (P = 0.02), the 172-bp allele of BDNF and negative symptoms (P = 0.04), and the 480-bp allele in SLC6A3 (= DAT1) and negative symptoms (P = 0.04). As total of 19 alleles were tested, we cannot rule out false positives. However, given prior evidence of involvement of the proteins encoded by these genes in psychopathology, our results suggest that more attention should be focused on the impact of these alleles on clinical features of schizophrenia.

24843883	20140521	Epigenetic dysregulation in glioma.	Given that treatment options for patients with glioblastoma are limited, much effort has been made to clarify the underlying mechanisms of gliomagenesis. Recent genome-wide genomic and epigenomic analyses have revealed that mutations in epigenetic modifiers occur frequently in gliomas and that dysregulation of epigenetic mechanisms is closely associated with glioma formation. Given that epigenetic changes are reversible, understanding the epigenetic abnormalities that arise in gliomagenesis might be key to developing more effective treatment strategies for glioma. In this review, we focus on the recent advancements in epigenetic research with respect to gliomas, consider how epigenetic mechanisms dynamically regulate tumor cells, including the cancer stem cell population, and discuss perspectives and challenges for glioma treatment in the near future.

CYP2C9 is a polymorphic enzyme that has been reported to metabolize several clinically useful drugs such as warfarin, phenytoin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We designed a rapid single-tube multiplex assay to detect four variant alleles of the CYP2C9 in a single polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a single pyrosequencing reaction. A multiplex PCR was designed to amplify two fragments simultaneously, one containing 430C&gt;T (CYP2C9*2) polymorphism and other containing 1075A&gt;C (CYP2C9*3), 1076T&gt;C (CYP2C9*4) and 1080C&gt;G (CYP2C9*5) polymorphisms. Four variants of the CYP2C9 gene could be simultaneously detected using only two varieties of pyrosequencing primers in a single-tube. The success rate for the four SNPs (*2, *3,*4 and *5) was high. Genotypes obtained by the multiplex reaction were 100% concordant with genotypes obtained using direct DNA sequencing (n = 96). The analysis time was halved, compared with existing simplex pyrosequencing. The system allowed high-throughput analysis of over 384 samples per hour. Our method reduces running cost and halves analysis time, compared to simplex pyrosequencing. Another advantage of this method is that it analyses and determines multiple bases around the polymorphic site thereby reducing the possibility of scoring a truncated PCR product.

23819556	20130704	Revealing selection in cancer using the predicted functional impact of cancer mutations. Application to nomination of cancer drivers.	Every malignant tumor has a unique spectrum of genomic alterations including numerous protein mutations. There are also hundreds of personal germline variants to be taken into account. The combinatorial diversity of potential cancer-driving events limits the applicability of statistical methods to determine tumor-specific &quot;driver&quot; alterations among an overwhelming majority of &quot;passengers&quot;. An alternative approach to determining driver mutations is to assess the functional impact of mutations in a given tumor and predict drivers based on a numerical value of the mutation impact in a particular context of genomic alterations.Recently, we introduced a functional impact score, which assesses the mutation impact by the value of entropic disordering of the evolutionary conservation patterns in proteins. The functional impact score separates disease-associated variants from benign polymorphisms with an accuracy of ~80%. Can the score be used to identify functionally important non-recurrent cancer-driver mutations? Assuming that cancer-drivers are positively selected in tumor evolution, we investigated how the functional impact score correlates with key features of natural selection in cancer, such as the non-uniformity of distribution of mutations, the frequency of affected tumor suppressors and oncogenes, the frequency of concurrent alterations in regions of heterozygous deletions and copy gain; as a control, we used presumably non-selected silent mutations. Using mutations of six cancers studied in TCGA projects, we found that predicted high-scoring functional mutations as well as truncating mutations tend to be evolutionarily selected as compared to low-scoring and silent mutations. This result justifies prediction of mutations-drivers using a shorter list of predicted high-scoring functional mutations, rather than the &quot;long tail&quot; of all mutations.

22675544	20120608	Fine mapping of the Bsr1 barley stripe mosaic virus resistance gene in the model grass Brachypodium distachyon.	The ND18 strain of Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) infects several lines of Brachypodium distachyon, a recently developed model system for genomics research in cereals. Among the inbred lines tested, Bd3-1 is highly resistant at 20 to 25 ?C, whereas Bd21 is susceptible and infection results in an intense mosaic phenotype accompanied by high levels of replicating virus. We generated an F(6:7) recombinant inbred line (RIL) population from a cross between Bd3-1 and Bd21 and used the RILs, and an F(2) population of a second Bd21 ? Bd3-1 cross to evaluate the inheritance of resistance. The results indicate that resistance segregates as expected for a single dominant gene, which we have designated Barley stripe mosaic virus resistance 1 (Bsr1). We constructed a genetic linkage map of the RIL population using SNP markers to map this gene to within 705 Kb of the distal end of the top of chromosome 3. Additional CAPS and Indel markers were used to fine map Bsr1 to a 23 Kb interval containing five putative genes. Our study demonstrates the power of using RILs to rapidly map the genetic determinants of BSMV resistance in Brachypodium. Moreover, the RILs and their associated genetic map, when combined with the complete genomic sequence of Brachypodium, provide new resources for genetic analyses of many other traits.

12044673	20020605	Mutagenesis of key amino acids alters activity of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae endo-polygalacturonase expressed in Pichia pastoris.	A polygalacturonase (PG)-encoding gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (PGU1) was successfully expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. PG secretion was efficiently directed by the S. cerevisiae alpha-factor signal sequence, while the native (PGU1) leader peptide was unable to direct protein export in P. pastoris. The level of PGU1 activity achieved in P. pastoris was significantly enhanced when compared to activity using the same gene in S. cerevisiae. Expression of PG proteins, engineered by site-directed mutagenesis, in P. pastoris showed that aspartic acid residues at positions 179, 200, and 201, and histidine 222 were essential for enzyme activity. Mutation of the two potential glycosylation sites in PGU1 showed that the two residues individually (N318D, N330D) did not affect secreted enzyme activity, but the double mutant caused a 50% reduction in enzyme activity when compared to the wild-type PGU1 transformant.

26982032	20160317	MKS5 and CEP290 Dependent Assembly Pathway of the Ciliary Transition Zone.	Cilia have a unique diffusion barrier (&quot;gate&quot;) within their proximal region, termed transition zone (TZ), that compartmentalises signalling proteins within the organelle. The TZ is known to harbour two functional modules/complexes (Meckel syndrome [MKS] and Nephronophthisis [NPHP]) defined by genetic interaction, interdependent protein localisation (hierarchy), and proteomic studies. However, the composition and molecular organisation of these modules and their links to human ciliary disease are not completely understood. Here, we reveal Caenorhabditis elegans CEP-290 (mammalian Cep290/Mks4/Nphp6 orthologue) as a central assembly factor that is specific for established MKS module components and depends on the coiled coil region of MKS-5 (Rpgrip1L/Rpgrip1) for TZ localisation. Consistent with a critical role in ciliary gate function, CEP-290 prevents inappropriate entry of membrane-associated proteins into cilia and keeps ARL-13 (Arl13b) from leaking out of cilia via the TZ. We identify a novel MKS module component, TMEM-218 (Tmem218), that requires CEP-290 and other MKS module components for TZ localisation and functions together with the NPHP module to facilitate ciliogenesis. We show that TZ localisation of TMEM-138 (Tmem138) and CDKL-1 (Cdkl1/Cdkl2/Cdkl3/Cdlk4 related), not previously linked to a specific TZ module, similarly depends on CEP-290; surprisingly, neither TMEM-138 or CDKL-1 exhibit interdependent localisation or genetic interactions with core MKS or NPHP module components, suggesting they are part of a distinct, CEP-290-associated module. Lastly, we show that families presenting with Oral-Facial-Digital syndrome type 6 (OFD6) have likely pathogenic mutations in CEP-290-dependent TZ proteins, namely Tmem17, Tmem138, and Tmem231. Notably, patient fibroblasts harbouring mutated Tmem17, a protein not yet ciliopathy-associated, display ciliogenesis defects. Together, our findings expand the repertoire of MKS module-associated proteins--including the previously uncharacterised mammalian Tmem80--and suggest an MKS-5 and CEP-290-dependent assembly pathway for building a functional TZ.

21851379	20110820	The effects of a single nucleotide polymorphism in SLCO1B1 on the pharmacodynamics of pravastatin.	To determine whether the SNP rs4149056 in SLCO1B1 alters the pharmacodynamics of pravastatin. rs4149056 was genotyped in 626 pravastatin-treated participants in the WOSCOPS trial and the response after 1 year of treatment was compared between the different genotypes. Pravastatin reduced serum LDL cholesterol by 22.2% in TT homozygotes, by 22.2% in TC heterozygotes and by 17.7% in CC homozygotes (TT + TC vs. CC P value 0.33). There were no significant differences in the response of total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides or CRP to pravastatin between the genotypes. The rs4149056 SNP did not significantly affect the pharmacodynamics of pravastatin. 	Br_J_Clin_Pharmacol	D016428 D013485
25435849	20141202	Intercalated chemotherapy and erlotinib for advanced NSCLC: high proportion of complete remissions and prolonged progression-free survival among patients with EGFR activating mutations.	Pharmaco-dynamic separation of cytotoxic and targeted drugs might avoid their mutual antagonistic effect in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Eligible patients were treatment-naive with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC. In addition, inclusion was limited to never-smokers or light smokers or, after 2010, to patients with activating epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. Treatment started with 3-weekly cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin on days 1, 2 and 4 and erlotinib on days 5 to 15. After 4 to 6 cycles, patients continued with erlotinib maintenance. Fifty-three patients were recruited into the trial: 24 prior to 2010 (of whom 9 were later found to be positive for EGFR mutations), and 29 EGFR mutation-positive patients recruited later. Unfavourable prognostic factors included stage IV disease (51 patients - 96%), performance status 2-3 (11 patients - 21%) and brain metastases (15 patients -28%). Grade 4 toxicity included 2 cases of neutropenia and 4 thrombo-embolic events. The 15 EGFR negative patients had 33% objective response rate, median progression-free survival (PFS) 6.0 months and median survival 7.6 months. Among 38 EGFR positive patients, complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) were seen in 16 (42.1%) and 17 (44.7%) cases, respectively. PET-CT scanning was performed in 30 patients and confirmed CR and PR in 16 (53.3%) and 9 (30.0%) cases, respectively. Median PFS for EGFR mutated patients was 21.2 months and median survival was 32.5 months. While patients with EGFR negative tumors do not benefit from addition of erlotinib, the intercalated schedule appears most promising for those with EGFR activating mutations. 	Radiol_Oncol	D016428
7651903	19950101	Isolation and biological activity of [Trp5]bradykinin from the plasma of the phylogenetically ancient fish, the bowfin and the longnosed gar.	The holostean fish occupy an important position in vertebrate phylogeny as extant representatives of a ancient group of ray-finned fish with evolutionary connections to present-day teleosts. Incubation of heat-denatured plasma from the bowfin Amia calva with trypsin generated bradykinin-like immunoreactivity. The primary structure of bowfin bradykinin was established as Ala-Pro-Pro-Gly-Trp-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg. This amino acid sequence contains one amino acid substitution (Phe5 --&gt; Trp) compared with mammalian bradykinin. The same peptide was generated in heat-denatured plasma from the longnosed gar Lepisosteus osseus. Treatment of plasma from either the bowfin or gar with glass beads under conditions previously shown to activate Factor XII in the plasma of mammals and reptiles did not generate bradykinin. Bolus injections of synthetic bowfin bradykinin (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 nmol/kg) into the bulbus arteriosus of unanesthetized bowfin resulted in an immediate fall in arterial blood pressure of 5-10 min duration that was followed by a dose-dependent rise in pressure that was sustained for 30-60 min. There was no change in heart rate following bradykinin administration. The data suggest that the kallikrein-kinin system may predate the appearance of teleosts and may play a role in cardiovascular regulation in holosteans. 	Peptides	D016428 D013485 D013486
10858258	20000617	Adjuvant activity of a nontoxic mutant of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin on systemic and mucosal immune responses elicited against a heterologous antigen carried by a live Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccine strain.	Systemic and mucosal antibody responses against both the major subunit of colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and the somatic lipopolysaccharide expressed by recombinant bivalent Salmonella vaccine strains were significantly enhanced by coadministration of a detoxified derivative with preserved adjuvant effects of the ETEC heat-labile toxin, LT((R192G)). The results further support the adjuvant effects of LT((R192G)) and represent a simple alternative to improve responses against passenger antigens expressed by orally delivered Salmonella vaccine strains.

1954392	19911201	Hemoglobin Neapolis, beta 126(H4)Val----Gly: a novel beta-chain variant associated with a mild beta-thalassemia phenotype and displaying anomalous stability features.	A novel beta-chain, beta 126(H4)Val----Gly, electrophoretically silent, was detected by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography in three unrelated families from Naples (Southern Italy) and accounted for about 30% of the total beta-chains. The amino acid substitution was detected by HPLC fingerprint. The eight heterozygous patients showed hematologic and biosynthetic alterations of mild beta-thalassemia type. The hemoglobin variant showed abnormal stability features. It was unstable in the heat stability and isopropanol precipitation tests, but did not cause a hemolytic syndrome in vivo and was stable in a time-course experiment of biosynthesis in vitro. DNA polymerase chain reaction direct sequencing of the mutated gene from 135 nt upstream of the cap site to 106 nt downstream of the polyadenylation site showed only the beta 126 GTG----GGG mutation, which was confirmed in the other patients by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. The mutation was found to be associated with a type II beta-globin framework and restriction fragment length polymorphism haplotype V. The novel variant was named hemoglobin Neapolis.

24904581	20140607	Mast cell-mediated and associated disorders in pregnancy: a risky game with an uncertain outcome?	During pregnancy, the maternal organism is under the influence of tremendous endocrine as well as immunological changes as an adaptation to the implanted and developing fetus. In most cases, the maternal adaptations to pregnancy ensure both, the protection against harmful pathogens and the tolerance toward the growing semi-allogeneic fetus. However, under certain circumstances the unique hormonal milieu during pregnancy is causative of a shift into an unfavorable direction. Of particular importance are cellular disorders previous to pregnancy that involve cell types known for their susceptibility to hormones. One interesting cell type is the mast cell (MC), one of the key figures in allergic disorders. While physiological numbers of MCs were shown to positively influence pregnancy outcome, at least in mouse models, uncontrolled augmentations in quantity, and/or activation can lead to pregnancy complications. Women that have the desire of getting pregnant and been diagnosed with MC mediated disorders such as urticaria and mastocytosis or chronic inflammatory diseases in which MCs are involved, including atopic dermatitis, asthma, or psoriasis, may benefit from specialized medical assistance to ensure a positive pregnancy outcome. In the present review, we address the course of pregnancy in women affected by MC mediated or associated disorders. 	Front_Immunol	D016428 D016454

23647335	20130508	Botulinum neurotoxin G binds synaptotagmin-II in a mode similar to that of serotype B: tyrosine 1186 and lysine 1191 cause its lower affinity.	Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) block neurotransmitter release by proteolyzing SNARE proteins in peripheral nerve terminals. Entry into neurons occurs subsequent to interaction with gangliosides and a synaptic vesicle protein. Isoforms I and II of synaptotagmin were shown to act as protein receptors for two of the seven BoNT serotypes, BoNT/B and BoNT/G, and for mosaic-type BoNT/DC. BoNT/B and BoNT/G exhibit a homologous binding site for synaptotagmin whose interacting part adopts helical structure upon binding to BoNT/B. Whereas the BoNT/B-synaptotagmin-II interaction has been elucidated in molecular detail, corresponding information about BoNT/G is lacking. Here we systematically mutated the synaptotagmin binding site in BoNT/G and performed a comparative binding analysis with mutants of the cell binding subunit of BoNT/B. The results suggest that synaptotagmin takes the same overall orientation in BoNT/B and BoNT/G governed by the strictly conserved central parts of the toxins' binding site. The surrounding nonconserved areas differently contribute to receptor binding. Reciprocal mutations Y1186W and L1191Y increased the level of binding of BoNT/G approximately to the level of BoNT/B affinity, suggesting a similar synaptotagmin-bound state. The effects of the mutations were confirmed by studying the activity of correspondingly mutated full-length BoNTs. On the basis of these data, molecular modeling experiments were employed to reveal an atomistic model of BoNT/G-synaptotagmin recognition. These data suggest a reduced length and/or a bend in the C-terminal part of the synaptotagmin helix that forms upon contact with BoNT/G as compared with BoNT/B and are in agreement with the data of the mutational analyses.

25690988	20150219	Glucose control and fatigue in type 2 diabetes: the mediating roles of diabetes symptoms and distress.	The purpose of this study was to examine the mediating influence of diabetes health characteristics (diabetes distress, depression symptoms and diabetes symptoms) on the relationship between glucose control and fatigue in adults with type 2 diabetes. In patients with type 2 diabetes, fatigue is common and can affect diabetes self-management behaviours. Although long thought to result from hyperglycaemia, little evidence supports a relationship between fatigue and glucose control. A cross-sectional, descriptive study design was used. Data were combined from two studies conducted at a large urban university in the Midwestern United States, resulting in a total sample of 155 urban-dwelling adults with type 2 diabetes. Data were collected over the course of 6 days from 2013-March 2014. Fatigue and related biological and psychological phenomena were measured to perform path analyses using structural equation modelling methods. The STATA software was used to analyse the data. In patients with A1C less than or equal to 7%, fatigue was related to diabetes distress and diabetes symptoms, but not to A1C directly or indirectly. In the group with A1C greater than 7%, fatigue was indirectly related to A1C; this relationship was mediated through diabetes symptoms, depression and diabetes distress. Our findings suggest that fatigue is indirectly related to glucose control, but only in patients who have elevated A1C levels. In those with adequate glucose control, fatigue is mainly influenced by the presence of diabetes symptoms and distress. In both groups, the number and severity of diabetes symptoms were the strongest predictors of fatigue, regardless of blood glucose control. 	J_Adv_Nurs	D016428 D052061
20500820	20100527	Comparison of scores for bimodality of gene expression distributions and genome-wide evaluation of the prognostic relevance of high-scoring genes.	A major goal of the analysis of high-dimensional RNA expression data from tumor tissue is to identify prognostic signatures for discriminating patient subgroups. For this purpose genome-wide identification of bimodally expressed genes from gene array data is relevant because distinguishability of high and low expression groups is easier compared to genes with unimodal expression distributions.Recently, several methods for the identification of genes with bimodal distributions have been introduced. A straightforward approach is to cluster the expression values and score the distance between the two distributions. Other scores directly measure properties of the distribution. The kurtosis, e.g., measures divergence from a normal distribution. An alternative is the outlier-sum statistic that identifies genes with extremely high or low expression values in a subset of the samples. We compare and discuss scores for bimodality for expression data. For the genome-wide identification of bimodal genes we apply all scores to expression data from 194 patients with node-negative breast cancer. Further, we present the first comprehensive genome-wide evaluation of the prognostic relevance of bimodal genes. We first rank genes according to bimodality scores and define two patient subgroups based on expression values. Then we assess the prognostic significance of the top ranking bimodal genes by comparing the survival functions of the two patient subgroups. We also evaluate the global association between the bimodal shape of expression distributions and survival times with an enrichment type analysis.Various cluster-based methods lead to a significant overrepresentation of prognostic genes. A striking result is obtained with the outlier-sum statistic (p &lt; 10-12). Many genes with heavy tails generate subgroups of patients with different prognosis. Genes with high bimodality scores are promising candidates for defining prognostic patient subgroups from expression data. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of the different scores for prognostic purposes. The outlier-sum statistic may be particularly valuable for the identification of genes to be included in prognostic signatures. Among the genes identified as bimodal in the breast cancer data set several have not yet previously been recognized to be prognostic and bimodally expressed in breast cancer.

10952646	20000822	The relationship of genotype to cognitive outcome in galactosaemia.	To evaluate the cognitive outcome of a cohort of children with galactosaemia in relation to genotype. The cohort was drawn from children notified to the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit galactosaemia study which ran from 1988 to 1990. Cognitive outcome was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children or the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence. Parents completed a questionnaire detailing educational status, and the attending paediatrician returned a questionnaire regarding age at diagnosis and biochemical outcome over the previous two years. A total of 45 children were genotyped: 30 were homoallelic for the Q188R mutation, the remainder being heteroallelic for Q188R with K285N (n = 4), L195P (n = 4), or other mutations (n = 7). Psychometric evaluation was available in 34 cases: mean full scale IQ was 79, verbal quotient 79, and performance quotient 82. Genotype was not related to galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1-P) concentrations. However, children homoallelic for the Q188R mutation had significantly lower IQ scores than those who were heteroallelic (73. 6 v 94.8). This difference was independent of social and demographic influences and Gal-1-P concentrations over the previous two years. In children with galactosaemia, cognitive outcome appears to relate to genotype rather than metabolic control, as reflected by Gal-1-P concentrations. The value of measuring Gal-1-P concentrations routinely once successfully established on a galactosaemia diet is questionable as concentrations do not appear to affect outcome. In the UK population, homozygosity for the Q188R mutation is invariably associated with a poor outcome, and there is evidence that variability in neurocognitive outcome is at least part dependent on allelic heterogeneity.

23771755	20130618	Improved eye- and skin-color prediction based on 8 SNPs.	To improve the 7-plex system to predict eye and skin color by increasing precision and detailed phenotypic descriptions. Analysis of an eighth single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs12896399 (SLC24A4), showed a statistically significant association with human eye color (P=0.007) but a rather poor strength of agreement (?=0.063). This SNP was added to the 7-plex system (rs12913832 at HERC2, rs1545397 at OCA2, rs16891982 at SLC45A2, rs1426654 at SLC24A5, rs885479 at MC1R, rs6119471 at ASIP, and rs12203592 at IRF4). Further, the instruction guidelines on the interpretation of genotypes were changed to create a new 8-plex system. This was based on the analysis of an 803-sample training set of various populations. The newly developed 8-plex system can predict the eye colors brown, green, and blue, and skin colors light, not dark, and not light. It is superior to the 7-plex system with its additional ability to predict blue eye and light skin color. The 8-plex system was tested on an additional 212 samples, the test set. Analysis showed that the number of positive descriptions for eye colors as being brown, green, or blue increased significantly (P=6.98e-15, z-score: -7.786). The error rate for eye-color prediction was low, at approximately 5%, while the skin color prediction showed no error in the test set (1% in training set). We can conclude that the new 8-plex system for the prediction of eye and skin color substantially enhances its former version. 	Croat._Med._J.	D016428 D013486

17200209	20070104	Aneuploidy arises at early stages of Apc-driven intestinal tumorigenesis and pinpoints conserved chromosomal loci of allelic imbalance between mouse and human.	Although chromosomal instability characterizes the majority of human colorectal cancers, the contribution of genes such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), KRAS, and p53 to this form of genetic instability is still under debate. Here, we have assessed chromosomal imbalances in tumors from mouse models of intestinal cancer, namely Apc(+/1638N), Apc(+/1638N)/KRAS(V12G), and Apc(+/1638N)/Tp53-/-, by array comparative genomic hybridization. All intestinal adenomas from Apc(+/1638N) mice displayed chromosomal alterations, thus confirming the presence of a chromosomal instability defect at early stages of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Moreover, loss of the Tp53 tumor suppressor gene, but not KRAS oncogenic activation, results in an increase of gains and losses of whole chromosomes in the Apc-mutant genetic background. Comparative analysis of the overall genomic alterations found in mouse intestinal tumors allowed us to identify a subset of loci syntenic with human chromosomal regions (eg, 1p34-p36, 12q24, 9q34, and 22q) frequently gained or lost in familial adenomas and sporadic colorectal cancers. The latter indicate that, during intestinal tumor development, the genetic mechanisms and the underlying functional defects are conserved across species. Hence, our array comparative genomic hybridization analysis of Apc-mutant intestinal tumors allows the definition of minimal aneuploidy regions conserved between mouse and human and likely to encompass rate-limiting genes for intestinal tumor initiation and progression.

23665582	20130514	Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate clusters act as molecular beacons for vesicle recruitment.	Synaptic-vesicle exocytosis is mediated by the vesicular Ca(2+) sensor synaptotagmin-1. Synaptotagmin-1 interacts with the SNARE protein syntaxin-1A and acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). However, it is unclear how these interactions contribute to triggering membrane fusion. Using PC12 cells from Rattus norvegicus and artificial supported bilayers, we show that synaptotagmin-1 interacts with the polybasic linker region of syntaxin-1A independent of Ca(2+) through PIP2. This interaction allows both Ca(2+)-binding sites of synaptotagmin-1 to bind to phosphatidylserine in the vesicle membrane upon Ca(2+) triggering. We determined the crystal structure of the C2B domain of synaptotagmin-1 bound to phosphoserine, allowing development of a high-resolution model of synaptotagmin bridging two different membranes. Our results suggest that PIP2 clusters organized by syntaxin-1 act as molecular beacons for vesicle docking, with the subsequent Ca(2+) influx bringing the vesicle membrane close enough for membrane fusion.

23862076	20130718	Neural plasticity and proliferation in the generation of antidepressant effects: hippocampal implication.	It is widely accepted that changes underlying depression and antidepressant-like effects involve not only alterations in the levels of neurotransmitters as monoamines and their receptors in the brain, but also structural and functional changes far beyond. During the last two decades, emerging theories are providing new explanations about the neurobiology of depression and the mechanism of action of antidepressant strategies based on cellular changes at the CNS level. The neurotrophic/plasticity hypothesis of depression, proposed more than a decade ago, is now supported by multiple basic and clinical studies focused on the role of intracellular-signalling cascades that govern neural proliferation and plasticity. Herein, we review the state-of-the-art of the changes in these signalling pathways which appear to underlie both depressive disorders and antidepressant actions. We will especially focus on the hippocampal cellularity and plasticity modulation by serotonin, trophic factors as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through intracellular signalling pathways-cAMP, Wnt/ ? -catenin, and mTOR. Connecting the classic monoaminergic hypothesis with proliferation/neuroplasticity-related evidence is an appealing and comprehensive attempt for improving our knowledge about the neurobiological events leading to depression and associated to antidepressant therapies.

19076989	20081217	Tumor necrosis factor-alpha -308G/A single nucleotide polymorphism and red-complex periodontopathogens are independently associated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in diseased periodontal tissues.	Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha are involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. A high between-subject variation in the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA has been verified, which may be a result of genetic polymorphisms and/or the presence of periodontopathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola (called the red complex) and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. In this study, we investigated the effect of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA) -308G/A gene polymorphism and of periodontopathogens on the tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in the periodontal tissues of nonsmoking patients with chronic periodontitis (n = 127) and in control subjects (n = 177). The TNFA -308G/A single nucleotide polymorphism was investigated using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, whereas the tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels and the periodontopathogen load were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. No statistically significant differences were found in the frequency of the TNFA -308 single nucleotide polymorphism in control and chronic periodontitis groups, in spite of the higher frequency of the A allele in the chronic periodontitis group. The concomitant analyses of genotypes and periodontopathogens demonstrated that TNFA -308 GA/AA genotypes and the red-complex periodontopathogens were independently associated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in periodontal tissues, and no additive effect was seen when both factors were present. P. gingivalis, T. forsythia and T. denticola counts were positively correlated with the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. TNFA -308 genotypes were not associated with the periodontopathogen detection odds or with the bacterial load. Our results demonstrate that the TNFA -308 A allele and red-complex periodontopathogens are independently associated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in diseased tissues of nonsmoking chronic periodontitis patients and consequently are potentially involved in determining the disease outcome.

26709691	20151229	Advances in the biology and treatment of pediatric central nervous system tumors.	Central nervous system tumors represent the most common solid tumors in children and are a leading cause of cancer-related fatalities in this age group. Here, we provide an update on insights gained through molecular profiling of the most common malignant childhood brain tumors. Genomic profiling studies of medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (diffuse midline glioma, with H3-K27M mutation), have refined, if not redefined, the diagnostic classification and therapeutic stratification of patients with these tumors. They detail the substantial genetic heterogeneity across each disease type and, importantly, link genotypic information to clinical course. The most aggressive, treatment-resistant (and also treatment-sensitive) forms within each disease entity are identified, and their potentially actionable targets. Molecularly based classification of pediatric brain tumors provides a critical framework for the more precise stratification and treatment of children with brain tumors. 	Curr._Opin._Pediatr.

26689739	20151223	Mapping cellular processes in the mesenchyme during palatal development in the absence of Tbx1 reveals complex proliferation changes and perturbed cell packing and polarity.	The 22q11 deletion syndromes represent a spectrum of overlapping conditions including cardiac defects and craniofacial malformations. Amongst the craniofacial anomalies that are seen, cleft of the secondary palate is a common feature. Haploinsufficiency of TBX1 is believed to be a major contributor toward many of the developmental structural anomalies that occur in these syndromes, and targeted deletion of Tbx1 in the mouse reproduces many of these malformations, including cleft palate. However, the cellular basis of this defect is only poorly understood. Here, palatal development in the absence of Tbx1 has been analysed, focusing on cellular properties within the whole mesenchymal volume of the palatal shelves. Novel image analyses and data presentation tools were applied to quantify cell proliferation rates, including regions of elevated as well as reduced proliferation, and cell packing in the mesenchyme. Also, cell orientations (nucleus-Golgi axis) were mapped as a potential marker of directional cell movement. Proliferation differed only subtly between wild-type and mutant until embryonic day (E)15.5 when proliferation in the mutant was significantly lower. Tbx1(-/-) palatal shelves had slightly different cell packing than wild-type, somewhat lower before elevation and higher at E15.5 when the wild-type palate has elevated and fused. Cell orientation is biased towards the shelf distal edge in the mid-palate of wild-type embryos but is essentially random in the Tbx1(-/-) mutant shelves, suggesting that polarised processes such as directed cell rearrangement might be causal for the cleft phenotype. The implications of these findings in the context of further understanding Tbx1 function during palatogenesis and of these methods for the more general analysis of genotype-phenotype functional relationships are discussed.

24725450	20140415	Conformational changes and translocation of tissue-transglutaminase to the plasma membranes: role in cancer cell migration.	Tissue-transglutaminase (TG2), a dual function G-protein, plays key roles in cell differentiation and migration. In our previous studies we reported the mechanism of TG2-induced cell differentiation. In present study, we explored the mechanism of how TG2 may be involved in cell migration. To study the mechanism of TG2-mediated cell migration, we used neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) which do not express TG2, neuroblastoma cells expressing exogenous TG2 (SHYTG2), and pancreatic cancer cells which express high levels of endogenous TG2. Resveratrol, a natural compound previously shown to inhibit neuroblastoma and pancreatic cancer in the animal models, was utilized to investigate the role of TG2 in cancer cell migration. Immunofluorescence assays were employed to detect expression and intracellular localization of TG2, and calcium levels in the migrating cells. Native gel electrophoresis was performed to analyze resveratrol-induced cellular distribution and conformational states of TG2 in migrating cells. Data are presented as the mean and standard deviation of at least 3 independent experiments. Comparisons were made among groups using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer ad hoc test. TG2 containing cells (SHYTG2 and pancreatic cancer cells) exhibit increased cell migration and invasion in collagen-coated and matrigel-coated transwell plate assays, respectively. Resveratrol (1 ?M-10 ?M) prevented migration of TG2-expressing cells. During the course of migration, resveratrol increased the immunoreactivity of TG2 without affecting the total TG2 protein level in migrating cells. In these cells, resveratrol increased calcium levels, and depletion of intracellular calcium by a calcium chelator, BAPTA, attenuated resveratrol-enhanced TG2 immunoreactivity. In native-polyacrylamide gels, we detected an additional TG2 protein band with slower migration in total cell lysates of resveratrol treated cells. This TG2 form is non-phosphorylated, exclusively present in plasma membrane fractions and sensitive to intracellular Ca(2+) concentration suggesting a calcium requirement in TG2-regulated cell migration. Taken together, we conclude that resveratrol induces conformational changes in TG2, and that Ca(2+)-mediated TG2 association with the plasma membrane is responsible for the inhibitory effects of resveratrol on cell migration.

25380083	20141108	Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography as a screening tool for occult malignancy in patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism: an observational study.	Venous thromboembolism (VTE) can be the first clinical manifestation of an occult malignancy. We aimed to assess the value, in daily practice, of positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET-CT) for occult malignancy diagnosis in patients with unprovoked VTE.All PET-CTs performed over 5-years period (from January 2009 to October 2013) in adult patients followed in the Department of Internal Medicine (Bichat Hospital, Paris, France) were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical history, imaging findings, and additional diagnostic tests performed because of PET-CT findings were analyzed.From January 2009 to October 2013, PET-CT was performed for malignancy diagnosis in 67 consecutive patients with unprovoked VTE. Seventeen patients were excluded because of congenital or acquired thrombophilia, known cancer, estrogen use, inability to confirm VTE diagnosis, or missing data. Fifty patients (25 women; mean age, 65.2???15.9 years) were included. VTE was a first episode in 84% of cases. In 22 (44%) patients, PET-CT showed increased uptake suspicious for malignancy. After additional procedures, malignancy was confirmed in 12/22 patients. In all cases of confirmed malignancies, conventional computed tomography scan (CT-scan) had similar diagnosis yield, as compared with PET-CT. In 10/22 cases, the suspected diagnosis of malignancy could not be confirmed despite extensive workup including specialist visits (n?=?5), magnetic resonance imaging (n?=?4), gastrointestinal tract endoscopy (n?=?3), endometrial biopsies (n?=?2), and hysterectomy (n?=?1). The cost of additional diagnosis procedures performed because of false positive PET-CT amounted to ?1956/patient. Interestingly, considering CT-scan findings only, no further investigation would have been scheduled. No patient with negative or false positive PET-CT was diagnosed with cancer during a mean follow-up of 22???13.6 months.A diagnosis strategy based on PET-CT screening for malignancy in patients with unprovoked VTE had limited diagnosis value and may lead to unnecessary alarming and money- and time-consuming investigations.

7984061	19940901	Analysis of macromolecule resonances in 1H NMR spectra of human brain.	Macromolecule resonances underlying metabolites in 1H NMR spectra were investigated in temporal lobe biopsy tissue from epilepsy patients and from localized 1H spectra of the brains of healthy volunteers. The 1H NMR spectrum of brain tissue was compared with that of cytosol and dialyzed cytosol after removal of low molecular weight molecules (&lt; 3500 daltons) at 8.4 and 2.1 Tesla. The assignment of specific resonances to macromolecules in 2.1 Tesla, short-TE, localized human brain 1H NMR spectra in vivo was made on the basis of a J-editing method using the spectral parameters (delta, J) and connectivities determined from 2D experiments in vitro. Two prominent connectivities associated with macromolecules in vitro (0.93-2.05 delta and 1.6-3.00 delta) were also detected in vivo by the J-editing method. Advantage was taken of the large difference in measured T1 relaxation times between macromolecule and metabolite resonances in the brain spectrum to acquire 'metabolite-nulled' macromolecule spectra. These spectra appear identical to the spectra of macromolecules isolated in vitro. 	Magn_Reson_Med	D003160 D016428 D013487
25565750	20150108	Mutations in the MSX1 gene in Turkish children with non-syndromic tooth agenesis and other dental anomalies.	To search for mutations on the MSX1 gene and to present a genetic basis for non-syndromic tooth agenesis in conjunction with dental anomalies in a Turkish population. The patients included in this study were otherwise healthy, with ages ranging from seven to eighteen years. Eighty-two of them had one to six teeth missing (Group I) and 26 had more than six teeth missing (Group II), except for the third molars,. The missing teeth and dental anomalies were examined clinically and radiographically. The MSX1 gene was sequenced from the blood samples of patients who consented to the study. Mutations or polymorphisms on the MSX1 gene were identified in six patients. Taurodontism was seen in patients from both groups I and II. The nucleotide changes were identified by mutation screening. Performing family studies, screening other candidate genes, and investigation of interactions between genes will provide a basis for better analysis of tooth agenesis models and their association with other dental anomalies.

22209462	20120103	Pyrazolopyridine inhibitors of B-Raf(V600E). Part 3: an increase in aqueous solubility via the disruption of crystal packing.	A single crystal was obtained of a lead B-Raf(V600E) inhibitor with low aqueous solubility. The X-ray crystal structure revealed hydrogen-bonded head-to-tail dimers formed by the pyrazolopyridine and sulfonamide groups of a pair of molecules. This observation suggested a medicinal chemistry strategy to disrupt crystal packing and reduce the high crystal lattice energy of alternative inhibitors. Both a bulkier group at the interface of the dimer and an out-of-plane substituent were required to decrease the compound's melting point and increase aqueous solubility. These substituents were selected based on previously developed structure-activity relationships so as to concurrently maintain good enzymatic and cellular activity against B-Raf(V600E).

27471621	20160730	NLRC5 elicits antitumor immunity by enhancing processing and presentation of tumor antigens to CD8(+) T lymphocytes.	Cancers can escape immunesurveillance by diminishing the expression of MHC class-I molecules (MHC-I) and components of the antigen-processing machinery (APM). Developing new approaches to reverse these defects could boost the efforts to restore antitumor immunity. Recent studies have shown that the expression of MHC-I and antigen-processing molecules is transcriptionally regulated by NOD-like receptor CARD domain containing 5 (NLRC5). To investigate whether NLRC5 could be used to improve tumor immunogenicity, we established stable lines of B16-F10 melanoma cells expressing NLRC5 (B16-5), the T cell co-stimulatory molecule CD80 (B16-CD80) or both (B16-5/80). Cells harboring NLRC5 constitutively expressed MHC-I and LMP2, LMP7 and TAP1 genes of the APM. The B16-5 cells efficiently presented the melanoma antigenic peptide gp10025-33 to Pmel-1 TCR transgenic CD8(+) T cells and induced their proliferation. In the presence of CD80, B16-5 cells stimulated Pmel-1 cells even without the addition of gp100 peptide, indicating that NLRC5 facilitated the processing and presentation of endogenous tumor antigen. Upon subcutaneous implantation, B16-5 cells showed markedly reduced tumor growth in C57BL/6 hosts but not in immunodeficient hosts, indicating that the NLRC5-expressing tumor cells elicited antitumor immunity. Following intravenous injection, B16-5 and B16-5/80 cells formed fewer lung tumor foci compared to control cells. In mice depleted of CD8(+) T cells, B16-5 cells formed large subcutaneous and lung tumors. Finally, immunization with irradiated B16-5 cells conferred protection against challenge by parental B16 cells. Collectively, our findings indicate that NLRC5 could be exploited to restore tumor immunogenicity and to stimulate protective antitumor immunity. 	Oncoimmunology	D016428
23446089	20130301	Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene polymorphisms as risk factor in temporomandibular disorders patients from Southern Italy.	To evaluate the role of COMT gene variants as potential risk factors in a group of patients affected with chronic temporomandibular disorder (TMD) pain. We sequenced COMT gene in 182 Italian subjects (50 affected by TMD and 132 controls). The study population consisted of patients affected by myogenous and/or arthrogenous pain (RDC/TMD: Ia, Ib, IIIa, IIIb diagnostic categories). We detected 40 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) variants (18 novel). Three SNPs, all located in the promoter regions, were more frequently present in cases than in controls (rs 4646310 P=0.018, rs165656 P=0.001, rs 165722 P=0.007). After the False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction rs165656 remained significantly associated with TMD (P=0.049). In addition, the rs 4646310 (AG vs GG, P=0.015) and rs 165656 (GG vs CC, P=0.001) were at binary logistic regression analysis independently associated with TMD, conferring a risk disease of 2.6 (CI= 1.2-5.6) and of 5.3 (CI= 2.0-13.7) respectively. Our data extend the number of SNPs present in the promoter region that could play a regulatory role in COMT gene and suggest that the genetic polymorphisms rs 165656 and rs 4646310 exert a role in TMD susceptibility.

16055685	20050802	Regulation of photosynthetic GAPDH dissected by mutants.	Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) of higher plants catalyzes an NADPH-consuming reaction, which is part of the Calvin cycle. This reaction is regulated by light via thioredoxins and metabolites, while a minor NADH-dependent activity is constant and constitutive. The major native isozyme is formed by A- and B-subunits in stoichiometric ratio (A2B2, A8B8), but tetramers of recombinant B-subunits (GapB) display similar regulatory features to A2B2-GAPDH. The C-terminal extension (CTE) of B-subunits is essential for thioredoxin-mediated regulation and NAD-induced aggregation to partially inactive oligomers (A8B8, B8). Deletion mutant B(minCTE) is redox insensitive and invariably tetrameric, and chimeric mutant A(plusCTE) acquired redox sensitivity and capacity to aggregate to very large oligomers in presence of NAD. Redox regulation principally affects the turnover number, without significantly changing the affinity for either 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate or NADPH. Mutant R77A of GapB, B(R77A), is down-regulated and mimics the behavior of oxidized GapB under any redox condition, whereas mutant B(E362Q) is constantly up-regulated, resembling reduced GapB. Despite their redox insensitivity, both B(R77A) and B(E362Q) mutants are notably prone to aggregate in presence of NAD. Based on structural data and current functional analysis, a model of GAPDH redox regulation is presented. Formation of a disulfide in the CTE induces a conformational change of the GAPDH with repositioning of the terminal amino acid Glu-362 in the proximity of Arg-77. The latter residue is thus distracted from binding the 2'-phosphate of NADP, with the final effect that the enzyme relaxes to a conformation leading to a slower NADPH-dependent catalytic activity.

18942176	20081023	ruvA and ruvB mutants specifically impaired for replication fork reversal.	Replication fork reversal (RFR) is a reaction that takes place in Escherichia coli at replication forks arrested by the inactivation of a replication protein. Fork reversal involves the annealing of the leading and lagging strand ends; it results in the formation of a Holliday junction adjacent to DNA double-strand end, both of which are processed by recombination enzymes. In several replication mutants, replication fork reversal is catalysed by the RuvAB complex, originally characterized for its role in the last steps of homologous recombination, branch migration and resolution of Holliday junctions. We present here the isolation and characterization of ruvA and ruvB single mutants that are impaired for RFR at forks arrested by the inactivation of polymerase III, while they remain capable of homologous recombination. The positions of the mutations in the proteins and the genetic properties of the mutants suggest that the mutations affect DNA binding, RuvA-RuvB interaction and/or RuvB-helicase activity. These results show that a partial RuvA or RuvB defect affects primarily RFR, implying that RFR is a more demanding reaction than Holliday junction resolution. 	Mol._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485
2285227	19901101	Expression of the normal H-ras1 gene can suppress the transformed and tumorigenic phenotypes induced by mutant ras genes.	The transformed phenotype of rat 208F cells transfected with the T24 H-ras1 oncogene is suppressed by simultaneous or subsequent transfection with the normal H-ras1 gene. The suppressed cells express both the normal and mutant forms of ras p21 but the normal form predominates. Rare transformed cells obtained after simultaneous transfection express mainly the T24 p21. Some suppressed cells induce tumours in nude mice after a long lag period and these tumour cell lines have much reduced expression of normal p21. The normal H-ras1 gene also suppresses the transformed phenotype induced by mutant N-ras, albeit less effectively. The tumorigenicity of the EJ bladder carcinoma cell line, which contains only the T24 mutant allele of H-ras1, is also suppressed following transfection with the normal H-ras1 gene. The results suggest that transforming alleles of ras genes do not behave in a fully dominant manner and that expression of the normal allele at elevated levels can lead to suppression of the transformed and tumorigenic phenotypes.

25348067	20141029	MSEA: detection and quantification of mutation hotspots through mutation set enrichment analysis.	Many cancer genes form mutation hotspots that disrupt their functional domains or active sites, leading to gain- or loss-of-function. We propose a mutation set enrichment analysis (MSEA) implemented by two novel methods,MSEA-clust and MSEA-domain, to predict cancer genes based on mutation hotspot patterns. MSEA methods are evaluated by both simulated and real cancer data. We find approximately 51% of the eligible known cancer genes form detectable mutation hotspots. Application of MSEA in eight cancers reveals a total of 82 genes with mutation hotspots,including well-studied cancer genes, known cancer genes re-found in new cancer types, and novel cancer genes.

3147578	19881001	In vivo measurement of intracellular pH in human brain during different tensions of carbon dioxide in arterial blood. A 31P-NMR study.	The effect of changes in carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood upon intracellular pH in brain tissue was studied in seven healthy volunteers, aged 22-45 years. The pH changes were monitored by use of 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, performed on a whole-body 1.5 Tesla Siemens imaging system. The measurements were carried out during hyperventilation and with the subject breathing atmospheric air containing 5 vol. % and 7 vol. % carbon dioxide. Intracellular pH increased significantly during 15 min of hyper-ventilation and decreased significantly during 18 min respiration of air containing 7 vol. % carbon dioxide. The intracellular buffer capacity was estimated. These results suggest that the ventilation response to carbon dioxide is correlated to changes in intracellular fluid pH. 	Acta_Physiol._Scand.

26266418	20150813	eEF1A Interacts with the NS5A Protein and Inhibits the Growth of Classical Swine Fever Virus.	The NS5A protein of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is involved in the RNA synthesis and viral replication. However, the NS5A-interacting cellular proteins engaged in the CSFV replication are poorly defined. Using yeast two-hybrid screen, the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) was identified to be an NS5A-binding partner. The NS5A-eEF1A interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation, glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown and laser confocal microscopy assays. The domain I of eEF1A was shown to be critical for the NS5A-eEF1A interaction. Overexpression of eEF1A suppressed the CSFV growth markedly, and conversely, knockdown of eEF1A enhanced the CSFV replication significantly. Furthermore, eEF1A, as well as NS5A, was found to reduce the translation efficiency of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of CSFV in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by luciferase reporter assay. Streptavidin pulldown assay revealed that eEF1A could bind to the CSFV IRES. Collectively, our results suggest that eEF1A interacts with NS5A and negatively regulates the growth of CSFV.

16435193	20060126	Globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease): normal umbilical cord blood galactocerebrosidase activity and polymorphic mutations.	Globoid cell leukodystrophy is an inherited metabolic disorder of the central nervous system caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme galactocerebrosidase. Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only available effective treatment. The engraftment from normal donors provides competent cells able to correct the metabolic defect. Umbilical cord blood cells have proved to significantly decrease complications and improve engraftment rate compared to adult marrow cells in haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Umbilical cord blood cells must be of sufficient activity to provide central nervous system recovery after engraftment is obtained. Galactocerebrosidase activity is known to be affected by two polymorphic alleles found at nucleotides 502 and 1637 of the cDNA for this gene. This enzyme activity and the polymorphic alleles noted above were analysed in 83 random samples of umbilical cord blood. The activity, assayed with the fluorogenic substrate 6-hexadecanoylamino-4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-galactopyranoside, in those with neither polymorphic allele was 4.6 +/- 1.7 units (nmol/h per mg protein). This optimal choice of cord blood was found in only 24% of specimens. Homozygotes for 1637T &gt; C with activity of only 1.5 +/- 0.4 units represented 16% of the samples. Those heterozygous for 1637T &gt; C with slightly better activity (2.3 +/- 0.7 units) represented 52% of the samples. Choice of umbilical cord blood for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, therefore, requires consideration not only of cell quantity and HLA compatibility but also selection for normal alleles to obtain maximal enzymatic activity for central nervous system correction.

10961859	20000829	Dominant negative mutation of the hematopoietic-specific Rho GTPase, Rac2, is associated with a human phagocyte immunodeficiency.	Rho GTPases control a variety of cellular processes, including actin polymerization, integrin complex formation, cell adhesion, gene transcription, cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation. A patient is described who has recurrent infections and defective neutrophil cellular functions similar to those found in Rac2-deficient mice. Molecular methods were used to clone the expressed Rac2 cDNA from this patient, and a single base pair change (G--&gt;A at nucleotide 169) in the coding sequence was identified. This results in an asparagine for aspartic acid mutation at amino acid 57 (D57N), a residue that is involved in nucleotide binding and is conserved in all mammalian Rho GTPases. The cloned cDNA was then introduced into normal bone marrow cells through retrovirus vectors, and neutrophils expressing this mutant exhibited decreased cell movement and production of superoxide in response to fMLP. The expressed recombinant protein was also analyzed biochemically and exhibited defective binding to GTP. Functional studies demonstrated that the D57N mutant behaves in a dominant-negative fashion at the cellular level. The syndrome of Rac2 dysfunction represents a human condition associated with mutation of a Rho GTPase and is another example of human disease associated with abnormalities of small G protein signaling pathways.

26992786	20160320	Enhanced catalysis of L-asparaginase from Bacillus licheniformis by a rational redesign.	L-Asparaginase (3.5.1.1) being antineoplastic in nature are used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However glutaminase activity is the cause of various side effects when used as a drug against acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Therefore, there is a need of a novel L-asparaginase (L-ASNase) with low or no glutaminase activity. Such a property has been observed with L-ASNase from B. licheniformis (BliA). The enzyme being glutaminase free in nature paved the way for its improvement to achieve properties similar to or near to the commercially available L-ASNases. Rational enzyme engineering approach resulted in four mutants: G238N, E232A, D103V and Q112H. Among these the mutant enzyme, D103V, had a specific activity of 597.7IU/mg, which is higher than native (rBliA) (407.65IU/mg). Moreover, when the optimum temperature and in vitro half life were studied and compared with native BliA, D103V mutant BliA was better, showing tolerance to higher temperatures and a 3 fold higher half life. Kinetic studies revealed that the mutant D103V L-ASNase has increased substrate affinity, with Km value of 0.42mM and Vmax of 2778.9?molmin(-1). 	Enzyme_Microb._Technol.	D016428
27782101	20161027	Angiotensin II Promotes the Development of Carotid Atherosclerosis in Type 2 Diabetes Patients via Regulating the T Cells Activities: A Cohort Study.	BACKGROUND Specific T cell phenotype has been reported to potentially contribute to the development of angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced several vascular disorders. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is intimately associated with cardiovascular disease. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between T cell phenotypes and Ang II in T2DM patients combined with carotid atherosclerosis (CA). MATERIAL AND METHODS This study was performed on 50 patients with T2DM in our hospital. Based on the presence of CA, they were divided into CA group (presence of CA, n=30) or T2DM group (absence of CA, n=20). Additionally, 10 healthy participants were selected as controls. Basic characteristics of all participants were collected and recorded. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from patients and controls with or without Ang II and Ang II receptor blocker (ARB) treatment were used to detect Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell proportions, mRNA levels of T-bet, GATA3, and ROR?t as well as the expression of IFN-?, IL-4, and IL-17 by flow cytometry, ELISA, and Real-Time PCR. RESULTS Ang II levels were notably higher in patients in the CA group than those in the T2DM and control group (p&lt;0.05). Th1 and Th17 positive cells, mRNA levels of T-bet and RORgt as well as the expression of IFN-? and IL-17 were significantly increased in the CA group compared with the T2DM group and control group (p&lt;0.05). Moreover, the activities of T cells and related cytokines were significantly increased of healthy controls after Ang II treatment (p&lt;0.05), while these changes were notably weakened by ARB treatment (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS Ang II promotes the development of CA in T2DM patients by regulating T cells activities. 	Med._Sci._Monit.	D016428
24740276	20140418	De novo peptide design and experimental validation of histone methyltransferase inhibitors.	Histones are small proteins critical to the efficient packaging of DNA in the nucleus. DNA?protein complexes, known as nucleosomes, are formed when the DNA winds itself around the surface of the histones. The methylation of histone residues by enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) maintains gene repression over successive cell generations. Overexpression of EZH2 can silence important tumor suppressor genes leading to increased invasiveness of many types of cancers. This makes the inhibition of EZH2 an important target in the development of cancer therapeutics. We employed a three-stage computational de novo peptide design method to design inhibitory peptides of EZH2. The method consists of a sequence selection stage and two validation stages for fold specificity and approximate binding affinity. The sequence selection stage consists of an integer linear optimization model that was solved to produce a rank-ordered list of amino acid sequences with increased stability in the bound peptide-EZH2 structure. These sequences were validated through the calculation of the fold specificity and approximate binding affinity of the designed peptides. Here we report the discovery of novel EZH2 inhibitory peptides using the de novo peptide design method. The computationally discovered peptides were experimentally validated in vitro using dose titrations and mechanism of action enzymatic assays. The peptide with the highest in vitro response, SQ037, was validated in nucleo using quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics. This peptide had an IC50 of 13.5 mM, demonstrated greater potency as an inhibitor when compared to the native and K27A mutant control peptides, and demonstrated competitive inhibition versus the peptide substrate. Additionally, this peptide demonstrated high specificity to the EZH2 target in comparison to other histone methyltransferases. The validated peptides are the first computationally designed peptides that directly inhibit EZH2. These inhibitors should prove useful for further chromatin biology investigations.

In this study, we used a systems biology approach to investigate changes in the proteome and metabolome of shrimp hemocytes infected by the invertebrate virus WSSV (white spot syndrome virus) at the viral genome replication stage (12 hpi) and the late stage (24 hpi). At 12 hpi, but not at 24 hpi, there was significant up-regulation of the markers of several metabolic pathways associated with the vertebrate Warburg effect (or aerobic glycolysis), including glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, nucleotide biosynthesis, glutaminolysis and amino acid biosynthesis. We show that the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway was of central importance in triggering this WSSV-induced Warburg effect. Although dsRNA silencing of the mTORC1 activator Rheb had only a relatively minor impact on WSSV replication, in vivo chemical inhibition of Akt, mTORC1 and mTORC2 suppressed the WSSV-induced Warburg effect and reduced both WSSV gene expression and viral genome replication. When the Warburg effect was suppressed by pretreatment with the mTOR inhibitor Torin 1, even the subsequent up-regulation of the TCA cycle was insufficient to satisfy the virus's requirements for energy and macromolecular precursors. The WSSV-induced Warburg effect therefore appears to be essential for successful viral replication. 	PLoS_Pathog.	D016428 D013485
8632332	19960201	Endothelin-induced nociception in mice: mediation by ETA and ETB receptors.	Endothelins (ET-1, ET-2 or ET-3) or endothelin precursors (big-ET-1[1-38], big-ET-2[1-37] or big-ET-3[1-41]) injected i.p. in mice have previously been shown to elicit a characteristic nociceptive behavioral response. In this study, we investigated the endothelin receptor type (ETA or ETB) that mediates this behavioral response. Mice were injected i.p. with ET-1, ET-2, ET-3, big-ET-1[1-38], big-ET-2[1-37], big-ET-3[1-41], sarafotoxin S6a, sarafotoxin S6b, sarafotoxin S6c, ET-1 with Ala substitutions for Cys3 and Cys11 or His-Leu-Asp-Ile-Ile-Trp, and quantal dose-response curves were obtained for each of the compounds (except the latter). Co-administration of enzyme inhibitors with the big-endothelins was used to establish the requisite conversion to endothelins and big-ET-1[22-38], big-ET-2[22-37] and ET-3[22-41] amide, and the ETA-selective antagonist cyclo[-D-Asp-Pro-D-Val-Leu-D-Trp-] was used to determine receptor specificity. The ED50 values were 2.9, 3.3 and 23.9 micrograms/kg i.p. for ET-1, ET-2 and ET-3, respectively, 0.6, 0.6 and 13.1 micrograms/kg i.p. for sarafotoxin S6a, sarafotoxin S6b and sarafotoxin S6c, respectively, and 5.3 micrograms/kg i.p. for ET-1 with Ala substitutions for Cys3 and Cys11. Big-ET-1[22-38], big-ET-2[22-37], big-ET-3[22-41] amide and ET-C produced less than 25% effect up to 2000 micrograms/kg. The big-ET-1-induced effects were blocked by the enzyme inhibitors phosphoramidon and thiorphan (ID50 = 0.9 mg/kg) but not by ubenimex (bestatin), captopril or perindopril. Cyclo[-D-Asp-Pro-D-Val-Leu-D-Trp-] blocked ET-1- and ET-2-induced effects but not ET-3-, ACh- or phenyl-p-quinone-induced effects. These results suggest that endothelin-induced nociceptive behavioral response in mice can be mediated via both ET receptor types, ETA and ETB. Further, the ET-1 carboxy-terminal hexapeptide is insufficient to produce the effect, and the Cys3-Cys11 disulfide bridge of ET-1 is not required. 	J._Pharmacol._Exp._Ther.	D016428
26806424	20160126	Chondroitin sulfate ?-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-1 (ChGn-1) polymorphism: Association with progression of multiple sclerosis.	Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are a constituent of the matrix of the central nervous system (CNS), likely participating as regulatory molecules in the process of demyelination, remyelination, axonal degeneration and regeneration in the CNS. ChGn-1 is a key enzyme for production of CSPGs and knock-out mice of this gene showed better recovery from spinal cord injury. We hypothesized that the clinical course of multiple sclerosis (MS) is influenced by the level of expression of ChGn-1 gene. We recruited 147 patients with MS and 181 healthy control subjects and analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of this gene. We found the coding SNP (cSNP: rs140161612) in approximately 10% of patients with MS as well as normal controls. The cSNP is changed from serine to leucine at position 126 (p.S126L). The expressed ChGn-1 mutant proteins exhibited no enzyme activities in COS-1 cells. In men, patients who had MS with S126L had a slower disease progression. This cSNP might be associated with the sex differences in clinical course of MS. 	Neurosci._Res.	D016428
16950817	20060905	A novel mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA(Ser(AGY)) gene associated with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, and complex I deficiency.	To identify molecular defects in a girl with clinical features of MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy and lactic acidosis) and MERRF (ragged-red fibres) syndromes. The enzyme complex activities of the mitochondrial respiratory chain were assayed. Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis was used to scan the entire mitochondrial genome for unknown mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alterations, which were then identified by direct DNA sequencing. A novel heteroplasmic mtDNA mutation, G12207A, in the tRNA(Ser(AGY)) gene was identified in the patient who had a history of developmental delay, feeding difficulty, lesions within her basal ganglia, cerebral atrophy, proximal muscle weakness, increased blood lactate, liver dysfunction, and fatty infiltration of her muscle. Muscle biopsy revealed ragged red fibres and pleomorphic mitochondria. Study of skeletal muscle mitochondria revealed complex I deficiency associated with mitochondrial proliferation. Real time quantitative PCR analysis showed elevated mtDNA content, 2.5 times higher than normal. The tRNA(Ser(AGY)) mutation was found in heteroplasmic state (92%) in the patient's skeletal muscle. It was not present in her unaffected mother's blood or in 200 healthy controls. This mutation occurs at the first nucleotide of the 5' end of tRNA, which is involved in the formation of the stem region of the amino acid acceptor arm. Mutation at this position may affect processing of the precursor RNA, the stability and amino acid charging efficiency of the tRNA, and overall efficiency of protein translation. This case underscores the importance of comprehensive mutational analysis of the entire mitochondrial genome when a mtDNA defect is strongly suggested. 	J._Med._Genet.	D016422 D013485
9371691	19980124	Recombinant 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase derived from rat peroxisomal multifunctional enzyme 2: role of the hydratase reaction in bile acid synthesis.	Rat liver peroxisomes contain two multifunctional enzymes: (1) perMFE-1 [2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 1/Delta3,Delta2-enoyl-CoA isomerase/(S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase] and (2) perMFE-2 [2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 2/(R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase]. To investigate the role of the hydratase activity of perMFE-2 in beta-oxidation, a truncated version of perMFE-2 was expressed in Escherichia coli as a recombinant protein. The protein catalyses the hydration of straight-chain (2E)-enoyl-CoAs to (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoAs, but it is devoid of hydratase 1 [(2E)-enoyl-CoA to (3S)-hydroxyacyl-CoA] and (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities. The purified enzyme (46 kDa hydratase 2) can be stored as an active enzyme for at least half a year. The recombinant enzyme hydrates (24E)-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy- 5beta-cholest-24-enoyl-CoA to (24R,25R)-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha, 24-tetrahydroxy-5beta-cholestanoyl-CoA, which has previously been characterized as a physiological intermediate in bile acid synthesis. The stereochemistry of the products indicates that the hydration reaction catalysed by the enzyme proceeds via a syn mechanism. A monofunctional 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 has not been observed as a wild-type protein. The recombinant 46 kDa hydratase 2 described here survives in a purified form under storage, thus being the first protein of this type amenable to application as a tool in metabolic studies.

10917441	20000805	Determination of inorganic cations in brine solutions by ion chromatography.	The method for analysis of inorganic cations in brine solutions was developed. Ion chromatography is a well-established and accepted technique in the determination of a variety of inorganic ions. However, there are significant complications when ion chromatography is used to determine trace concentrations of inorganic ions in brine matrices. The brine solution in our study was made to simulate the solution from the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. Instrumental parameters such as eluent composition, flow-rates, and sample loop volumes were investigated to arrive at the optimum condition for the determination of the cations with minimal dilution. Separation was carried out in a Dionex CG12A/CS12A with 8.25 mM H2SO4 as eluent at 1.2 ml/min flow-rate. Our results indicated that ion chromatography is an accurate and a good alternative method for the analysis of cations in brine solution. 	J_Chromatogr_A	D016428 D013486
26645330	20151210	Hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether combined with He-Ne laser irradiation-induced apoptosis in canine breast cancer cells through the mitochondrial pathway.	Hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) combined with He-Ne laser irradiation is a novel and promising photodynamic therapy (PDT)-induced apoptosis that can be applied in vitro on canine breast cancer cells. However, the exact pathway responsible for HMME-PDT in canine breast cancer cells remains unknown. CHMm cells morphology and apoptosis were analyzed using optical microscope, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling fluorescein staining and DNA ladder assays. Apoptotic pathway was further confirmed by Real-time-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting assays. Our results showed that HMME-PDT induced significant changes in cell morphology, such as formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles and the gradual rounding of cells coupled with decreased size and detachment. DNA fragmentation and cell death was shown to occur in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, HMME-PDT increased the activities of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and released cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytoplasm. HMME-PDT also significantly increased both mRNA and protein levels of Bax and decreased P53 gene expression in a time-dependent manner, while the mRNA and protein expression of Bcl-2 were repressed. These alterations suggest that HMME-PDT induced CHMm cell apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and had anti-canine breast cancer effects in vitro. 	J._Vet._Sci.	D016428
21459095	20110405	Predicting cortisol stress responses in older individuals: influence of serotonin receptor 1A gene (HTR1A) and stressful life events.	Considerable variability in the activity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in response to stress has been found in quantitative genetic studies investigating healthy individuals suggesting that at least part of this variance is due to genetic factors. Since the HPA axis is regulated by a neuronal network including amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex as well as brainstem circuits, the investigation of candidate genes that impact neurotransmitter systems related to these brain regions might further elucidate the genetic underpinnings of the stress response. However, aside from genetic risk factors, past stressful life events might also result in long-term adjustments of HPA axis reactivity. Here, we investigated the effects of the -1019 G/C polymorphism in the HTR1A gene encoding the serotonin (5-HT) receptor 1A (5-HT(1A)) and stressful life events experienced during childhood and adolescence on changes in cortisol levels in response to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) in a sample of healthy older adults (N=97). Regression analyses revealed a significant effect of HTR1A genotype with the G allele being associated with a less pronounced stress response. In addition, an inverse relationship between past stressful life events and cortisol release but no gene ? environment interaction was detected. The results further underscore the crucial role of functional serotonergic genetic variation as well as stressful events during critical stages of development on the acute stress response later in life.

24259466	20131122	Therapeutic targeting of oncogenic K-Ras by a covalent catalytic site inhibitor.	We report the synthesis of a GDP analogue, SML-8-73-1, and a prodrug derivative, SML-10-70-1, which are selective, direct-acting covalent inhibitors of the K-Ras G12C mutant relative to wild-type Ras. Biochemical and biophysical measurements suggest that modification of K-Ras with SML-8-73-1 renders the protein in an inactive state. These first-in-class covalent K-Ras inhibitors demonstrate that irreversible targeting of the K-Ras guanine-nucleotide binding site is potentially a viable therapeutic strategy for inhibition of Ras signaling.

25962696	20150513	Fc-Gamma receptor polymorphism and gene expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer receiving single-agent trastuzumab.	The aim of this study was to investigate gene expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer receiving trastuzumab. We also evaluated the effect of Fc-gamma receptor genotype on trastuzumab-driven gene expression. Gene expression was assessed by microarray analyses before and after administration of single-agent trastuzumab in 34 patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who were genotyped for Fc-gamma receptor (FcGR) IIA H131R and FcGRIIIA V158F. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to identify the gene sets that were significantly enriched after administration of trastuzumab in patient cohorts categorized by FcGR variant. At baseline three non-immune-related gene sets were identified only in patient cohort of FcGRIIA non-H/H variant. Thirty gene sets were identified in the cohort of FcGRIIIA V/V variants, while no gene set was identified in FcGRIIIA non-V/V variants one week after starting trastuzumab. Eleven gene sets were identified in FcGRIIA H/H variants 8 week after starting trastuzumab, but none in non-H/H variants. Immune-related gene sets were significantly down-regulated after administration of trastuzumab. The response of PBMCs to trastuzumab markedly varied with polymorphisms in FcGRIIA and FcGRIIIA. These results indicate that FcGR polymorphisms contribute to the systemic immune reaction triggered by trastuzumab. Further investigations are needed to clarify the biological effects of FcGR variation on the mechanism of trastuzumab activity. 	Breast_Cancer	D016428
27061418	20160411	A phase I dose escalation study of NK012, an SN-38 incorporating macromolecular polymeric micelle.	This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RD) of NK012, a macromolecular polymeric micelle formulation of SN-38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan). Patients with previously treated advanced solid tumors and acceptable organ function were administered NK012 as a 30-min infusion every 21 or 28?days without premedications. Patients were screened for UGT1A1 *28 polymorphism prior to enrollment. Patients homozygous for UGT1A1*28 allele (*28/*28 genotype patients) were treated at a reduced dose level with the potential for dose escalation based on toxicities. Pharmacokinetic samples were obtained during cycles 1 and 2. Thirty-nine patients were enrolled, and thirty-eight patients were treated with NK012. NK012 was escalated from 9 to 37?mg/m(2) in patients with UGT1A1*28 allele genotype of wt/wt and wt/*28. The MTD/RD of a Q21D regimen was determined to be 28?mg/m(2) where the dose-limiting toxicity is myelosuppression, which appears to be cumulative and limits timely subsequent dosing. Based on delayed neutrophil recovery, the NK012 dose of 28?mg/m(2) administered on an every 28?days schedule was confirmed as the RD. Gastrointestinal toxicities were mild, with no grade 3 diarrhea reported. The T1/2z value of polymer-unbound SN-38 was significantly prolonged compared to that of SN-38 metabolized from CPT-11, indicating a sustained high systemic SN-38 concentration. Six patients had confirmed partial responses. Eighteen additional patients had stable disease as their best response to treatment. The recommended phase II dose of NK012 for UGT1A1 wt/wt and wt/*28 genotype patients is 28?mg/m(2) every 28?days. Additional clinical development as a single agent in specific patient populations or in combination with other chemotherapy agents is warranted. 	Cancer_Chemother._Pharmacol.	D017426 D016428
22943051	20120905	The spectrum of ?- and ?-thalassemia mutations in Yunnan Province of Southwestern China.	The aim of this study was to investigate the spectrum of thalassemia mutations in Yunnan Province, Southwestern China. We detected 450 thalassemia patients and carriers by multiplex gap polymerase chain reaction (gap-PCR), PCR reverse dot-blot hybridization and direct sequencing methods in 535 suspected patients. Four types of ?-thalassemia (?-thal) mutations, - -(SEA) (59.2%), -?(3.7) (rightward) (19.0%), Hb Constant Spring [Hb CS, ?142, Term?Gln, TAA&gt;CAA (?2), ?(CS)?] (15.5%), and -?(4.2) (leftward) (6.34%) were detected. Six types of ?-thal mutations, the most prevalent being Hb E [?26(B8)Glu?Lys, GAG&gt;AAG or codon 26 (G&gt;A)] (30.5%), followed by codon 17 (A&gt;T) (20.8%), codons 41/42 (-TCTT) (17.5%), IVS-II-654 (C&gt;T) (17.2%), -28 (A&gt;G) (6.95%), and codons 71/72 (+A) (2.42%) were also detected. Other rare mutations were codons 27/28 (+C), IVS-I-1 (G&gt;T), Hb New York [?113(G15)Val?Glu, GTG&gt;GAG], Hb D-Los Angeles [?121(GH4)Glu?Gln, GAA&gt;CAA], codon 5 (-CT), Hb G-Taipei [?22(B4)Glu?Glu (GAA&gt;GGA)], Hb J-Lome [?59(E3)Lys?Asn (AAG&gt;AAC)], Hb J-Bangkok [?56(D7)Gly?Asp (GGC&gt;GAC)], IVS-I-2 (T&gt;C), and -31 (A&gt;C). In this study, we provide a complete mutation spectrum of ?- and ?-thal mutations and a valuable strategy for accurate molecular diagnostic testing in Yunnan Province, People's Republic of China (PRC).

23479407	20130313	First-line management of EGFR-mutated advanced lung adenocarcinoma: recent developments.	Gefitinib and erlotinib are small-molecule reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Objective responses have been observed frequently in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbouring activating EGFR mutations, the most common being deletions in exon 19 and the exon 21 L858R mutation. EGFR mutations are prevalent in female patients, those who have never smoked, those of Asian ethnicity and those who have adenocarcinoma histology. Given the efficacy of EGFR TKIs in advanced NSCLC in the salvage setting, and their favourable toxicity profile compared with conventional chemotherapy, there is considerable interest in evaluating their efficacy in the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC. To date, there have been several phase II and phase III studies that have examined the efficacy of first-line single-agent EGFR TKIs in unselected, clinically selected or molecularly selected populations. Here we review and compare the differences in these phase III trials. Most phase III trials chose progression-free survival (PFS) rather than overall survival (OS) as their primary endpoint. PFS was prolonged but OS was not. The recent development of novel irreversible EGFR TKIs, such as afatinib and dacomitinib, is also reviewed. 	Drugs	D016428 D016454
9048418	19961101	Antifungal activity of synthetic 15-mer peptides based on the Rs-AFP2 (Raphanus sativus antifungal protein 2) sequence.	Plant defensins are a class of cysteine-rich peptides of which several members have been shown to be potent inhibitors of fungal growth. A series of overlapping 15-mer peptides based on the amino acid sequence of the radish antifungal protein Rs-AFP2 have been synthesized. Peptides 6, 7, 8 and 9, comprising the region from cysteine 27 to cysteine 47 of Rs-AFP2 showed substantial antifungal activity against several fungal species (minimal inhibitory concentrations of 30-60 micrograms/mL), but no activity towards bacteria (except peptide 6 at 100 micrograms/mL). The active peptides were shown to be sensitive to the presence of cations in the medium and to the composition and pH of the medium. When present at a subinhibitory concentration (20 micrograms/mL), peptides 1, 7, 8 and 10 potentiated the activity of Rs-AFP2 from 2.3-fold to 2.8-fold. By mapping the characteristics of the active peptide on the structure of Rs-AFP2 as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance, the active region of the antifungal protein appears to involve beta-strands 2 and 3 in combination with the loop connecting those strands. A cyclized synthetic mimic of the loop, cysteine 36 to cysteine 45, was shown to have antifungal activity. Substitution of tyrosine 38 by alanine in the cyclic peptide substantially reduced the antifungal activity, indicating the importance of this residue for the activity of Rs-AFP2 as demonstrated carrier by mutational analysis.

20631150	20100716	Divergent evolution in reverse transcriptase (RT) of HIV-1 group O and M lineages: impact on structure, fitness, and sensitivity to nonnucleoside RT inhibitors.	Natural evolution in primate lentiviral reverse transcriptase (RT) appears to have been constrained by the necessity to maintain function within an asymmetric protein composed of two identical primary amino acid sequences (66 kDa), of which one is cleaved (51 kDa). In this study, a detailed phylogenetic analysis now segregates groups O and M into clusters based on a cysteine or tyrosine residue located at position 181 of RT and linked to other signature residues. Divergent evolution of two group O (C181 or Y181) and the main (Y181 only) HIV-1 lineages did not appreciably impact RT activity or function. Group O RT structural models, based on group M subtype B RT crystal structures, revealed that most evolutionarily linked amino acids appear on a surface-exposed region of one subunit while in a noncatalytic RT pocket of the other subunit. This pocket binds nonnucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTI); therefore, NNRTI sensitivity was used to probe enzyme differences in these group O and M lineages. In contrast to observations showing acquired drug resistance associated with fitness loss, the C181Y mutation in the C181 group O lineage resulted in a loss of intrinsic NNRTI resistance and was accompanied by fitness loss. Other mutations linked to the NNRTI-resistant C181 lineage also resulted in altered NNRTI sensitivity and a net fitness cost. Based on RT asymmetry and conservation of the intricate reverse transcription process, millions of years of divergent primate lentivirus evolution may be constrained to discrete mutations that appear primarily in the nonfunctional, solvent-accessible NNRTI binding pocket.

23251356	20121220	Association of mitochondrial DNA polymerase ? gene POLG1 polymorphisms with parkinsonism in Chinese populations.	Mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG1) mutations were associated with levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism. POLG1 gene contains a number of common nonsynonymous SNPs and intronic regulatory SNPs which may have functional consequences. It is of great interest to discover polymorphisms variants associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), both in isolation and in combination with specific SNPs. We conducted a case-control study and genotyped twenty SNPs and poly-Q polymorphisms of POLG1 gene including in 344 Chinese sporadic PD patients and 154 healthy controls. All the polymorphisms of POLG1 we found in this study were sequenced by PCR products with dye terminator methods using an ABI-3100 sequencer. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium (LD) for association between twenty POLG1 SNPs and PD were calculated using the program Haploview. We provided evidence for strong association of four intronic SNPs of the POLG1 gene (new report: c.2070-12T&gt;A and rs2307439: c.2070-64G&gt;A in intron 11, P = 0.00011, OR = 1.727; rs2302084: c.3105-11T&gt;C and rs2246900: c.3105-36A&gt;G in intron 19, P = 0.00031, OR = 1.648) with PD. However, we did not identify any significant association between ten exonic SNPs of POLG1 and PD. Linkage disequilibrium analysis indicated that c.2070-12T&gt;A and c.2070-64G&gt;A could be parsed into one block as Haplotype 1 as well as c.3105-11T&gt;C and c.3105-36A&gt;G in Haplotype 2. In addition, case and control study on association of POLG1 CAG repeat (poly-Q) alleles with PD showed a significant association (P = 0.03, OR = 2.16) of the non-10/11Q variants with PD. Although intronic SNPs associated with PD didn't influence POLG1 mRNA alternative splicing, there was a strong association of c.2070-12T&gt;A and c.2070-64G&gt;A with decreased POLG1 mRNA level and protein levels. Our findings indicate that POLG1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of PD in Chinese populations. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428

Fas gene, which is related to apoptosis, influences the clinical remission of Graves' disease (GD). This study was performed to determine whether the Fas gene promoter polymorphism at position-670 is associated with different efficacy in GD patients treated with methimazole (MMI). Serum levels of thyroid hormone, sFas and thyrotropic-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TRAb) were evaluated as therapeutic efficacy parameters before and after 18-month treatment with MMI in a total of 115 subjects of North China. At the end of the follow-up study, patients were categorized into an effective group (group A) and an ineffective group (group B) according the level of thyroid hormone. Similar to the changes of thyroid hormone, the reductions of sFas and TRAb were significantly different in the two groups (P &lt; 0.05). Meanwhile, we detected that Fas promoter-670 A/G polymorphism existed in the GD patients of North China. We studied the frequencies of genotypes and alleles of the A/G polymorphism in different groups. However, there was no association between different efficacy and Fas promoter polymorphism in patients with GD. 	Pharmazie	D016428

20226665	20100316	Decoding individual episodic memory traces in the human hippocampus.	In recent years, multivariate pattern analyses have been performed on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, permitting prediction of mental states from local patterns of blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal across voxels. We previously demonstrated that it is possible to predict the position of individuals in a virtual-reality environment from the pattern of activity across voxels in the hippocampus. Although this shows that spatial memories can be decoded, substantially more challenging, and arguably only possible to investigate in humans, is whether it is feasible to predict which complex everyday experience, or episodic memory, a person is recalling. Here we document for the first time that traces of individual rich episodic memories are detectable and distinguishable solely from the pattern of fMRI BOLD signals across voxels in the human hippocampus. In so doing, we uncovered a possible functional topography in the hippocampus, with preferential episodic processing by some hippocampal regions over others. Moreover, our results imply that the neuronal traces of episodic memories are stable (and thus predictable) even over many re-activations. Finally, our data provide further evidence for functional differentiation within the medial temporal lobe, in that we show the hippocampus contains significantly more episodic information than adjacent structures.

25955295	20150509	Boswellia serrata Preserves Intestinal Epithelial Barrier from Oxidative and Inflammatory Damage.	Aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are currently the therapeutic choices in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), however, with limited remission and often serious side effects. Meanwhile complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is increasing, particularly herbal medicine. Boswellia serrata is a traditional Ayurvedic remedy with anti-inflammatory properties, of interest for its usefulness in IBDs. The mechanism of this pharmacological potential of Boswellia serrata was investigated in colonic epithelial cell monolayers exposed to H2O2 or INF-?+TNF-?, chosen as in vitro experimental model of intestinal inflammation. The barrier function was evaluated by the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and paracellular permeability assay, and by the tight junction proteins (zonula occludens-1, ZO-1 and occludin) immunofluorescence. The expression of phosphorylated NF-?B and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were determined by immunoblot and cytofluorimetric assay, respectively. Boswellia serrata oleo-gum extract (BSE) and its pure derivative acetyl-11-keto-?-boswellic acid (AKBA), were tested at 0.1-10 ?g/ml and 0.027 ?g/ml, respectively. BSE and AKBA safety was demonstrated by no alteration of intestinal cell viability and barrier function and integrity biomarkers. H2O2 or INF-?+TNF-? treatment of Caco-2 cell monolayers significantly reduced TEER, increased paracellular permeability and caused the disassembly of tight junction proteins occludin and ZO-1. BSE and AKBA pretreatment significantly prevented functional and morphological alterations and also the NF-?B phosphorylation induced by the inflammatory stimuli. At the same concentrations BSE and AKBA counteracted the increase of ROS caused by H2O2 exposure. Data showed the positive correlation of the antioxidant activity with the mechanism involved in the physiologic maintenance of the integrity and function of the intestinal epithelium. This study elucidates the pharmacological mechanisms mediated by BSE, in protecting intestinal epithelial barrier from inflammatory damage and supports its use as safe adjuvant in patients affected by IBD.

23364397	20130201	Exome sequencing reveals SCO2 mutations in a family presented with fatal infantile hyperthermia.	We applied whole-exome sequencing (WES) for identification of an underlying genetic cause of a disease in a family presented with fatal infantile hyperthermia. Analysis of WES results revealed novel, deleterious compound missense mutations, Val160Ala and Pro233Thr, in the synthesis of cytochrome C oxidase 2 gene (SCO2) encoding a mitochondrial protein, Sco2, which is important for cytochrome C oxidase (COX) synthesis. Autosomal recessive mutations in SCO2 are known to be associated with COX deficiency recognized as fatal infantile cardio-encephalomyopathy (604272, OMIM). The Val160Ala and Pro233Thr mutations occurred in the conserved thioredoxin domain of Sco2 and predicted to disrupt protein folding and interaction of Sco2 with other proteins. Our results show applicability of WES in identification of disease-causing mutations and in establishing molecular diagnosis of severe, infantile onset disorder with a challenging diagnosis.

23152778	20121116	Establishment and characterization of a highly tumourigenic and cancer stem cell enriched pancreatic cancer cell line as a well defined model system.	Standard cancer cell lines do not model the intratumoural heterogeneity situation sufficiently. Clonal selection leads to a homogeneous population of cells by genetic drift. Heterogeneity of tumour cells, however, is particularly critical for therapeutically relevant studies, since it is a prerequisite for acquiring drug resistance and reoccurrence of tumours. Here, we report the isolation of a highly tumourigenic primary pancreatic cancer cell line, called JoPaca-1 and its detailed characterization at multiple levels. Implantation of as few as 100 JoPaca-1 cells into immunodeficient mice gave rise to tumours that were histologically very similar to the primary tumour. The high heterogeneity of JoPaca-1 was reflected by diverse cell morphology and a substantial number of chromosomal aberrations. Comparative whole-genome sequencing of JoPaca-1 and BxPC-3 revealed mutations in genes frequently altered in pancreatic cancer. Exceptionally high expression of cancer stem cell markers and a high clonogenic potential in vitro and in vivo was observed. All of these attributes make this cell line an extremely valuable model to study the biology of and pharmaceutical effects on pancreatic cancer. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
23082207	20121020	Concordance of two diabetes diagnostic criteria using fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c: the Yuport Medical Checkup Centre study.	We tested the concordance of the two diagnostic criteria for diabetes using fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) by the Japan Diabetes Society (JDS) and American Diabetes Association (ADA). We used data from 7,328 subjects without known diabetes who participated in a voluntary health checkup program at least twice between 1998 and 2006, at intervals ? 2 years. For repeat participants who attended the screening over two times, data from the first and second checkups were used for this study. At the first visit, diabetes was diagnosed both at FPG ? 7.0 mmol/L and HbA1c ? 6.5% using the JDS criteria. In addition, diabetes was diagnosed using two ADA criteria; ADA-FPG diabetes for persistent fasting hyperglycemia (FPG ? 7.0 mmol/L) or ADA-HbA1c diabetes for hyper-glycated hemoglominemia (HbA1c ? 6.5%), both at the first and second checkups. Subsequently, the concordance of diagnosis between the JDS and the ADA criteria was evaluated. At the first checkup, 153 (2.1%) persons were diagnosed with diabetes by the JDS criteria. They had higher levels of risk factors for diabetes than non-diabetic subjects. Using the first and second checkups, 174 (2.4%) and 175 (2.4%) were diagnosed with diabetes by the ADA-FPG criteria, respectively. Among 153 subjects diagnosed with diabetes by the JDS criteria, 125 (81.7%) and 129 (84.3%) had ADA-FPG and ADA-HbA1c diabetes, respectively. The kappa coefficients of the JDS criteria with ADA-FPG and ADA-HbA1c criteria were 0.759 and 0.782 (P&lt;0.001), respectively. In the subgroup analysis stratified by sex, the concordance was well preserved at the kappa coefficients around 0.8 (between 0.725 and 0.836). The JDS diagnostic criteria for diabetes have a substantial and acceptable concordance with the ADA criteria. The JDS criteria may be a practical method for diagnosing diabetes that maintains compatibility with the ADA criteria. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428
27847876	20161117	Overcoming a nucleosomal barrier to replication.	Efficient overcoming and accurate maintenance of chromatin structure and associated histone marks during DNA replication are essential for normal functioning of the daughter cells. However, the molecular mechanisms of replication through chromatin are unknown. We have studied traversal of uniquely positioned mononucleosomes by T7 replisome in vitro. Nucleosomes present a strong, sequence-dependent barrier for replication, with particularly strong pausing of DNA polymerase at the +(31-40) and +(41-65) regions of the nucleosomal DNA. The exonuclease activity of T7 DNA polymerase increases the overall rate of progression of the replisome through a nucleosome, likely by resolving nonproductive complexes. The presence of nucleosome-free DNA upstream of the replication fork facilitates the progression of DNA polymerase through the nucleosome. After replication, at least 50% of the nucleosomes assume an alternative conformation, maintaining their original positions on the DNA. Our data suggest a previously unpublished mechanism for nucleosome maintenance during replication, likely involving transient formation of an intranucleosomal DNA loop. 	Sci_Adv	D016428

24040037	20130917	Molecular phylogeny of the Myxobolus and Henneguya genera with several new South American species.	The present study consists of a detailed phylogenetic analysis of myxosporeans of the Myxobolus and Henneguya genera, including sequences from 12 Myxobolus/Henneguya species, parasites of South American pimelodids, bryconids and characids. Maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony analyses, based on 18 S rDNA gene sequences, showed that the strongest evolutionary signal is the phylogenetic affinity of the fish hosts, with clustering mainly occurring according to the order and/or family of the host. Of the 12 South American species studied here, six are newly described infecting fish from the Brazilian Pantanal wetland. Henneguya maculosus n. sp. and Myxobolus flavus n. sp. were found infecting both Pseudoplatystoma corruscans and Pseudoplatystoma reticulatum; Myxobolus aureus n. sp. and Myxobolus pantanalis n. sp. were observed parasitizing Salminus brasiliensis and Myxobolus umidus n. sp. and Myxobolus piraputangae n. sp. were detected infecting Brycon hilarii.

24885920	20140603	microRNA-139-5p exerts tumor suppressor function by targeting NOTCH1 in colorectal cancer.	miR-139-5p was identified to be significantly down-regulated in colon tumor tissues by miRNA array. We aimed to clarify its biological function, molecular mechanisms and direct target gene in colorectal cancer (CRC). The biological function of miR-139-5p was examined by cell growth, cell cycle and apoptosis analysis in vitro and in vivo. miR-139-5p target gene and signaling pathway was identified by luciferase activity assay and western blot. miR-139-5p was significantly down-regulated in primary tumor tissues (P?&lt;?0.0001). Ectopic expression of miR-139-5p in colon cancer cell lines significantly suppressed cell growth as evidenced by cell viability assay (P?&lt;?0.001) and colony formation assay (P?&lt;?0.01) and in xenograft tumor growth in nude mice (P?&lt;?0.01). miR-139-5p induced apoptosis (P?&lt;?0.01), concomitantly with up-regulation of key apoptosis genes including cleaved caspase-8, caspase-3, caspase-7 and PARP. miR-139-5p also caused cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase (P?&lt;?0.01), with upregulation of key G0/G1 phase regulators p21Cip1/Waf1 and p27Kip1. Moreover, miR-139-5p inhibited cellular migration (P?&lt;?0.001) and invasiveness (P?&lt;?0.001) through the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)7 and MMP9. Oncogene NOTCH1 was revealed to be a putative target of miR-139-5p, which was inversely correlated with miR-139-5p expression (r?=?-0.3862, P?=?0.0002). miR-139-5p plays a pivotal role in colon cancer through inhibiting cell proliferation, metastasis, and promoting apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by targeting oncogenic NOTCH1.

23225982	20121211	Intronic SNPs of TP53 gene in chronic myeloid leukemia: Impact on drug response.	TP53, located on chromosome 17p13, is one of the most mutated genes affecting many types of human cancers. Thus, we aimed at investigating the association of SNPs in TP53 gene with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). A total of 236 CML and 157 control samples were analysed for mutations in TP53 gene using polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing. Sequencing analysis for mutations in exons 7-9 of the TP53 gene revealed four SNPs, three in intron 7 (C14181T, T14201G, and C14310T) and one SNP in intron 6 (A13463G) of TP53 gene. The mutation C14181T is located at position 72 base pairs downstream of the 3'-end of exon 7 of the P53 gene. This mutation is in complete linkage disequilibrium with a T14201G mutation, 20 base pairs further downstream occurring at position 14201. This mutation occurred only in the presence of C14181T mutation and these mutations showed association with advanced phase and cytogenetic poor response. Another two novel mutations, C14310T in intron 7 and A13463G in intron 6 were also found to be associated with cytogenetic poor response. Our study suggests that TP53 intronic SNPs might have a strong influence on disease progression and poor response in CML patients. 	J_Nat_Sci_Biol_Med	D016428
17990293	20071109	F413C and A531V but not R894X myotonia congenita mutations cause defective endoplasmic reticulum export of the muscle-specific chloride channel CLC-1.	In northern Finland myotonia congenita is caused by three main mutations in the ClC-1 chloride channel. We studied the molecular basis of these mutations (1238T&gt;G/F413C, 1592C&gt;T/A531V, and 2680C&gt;T/R894X). The mutated cDNAs were expressed either in L6 myotubes or in isolated rat myofibers using recombinant Semliki Forest virus. Experiments in L6 cells indicated that A531V and R894X proteins suffered from stability problems in these cells. Analysis in myofibers indicated that the A531V protein was totally retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas the export of the F413C protein was severely reduced. The C-terminal nonsense mutant (R894X), however, was normally transported to the Golgi elements in the myofibers. Defective export or reduced stability of the mutated proteins may thus be reasons for the myotonic symptoms. 	Muscle_Nerve	D016428 D013485
26550684	20151110	Artificial Avidin-Based Receptors for a Panel of Small Molecules.	Proteins with high specificity, affinity, and stability are needed for biomolecular recognition in a plethora of applications. Antibodies are powerful affinity tools, but they may also suffer from limitations such as low stability and high production costs. Avidin and streptavidin provide a promising scaffold for protein engineering, and due to their ultratight binding to D-biotin they are widely used in various biotechnological and biomedical applications. In this study, we demonstrate that the avidin scaffold is suitable for use as a novel receptor for several biologically active small molecules: Artificial, chicken avidin-based proteins, antidins, were generated using a directed evolution method for progesterone, hydrocortisone, testosterone, cholic acid, ketoprofen, and folic acid, all with micromolar to nanomolar affinity and significantly reduced biotin-binding affinity. We also describe the crystal structure of an antidin, sbAvd-2(I117Y), a steroid-binding avidin, which proves that the avidin scaffold can tolerate significant modifications without losing its characteristic tetrameric beta-barrel structure, helping us to further design avidin-based small molecule receptors.

23430490	20130223	Mutation Analysis in Glycogen Storage Disease Type III Patients in the Netherlands: Novel Genotype-Phenotype Relationships and Five Novel Mutations in the AGL Gene.	Glycogen Storage Disease type III (GSD III) is an autosomal recessive disorder in which a mutation in the AGL gene causes deficiency of the glycogen debranching enzyme. In childhood, it is characterized by hepatomegaly, keto-hypoglycemic episodes after short periods of fasting, and hyperlipidemia. In adulthood, myopathy, cardiomyopathy, and liver cirrhosis are the main complications. To determine the genotype of the GSD III patients (n = 14) diagnosed and treated in our center, mutation analysis was performed by either denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis or full gene sequencing. We developed, validated and applied both methods, and in all patients a mutation was identified on both alleles. Five novel pathogenic mutations were identified in seven patients, including four missense mutations (c.643G&gt;A, p.Asp215Asn; c.655A&gt;G, p.Asn219Asp; c.1027C&gt;T, p.Arg343Trp; c.1877A&gt;G, p.His626Arg) and one frameshift mutation (c.3911delA, p.Asn1304fs). The c.643G&gt;A, p.Asp215Asn mutation is related with type IIIa, as this mutation was found homozygously in two type IIIa patients. In addition to five novel mutations, we present new genotype-phenotype relationships for c.2039G&gt;A, p.Trp680X; c.753_756delCAGA, p.Asp251fs; and the intron 32 c.4260-12A&gt;G splice site mutation. The p.Trp680X mutation was found homozygously in four patients, presenting a mild IIIa phenotype with mild skeletal myopathy, elevated CK values, and no cardiomyopathy. The p.Asp251fs mutation was found homozygously in one patient presenting with a severe IIIa phenotype, with skeletal myopathy, and severe symptomatic cardiomyopathy. The c.4260-12A&gt;G mutation was found heterozygously, together with the p.Arg343Trp mutation in a severe IIIb patient who developed liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, necessitating an orthotopic liver transplantation.

17573812	20070619	Adult-onset glycogen storage disease type 2: clinico-pathological phenotype revisited.	The need for clinical awareness and diagnostic precision of glycogen storage disease type 2 (GSD2) has increased, as enzyme replacement therapy has become available. So far, only small series have reported the muscle pathology of late-onset GSD2. We reassessed 43 muscle biopsies of 38 GSD2 patients. In all patients the diagnosis of GSD2 has been established by biochemistry and/or mutational analysis of the GAA gene. Additionally to the expected morphological features, ultrastructural analysis revealed a high incidence of autophagic vacuoles, lipofuscin debris, structural Z-line disorganization and histological neurogenic-like pattern that were not thoroughly appreciated, previously. Comparing age at onset and morphology, excessive vacuolar and autophagic myopathy and mitochondrial disorganization of virtually all fibres is common in infants. At juvenile onset, a more moderate vacuolization without significant differences in overall morphology is notable. At late-onset, the spectrum of vacuolar myopathy is more divergent, ranging from almost normal to severe. Here pronounced secondary alterations are observed that include lipofuscin debris, autophagic vacuoles with residual lysosomal bodies and granular inclusions, structural mitochondrial and Z-line texture alterations. Moreover, there is a high incidence of subtle neurogenic-like alteration in all subtypes. Nineteen patients were genetically tested; in 15 patients the common leaky splicing mutation c.-45T&gt;G (or IVS1-13T&gt;G) in intron1 of the GAA gene was found on at least one allele, facilitating genetic screening. In our patients, GAA genotype appears not to be associated with secondary alterations such as autophagic vacuoles, structural alterations or neurogenic-like changes. These findings may have implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis of GSD2 and for assessing therapeutic success of enzyme replacement therapy. 	Neuropathol._Appl._Neurobiol.

26077345	20150617	Higher plasma betatrophin/ANGPTL8 level in Type 2 Diabetes subjects does not correlate with blood glucose or insulin resistance.	Betatrophin/ANGPTL8 is a newly identified hormone produced in liver and adipose tissue that has been shown to be induced as a result of insulin resistance and regulates lipid metabolism. Little is known about betatrophin level in humans and its association with T2D and metabolic risk factors. Plasma level of betatrophin was measured by ELISA in 1603 subjects: 1047 non-diabetic and 556 T2D subjects and its associations with metabolic risk factors in both non-diabetic and T2D were also studied. Our data show a significant difference in betatrophin levels between non-diabetic (731.3 (59.5-10625.0) pg/ml) and T2D (1710.5 (197.4-12361.1) p &lt; 0.001. Betatrophin was positively correlated with age, BMI, waist/hip ratio, FBG, HbA1C, HOMA-IR and TG in the non-diabetic subjects. However, no association was observed with BMI, FBG, HbA1C or HOMA-IR in T2D subjects. TC and LDL showed negative association with betatrophin in T2D subjects. Multivariate analysis showed that subjects in the highest tertile of betatrophin had higher odds of having T2D (odd ratio [OR] = 6.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]?=?(3.15 - 12.01). Our data show strong positive associations between betatrophin and FBG and insulin resistance in non-diabetic subjects. However, correlations with FBG and insulin resistance were diminished in T2D subjects. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D013485
22658861	20120605	Numerical modeling of thermoelastic generation of ultrasound by laser irradiation in the coupled thermoelasticity.	Laser-generation of ultrasound is investigated in the coupled dynamical thermoelasticity in the presented paper. The coupled heat conduction and wave equations are solved using finite differences. It is shown that the application of staggered grids in combination with explicit integration of the wave equation facilitates the decoupling of the solution and enables the application of a combination of implicit and explicit numerical integration techniques. The presented solution is applied to model the generation of ultrasound by a laser source in isotropic and transversely isotropic materials. The influence of the coupling of the generalized thermoelasticity is investigated and it will be shown, that for ultra high frequency waves (i.e. 100GHz) generated by laser pulses with duration in the picosecond range, the thermal feedback becomes considerable leading to a strong attenuation of the longitudinal bulk wave. Moreover, the coupling leads to dispersion influencing the wave velocities at low frequencies. The numerical simulations are compared to theoretical results available in the literature. Wave fields generated by a line focused laser source are presented by the numerical model for isotropic and for transversely isotropic materials. 	Ultrasonics	D016428
26063650	20150612	Probing the ligand recognition and discrimination environment of the globin-coupled oxygen sensor protein YddV by FTIR and time-resolved step-scan FTIR spectroscopy.	YddV is a newly discovered signal transducer heme protein that recognizes O2 and CO. Structural differences in the ligand-bound heme complex in YddV reflect variations in catalytic regulation by O2 and CO. Time-resolved step-scan (TRS(2)) FTIR studies of the wild type and of the important in oxygen recognition and stability of the heme Fe(II)-O2 complex L65M, L65T, Y43A, Y43F and Y43W mutants were performed to determine the site-specific protein dynamics following carbon monoxide (CO) photodissociation. These mutations were designed to perturb the electrostatic field near the iron-bound gaseous ligand (CO) and also to allow us to investigate the communication pathway between the distal residues of the protein and heme. TRS(2)-FTIR spectra of YddV-heme-CO show that the heme propionates are in protonated and deprotonated states. Moreover, the rate of decay of the vibrations of amide I is on a time scale that coincides with the rate of rebinding of CO, which suggests that there is coupling between ligation dynamics in the distal heme environment and (i) relaxation of the protein backbone and (ii) the environment sensed by the heme propionates. The fast recombination rates in L65M, L65T and Y43W imply a significant role of L65 and Y43 in controlling the ligand dynamics. The implications of these results with respect to the role of the heme propionates and the charged or proton-donating residues in the distal pocket, which are crucial for stabilizing bound gaseous ligands, are discussed.

15827186	20050414	T-cell growth transformation by herpesvirus saimiri is independent of STAT3 activation.	Herpesvirus saimiri (saimirine herpesvirus 2) (HVS), a T-lymphotropic tumor virus, induces lymphoproliferative disease in several species of New World primates. In addition, strains of HVS subgroup C are able to transform T cells of Old World primates, including humans, to permanently growing T-cell lines. In concert with the Stp oncoprotein, the tyrosine kinase-interacting protein (Tip) of HVS C488 is required for T-cell transformation in vitro and lymphoma induction in vivo. Tip was previously shown to interact with the protein tyrosine kinase Lck. Constitutive activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) has been associated with oncogenesis and has also been detected in HVS-transformed T-cell lines. Furthermore, Tip contains a putative consensus YXPQ binding motif for the SH2 (src homology 2) domains of STAT1 and STAT3. Tip tyrosine phosphorylation at this site was required for binding of STATs and induction of STAT-dependent transcription. Here we sought to address the relevance of STAT activation for transformation of human T cells by introducing a tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutation in the YXPQ motif of Tip of HVS C488. Unexpectedly, the recombinant virus was still able to transform human T lymphocytes, but it had lost its capability to activate STAT3 as well as STAT1. This demonstrates that growth transformation by HVS is independent of STAT3 activation. 	J._Virol.	D016428 D013485
25565213	20150108	Contribution of IL-12A and IL-12B polymorphisms to Chlamydia trachomatis-specific cell-mediated immune responses.	Inherited variance in the IL-12B gene is associated with susceptibility to Chlamydia trachomatis-induced tubal factor infertility and disease severity. In this study, our aim was to discover how polymorphisms in IL-12-coding genes influence C.?trachomatis-induced immune responses and IL-12 production. The study population consisted of 240 women. IL-12A and IL-12B single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were determined from isolated DNA using the Sequenom system with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. We studied lymphocyte proliferative (LP) responses to C.?trachomatis strains E and F elementary bodies (EBs) and recombinant chlamydial heat-shock protein 60 (CHSP60) antigen. IL-12p40 and IL-12p70 levels were measured using the BD Flex Set method. We found a statistically significant association between the C.?trachomatis EB antigen-specific LP response and the rs2853694 SNP (P?=?0.02). Our study demonstrates that the IL-12 cytokine family is involved in C.?trachomatis-specific immune responses. Moreover, C.?trachomatis-induced IL-12 production and the IL-12B rs2853694 SNP partially explain individual variation in the C.?trachomatis LP response. 	Scand._J._Immunol.	D016428 D013485
27037934	20160403	Physical and Bioactive Properties of Muffins Enriched with Raspberry and Cranberry Pomace Powder: A Promising Application of Fruit By-Products Rich in Biocompounds.	The objective of this study was to determine the effects on quality of incorporating raspberry and cranberry pomaces into American-style muffins prepared under various baking conditions. The different baking conditions did not affect the texture or microstructure of the control muffins. The enhanced samples baked at 140??C for 30?min were characterized by a harder texture than the control muffins and by a distributed protein matrix and distorted starch granules, while those baked at 240??C for 15?min had a moist texture and showed incomplete starch gelatinization. The mean percent recovery of ellagic acid, flavonols, tocopherols, tocotrienols, and anthocyanins after baking were 156, 53, 48, 43, and 22?%, respectively. Lower baking temperature was better for ellagic acid and tocotrienols, but worse for flavonols, tocopherols, and anthocyanins. It seems that, for the enhanced samples, the intermediate baking conditions (180??C for 20?min) guarantee the best microstructure and texture and the appropriate retention of phytochemicals in muffins.

24945345	20140620	Mitochondrial fusion and ERK activity regulate steroidogenic acute regulatory protein localization in mitochondria.	The rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, known as the transfer of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, is facilitated by StAR, the Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory protein. We have described that mitochondrial ERK1/2 phosphorylates StAR and that mitochondrial fusion, through the up-regulation of a fusion protein Mitofusin 2, is essential during steroidogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that mitochondrial StAR together with mitochondrial active ERK and PKA are necessary for maximal steroid production. Phosphorylation of StAR by ERK is required for the maintenance of this protein in mitochondria, observed by means of over-expression of a StAR variant lacking the ERK phosphorylation residue. Mitochondrial fusion regulates StAR levels in mitochondria after hormone stimulation. In this study, Mitofusin 2 knockdown and mitochondrial fusion inhibition in MA-10 Leydig cells diminished StAR mRNA levels and concomitantly mitochondrial StAR protein. Together our results unveil the requirement of mitochondrial fusion in the regulation of the localization and mRNA abundance of StAR. We here establish the relevance of mitochondrial phosphorylation events in the correct localization of this key protein to exert its action in specialized cells. These discoveries highlight the importance of mitochondrial fusion and ERK phosphorylation in cholesterol transport by means of directing StAR to the outer mitochondrial membrane to achieve a large number of steroid molecules per unit of StAR.

(TGF?) is a well-studied inducer of EMT. We demonstrate that TGF? potently stimulates hyaluronan synthesis via upregulation of hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) in NMuMG mammary epithelial cells. This stimulatory effect requires the kinase active type I TGF? receptor and is dependent on Smad signaling and activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Knockdown of HAS2 inhibited the TGF?-induced EMT by about 50%, as determined by the phase contrast microscopy and immunostaining using the EMT marker ZO-1. Furthermore, real-time PCR analysis of the EMT markers fibronectin, Snail1 and Zeb1 revealed decreased expressions upon HAS2 suppression, using specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) for HAS2. Removal of the extracellular hyaluronan by Streptomyces hyaluronidase or inhibiting the binding to its cell surface receptor CD44 by blocking antibodies, did not inhibit TGF?-induced EMT. Interestingly, HAS2 suppression completely abolished the TGF?-induced cell migration, whereas CD44 knockdown did not. These observations suggest that TGF?-dependent HAS2 expression, but not extracellular hyaluronan, has an important regulatory role in TGF?-induced EMT. 	Oncogene	D016428 D013485
26094627	20150623	Forward Looking Radar Imaging by Truncated Singular Value Decomposition and Its Application for Adverse Weather Aircraft Landing.	The forward looking radar imaging task is a practical and challenging problem for adverse weather aircraft landing industry. Deconvolution method can realize the forward looking imaging but it often leads to the noise amplification in the radar image. In this paper, a forward looking radar imaging based on deconvolution method is presented for adverse weather aircraft landing. We first present the theoretical background of forward looking radar imaging task and its application for aircraft landing. Then, we convert the forward looking radar imaging task into a corresponding deconvolution problem, which is solved in the framework of algebraic theory using truncated singular decomposition method. The key issue regarding the selecting of the truncated parameter is addressed using generalized cross validation approach. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in achieving angular resolution enhancement with suppressing the noise amplification in forward looking radar imaging.

26569308	20151117	Meta-Analysis of DNA Tumor-Viral Integration Site Selection Indicates a Role for Repeats, Gene Expression and Epigenetics.	Oncoviruses cause tremendous global cancer burden. For several DNA tumor viruses, human genome integration is consistently associated with cancer development. However, genomic features associated with tumor viral integration are poorly understood. We sought to define genomic determinants for 1897 loci prone to hosting human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV). These were compared to HIV, whose enzyme-mediated integration is well understood. A comprehensive catalog of integration sites was constructed from the literature and experimentally-determined HPV integration sites. Features were scored in eight categories (genes, expression, open chromatin, histone modifications, methylation, protein binding, chromatin segmentation and repeats) and compared to random loci. Random forest models determined loci classification and feature selection. HPV and HBV integrants were not fragile site associated. MCPyV preferred integration near sensory perception genes. Unique signatures of integration-associated predictive genomic features were detected. Importantly, repeats, actively-transcribed regions and histone modifications were common tumor viral integration signatures. 	Cancers_(Basel)	D016428
24570807	20140227	IL-4 and IL-5 secretions predominate in the airways of wistar rats exposed to toluene diisocyanate vapor.	We established a Wistar rat model of asthma caused by toluene diisocyanate (TDI) exposure, and investigated the relationship between TDI exposure concentrations and respiratory hypersensitivity, airway inflammation, and cytokine secretions in animals, to better understand the mechanism of TDI induced occupational asthma. Wistar rats were exposed to two different concentrations of TDI vapor four hours a day for five consecutive days. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, and differential leucocytes from the BAL fluid were analyzed. Lung histopathological examination was carried out to investigate the inflammatory status in the airways. Production of cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 productions in the BAL fluid in vivo was determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The TDI-exposed rats exhibited greater airway hypersensitivity symptoms than the control rats. The BAL differential cell count and lung histopathological examination demonstrated that inflammation reactions were present in both the central and peripheral airways, characterized with marked infiltration of eosinophils in the TDI-exposed rats. The cytokine assay showed that IL-4 and IL-5 were predominantly produced in the BAL fluid in vivo. These findings imply that TDI exposure concentrations may greatly affect the occurrence and extent of inflammatory events and that Th2 type cytokines may play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of TDI-induced occupational respiratory hypersensitivity.

16861974	20060725	Low-grade intraductal carcinoma of salivary gland: report of 3 cases with marked apocrine differentiation.	Low-grade intraductal carcinomas (LG-IDCs) of salivary gland are rare neoplasms that resemble atypical ductal hyperplasia or LG-IDCs of the breast. They have been referred to as &quot;low-grade salivary duct carcinomas&quot; or &quot;low-grade cribriform cystadenocarcinomas.&quot; Herein, we describe 3 additional cases of LG-IDCs, 2 were pure intraductal carcinomas, although 1 demonstrated increasing cytologic atypia and progression to an invasive adenosquamous carcinoma. The latter had been present for 7 years before demonstrating clinical and pathologic progression to a widely invasive malignancy. The intraductal component in all cases exhibited a remarkable degree of apocrine differentiation. The tumor cells were positive for AE1:AE3, Cam 5.2, high molecular weight keratin, CK7, CK19, BRST-2, and androgen receptors (ARs). S-100 was positive in 2 cases and negative in 1 case. The intraductal neoplastic cells were surrounded by myoepithelial cells positive for CK14, actins, calponin, high molecular weight keratin, and p63. All the tumors were negative for CK20, estrogen and progesterone receptors, Her2Neu, and p53. Extensive apocrine differentiation, expression of ARs, CK7, and CK19, and progression to a widely invasive carcinoma after a long clinical latency have not been reported in LG-IDCs previously. These tumors share some histopathologic features with salivary duct carcinoma including apocrine differentiation, and expression of ARs and BRST-2. The terms &quot;low-grade salivary duct carcinomas&quot; and &quot;low-grade cribriform cystadenocarcinomas&quot; should be abandoned in favor of LG-IDC of salivary gland, which better reflects their predominantly noninvasive, intraductal nature.

27626182	20160915	Predictive value of homocysteine for depression after acute coronary syndrome.	We investigated roles of plasma homocysteine and MTHFR gene in relation to risks and treatment responses of depression in ACS. A sample of 969 patients with recent ACS were recruited and 711 followed 1 year later. In addition, of 378 baseline participants with depressive disorder, 255 were randomized to a 24-week double blind trial of escitalopram (N = 127) or placebo (N = 128). A higher homocysteine concentration was independently associated with prevalent depressive disorder at baseline irrespective of MTHFR genotype; and with both incident and persistent depressive disorder at follow-up only in the presence of TT genotype. MTHFR genotype was not itself associated with depressive disorder after ACS. No associations were found with 24-week antidepressant treatment responses. Plasma homocysteine could be a biomarker for depressive disorder particularly in the acute phase of ACS. Focused interventions for those with higher homocysteine level and MTHFR TT genotype might reduce the risk of later depressive disorder. 	Oncotarget	D016428
27000125	20160323	Neighborhood Socioeconomic Status in Relation to Serum Biomarkers in the Black Women's Health Study.	Lower neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Black women have a higher CVD risk and are more likely to live in poor neighborhoods than white women. We examined the association of neighborhood SES with several CVD biomarkers using data from the Black Women's Health Study (BWHS), a follow-up study of US black women reporting high levels of education and income. Blood specimens of 418 BWHS participants were assayed for C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin A1C (hgA1C), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. US Census block group data were linked to the women's addresses to reflect neighborhood SES. Multivariable-adjusted mixed linear regression models that adjusted for person-level SES and for cardiovascular risk factors were used to assess CRP, hgA1C, and HDL levels in relation to quintiles of neighborhood SES. Women living in the poorest neighborhoods had the least favorable biomarker levels. As neighborhood SES increased, CRP decreased (P for trend?=?0.01), hgA1C decreased (P for trend?=?0.07), and HDL increased (P for trend?=?0.19). These associations were present within strata of individual educational level. The present findings suggest that neighborhood environments may affect physiological processes within residents independently of individual SES. 	J_Urban_Health	D016428 D052061
23796921	20130626	Plasmodium falciparum pfmdr1</i>Polymorphisms Inferred from<i>Ex Vivo</i>Culture of Ugandan Parasites.	Polymorphisms in thePlasmodium falciparummultidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1) gene impact sensitivity to multiple antimalarials. In Africa, polymorphisms at N86Y and D1246Y are common and have various impacts on sensitivity to different drugs. To gain insight into the fitness consequences of these polymorphisms, we cultured parasites isolated from children with malaria in Tororo, Uganda, where the multiplicity of infection is high, and used pyrosequencing to follow polymorphism prevalences in culture over time. Of 71 cultures, parasites in 69 were successfully analyzed at N86Y and parasites in 68 were successfully analyzed at D1246Y over 3 to 36 days of culture. For position 86, the sequences of 39/69 (56.5%) parasites remained stable (&gt;90% prevalence over 2 to 17 time points), with 82.1% of these being stable for the 86Y mutation. For position 1246, the sequences of 31/68 (45.6%) parasites remained stable, with 64.5% of these being stable for the wild-type D1246 sequence (P= 0.0002 for comparison of stable mutant genotypes for the two alleles). Defining allele selection as a ?15% change in prevalence between the first and last samples assessed, for position 86, 11 samples showed selection, with selection toward 86Y occurring in 72.7% of alleles; for position 1246, 14 samples showed selection, with selection toward D1246 occurring in 64.3% of alleles (P= 0.11 for comparison of selection of mutations at the two alleles). Among the 7 samples with selection at both alleles, 5 showed selection for both 86Y and D1246. Overall, consistent trends in the direction of selection were seen, although differences were not statistically significant. Our results suggest fitness advantages for parasites with thepfmdr186Y mutation and wild-type D1246, highlighting the complex interplay between drug resistance and fitness in malaria parasites.

25408912	20141120	Association study in siblings and case-controls of serotonin- and oxytocin-related genes with high functioning autism.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is heritable and neurodevelopmental with unknown causes. The serotonergic and oxytocinergic systems are of interest in autism for several reasons: (i) Both systems are implicated in social behavior, and abnormal levels of serotonin and oxytocin have been found in people with ASD; (ii) treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and oxytocin can yield improvements; and (iii) previous association studies have linked the serotonin transporter (SERT; SLC6A4), serotonin receptor 2A (HTR2A), and oxytocin receptor (OXTR) genes with ASD. We examined their association with high functioning autism (HFA) including siblings and their interaction. In this association study with HFA children (IQ?&gt;?80), siblings, and controls, participants were genotyped for four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in OXTR (rs2301261, rs53576, rs2254298, rs2268494) and one in HTR2A (rs6311) as well as the triallelic HTTLPR (SERT polymorphism). We identified a nominal significant association with HFA for the HTTLPR s allele (consisting of S and LG alleles) (p?=?.040; odds ratio (OR)?=?1.697, 95% CI 1.191-2.204)). Four polymorphisms (HTTLPR, HTR2A rs6311, OXTR rs2254298 and rs53576) in combination conferred nominal significant risk for HFA with a genetic score of ?4 (OR?=?2.09, 95% CI 1.05-4.18, p?=?.037). The resulting area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.595 (p?=?.033). Our findings, combined with those of previous reports, indicate that ASD, in particular HFA, is polygenetic rather than monogenetic and involves the serotonergic and oxytocin pathways, probably in combination with other factors.

26754925	20160113	IER5 generates a novel hypo-phosphorylated active form of HSF1 and contributes to tumorigenesis.	The transcription factors HSF1 and p53 both modulate the stress response, thereby protecting and facilitating the recovery of stressed cells, but both have the potential to promote tumor development. Here we show that a p53 target gene, IER5, encodes an activator of HSF1. IER5 forms a ternary complex with HSF1 and the phosphatase PP2A, and promotes the dephosphorylation of HSF1 at numbers of serine and threonine residues, generating a novel, hypo-phosphorylated active form of HSF1. IER5 is also transcriptionally upregulated in various cancers, although this upregulation is not always p53-dependent. The IER5 locus is associated with a so-called super enhancer, frequently associated with hyperactivated oncogenes in cancer cell lines. Enhanced expression of IER5 induces abnormal HSF1 activation in cancer cells and contributes to the proliferation of these cells under stressed conditions. These results reveal the existence of a novel IER5-mediated cancer regulation pathway that is responsible for the activation of HSF1 observed in various cancers. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D013485

Mycobacterium leprae DNA gyrases carrying various mutations, previously described in clinical strains, were investigated for quinolone susceptibility by inhibition of supercoiling and DNA cleavage promotion. We demonstrated that the gyrA mutations leading to G89C or A91V confer fluoroquinolone resistance whereas the gyrB mutation leading to D205N does not. 	Antimicrob._Agents_Chemother.	D016428 D013485
27064113	20160412	Histone H4 lysine 20 acetylation is associated with gene repression in human cells.	Histone acetylation is generally associated with gene activation and chromatin decondensation. Recent mass spectrometry analysis has revealed that histone H4 lysine 20, a major methylation site, can also be acetylated. To understand the function of H4 lysine 20 acetylation (H4K20ac), we have developed a specific monoclonal antibody and performed ChIP-seq analysis using HeLa-S3 cells. H4K20ac was enriched around the transcription start sites (TSSs) of minimally expressed genes and in the gene body of expressed genes, in contrast to most histone acetylation being enriched around the TSSs of expressed genes. The distribution of H4K20ac showed little correlation with known histone modifications, including histone H3 methylations. A motif search in H4K20ac-enriched sequences, together with transcription factor binding profiles based on ENCODE ChIP-seq data, revealed that most transcription activators are excluded from H4K20ac-enriched genes and a transcription repressor NRSF/REST co-localized with H4K20ac. These results suggest that H4K20ac is a unique acetylation mark associated with gene repression. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D013485
20515102	20100603	Molecular packing and chemical association in liquid water simulated using ab initio hybrid Monte Carlo and different exchange-correlation functionals.	In the free energy of hydration of a solute, the chemical contribution is given by the free energy required to expel water molecules from the coordination sphere and the packing contribution is given by the free energy required to create the solute-free coordination sphere (the observation volume) in bulk water. With the simple point charge/extended (SPC/E) water model as a reference, we examine the chemical and packing contributions in the free energy of water simulated using different electron density functionals. The density is fixed at a value corresponding to that for SPC/E water at a pressure of 1 bar. The chemical contribution shows that water simulated at 300 K with BLYP is somewhat more tightly bound than water simulated at 300 K with revised PBE (revPBE) functional or at 350 K with the BLYP and BLYP-D functionals. The packing contribution for various radii of the observation volume is studied. In the size range where the distribution of water molecules in the observation volume is expected to be Gaussian, the packing contribution is expected to scale with the volume of the observation sphere. Water simulated at 300 K with the revPBE and at 350 K with BLYP-D or BLYP conforms to this expectation, but the results suggest an earlier onset of system size effects in the BLYP 350 K and revPBE 300 K systems than that observed for either BLYP-D 350 K or SPC/E. The implication of this observation for constant pressure simulations is indicated. For water simulated at 300 K with BLYP, in the size range where Gaussian distribution of occupation is expected, we instead find non-Gaussian behavior, and the packing contribution scales with surface area of the observation volume, suggesting the presence of heterogeneities in the system.

26585824	20151121	Identification of a Novel Nematotoxic Protein by Challenging the Model Mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea with a Fungivorous Nematode.	The dung of herbivores, the natural habitat of the model mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea, is a nutrient-rich but also very competitive environment for a saprophytic fungus. We showed previously that C. cinerea expresses constitutive, tissue-specific armories against antagonists such as animal predators and bacterial competitors. In order to dissect the inducible armories against such antagonists, we sequenced the poly(A)-positive transcriptome of C. cinerea vegetative mycelium upon challenge with fungivorous and bacterivorous nematodes, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and mechanical damage. As a response to the fungivorous nematode Aphelenchus avenae, C. cinerea was found to specifically induce the transcription of several genes encoding previously characterized nematotoxic lectins. In addition, a previously not characterized gene encoding a cytoplasmic protein with several predicted Ricin B-fold domains, was found to be strongly upregulated under this condition. Functional analysis of the recombinant protein revealed a high toxicity toward the bacterivorous nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Challenge of the mycelium with A. avenae also lead to the induction of several genes encoding putative antibacterial proteins. Some of these genes were also induced upon challenge of the mycelium with the bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. These results suggest that fungi have the ability to induce specific innate defense responses similar to plants and animals. 	G3_(Bethesda)	D016428 D013485 D013486
27487211	20160804	Thirst neurons anticipate the homeostatic consequences of eating and drinking.	Thirst motivates animals to drink in order to maintain fluid balance. Thirst has conventionally been viewed as a homeostatic response to changes in blood volume or tonicity. However, most drinking behaviour is regulated too rapidly to be controlled by blood composition directly, and instead seems to anticipate homeostatic imbalances before they arise. How this is achieved remains unknown. Here we reveal an unexpected role for the subfornical organ (SFO) in the anticipatory regulation of thirst in mice. By monitoring deep-brain calcium dynamics, we show that thirst-promoting SFO neurons respond to inputs from the oral cavity during eating and drinking and then integrate these inputs with information about the composition of the blood. This integration allows SFO neurons to predict how ongoing food and water consumption will alter fluid balance in the future and then to adjust behaviour pre-emptively. Complementary optogenetic manipulations show that this anticipatory modulation is necessary for drinking in several contexts. These findings provide a neural mechanism to explain longstanding behavioural observations, including the prevalence of drinking during meals, the rapid satiation of thirst, and the fact that oral cooling is thirst-quenching.

9334199	19971023	Major changes in the kinetic mechanism of AMP inhibition and AMP cooperativity attend the mutation of Arg49 in fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase.	The significance of subunit interface residues Arg49 and Lys50 in the function of porcine liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was explored by site-directed mutagenesis, initial rate kinetics, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The Lys50 --&gt; Met mutant had kinetic properties similar to the wild-type enzyme but was more thermostable. Mutants Arg49 --&gt; Leu, Arg49 --&gt; Asp, Arg49 --&gt; Cys were less thermostable than the wild-type enzyme yet exhibited wild-type values for kcat and Km. The Ki for the competitive inhibitor fructose 2,6-bisphosphate increased 3- and 5-fold in Arg49 --&gt; Leu and Arg49 --&gt; Asp, respectively. The Ka for Mg2+ increased 4-8-fold for the Arg49 mutants, with no alteration in the cooperativity of Mg2+ binding. Position 49 mutants had 4-10-fold lower AMP affinity. Most significantly, the mechanism of AMP inhibition with respect to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate changed from noncompetitive (wild-type enzyme) to competitive (Arg49 --&gt; Leu and Arg49 --&gt; Asp mutants) and to uncompetitive (Arg49 --&gt; Cys mutant). In addition, AMP cooperativity was absent in the Arg49 mutants. The R and T-state circular dichroism spectra of the position 49 mutants were identical and superimposable on only the R-state spectrum of the wild-type enzyme. Changes from noncompetitive to competitive inhibition by AMP can be accommodated within the framework of a steady-state Random Bi Bi mechanism. The appearance of uncompetitive inhibition, however, suggests that a more complex mechanism may be necessary to account for the kinetic properties of the enzyme. 	J._Biol._Chem.

26278173	20150818	Novel Inter-Subunit Contacts in Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus Revealed by Cryo-Electron Microscopy.	Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV, genus Hordeivirus) is a rod-shaped single-stranded RNA virus similar to viruses of the structurally characterized and well-studied genus Tobamovirus. Here we report the first high-resolution structure of BSMV at 4.1 ? obtained by cryo-electron microscopy. We discovered that BSMV forms two types of virion that differ in the number of coat protein (CP) subunits per turn and interactions between the CP subunits. While BSMV and tobacco mosaic virus CP subunits have a similar fold and interact with RNA using conserved residues, the axial contacts between the CP of these two viral groups are considerably different. BSMV CP subunits lack substantial axial contacts and are held together by a previously unobserved lateral contact formed at the virion surface via an interacting loop, which protrudes from the CP hydrophobic core to the adjacent CP subunit. These data provide an insight into diversity in structural organization of helical viruses. 	Structure	D016428 D013485
24745974	20140422	Towards XNA nanotechnology: new materials from synthetic genetic polymers.	Nucleic acids display remarkable properties beyond information storage and propagation. The well-understood base pairing rules have enabled nucleic acids to be assembled into nanostructures of ever increasing complexity. Although nanostructures can be constructed using other building blocks, including peptides and lipids, it is the capacity to evolve that sets nucleic acids apart from all other nanoscale building materials. Nonetheless, the poor chemical and biological stability of DNA and RNA constrain their applications. Recent advances in nucleic acid chemistry and polymerase engineering enable the synthesis, replication, and evolution of a range of synthetic genetic polymers (XNAs) with improved chemical and biological stability. We discuss the impact of this technology on the generation of XNA ligands, enzymes, and nanostructures with tailor-made chemistry. 	Trends_Biotechnol.	D016428 D016454
22427805	20120320	Glucocorticoid receptor 1B and 1C mRNA transcript alterations in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and their possible regulation by GR gene variants.	Abnormal patterns of HPA axis activation, under basal conditions and in response to stress, are found in individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Altered glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA and protein expression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in psychiatric illness have also been reported, but the cause of these abnormalities is not known. We quantified expression of GR mRNA transcript variants which employ different 5' promoters, in 35 schizophrenia cases, 31 bipolar disorder cases and 34 controls. We also explored whether sequence variation within the NR3C1 (GR) gene is related to GR mRNA variant expression. Total GR mRNA was decreased in the DLPFC in schizophrenia cases relative to controls (15.1%, p&lt;0.0005) and also relative to bipolar disorder cases (8.9%, p&lt;0.05). GR-1B mRNA was decreased in schizophrenia cases relative to controls (20.2%, p&lt;0.05), while GR-1C mRNA was decreased in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder cases relative to controls (16.1% and 17.2% respectively, both p&lt;0.005). A dose-dependent effect of rs10052957 genotype on GR-1B mRNA expression was observed, where CC homozygotes displayed 18.4% lower expression than TC heterozygotes (p&lt;0.05), and 31.8% lower expression than TT homozygotes (p&lt;0.005). Similarly, a relationship between rs6190 (R23K) genotype and GR-1C expression was seen, with 24.8% lower expression in GG homozygotes than GA heterozygotes (p&lt;0.01). We also observed an effect of rs41423247 (Bcl1) SNP on expression of 67 kDa GR? isoform, the most abundant GR? isoform in the DLPFC. These findings suggest possible roles for the GR-1B and GR-1C promoter regions in mediating GR gene expression changes in psychotic illness, and highlight the potential importance of sequence variation within the NR3C1 gene in modulating GR mRNA expression in the DLPFC.

27806967	20161104	Neuronal Nav1.8 Channels as a Novel Therapeutic Target of Acute Atrial Fibrillation Prevention.	Ganglionated plexus have been developed as additional ablation targets to improve the outcome of atrial fibrillation (AF) besides pulmonary vein isolation. Recent studies implicated an intimate relationship between neuronal sodium channel Nav1.8 (encoded by SCN10A) and AF. The underlying mechanism between Nav1.8 and AF remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the role of Nav1.8 in cardiac electrophysiology in an acute AF model and explore possible therapeutic targets. Immunohistochemical study was used on canine cardiac ganglionated plexus. Both Nav1.5 and Nav1.8 were expressed in ganglionated plexus with canonical neuronal markers. Sixteen canines were randomly administered either saline or the Nav1.8 blocker A-803467. Electrophysiological study was compared between the 2 groups before and after 6-hour rapid atrial pacing. Compared with the control group, administration of A-803467 decreased the incidence of AF (87.5% versus 25.0%, P&lt;0.05), shortened AF duration, and prolonged AF cycle length. A-803467 also significantly suppressed the decrease in the effective refractory period and the increase in effective refractory period dispersion and cumulative window of vulnerability caused by rapid atrial pacing in all recording sites. Patch clamp study was performed under 100?nmol/L A-803467 in TSA201 cells cotransfected with SCN10A-WT, SCN5A-WT, and SCN3B-WT. INa,Pwas reduced by 45.34% at -35?mV, and INa,Lby 68.57% at -20?mV. Evident fast inactivation, slow recovery, and use-dependent block were also discovered after applying the drug. Our study demonstrates that Nav1.8 could exert its effect on electrophysiological characteristics through cardiac?ganglionated plexus. It indicates that Nav1.8 is a novel target in understanding cardiac electrophysiology and SCN10A-related arrhythmias. 	J_Am_Heart_Assoc	D016428
23476140	20130312	Inhibition of androgen receptor expression with small interfering RNA enhances cancer cell apoptosis by suppressing survival factors in androgen insensitive, late stage LNCaP cells.	The aim was to evaluate the changes of androgen receptor (AR) expression quantitatively and to identify influence of AR on cancer related survival markers in LNCap cell line. We compared expressions of AR, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), clusterin (CLU), glucose-related protein 78 (GRP78), and cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) and their genes between es-LNCaP (less than 33 times subcultured, L-33), ls-LNCaP (over 81 times subcultured, H-81), and si-LNCaP (AR siRNA transfected ls-LNCaP) by Western blotting and RT-PCR. The expressions of AR, HSP27, CLU, GRP78, and c-FLIP were increased in ls-LNCaP compared with es-LNCaP (AR, 157%; HSP27, 132%; CLU, 146%; GRP78, 138%; c-FLIP, 152%). However, in si-LNCaP cell line, protein expressions were reversed to the level of es-LNCaP cell lines (25, 102, 109, 98, and 101%), and gene expressions on real-time PCR were also reversed to the expression level of es-LNCaP (ls-LNCaP: 179, 156, 133, 123, and 167%; si-LNCaP: 22, 93, 103, 112, and 107%). This finding suggests that androgen receptor can be related to the increased expression of cancer related survival markers such as HSP27, GRP78, CLU, and c-FLIP in late stage prostate cancer, and also inhibition of AR gene can be a therapeutic target in this stage of cancer.

20031619	20091225	Sarcomere mutations in cardiomyopathy with left ventricular hypertrabeculation.	Mutations in the genes encoding sarcomere proteins have been associated with both hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy. Recently, mutations in myosin heavy chain (MYH7), cardiac actin (ACTC), and troponin T (TNNT2) were associated with left ventricular noncompaction, a form of cardiomyopathy characterized with hypertrabeculation that may also include reduced function of the left ventricle. We used clinically available genetic testing on 3 cases referred for evaluation of left ventricular dysfunction and noncompaction of the left ventricle and found that all 3 individuals carried sarcomere mutations. The first patient presented with neonatal heart failure and was referred for left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy. Genetic testing found 2 different mutations in MYBPC3 in trans. The first mutation, 3776delA, Q1259fs, rendered a frame shift at 1259 of cardiac myosin-binding protein C and the second mutation was L1200P. The frameshift mutation was also found in this mother who displayed mild echocardiographic features of cardiomyopathy, with only subtle increase in trabeculation and an absence of hypertrophy. A second pediatric patient presented with heart failure and was found to carry a de novo MYH7 R369Q mutation. The third case was an adult patient with dilated cardiomyopathy referred for ventricular hypertrabeculation. This patient had a family history of congestive heart failure, including pediatric onset cardiomyopathy where 3 individuals in the family were found to have the MYH7 mutation R1250W. Genetic testing should be considered for cardiomyopathy with hypertrabeculation. 	Circ_Cardiovasc_Genet	D016430 D016428 D013485
20332346	20100325	Association between CNDP1 genotype and diabetic nephropathy is sex specific.	The 5-5 homozygous CNDP1 (carnosinase) genotype is associated with a reduced risk of diabetic nephropathy. We investigated whether this association is sex specific and independent of susceptibility for type 2 diabetes. Three separate groups of 114, 90, and 66 patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy were included in this study and compared with 93 patients with type 2 diabetes for &gt;15 years without diabetic nephropathy and 472 population control subjects. The diabetes control group was used to determine an association in the three patient groups separately, and the population control group was used to estimate the genotype risk [odds ratio (CI)] for the population in a pooled analysis. The population control subjects were also compared with 562 patients with type 2 diabetes without diabetic nephropathy to determine whether the association was independent of type 2 diabetes. The CNDP1 genotype was determined by fragment analysis after PCR amplification. The frequency of the 5-5 homozygous genotype was 28, 36, and 41% in the three diabetic nephropathy patient groups and 43 and 42% in the diabetic and population control subjects, respectively. The 5-5 homozygous genotype occurred significantly less frequently in women in all three patient groups compared with diabetic control subjects. The genotype risk for the population was estimated to be 0.5 (0.30-0.68) in women and 1.2 (0.77-1.69) in men. The 562 patients with type 2 diabetes without diabetic nephropathy did not differ from the general population (P = 0.23). This study suggests that the association between the CNDP1 gene and diabetic nephropathy is sex specific and independent of susceptibility for type 2 diabetes. 	Diabetes	D016428 D013485

24333836	20131217	Mutations adjacent to the end of transmembrane helices 6 and 7 independently affect drug efflux capacity of yeast ABC transporter Pdr5p.	As a mammalian p-glycoprotein homolog, Pdr5p is a major ATP-binding cassette transporter for cellular detoxification in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, two novel loss-of-function mutations located adjacent to the ends of the predicted transmembrane helices of Pdr5p were identified. C793F and S1230L mutations considerably impaired the transport activity of Pdr5p without affecting the ATPase activity and the expression level of the protein. Our results demonstrate that the size of residue 793 and the hydrophobicity of residue 1230 are important for Pdr5p efflux function. It reveals that amino acid residues located near the end of transmembrane helix play an important role in drug efflux of Pdr5p. Molecular docking results further suggest that these two single mutations might have disturbed interactions between the drugs and Pdr5p, preventing the drugs from approaching the intracellular or extracellular portal and subsequently from being exported by Pdr5p.

27223698	20160526	Consumer Preferences for Written and Oral Information about Allergens When Eating Out.	Avoiding food allergens when eating outside the home presents particular difficulties for food allergic (FA) and intolerant (FI) consumers and a lack of allergen information in restaurants and takeaways causes unnecessary restrictions. Across Europe, legislation effective from December 2014, aims to improve allergen information by requiring providers of non-prepacked foods to supply information related to allergen content within their foods. Using in-depth interviews with 60 FA/FI adults and 15 parents/carers of FA/FI children, we aimed to identify FA/FI consumers' preferences for written and/or verbal allergen information when eating out or ordering takeaway food. A complex and dynamic set of preferences and practices for written and verbal allergen information was identified. Overwhelmingly, written information was favoured in the first instance, but credible personal/verbal communication was highly valued and essential to a good eating out experience. Adequate written information facilitated implicit trust in subsequent verbal information. Where written information was limited, FA/FIs depended on social cues to assess the reliability of verbal information resources, and defaulted to tried and tested allergen avoidance strategies when these were deemed unreliable. Understanding the subtle negotiations and difficulties encountered by FA/FIs when eating out can serve as a guide for legislators and food providers; by encouraging provision of clear written and verbal allergen information, and training of proactive, allergen-aware staff. This, in tandem with legal requirements for allergen information provision, paves the way for FA/FIs to feel more confident in eating out choices; and to experience improved eating out experiences.

25866529	20150414	MEIS1, a Promising Candidate Gene, Is Not Associated with the Core Symptoms of Antipsychotic-Induced Restless Legs Syndrome in Korean Schizophrenia Patients.	Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a distressing sleep disorder to which individuals appear to be genetically predisposed. In the present study, we assumed that antipsychotic-induced RLS symptoms were attributable to differences in individual genetic susceptibility, and investigated whether MEIS1, a promising candidate gene, was associated with antipsychotic-induced RLS symptoms in schizophrenia patients. All subjects were diagnosed with schizophrenia by board-certified psychiatrists using the Korean version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. We assessed antipsychotic-induced RLS symptoms in 190 Korean schizophrenic patients using the diagnostic criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. Genotyping was performed for the rs2300478 and rs6710341 polymorphisms of the MEIS1 gene. We divided subjects into RLS symptom (n=96) and non-symptom (n=94) groups. There was no significant between-group difference in the genotype or allele frequencies of the two polymorphisms investigated, nor in the frequency of the rs2300478-rs6710341 haplotype. Our data do not suggest that the rs2300478 and rs6710341 polymorphisms of the MEIS1 gene are associated with the core symptoms of antipsychotic-induced RLS in schizophrenia; different genetic mechanisms may underlie antipsychotic-induced vs. primary RLS.

25820215	20150331	Association between rs6812193 polymorphism and sporadic Parkinson's disease susceptibility.	Recently, the association of a single nucleotide polymorphism rs6812193 C/T with sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) susceptibility has been widely evaluated, but the results remained inconsistent. This association should be clarified because of the importance of it on human health and quality of life. We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to evaluate the association between the rs6812193 polymorphism and sporadic PD. PubMed was used to retrieve articles published up to June 2014 for all studies evaluating the rs6812193 polymorphism and PD in humans. Ethnicity-specific subgroup analysis was also performed based on ethnicity susceptibility. A total of 17 independent study samples (15 Caucasians and 2 Asians) including 17,956 cases and 52,751 controls were used in the presented study. The MAFT (minor allele T frequency) in PD patients of European descent is obviously higher than Asian cases (p &lt; 0.01). The results suggested the rs6812193 polymorphism (allele T vs. C) is significantly associated with PD susceptibility among overall samples (OR 0.882, 95 % CI 0.856-0.908) and Caucasian population (OR 0.881, 95 % CI 0.856-0.907), but not in Asian samples (OR 0.918, 95 % CI 0.721-1.168). No evidence of publication bias was observed. Throughout our analysis, the rs6812193 polymorphism is significantly associated with sporadic PD susceptibility in Caucasian samples, and ethnicity might be the key point of inconsistency in rs6812193 studies. Further studies are warranted to re-examine the observed associations, especially in different ethnicities. 	Neurol._Sci.	D016428 D017418 D013485
23052974	20121012	Cooperative regulation of myosin-S1 binding to actin filaments by a continuous flexible Tm-Tn chain.	The regulation of striated muscle contraction involves cooperative interactions between actin filaments, myosin-S1 (S1), tropomyosin (Tm), troponin (Tn), and calcium. These interactions are modeled by treating overlapping tropomyosins as a continuous flexible chain (CFC), weakly confined by electrostatic interactions with actin. The CFC is displaced locally in opposite directions on the actin surface by the binding of either S1 or Troponin I (TnI) to actin. The apparent rate constants for myosin and TnI binding to and detachment from actin are then intrinsically coupled via the CFC model to the presence of neighboring bound S1s and TnIs. Monte Carlo simulations at prescribed values of the CFC stiffness, the CFC's degree of azimuthal confinement, and the angular displacements caused by the bound proteins were able to predict the stopped-flow transients of S1 binding to regulated F-actin. The transients collected over a large range of calcium concentrations could be well described by adjusting a single calcium-dependent parameter, the rate constant of TnI detachment from actin, k(-I). The resulting equilibrium constant K(B) ? 1/K(I) varied sigmoidally with the free calcium, increasing from 0.12 at low calcium (pCa &gt;7) to 12 at high calcium (pCa &lt;5.5) with a Hill coefficient of ~2.15. The similarity of the curves for excess-actin and excess-myosin data confirms their allosteric relationship. The spatially explicit calculations confirmed variable sizes for the cooperative units and clustering of bound myosins at low calcium concentrations. Moreover, inclusion of negative cooperativity between myosin units predicted the observed slowing of myosin binding at excess-myosin concentrations. 	Eur._Biophys._J.	D016428 D052061 D013485
26925509	20160302	Novel PSEN1 mutations (H214N and R220P) associated with familial Alzheimer's disease identified by targeted exome sequencing.	Autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by mutations in amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 genes and is mostly associated with early-onset form of AD (EOAD), whereas very few mutations were also found in late-onset AD (LOAD) cases. Because of the clinical overlapping between AD and other degenerative dementias such as frontotemporal dementias, a wide-spectrum genetic analysis should be envisaged in the differential diagnosis of this group of disorders. We used next-generation sequencing techniques to analyze 10 genes involved in dementia on a cohort of 20 EOAD and 20 LOAD cases. We found 5 rare coding variants (frequency &lt;1%). PSEN1 H214N mutation, identified in a case of familial EOAD and PSEN1 R220P, found in a case of familial LOAD, are predicted to be pathogenic. These findings confirm the contribution of PSEN1 genetic variants also to LOAD, underlining the need of extending the genetic screening of presenilin mutations to LOAD patients. Two variants in microtubule-associated protein tau and 1 in progranulin appeared to be benign polymorphisms, showing no major contribution of these genes to AD. 	Neurobiol._Aging	D016428 D013485
12932169	20030823	Leucine 7 to proline 7 polymorphism of the preproneuropeptide Y gene is not associated with restenosis after coronary stenting.	To identify if an association exists between the leucine 7 (Leu7) to proline 7 (Pro7) polymorphism located in the signal peptide of the preproneuropeptide Y (preproNPY) gene and restenosis after coronary stenting. The Pro7 allele of the preproNPY gene affects the plasma levels of human neuropeptide Y, a potent mitogen of vascular smooth muscle cells. A population of 1850 consecutive patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease undergoing coronary stent implantation was enrolled in a study that featured angiography at 6 months and genotype determination. The primary endpoint was angiographically documented restenosis (&gt; or =50% diameter stenosis) at 6 months. The secondary endpoint was the clinical outcome at 1 year (death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization). Genotyping was based on the polymerase chain reaction with fluorescent allele-specific oligonucleotide probes (TaqMan method). The carrier frequency of the rare Pro7 allele was 6.2%. Baseline, lesion-related, angiographic, and procedural parameters were similar in the patients with the Leu7/Leu7 genotype and carriers of the Pro7 allele (i.e., subjects with genotype Leu7/Pro7 or Pro7/Pro7). Restenosis rates at 6 months did not differ significantly between the groups (33% versus 30%, p=0.54). In addition, no relationship of the polymorphism with the clinical outcomes at 1 year was observed. Our results suggest that the Leu7 to Pro7 polymorphism of the preproNPY gene is not associated with angiographic restenosis or adverse clinical events after stent placement in coronary arteries.

23457521	20130305	Divergent profile of emerging cutaneous leishmaniasis in subtropical Brazil: new endemic areas in the southern frontier.	Although known to be highly endemic in the Amazon regions of Brazil, the presence of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in the subtropical southern part of the country has largely been ignored. This study was conducted to demonstrate CL is emerging in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina, as well as to characterize the epidemiological profile and Leishmania species involved. For this cross-sectional study, data from all CL cases from Santa Catarina, Brazil, reported to the Brazilian National Notifiable Diseases Information System from 2001 to 2009 were investigated. Amplification of the kDNA minicircle conserved region followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was conducted to screen for Leishmania species present in patient biopsy. Overall, 542 CL cases were reported, with majority resulting from autochthonous transmission (n?=?401, 73.99%) and occurring in urban zones (n?=?422, 77.86%). Age, gender, zone of residence, origin of case, clinical form and case outcome were found to differ significantly by region. Imported cases were over seven times more likely to relapse (95% CI 2.56-21.09). Mapping of cases revealed new endemic areas in northeastern Santa Catarina with two species present. With the exception of three L. (Leishmania) amazonensis cases (1.20%), majority of PCR positive samples were found to be L. (Viannia) braziliensis (n?=?248, 98.80%). CL is now endemic in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil, with case profiles varying significantly by region. L. (V.) braziliensis has been identified as the predominant species in the region.

25466440	20141204	Myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum disorder due to POLG mutations: A clinicopathological report.	We report on the clinical, neuropathological, and genetic findings of a Japanese case with myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum (MCHS) disorder due to polymerase gamma (POLG) mutations. A girl manifested poor sucking and failure to thrive since 4 months of age and had frequent vomiting and developmental regression at 5 months of age. She showed significant hypotonia and hepatomegaly. Laboratory tests showed hepatocellular dysfunction and elevated protein and lactate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Her liver function and neurologic condition exacerbated, and she died at 8 months of age. At autopsy, fatty degeneration and fibrosis were observed in the liver. Neuropathological examination revealed white matter-predominant spongy changes with Alzheimer type II glia and loss of myelin. Enzyme activities of the respiratory chain complex I, III, and IV relative to citrate synthase in the muscle were normal in the biopsied muscle tissue, but they were reduced in the liver to 0%, 10%, and 14% of normal values, respectively. In the liver, the copy number of mitochondrial DNA compared to nuclear DNA was reduced to 3.3% of normal values as evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Genetic analysis revealed compound heterozygous mutations for POLG (I1185T/A957V). This case represents the differential involvement of multiple organs and phenotype-specific distribution of brain lesions in mitochondrial DNA depletion disorders. 	Brain_Dev.

17439973	20070419	Sequence analysis of p53 response-elements suggests multiple binding modes of the p53 tetramer to DNA targets.	The p53 tetramer recognizes specifically a 20-bp DNA element. Here, we examined symmetries encoded in p53 response elements (p53REs). We analyzed base inversion correlations within the half-site, as well as in the full-site palindrome. We found that p53REs are not only direct repeats of half-sites; rather, two p53 half-sites couple to form a higher order 20 bp palindrome. The palindrome couplings between the half-sites are stronger for the human than for the mouse genome. The full-site palindrome and half-site palindrome are controlled by insertions between the two half-sites. The most notable feature is that the full-site palindrome with coupling between quarter-sites one and four (H14 coupling) dominates the p53REs without insertions. The most frequently observed insertion in human p53REs of 3 bp enhances the half-site palindrome. The statistical frequencies of the coupling between the half-sites in the human genome correlate with grouped experimental p53 affinities with p53REs. Examination of known p53REs indicates the H14 couplings are stronger for positive regulation than for negatively regulated p53REs, with repressors having the lowest H14 couplings. We propose that the palindromic sequence couplings may encode such potential preferred multiple binding modes of the p53 tetramer to DNA. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D052061 D052060 D013486
20678234	20100804	The exenatide analogue AC3174 attenuates hypertension, insulin resistance, and renal dysfunction in Dahl salt-sensitive rats.	Activation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors improves insulin sensitivity and induces vasodilatation and diuresis. AC3174 is a peptide analogue with pharmacologic properties similar to the GLP-1 receptor agonist, exenatide. Hypothetically, chronic AC3174 treatment could attenuate salt-induced hypertension, cardiac morbidity, insulin resistance, and renal dysfunction in Dahl salt-sensitive (DSS) rats. DSS rats were fed low salt (LS, 0.3% NaCl) or high salt (HS, 8% NaCl) diets. HS rats were treated with vehicle, AC3174 (1.7 pmol/kg/min), or GLP-1 (25 pmol/kg/min) for 4 weeks via subcutaneous infusion. Other HS rats received captopril (150 mg/kg/day) or AC3174 plus captopril. HS rat survival was improved by all treatments except GLP-1. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was lower in LS rats and in GLP-1, AC3174, captopril, or AC3174 plus captopril HS rats than in vehicle HS rats (p &lt; 0.05). AC3174 plus captopril attenuated the deleterious effects of high salt on posterior wall thickness, LV mass, and the ratio of LV mass to body weight (P &lt; or = 0.05). In contrast, GLP-1 had no effect on these cardiovascular parameters. All treatments reduced LV wall stress. GLP-1, AC3174, captopril, or AC3174 plus captopril normalized fasting insulin and HOMA-IR (P &lt; or = 0.05). AC3174, captopril, or AC3174 plus captopril improved renal function (P &lt; or = 0.05). Renal morphology in HS rats was associated with extensive sclerosis. Monotherapy with AC3174, captopril, or GLP-1 attenuated renal damage. However, AC3174 plus captopril produced the most effective improvement. Thus, AC3174 had antihypertensive, cardioprotective, insulin-sensitizing, and renoprotective effects in the DSS hypertensive rat model. Furthermore, AC3174 improved animal survival, an effect not observed with GLP-1. 	Cardiovasc_Diabetol	D016428 D013485
18528812	20080606	Multiple relapses of hyperthyroidism after thyroid surgeries in a patient with long term follow-up of sporadic non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism.	Constitutively activating thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) germline mutations have been identified as a molecular cause of congenital hyperthyroidism. Patients with relapsing hyperthyroidism were previously treated with surgery and radioiodine. We report on a 22-year-old male patient who was treated for his multiple relapses of hyperthyroidism by repeated subtotal thyroidectomies (STE). During the 22 years of follow-up, the patient developed several relapses of hyperthyroidism, four of them after thyroid surgeries. Sequencing of the TSHR gene revealed a gain-of-function mutation with an amino acid exchange of aspartate to tyrosine in codon 633 which is located in the sixth transmembrane domain of the TSH receptor. The absence of the mutation in all other family members identifies the patient's TSHR mutation as a sporadic germline mutation. In this patient, thyroid tissue growth and hyperthyroidism could repeatedly be controlled only for limited periods by near total thyroidectomy. Therefore, this case confirms that early combined treatment with near-total thyroidectomy plus radioiodine therapy seems to be the treatment of choice for patients with sporadic non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism.

28097100	20170119	Hepatitis C Virus: A Review of Treatment Guidelines, Cost-effectiveness, and Access to Therapy.	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a significant medical concern in the United States and around the world. It is still one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease, and, for more than 20 years, there has been little progress in the treatment of HCV infection. The advent of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) initiated the era of high efficacy and well-tolerated medications with high cure rates. The efficacy of these medications has prompted many professional societies around the world to update their treatment guidelines to include DAAs as first-line treatment. Guidelines by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease/Infectious Disease Society of America, World Health Organization, Asian-Pacific Association for the Study of Liver and the European Association for the Study of Liver have all incorporated DAAs into their treatment guidelines. Despite the promising data supporting these medications, however, their cost represents a limiting factor to their use, even though studies have shown DAAs to be cost-effective. In addition to the expense of these medications and limited resources, there are many barriers preventing patients from receiving this potentially life-saving treatment. In order to overcome these barriers, these issues need to be recognized and addressed. 	J_Clin_Transl_Hepatol	D016454 D016428
26227853	20150801	CALR mutations screening in wild type JAK2(V617F) and MPL(W515K/L) Brazilian myeloproliferative neoplasm patients.	Some myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients harbor JAK2(V617F) mutation, and CALR mutations were recently discovered in wild type (WT) JAK2(V617F). We evaluated the frequency and type of CALR mutations, and clinical and hematological characteristics in WT JAK2(V617F) and MPL(W515K/L) MPN patients. Sixty-five patients were included: 21 with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), 21 with myelofibrosis post-essential thrombocythemia (MPET) and 23 with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Screening for JAK2(V617F) and MPL(W515K/L) were performed using real-time PCR, while CALR mutations were analyzed by fragment analysis and Sanger sequencing. JAK2(V617F) was the most frequent mutation (54.5%) and one patient (1.5%) harbored MPL(W515L). CALR mutations were present in 38.1% of PMF, 12.5% of ET and 33.3% of MPET patients. Five types of CALR mutations were detected, among which type 1 (32.1%) and type 2 (21.4%) were found to be the most common. A novel CALR mutation in a PMF patient was found. Patients carrying CALR mutations had higher platelet count and less presence of splenomegaly than JAK2(V617F), while triple negatives had higher C-reactive protein levels than CALR mutant carriers. Screening for CALR mutations and its correlation with clinical features could be useful for the characterization of MPN patients and result in its incorporation into a new prognostic score.

17848960	20070913	Correction of murine hemophilia A and immunological differences of factor VIII variants delivered by helper-dependent adenoviral vectors.	Bioengineering of the factor VIII (FVIII) molecule has led to the production of variants that overcome poor secretion and/or rapid inactivation. We tested six modified FVIII variants for in vivo efficacy by expressing them from helper-dependent adenoviral (HD-Ad) vectors. We constructed a wild-type (WT) variant, a B-domain-deleted (BDD) variant, a point mutant for improved secretion (F309S), a variant with a partial B-domain deletion for improved secretion (N6), a combination of the point mutant and partial BDD variant (F309N6), and an inactivation-resistant (IR8) FVIII variant. All the constructs expressed functional protein after injection of high-dose HD-Ad. Activity ranged from 20 to 50% with WT, to approximately 100% with the N6 and F309N6 variants. Interestingly, mice treated with N6 showed long-term FVIII activity and phenotypic correction for up to 74 weeks, with low anti-FVIII antibody titer. Importantly, the N6 variant was therapeutically efficacious even after a 50% reduction of viral dose, thereby indicating that transgene modification itself can improve the dose efficacy of HD-Ad. This finding is significant, because dose efficacy is a key factor in clinical application. In summary, bioengineering of the FVIII molecule may be an effective approach to improving the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of HD-Ad gene therapy in hemophilia A (HA). 	Mol._Ther.

23593318	20130418	Enhanced virus resistance in transgenic maize expressing a dsRNA-specific endoribonuclease gene from E. coli.	Maize rough dwarf disease (MRDD), caused by several Fijiviruses in the family Reoviridae, is a global disease that is responsible for substantial yield losses in maize. Although some maize germplasm have low levels of polygenic resistance to MRDD, highly resistant cultivated varieties are not available for agronomic field production in China. In this work, we have generated transgenic maize lines that constitutively express rnc70, a mutant E. coli dsRNA-specific endoribonuclease gene. Transgenic lines were propagated and screened under field conditions for 12 generations. During three years of evaluations, two transgenic lines and their progeny were challenged with Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV), the causal agent of MRDD in China, and these plants exhibited reduced levels of disease severity. In two normal years of MRDD abundance, both lines were more resistant than non-transgenic plants. Even in the most serious MRDD year, six out of seven progeny from one line were resistant, whereas non-transgenic plants were highly susceptible. Molecular approaches in the T12 generation revealed that the rnc70 transgene was integrated and expressed stably in transgenic lines. Under artificial conditions permitting heavy virus inoculation, the T12 progeny of two highly resistant lines had a reduced incidence of MRDD and accumulation of RBSDV in infected plants. In addition, we confirmed that the RNC70 protein could bind directly to RBSDV dsRNA in vitro. Overall, our data show that RNC70-mediated resistance in transgenic maize can provide efficient protection against dsRNA virus infection. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485

In Chinese local cattle, B allele was dominant, and this locus was at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium except for the Charolais x Luxi cattle and Angus x Luxi cattle. The association of these polymorphisms with cattle carcass traits was analyzed using the general linear model (GLM). Statistical analysis revealed a higher value of living weight, carcass weight and loin eye area for individuals with genotype AA than AB (P &lt; 0.05). Further studies on a bigger population size are needed to confirm the observed effect of MyoD genotypes on carcass quality traits. 	Yi_Chuan	D004740 D016428 D013485
22509354	20120418	Expression and subcellular localization of mammalian formin Fhod3 in the embryonic and adult heart.	The formin family proteins play pivotal roles in actin filament assembly via the FH2 domain. The mammalian formin Fhod3 is highly expressed in the heart, and its mRNA in the adult heart contains exons 11, 12, and 25, which are absent from non-muscle Fhod3 isoforms. In cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes, Fhod3 localizes to the middle of the sarcomere and appears to function in its organization, although it is suggested that Fhod3 localizes differently in the adult heart. Here we show, using immunohistochemical analysis with three different antibodies, each recognizing distinct regions of Fhod3, that Fhod3 localizes as two closely spaced bands in middle of the sarcomere in both embryonic and adult hearts. The bands are adjacent to the M-line that crosslinks thick myosin filaments at the center of a sarcomere but distant from the Z-line that forms the boundary of the sarcomere, which localization is the same as that observed in cultured cardiomyocytes. Detailed immunohistochemical and immuno-electron microscopic analyses reveal that Fhod3 localizes not at the pointed ends of thin actin filaments but to a more peripheral zone, where thin filaments overlap with thick myosin filaments. We also demonstrate that the embryonic heart of mice specifically expresses the Fhod3 mRNA isoform harboring the three alternative exons, and that the characteristic localization of Fhod3 in the sarcomere does not require a region encoded by exon 25, in contrast to an essential role of exons 11 and 12. Furthermore, the exon 25-encoded region appears to be dispensable for actin-organizing activities both in vivo and in vitro, albeit it is inserted in the catalytic FH2 domain.

25793266	20150321	Is greater acculturation associated with an increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors among Latinos in South Florida?	To examine the association of acculturation with various cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) among Latinos with diabetes in South Florida. In a cross-sectional analysis of data collected from 300 Latinos with poorly controlled diabetes we measured acculturation using the Marin Short Acculturation Scale. We examined correlations between acculturation and the following 7 CRFs: hemoglobin A1C, low-density lipoprotein, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, smoking status, physical activity, and fruit and vegetable intake. Cubans made up 38% of our population; no other Latino subgroup represented over 17% of the sample. Of the 8 outcomes examined, only smoking was associated with increased acculturation; 12% of Latinos in the 2 lowest acculturation groups were current smokers versus 25% in the highest acculturation group (P=0.02). Furthermore, Cuban Americans from our sample had over double the prevalence of smoking compared with non-Cubans in both the lowest and highest acculturation groups. With the exception of smoking, our data does not support a link between increased acculturation and higher prevalence of CRFs in Latinos with diabetes. Smoking prevention and cessation programs targeting Latinos and particularly among Cubans are needed. 	Med_Care	D016428 D052061
24675707	20140329	Resistin in dairy cows: plasma concentrations during early lactation, expression and potential role in adipose tissue.	Resistin is an adipokine that has been implicated in energy metabolism regulation in rodents but has been little studied in dairy cows. We determined plasma resistin concentrations in early lactation in dairy cows and investigated the levels of resistin mRNA and protein in adipose tissue and the phosphorylation of several components of insulin signaling pathways one week post partum (1 WPP) and at five months of gestation (5 MG). We detected resistin in mature bovine adipocytes and investigated the effect of recombinant bovine resistin on lipolysis in bovine adipose tissue explants. ELISA showed that plasma resistin concentration was low before calving, subsequently increasing and reaching a peak at 1 WPP, decreasing steadily thereafter to reach pre-calving levels at 6 WPP. Plasma resistin concentration was significantly positively correlated with plasma non esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels and negatively with milk yield, dry matter intake and energy balance between WPP1 to WPP22. We showed, by quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting, that resistin mRNA and protein levels in adipose tissue were higher at WPP1 than at 5 MG. The level of phosphorylation of several early and downstream insulin signaling components (IR?, IRS-1, IRS-2, Akt, MAPK ERK1/2, P70S6K and S6) in adipose tissue was also lower at 1 WPP than at 5 MG. Finally, we showed that recombinant bovine resistin increased the release of glycerol and mRNA levels for ATGL (adipose triglyceride lipase) and HSL (hormone-sensitive lipase) in adipose tissue explants. Overall, resistin levels were high in the plasma and adipose tissue and were positively correlated with NEFA levels after calving. Resistin is expressed in bovine mature adipocytes and promotes lipid mobilization in adipose explants in vitro. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
22447671	20120327	An AT-rich region in the APC gene may cause misinterpretation of familial adenomatous polyposis molecular screening.	Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal-dominant condition mainly due to a mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. The present study reports evidence of a technical issue occurring during the mutational analysis of APC exon 4. Genetic conventional direct sequence analysis of a repetitive AT-rich region in the splice acceptor site of APC intron 3 could be misinterpreted as a pathogenetic frameshift result. However, this potential bias may be bypassed adopting a method for random mutagenesis of DNA based on the use of a triphosphate nucleoside analogues mixture. Using this method as a second-level analysis, we also demonstrated the nonpathogenic nature of the variant in the poly A trait in APC exon 4 region (c.423-4delA) that do not result in aberrant splicing of APC exons 3-4; conversely, we did not find a previously reported T deletion/insertion polymorphism.

26448739	20151009	Deep Neural Networks with Multistate Activation Functions.	We propose multistate activation functions (MSAFs) for deep neural networks (DNNs). These MSAFs are new kinds of activation functions which are capable of representing more than two states, including the N-order MSAFs and the symmetrical MSAF. DNNs with these MSAFs can be trained via conventional Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as well as mean-normalised SGD. We also discuss how these MSAFs perform when used to resolve classification problems. Experimental results on the TIMIT corpus reveal that, on speech recognition tasks, DNNs with MSAFs perform better than the conventional DNNs, getting a relative improvement of 5.60% on phoneme error rates. Further experiments also reveal that mean-normalised SGD facilitates the training processes of DNNs with MSAFs, especially when being with large training sets. The models can also be directly trained without pretraining when the training set is sufficiently large, which results in a considerable relative improvement of 5.82% on word error rates.

25849980	20150408	LPA signaling initiates schizophrenia-like brain and behavioral changes in a mouse model of prenatal brain hemorrhage.	Genetic, environmental and neurodevelopmental factors are thought to underlie the onset of neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. How these risk factors collectively contribute to pathology is unclear. Here, we present a mouse model of prenatal intracerebral hemorrhage--an identified risk factor for schizophrenia--using a serum-exposure paradigm. This model exhibits behavioral, neurochemical and schizophrenia-related gene expression alterations in adult females. Behavioral alterations in amphetamine-induced locomotion, prepulse inhibition, thigmotaxis and social interaction--in addition to increases in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area and decreases in parvalbumin-positive cells in the prefrontal cortex--were induced upon prenatal serum exposure. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a lipid component of serum, was identified as a key molecular initiator of schizophrenia-like sequelae induced by serum. Prenatal exposure to LPA alone phenocopied many of the schizophrenia-like alterations seen in the serum model, whereas pretreatment with an antagonist against the LPA receptor subtype LPA1 prevented many of the behavioral and neurochemical alterations. In addition, both prenatal serum and LPA exposure altered the expression of many genes and pathways related to schizophrenia, including the expression of Grin2b, Slc17a7 and Grid1. These findings demonstrate that aberrant LPA receptor signaling associated with fetal brain hemorrhage may contribute to the development of some neuropsychiatric disorders.

22530801	20120426	The joint association of REST and NFKB1 polymorphisms on the risk of colorectal cancer.	Due to the high morbidity and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC), this study aims to determine the joint association of RE-1-silencing transcription factor (REST) and nuclear factor-?B 1 (NFKB1) genes with CRC in a population-based study. A well-matched case-control study including 390 controls and 388 patients with CRC was enrolled in China. The selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the REST and NFKB1 genes were genotyped by Illumina SnapShot Chip. After adjustment for important covariates, the associations of SNPs and joint association of REST and NFKB1 with CRC were evaluated by multiple logistic regression models. The subjects with the rs2228991 AA genotype of the REST gene had a decreased risk for CRC (OR = 0.38; 95%CI: 0.19-0.74), compared with the GG genotype. There were no significant associations between three SNPs in the NFKB1 gene, their haplotype and CRC risk. However, a significant combined effect of rs3774959 and rs3774964 in the NFKB1 gene with rs2228991 in the REST gene on CRC risk was observed. In conclusion, the present study found that mutation in the REST gene rather than the NFKB1 gene was associated with the risk of CRC. Furthermore, significant REST-NFKB1 joint association was observed for CRC, colon cancer and rectal cancer risk. 	Ann._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
15198127	20040617	Proteasomal expression, induction of immunoproteasome subunits, and local MHC class I presentation in myofibrillar myopathy and inclusion body myositis.	Inclusion body myositis (IBM) and myofibrillar myopathy (MM) are diseases characterized by the abnormal accumulation of proteins in muscle fibers, including desmin, alphaB-crystallin, gelsolin, actin, kinases, and phospho-tau, along with ubiquitin in muscle fibers, suggesting abnormal protein degradation as a possible cause of the surplus myopathy. Since the ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a crucial role in non-lysosomal protein degradation, the present study has examined by immunohistochemistry the expression of components of the catalytic core of 20S proteasomes and its regulators: 19S and PA28alpha/beta, and the expression of immunoproteasome subunits LMP2, LMP7, and MECL1 in 8 patients with MM and 10 patients with IBM. The patients with MM were from 6 unrelated families, 2 sporadic cases, I with autosomal recessive and 5 with autosomal dominant inheritance. One sporadic patient had a de novo R406W mutation in the desmin gene, and 1 patient with autosomal dominant MM had a single amino acid deletion at position 366 in the desmin gene. Increased immunoreactivity to 20S, 19S, and PA28alpha/beta colocalizing abnormal protein deposits, as revealed in consecutive serial sections, was seen in all cases with MM and IBM. In all cases, the subunits of the immunoproteasome LMP2, LMP7, and MECL1 colocalized with proteasomal immunoreactivity and abnormal protein accumulation. Immunohistochemistry revealed focal MHC class I immunoreactivity in the cytoplasmic membrane of muscle fibers in IBM and in association with protein aggregates in IBM, and to a lesser degree, in MM. The present findings provide a link between abnormal protein accumulation and altered proteasomal expression in IBM and MM. 	J._Neuropathol._Exp._Neurol.	D016428 D013485
22369568	20120229	Transcriptomic profiles of peripheral white blood cells in type II diabetes and racial differences in expression profiles.	Along with obesity, physical inactivity, and family history of metabolic disorders, African American ethnicity is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the United States. However, little is known about the differences in gene expression and transcriptomic profiles of blood in T2D between African Americans (AA) and Caucasians (CAU), and microarray analysis of peripheral white blood cells (WBCs) from these two ethnic groups will facilitate our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanism in T2D and identify genetic biomarkers responsible for the disparities. A whole human genome oligomicroarray of peripheral WBCs was performed on 144 samples obtained from 84 patients with T2D (44 AA and 40 CAU) and 60 healthy controls (28 AA and 32 CAU). The results showed that 30 genes had significant difference in expression between patients and controls (a fold change of &lt;-1.4 or &gt;1.4 with a P value &lt;0.05). These known genes were mainly clustered in three functional categories: immune responses, lipid metabolism, and organismal injury/abnormaly. Transcriptomic analysis also showed that 574 genes were differentially expressed in AA diseased versus AA control, compared to 200 genes in CAU subjects. Pathway study revealed that &quot;Communication between innate and adaptive immune cells&quot;/&quot;Primary immunodeficiency signaling&quot; are significantly down-regulated in AA patients and &quot;Interferon signaling&quot;/&quot;Complement System&quot; are significantly down-regulated in CAU patients. These newly identified genetic markers in WBCs provide valuable information about the pathophysiology of T2D and can be used for diagnosis and pharmaceutical drug design. Our results also found that AA and CAU patients with T2D express genes and pathways differently. 	BMC_Genomics	D016428 D052061

27905516	20161202	Discovery and structural characterisation of new fold type IV-transaminases exemplify the diversity of this enzyme fold.	Transaminases are useful biocatalysts for the production of amino acids and chiral amines as intermediates for a broad range of drugs and fine chemicals. Here, we describe the discovery and characterisation of new transaminases from microorganisms which were enriched in selective media containing (R)-amines as sole nitrogen source. While most of the candidate proteins were clearly assigned to known subgroups of the fold IV family of PLP-dependent enzymes by sequence analysis and characterisation of their substrate specificity, some of them did not fit to any of these groups. The structure of one of these enzymes from Curtobacterium pusillum, which can convert d-amino acids and various (R)-amines with high enantioselectivity, was solved at a resolution of 2.4??. It shows significant differences especially in the active site compared to other transaminases of the fold IV family and thus indicates the existence of a new subgroup within this family. Although the discovered transaminases were not able to convert ketones in a reasonable time frame, overall, the enrichment-based approach was successful, as we identified two amine transaminases, which convert (R)-amines with high enantioselectivity, and can be used for a kinetic resolution of 1-phenylethylamine and analogues to obtain the (S)-amines with e.e.s &gt;99%.

18424137	20080422	Early and presymptomatic detection of Wilson's disease at the mandatory 3-year-old medical health care examination in Hokkaido Prefecture with the use of a novel automated urinary ceruloplasmin assay.	Wilson's disease (WND) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper (Cu) accumulation leading to liver and/or brain damage. Oral chelating agents and diet are effective in treating WND. However, once irreversible damage has occurred, the effect of treatment is diminished and the patient's quality of life is compromised. For these reasons an effective method for screening has been needed for early detection of presymptomatic patients. We conducted an early and presymptomatic detection of WND using a novel automated assay of ceruloplasmin (Cp) concentration in urine and selected the mandatory medical health care examination for 3-year-old children in Hokkaido Prefecture (the largest administrative division in Japan) as a sampling point. We measured urinary Cp concentrations in 11,362 children using an immunological latex agglutination assay kit developed by us. Among these children we identified a positive case with markedly reduced urinary Cp concentration. Detailed medical examination provided no clinical manifestations to support the diagnosis of WND, although serum Cp and Cu levels were remarkably low in this case. Therefore, we analyzed the WND gene in order to confirm the diagnosis. Sequence analysis revealed that the case was compound heterozygous for the WND gene mutations 2871del.C and D1296N. According to the Ferenci scoring system for WND diagnosis, the case was established as a WND patient at the presymptomatic stage. Consequently, the patient has maintained a good quality of life under medical treatment with polaprezinc administration to date. Our investigation suggests that the screening system for WND using the automated urinary assay at the mandatory medical health care examination for 3-year-old children is a noninvasive and efficient method for the early and presymptomatic diagnosis of WND.

26763878	20160115	De novo missense mutations in NALCN cause developmental and intellectual impairment with hypotonia.	Three recessive mutations in the sodium leak channel, nonselective (NALCN) have been reported to cause intellectual disability and hypotonia. In addition, 14 de novo heterozygous mutations have been identified in 15 patients with arthrogryposis and neurodevelopmental impairment. Here, we report three patients with neurodevelopmental disease and hypotonia, harboring one recurrent (p.R1181Q) and two novel mutations (p.L312V and p.V1020F) occurring de novo in NALCN. Mutation p.L312 is located in the pore forming S6 region of domain I and p.V1020F in the S5 region of domain III. Mutation p.R1181Q is in a linker region. Mapping these three mutations to a model of NALCN showed p.Leu312 and p.Val1020 positioned in the hydrophobic core of the pore modules, indicating these two mutations may affect the gating function of NALCN. Although p.R1181Q is unlikely to affect the ion channel structure, previous studies have shown that an analogous mutation in Caenorhabditis elegans produced a phenotype with a coiling locomotion, suggesting that p.R1181Q could also affect NALCN function. Our three patients showed profound intellectual disability and growth delay, facial dysmorphologies and hypotonia. The present data support previous work suggesting heterozygous NALCN mutations lead to syndromic neurodevelopmental impairment. 	J._Hum._Genet.	D016428
27446039	20160723	Cultivation of Staphylococcus epidermidis in the Human Spaceflight Environment Leads to Alterations in the Frequency and Spectrum of Spontaneous Rifampicin-Resistance Mutations in the rpoB Gene.	Bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus are persistent inhabitants of human spaceflight habitats and represent potential opportunistic pathogens. The effect of the human spaceflight environment on the growth and the frequency of mutations to antibiotic resistance in the model organism Staphylococcus epidermidis strain ATCC12228 was investigated. Six cultures of the test organism were cultivated in biological research in canisters-Petri dish fixation units for 122 h on orbit in the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the SpaceX-3 resupply mission. Asynchronous ground controls (GCs) consisted of identical sets of cultures cultivated for 122 h in the ISS Environmental Simulator at Kennedy Space Center. S. epidermidis exhibited significantly lower viable counts but significantly higher frequencies of mutation to rifampicin (Rif) resistance in space vs. GC cultures. The spectrum of mutations in the rpoB gene leading to Rif(R) was altered in S. epidermidis isolates cultivated in the ISS compared to GCs. The results suggest that the human spaceflight environment induces unique physiologic stresses on growing bacterial cells leading to changes in mutagenic potential. 	Front_Microbiol	D016428
18987190	20081107	Nur7 is a nonsense mutation in the mouse aspartoacylase gene that causes spongy degeneration of the CNS.	Aspartoacylase (ASPA) is an oligodendrocyte-restricted enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of neuronally derived N-acetylaspartate (NAA) to acetate and aspartic acid. ASPA deficiency leads to the fatal childhood autosomal recessive leukodystrophy Canavan disease (CD). Here we demonstrate that the previously described ENU-induced nur7 mouse mutant is caused by a nonsense mutation, Q193X, in the Aspa gene (Aspa(nur7)). Homozygous Aspa(nur7nur7) mice do not express detectable Aspa protein and display an early-onset spongy degeneration of CNS myelin with increased NAA levels similar to that observed in CD patients. In addition, CNS regions rich in neuronal cell bodies also display vacuolization. Interestingly, distinct myelin rich areas, such as the corpus callosum, optic nerve, and spinal cord white matter appear normal in Aspa(nur7/nur7) mice. Reduced cerebroside synthesis has been demonstrated in CD patients and animal models. To determine the potential relevance of this observation in disease pathogenesis, we generated Aspa(nur7/nur7) mice that were heterozygous for a null allele of the gene that encodes the enzyme UDP-galactose:ceramide galactosyltransferase (Cgt), which is responsible for catalyzing the synthesis of the abundant myelin galactolipids. Despite reduced amounts of cerebrosides, the Aspa(nur7/nur7);Cgt(+/-) mice were not more severely affected than the Aspa(nur7) mutants, suggesting that diminished cerebroside synthesis is not a major contributing factor in disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, we found that myelin degeneration leads to significant axonal loss in the cerebellum of older Aspa(nur7) mutants. This finding suggests that axonal pathology caused by CNS myelin defects may underlie the neurological disabilities that CD patients develop at late stages of the disease. 	J._Neurosci.

26330336	20150903	Toward Personalized Medicine: Using Cardiomyocytes Differentiated From Urine-Derived Pluripotent Stem Cells to Recapitulate Electrophysiological Characteristics of Type 2 Long QT Syndrome.	Human genetically inherited cardiac diseases have been studied mainly in heterologous systems or animal models, independent of patients' genetic backgrounds. Because sources of human cardiomyocytes (CMs) are extremely limited, the use of urine samples to generate induced pluripotent stem cell-derived CMs would be a noninvasive method to identify cardiac dysfunctions that lead to pathologies within patients' specific genetic backgrounds. The objective was to validate the use of CMs differentiated from urine-derived human induced pluripotent stem (UhiPS) cells as a new cellular model for studying patients' specific arrhythmia mechanisms. Cells obtained from urine samples of a patient with long QT syndrome who harbored the HERG A561P gene mutation and his asymptomatic noncarrier mother were reprogrammed using the episomal-based method. UhiPS cells were then differentiated into CMs using the matrix sandwich method.UhiPS-CMs showed proper expression of atrial and ventricular myofilament proteins and ion channels. They were electrically functional, with nodal-, atrial- and ventricular-like action potentials recorded using high-throughput optical and patch-clamp techniques. Comparison of HERG expression from the patient's UhiPS-CMs to the mother's UhiPS-CMs showed that the mutation led to a trafficking defect that resulted in reduced delayed rectifier K(+) current (IKr). This phenotype gave rise to action potential prolongation and arrhythmias. UhiPS cells from patients carrying ion channel mutations can be used as novel tools to differentiate functional CMs that recapitulate cardiac arrhythmia phenotypes.

16764926	20060613	Rare mutations of the PIK3CA gene in malignancies of the hematopoietic system as well as endometrium, ovary, prostate and osteosarcomas, and discovery of a PIK3CA pseudogene.	Lipid kinase PIK3CA mutations have been described in several cancers. They clustered in two 'hot spots' located in helical (exon 9) and kinase (exon 20) domains associated with increased kinase activity strongly suggesting oncogenic potential. Mutational analysis of previously unexamined tumors showed an amino acid change from threonine to alanine (T1025A) in exon 20 in one of 28 endometrial cancer samples and 6 endometrial cell lines. Additionally, a silent polymorphism (T1025T) was found in two of 20 MDS samples, one of 43 NHL samples, two of 40 osteosarcoma samples and Ishikawa. The polymorphism was established by identifying two of 92 normal samples with the same change. No PIK3CA mutations were found in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) as well as in osteosarcomas, prostate and ovarian cancer samples. Additionally, a previously unidentified PIK3CA pseudogene spanning exons 9-13 on chromosome 22 was discovered. 	Leuk._Res.	D016428 D052061 D013485
19812739	20091009	Chaperone therapy for neuronopathic lysosomal diseases: competitive inhibitors as chemical chaperones for enhancement of mutant enzyme activities.	Chaperone therapy is a newly developed molecular approach to lysosomal diseases, a group of human genetic diseases causing severe brain damage. We found two valienamine derivatives, N-octyl-4-epi-beta-valienamine (NOEV) and N-octyl-beta-valienamine (NOV), as promising therapeutic agents for human beta-galactosidase deficiency disorders (mainly G(M1)-gangliosidosis) and beta-glucosidase deficiency disorders (Gaucher disease), respectively. We briefly reviewed the historical background of research in carbasugar glycosidase inhibitors. Originally NOEV and NOV had been discovered as competitive inhibitors, and then their paradoxical bioactivities as chaperones were confirmed in cultured fibroblasts from patients with these disorders. Subsequently G(M1)-gangliosidosis model mice were developed and useful for experimental studies. Orally administered NOEV entered the brain through the blood-brain barrier, enhanced beta-galactosidase activity, reduced substrate storage, and improved neurological deterioration clinically. Furthermore, we executed computational analysis for prediction of molecular interactions between beta-galactosidase and NOEV. Some preliminary results of computational analysis of molecular interaction mechanism are presented in this article. NOV also showed the chaperone effect toward several beta-glucosidase gene mutations in Gaucher disease. We hope chaperone therapy will become available for some patients with G(M1)-gangliosidosis, Gaucher disease, and potentially other lysosomal storage diseases with central nervous system involvement.

9137809	19970101	Recombinant expression and catalytic analysis of rapid and slow acetylator Syrian hamster chimeric NAT2 alleles.	Polymorphic aromatic amine N-acetyltransferase (NAT2) catalyzes the N-acetylation of aromatic amines and the metabolic activation of N-hydroxyarylamines (via O-acetylation) and N-hydroxy-N-acetylarylamines (via N,O-acetylation) to electrophilic intermediates that mutate DNA. Acetylation capacity in humans and other mammalian species such as Syrian hamsters is subject to a genetic polymorphism. NAT2 is regulated by a single gene (NAT2) containing a single coding exon of 870 bp. Syrian hamster slow acetylator differs from the rapid acetylator NAT2 coding region by three nucleotide substitutions at T36C, A633G, and C727T. We measured expression of immunoreactive NAT2 protein and aromatic amine N-acetylation. N-hydroxyarylamine O-acetylation and N-hydroxy-N-acetylarylamine N,O-acetylation by recombinant NAT2 proteins expressed from alleles containing all combinations of the T36C, A633G, and C727T substitutions. The C727T substitution, which creates an opal stop codon in slow acetylator NAT2, was the sole mutation responsible for substantial reduction in expression of a truncated NAT2 protein with reduced capacity for the deactivation of aromatic amines (N-acetylation) and the metabolic activation of N-hydroxyarylamines (O-acetylation) and N-hydroxy-N-acetylarylamines (N,O-acetylation). The reductions in aromatic amine N-acetylation correlated very highly with the reductions in metabolic activation of the corresponding N-hydroxyarylamines and N-hydroxy-N-acetylarylamines.

22354706	20120223	The TRPV5/6 calcium channels contain multiple calmodulin binding sites with differential binding properties.	The epithelial Ca(2+) channels TRPV5/6 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 5/6) are thoroughly regulated in order to fine-tune the amount of Ca(2+) reabsorption. Calmodulin has been shown to be involved into calcium-dependent inactivation of TRPV5/6 channels by binding directly to the distal C-terminal fragment of the channels (de Groot et al. in Mol Cell Biol 31:2845-2853, 12). Here, we investigate this binding in detail and find significant differences between TRPV5 and TRPV6. We also identify and characterize in vitro four other CaM binding fragments of TRPV5/6, which likely are also involved in TRPV5/6 channel regulation. The five CaM binding sites display diversity in binding modes, binding stoichiometries and binding affinities, which may fine-tune the response of the channels to varying Ca(2+)-concentrations.

15579467	20041208	Reversible oxidation of ERK-directed protein phosphatases drives oxidative toxicity in neurons.	Oxidative stress links diverse neuropathological conditions that include stroke, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease and has been modeled in vitro with various paradigms that lead to neuronal cell death following the increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species. For example, immortalized neurons and immature primary cortical neurons undergo cell death in response to depletion of the antioxidant glutathione, which can be elicited by administration of glutamate at high concentrations. We have demonstrated previously that this glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity requires activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase member ERK1/2, but the mechanisms by which this activation takes place in oxidatively stressed neurons are still not fully known. In this study, we demonstrate that during oxidative stress, ERK-directed phosphatases of both the serine/threonine- and tyrosine-directed classes are selectively and reversibly inhibited via a mechanism that is dependent upon the oxidation of cysteine thiols. Furthermore, the impact of ERK-directed phosphatases on ERK1/2 activation and oxidative toxicity in neurons was tested in a neuronal cell line and in primary cortical cultures. Overexpression of the highly ERK-specific phosphatase MKP3 and its catalytic mutant, MKP3 C293S, were neuroprotective in transiently transfected HT22 cells and primary neurons. The neuroprotective effect of the MKP3 C293S mutant, which enhances ERK1/2 phosphorylation but blocks its nuclear translocation, demonstrates the necessity for active ERK1/2 nuclear localization for oxidative toxicity in neurons. Together, these data implicate the inhibition of endogenous ERK-directed phosphatases as a mechanism that leads to aberrant ERK1/2 activation and nuclear accumulation during oxidative toxicity in neurons.

16569655	20060330	Polymorphisms in estrogen bioactivation, detoxification and oxidative DNA base excision repair genes and prostate cancer risk.	To date, the potential impact of hormones on prostate cancer has predominantly focused on receptor-mediated events. However, catechol estrogens, if not inactivated by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), can generate large quantities of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS may cause a spectrum of damage including oxidative DNA base lesions, which can lead to irreversible mutation(s) if they are not repaired by base excision repair (BER) systems. hOGG1 is a key enzyme in short patch BER because it recognizes and performs initial excision of the most common form of oxidative DNA base damage, 8-hydroxyguanine (8-oxo-dG). To investigate potential non-receptor-mediated estrogen effects, we evaluated the association between COMT Val158Met and hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphisms and prostate cancer in a family-based case-control study (439 prostate cancer cases, 479 brother controls). We observed no noteworthy associations between these polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk in the total study population. However, among men with more aggressive prostate cancer, the hOGG1 326 Cys/Cys genotype was inversely associated with disease (OR=0.30; 95% CI=0.09-0.98). Combining the lower activity CYP1B1 432 Leu/Leu or Leu/Val genotypes (which may decrease the level of catechol estrogens and ROS generated) with the hOGG1 326 Cys/Cys genotype and the XRCC1 399 Arg/Arg or Arg/Gln genotypes (which may enhance BER) resulted in an even further reduced risk in Caucasians with more aggressive disease (OR=0.09; 95% CI=0.01-0.56). Including the high-activity COMT 158Val allele to this combination also lowered aggressive prostate cancer risk but the effect was not as strong (OR=0.20; 95% CI=0.05-0.88). The decreased risk we observed with the hOGG1 326 Cys/Cys genotype confirms an earlier report and the further reduced risk found with the CYP1B1 (432 Leu/Leu or Leu/Val)-hOGG1 (326 Cys/Cys)-XRCC1 (Arg/Arg or Arg/Gln) genotype combination may lend new insights to the importance of ROS generated from non-receptor-mediated estrogenic mechanisms in more aggressive prostate cancer.

26157637	20150710	Community- and population-level changes in diatom size structure in a subarctic lake over the last two centuries.	Climate change over the last two centuries has been associated with significant shifts in diatom community structure in lakes from the high arctic to temperate latitudes. To test the hypotheses that recent climate warming selects for species of smaller size within communities and a decrease in the average size of species within populations, we quantified the size of individual diatom valves from 10 depths in a sediment core covering the last ?200 years from a pristine subarctic lake. Over the last ?200 years, changes in the relative abundance of species of different average size and changes in the average valve size of populations of species contribute equally to the changes in community size structure, but are often opposite in sign, compensating for one another and moderating temporal changes in community size structure. In the surface sediments that correspond to the recent decades when air temperatures have warmed, the mean size of valves in the diatom community has significantly decreased due to an increase in the proportion of smaller-sized planktonic diatom species.

16888689	20060805	[Autosomal dominant granular corneal dystrophy caused by a TGFBI gene mutation in a Mexican family].	To describe the clinical data and the results of molecular analyses of the TGFBI gene in a patient with classic granular stromal corneal dystrophy (type I). A female patient aged 60-years complaining of a long-standing decrease of visual acuity bilaterally associated with photophobia and foreign body sensation, underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination. Molecular analyses of DNA from the patient and from an affected brother included PCR amplification of exons 4, 11, 12, and 14 of the TGFBI gene and direct automated sequencing of the PCR products. The affected patient showed a pattern of corneal stromal lesions that was compatible with a diagnosis of classic granular dystrophy. No involvement of other corneal layers was evident. Molecular analysis disclosed a point mutation in exon 14 of the TGFBI gene which consisted of an adenine to guanine change at nucleotide position 1924, predicting a substitution of arginine instead of histidine at residue 626 of the TGFBI protein (H626R). An identical mutation was detected in DNA from her affected brother. This is the first time that a case of stromal granular dystrophy has been demonstrated to be caused by the H626R mutation, a molecular defect classically detected in the phenotypically distinct lattice corneal dystrophy. Our data indicate that the same molecular defects in the TGFBI gene lead to different phenotypes in stromal dystrophies, thus expanding the genotypic-phenotypic spectrum in this group of corneal diseases.

26592390	20151124	Critical Test of Some Computational Chemistry Methods for Prediction of Gas-Phase Acidities and Basicities.	Gas-phase acidities and basicities were calculated for 64 neutral bases (covering the scale from 139.9 kcal/mol to 251.9 kcal/mol) and 53 neutral acids (covering the scale from 299.5 kcal/mol to 411.7 kcal/mol). The following methods were used: AM1, PM3, PM6, PDDG, G2, G2MP2, G3, G3MP2, G4, G4MP2, CBS-QB3, B1B95, B2PLYP, B2PLYPD, B3LYP, B3PW91, B97D, B98, BLYP, BMK, BP86, CAM-B3LYP, HSEh1PBE, M06, M062X, M06HF, M06L, mPW2PLYP, mPW2PLYPD, O3LYP, OLYP, PBE1PBE, PBEPBE, tHCTHhyb, TPSSh, VSXC, X3LYP. The addition of the Grimmes empirical dispersion correction (D) to B2PLYP and mPW2PLYP was evaluated, and it was found that adding this correction gave more-accurate results when considering acidities. Calculations with B3LYP, B97D, BLYP, B2PLYPD, and PBE1PBE methods were carried out with five basis sets (6-311G**, 6-311+G**, TZVP, cc-pVTZ, and aug-cc-pVTZ) to evaluate the effect of basis sets on the accuracy of calculations. It was found that the best basis sets when considering accuracy of results and needed time were 6-311+G** and TZVP. Among semiempirical methods AM1 had the best ability to reproduce experimental acidities and basicities (the mean absolute error (mae) was 7.3 kcal/mol). Among DFT methods the best method considering accuracy, robustness, and computation time was PBE1PBE/6-311+G** (mae = 2.7 kcal/mol). Four Gaussian-type methods (G2, G2MP2, G4, and G4MP2) gave similar results to each other (mae = 2.3 kcal/mol). Gaussian-type methods are quite accurate, but their downside is the relatively long computational time. 	J_Chem_Theory_Comput	D016428
23659670	20130511	A polymorphism of interleukin-22 receptor alpha-1 is associated with the development of childhood IgA nephropathy.	Recent studies suggest that dysregulated innate immunity plays an important role in the pathogenesis of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN). The interleukin-20 subfamily and its receptor, interleukin-22 receptor alpha-1 (IL-22R1), were recently identified as immunomodulators in human diseases, acting as mediators of mucosal host defense. However, the potential role of IL-22R1 in the pathogenesis of IgAN has not been explored. In the current study, 194 patients with IgAN and 287 normal controls were genotyped for coding polymorphisms of the IL-22R1 gene and the association between the polymorphisms and IgAN was investigated. Local expression of IL-22R1 was examined in patients with IgAN and healthy controls using immunohistochemistry. Our case-control analysis showed that genotypes of rs3795299 were associated with childhood IgAN. Individuals with the CC genotype of rs3795299 had about 3-fold reduced risk of IgAN compared with those with the GG genotype in the codominant model (P=0.0028) and those with the genotypes containing the G allele (GG or GC) in the recessive model (P=0.002). After Bonferroni correction, the association between the rs3795299 CC genotype and reduced risk of developing IgAN remained significant. Furthermore, the renal expression of IL-22R1 was significantly higher in healthy controls compared with subjects with IgAN. Our data suggest that the CC genotype of rs3795299 polymorphism in the IL-22R1 gene is associated with the reduced risk of IgAN, and this genetic association was supported by the higher renal expression of IL-22R1 in healthy controls compared with patients with IgAN.

26675057	20151218	Predicting the impact of promoter variability on regulatory outputs.	The increased availability of whole genome sequences calls for quantitative models of global gene expression, yet predicting gene expression patterns directly from genome sequence remains a challenge. We examine the contributions of an individual regulator, the ferrous iron-responsive regulatory element, BqsR, on global patterns of gene expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The position weight matrix (PWM) derived for BqsR uncovered hundreds of likely binding sites throughout the genome. Only a subset of these potential binding sites had a regulatory consequence, suggesting that BqsR/DNA interactions were not captured within the PWM or that the broader regulatory context at each promoter played a greater role in setting promoter outputs. The architecture of the BqsR operator was systematically varied to understand how binding site parameters influence expression. We found that BqsR operator affinity was predicted by the PWM well. At many promoters the surrounding regulatory context, including overlapping operators of BqsR or the presence of RhlR binding sites, were influential in setting promoter outputs. These results indicate more comprehensive models that include local regulatory contexts are needed to develop a predictive understanding of global regulatory outputs.

8094759	19930301	The E3L and K3L vaccinia virus gene products stimulate translation through inhibition of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase by different mechanisms.	Vaccinia virus has evolved multiple mechanisms to counteract the interferon-induced antiviral host cell response. Recently, two vaccinia virus gene products were shown to interfere with the activity of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR): the K3L gene product and the E3L gene product. We have evaluated the efficiency by which these gene products inhibit PKR and whether they act in a synergistic manner. The effects of the two vaccinia virus gene products were compared in an in vivo system in which translation of a reporter gene (dihydrofolate reductase or eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha [eIF-2 alpha]) was inhibited because of the localized activation of PKR. In this system, the E3L gene product, and to a lesser extent the K3L gene product, potentiated translation of the reporter gene and inhibited eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation. Analysis in vitro demonstrated that the E3L gene product inhibited PKR approximately 50- to 100-fold more efficiently than the K3L gene product. However, further studies demonstrated that the mechanism of action of these two inhibitors was different. Whereas the E3L inhibitor interfered with the binding of the kinase to double-stranded RNA, the K3L inhibitor did not. We propose that the K3L inhibitor acts through its homology to eIF-2 alpha to interfere with the interaction of eIF-2 alpha with PKR. The two inhibitors did not display a synergistic effect on translation or eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation. In addition, neither K3L nor E3L expression detectably altered cellular protein synthesis.

19098160	20081223	Identification and characterization of proximal promoter polymorphisms in the human concentrative nucleoside transporter 2 (SLC28A2).	The human concentrative nucleoside transporter 2 (CNT2) plays an important role in the absorption, disposition, and biological effects of endogenous nucleosides and nucleoside analog drugs. We identified genetic variation in the basal promoter region of CNT2 and characterized the function of the variants. We screened DNA from an ethnically diverse population and identified five basal promoter variants in CNT2. Three major haplotypes in the CNT2 basal promoter region were identified and were found at different allele frequencies in various ethnic groups. The common promoter variants and haplotypes were constructed and characterized for their promoter activity using luciferase reporter assays. One polymorphic variant, rs2413775 (-146T&gt;A), with an allele frequency &gt;20% in all populations, showed a gain of function in luciferase activity. Furthermore, in vivo mouse promoter assays of these nucleotide variants using the hydrodynamic tail vein injection, leading to their expression in the liver, demonstrated similar results. Transcription factor binding site (TFBS) analysis indicated this variant alters a hepatic nuclear factor (HNF) 1 TFBS. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated stronger binding of HNF1alpha and weaker binding of HNF1beta to the -146T and -146A regions, whereas the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), -146A, exhibited enhanced binding to both HNF1alpha and HNF1beta, consistent with its greater activity in reporter assays. The data collectively suggest that the common variant, -146T&gt;A, in the proximal promoter of CNT2 may result in an enhanced transcription rate of the gene and, thus, expression levels of CNT2. This SNP may play a role in variation in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects of nucleoside analogs. 	J._Pharmacol._Exp._Ther.	D016428 D052061 D013485

17396023	20070331	Molecular phylogenetic analysis of the human endogenous retrovirus E (HERV-E) family in human tissues and human cancers.	The human genome is estimated to contain up to 50 copies of full-length and truncated members of HERV-E family. They are thought to be involved in human gene transcription. Here we examine the expression pattern and phylogenetic relationships of the HERV-E in diverse human tissues and cancer cells using RT-PCR amplification and bioinformatic tools. The env gene was expressed in many human tissues (brain, prostate, testis, kidney, placenta, spleen, thymus and uterus) but not in heart, liver, lung and skeletal muscle, importantly, HERV-E expression was detected in all cancer cell lines examined (RT4, PFSK-1, BT-474, HCT-116, TE-1, UO-31, Jurkat, HepG2, A549, MCF7, OVCAR-3, MIA-PaCa-2, PC3, LOX-IMVI, AZ521, 2F7, U-937 and C-33A), suggesting that HERV-E family are expressed corresponding to the transcriptional program of human tissues and human cancer cells. Phylogenetic analysis of HERV-E env family from human tissues, cancer cells and our previous data identify two groups (I and II) through evolutionary divergence. Taken together, HERV-E family expression in human tissues and human cancer cells exhibited close relationships of the env gene sequences across human chromosomes. These active HERV-E elements deserve further investigation as potential pathogenic factors in human diseases such as cancers. 	Genes_Genet._Syst.	D016428 D013485
9463416	19980328	B cell-attracting chemokine 1, a human CXC chemokine expressed in lymphoid tissues, selectively attracts B lymphocytes via BLR1/CXCR5.	Although most leukocytes, T lymphocytes in particular, respond to several different chemokines, there is virtually no information on chemokine activities and chemokine receptors in B lymphocytes. A putative chemokine receptor, BLR1, that is expressed in Burkitt's lymphoma cells and B lymphocytes was cloned a few years ago. Deletion of the gene for BLR1 yielded mice with abnormal primary follicles and germinal centers of the spleen and Peyer's patches, reflecting the inability of B lymphocytes to migrate into B cell areas. By screening expressed sequence tag DNA sequences, we have identified a CXC chemokine, termed B cell-attracting chemokine 1 (BCA-1), that is chemotactic for human B lymphocytes. BCA-1 cDNA encodes a protein of 109 amino acids with a leader sequence of 22 residues. The mature protein shares 23-34% identical amino acids with known CXC chemokines and is constitutively expressed in secondary lymphoid organs. BCA-1 was chemically synthesized and tested for activity on murine pre-B cells 300-19 transfected with BLR1 and on human blood B lymphocytes. In transfected cells, BCA-1 induced chemotaxis and Ca2+ mobilization demonstrating that it acts via BLR1. Under the same conditions, no activity was obtained with 10 CXC and 19 CC chemokines, lymphotactin, neurotactin/fractalkine and several other peptide ligands. BCA-1 was also a highly effective attractant for human blood B lymphocytes (which express BLR1), but was inactive on freshly isolated or IL-2-stimulated T lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils. In agreement with the nomenclature rules for chemokine receptors, we propose the term CXCR5 for BLR1. Together with the observed disturbance of B cell colonization in BLR1/ CXCR5-deficient mice, the present results indicate that chemotactic recruitment by locally produced BCA-1 is important for the development of B cell areas of secondary lymphoid tissues.

22043285	20111102	Liquid facets-related (lqfR) is required for egg chamber morphogenesis during Drosophila oogenesis.	Clathrin interactor 1 [CLINT1] (also called enthoprotin/EpsinR) is an Epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain-containing adaptor protein that functions in anterograde and retrograde clathrin-mediated trafficking between the trans-Golgi network and the endosome. Removal of both Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologs, Ent3p and Ent5p, result in yeast that are viable, but that display a cold-sensitive growth phenotype and mistrafficking of various vacuolar proteins. Similarly, either knock-down or overexpression of vertebrate CLINT1 in cell culture causes mistrafficking of proteins. Here, we have characterized Drosophila CLINT1, liquid-facets Related (lqfR). LqfR is ubiquitously expressed throughout development and is localized to the Golgi and endosome. Strong hypomorphic mutants generated by imprecise P-element excision exhibit extra macrochaetae, rough eyes and are female sterile. Although essentially no eggs are laid, the ovaries do contain late-stage egg chambers that exhibit abnormal morphology. Germline clones reveal that LqfR expression in the somatic follicle cells is sufficient to rescue the oogenesis defects. Clones of mutant lqfR follicle cells have a decreased cell size consistent with a downregulation of Akt1. We find that while total Akt1 levels are increased there is also a significant decrease in activated phosphorylated Akt1. Taken together, these results show that LqfR function is required to regulate follicle cell size and signaling during Drosophila oogenesis. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
26473914	20151017	HCV Drug Resistance Challenges in Japan: The Role of Pre-Existing Variants and Emerging Resistant Strains in Direct Acting Antiviral Therapy.	Sustained virological response (SVR) rates have increased dramatically following the approval of direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapies. While individual DAAs have a low barrier to resistance, most patients can be successfully treated using DAA combination therapy. However, DAAs are vulnerable to drug resistance, and resistance-associated variants (RAVs) may occur naturally prior to DAA therapy or may emerge following drug exposure. While most RAVs are quickly lost in the absence of DAAs, compensatory mutations may reinforce fitness. However, the presence of RAVs does not necessarily preclude successful treatment. Although developments in hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy in Asia have largely paralleled those in the United States, Japan's July 2014 approval of asunaprevir plus daclatasvir combination therapy as the first all-oral interferon-free therapy was not repeated in the United States. Instead, two different combination therapies were approved: sofosbuvir/ledipasvir and paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir/dasabuvir. This divergence in treatment approaches may lead to differences in resistance challenges faced by Japan and the US. However, the recent approval of sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir in Japan and the recent submissions of petitions for approval of paritaprevir/ritonavir plus ombitasvir suggest a trend towards a new consensus on emerging DAA regimens.

23365805	20130201	A contribution to the history of the proton channel.	The low numbers of hydrogen ions in physiological solutions encouraged the assumption that H(+) currents flowing through conductive pathways would be so small as to be unmeasurable even if theoretically possible. Evidence for an H(+)-based action potential in the luminescent dinoflagellate Noctiluca and for an H(+)-conducting channel created by the secretions of the bacterium Bacillus brevis, did little to alter this perception. The clear demonstration of H(+) conduction in molluscan neurons might have provided the breakthrough but the new pathway was without an easily demonstrable function, and escaped general attention. Indeed the extreme measures that must be taken to successfully isolate H(+) currents meant that it was some years before proton channels were identified in mammalian cells. However, with the general availability of patch-clamp techniques and evidence for an important role in mammalian neutrophils, the stage was set for a series of structure/function studies with the potential to make the proton channel the best understood channel of all. In addition, widespread genomic searches have established that proton channels play important roles in processes ranging from fertilization of the human ovum to the progression of breast cancer. ? 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

19801978	20091006	SOX2 is an amplified lineage-survival oncogene in lung and esophageal squamous cell carcinomas.	Lineage-survival oncogenes are activated by somatic DNA alterations in cancers arising from the cell lineages in which these genes play a role in normal development. Here we show that a peak of genomic amplification on chromosome 3q26.33 found in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the lung and esophagus contains the transcription factor gene SOX2, which is mutated in hereditary human esophageal malformations, is necessary for normal esophageal squamous development, promotes differentiation and proliferation of basal tracheal cells and cooperates in induction of pluripotent stem cells. SOX2 expression is required for proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of lung and esophageal cell lines, as shown by RNA interference experiments. Furthermore, ectopic expression of SOX2 here cooperated with FOXE1 or FGFR2 to transform immortalized tracheobronchial epithelial cells. SOX2-driven tumors show expression of markers of both squamous differentiation and pluripotency. These characteristics identify SOX2 as a lineage-survival oncogene in lung and esophageal SCC.

19779552	20090926	Balancing selection of a frame-shift mutation in the MRC2 gene accounts for the outbreak of the Crooked Tail Syndrome in Belgian Blue Cattle.	We herein describe the positional identification of a 2-bp deletion in the open reading frame of the MRC2 receptor causing the recessive Crooked Tail Syndrome in cattle. The resulting frame-shift reveals a premature stop codon that causes nonsense-mediated decay of the mutant messenger RNA, and the virtual absence of functional Endo180 protein in affected animals. Cases exhibit skeletal anomalies thought to result from impaired extracellular matrix remodeling during ossification, and as of yet unexplained muscular symptoms. We demonstrate that carrier status is very significantly associated with desired characteristics in the general population, including enhanced muscular development, and that the resulting heterozygote advantage caused a selective sweep which explains the unexpectedly high frequency (25%) of carriers in the Belgian Blue Cattle Breed.

25474106	20141205	Formation of linear amplicons with inverted duplications in Leishmania requires the MRE11 nuclease.	Extrachromosomal DNA amplification is frequent in the protozoan parasite Leishmania selected for drug resistance. The extrachromosomal amplified DNA is either circular or linear, and is formed at the level of direct or inverted homologous repeated sequences that abound in the Leishmania genome. The RAD51 recombinase plays an important role in circular amplicons formation, but the mechanism by which linear amplicons are formed is unknown. We hypothesized that the Leishmania infantum DNA repair protein MRE11 is required for linear amplicons following rearrangements at the level of inverted repeats. The purified LiMRE11 protein showed both DNA binding and exonuclease activities. Inactivation of the LiMRE11 gene led to parasites with enhanced sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. The MRE11(-/-) parasites had a reduced capacity to form linear amplicons after drug selection, and the reintroduction of an MRE11 allele led to parasites regaining their capacity to generate linear amplicons, but only when MRE11 had an active nuclease activity. These results highlight a novel MRE11-dependent pathway used by Leishmania to amplify portions of its genome to respond to a changing environment. 	PLoS_Genet.	D016428 D013485
16430206	20060125	Interactions of granisetron with an agonist-free 5-HT3A receptor model.	A new homology model of type-3A serotonin receptors (5-HT(3A)Rs) was built on the basis of the electron microscopic structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and with an agonist-free binding cavity. The new model was used to re-evaluate the interactions of granisetron, a 5-HT(3A)R antagonist. Docking of granisetron identified two possible binding modes, including a newly identified region for antagonists formed by loop B, C, and E residues. Amino acid residues L184-D189 in loop B were mutated to alanine, while Y143 and Y153 in loop E were mutated to phenylalanine. Mutation H185A resulted in no detectable granisetron binding, while D189A resulted in a 22-fold reduction in affinity. Y143F and Y153F decreased granisetron affinity to the same extent as Y143A and Y153A mutations, supporting the role of the OH groups of these tyrosines in loop E. Modeling and mutation studies suggest that granisetron plays its antagonist role by hindering the closure of the back wall of the binding cavity. 	Biochemistry	D016428
15555063	20041124	Widespread presence of &quot;bacterial-like&quot; PPP phosphatases in eukaryotes.	In eukaryotes, PPP (protein phosphatase P) family is one of the two known protein phosphatase families specific for Ser and Thr. The role of PPP phosphatases in multiple signaling pathways in eukaryotic cell has been extensively studied. Unlike eukaryotic PPP phosphatases, bacterial members of the family have broad substrate specificity or may even be Tyr-specific. Moreover, one group of bacterial PPPs are diadenosine tetraphosphatases, indicating that bacterial PPP phosphatases may not necessarily function as protein phosphatases. We describe the presence in eukaryotes of three groups of expressed genes encoding &quot;non-conventional&quot; phosphatases of the PPP family. These enzymes are more closely related to bacterial PPP phosphatases than to the known eukaryotic members of the family. One group, found exclusively in land plants, is most closely related to PPP phosphatases from some alpha-Proteobacteria, including Rhizobiales, Rhodobacterales and Rhodospirillaceae. This group is therefore termed Rhizobiales / Rhodobacterales / Rhodospirillaceae-like phosphatases, or Rhilphs. Phosphatases of the other group are found in Viridiplantae, Rhodophyta, Trypanosomatidae, Plasmodium and some fungi. They are structurally related to phosphatases from psychrophilic bacteria Shewanella and Colwellia, and are termed Shewanella-like phosphatases, or Shelphs. Phosphatases of the third group are distantly related to ApaH, bacterial diadenosine tetraphosphatases, and are termed ApaH-like phosphatases, or Alphs. Patchy distribution of Alphs in animals, plants, fungi, diatoms and kinetoplasts suggests that these phosphatases were present in the common ancestor of eukaryotes but were independently lost in many lineages. Rhilphs, Shelphs and Alphs form PPP clades, as divergent from &quot;conventional&quot; eukaryotic PPP phosphatases as they are from each other and from major bacterial clades. In addition, comparison of primary structures revealed a previously unrecognised (I/L/V)D(S/T)G motif, conserved in all bacterial and &quot;bacterial-like&quot; eukaryotic PPPs, but not in &quot;conventional&quot; eukaryotic and archaeal PPPs.

19646633	20090804	Genetic association of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1)-2518 polymorphism in Mexican patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.	To investigate the role of MCP-1-2518, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)-G801A and chemokine receptors CCR5-Delta32, CCR5-59 029, and CCR2-64I gene polymorphisms in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder in Mexican Mestizo patients. Forty-seven unrelated consecutive patients with non-muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) and 126 unrelated healthy individuals were studied. Genomic extraction was carried out from complete blood samples using the salting out method. The PCR-RFLP method was used to amplify the following polymorphisms: MCP-1-2518, SDF-1-G801A, CCR5-Delta32, CCR5-59 029, and CCR2-64I. The patients were divided according to low, intermediate, and high risk of progression and treated accordingly with surveillance or immunotherapy with BCG. SDF-1-G801A, CCR5-Delta32, CCR5-59 029, and CCR2-64I polymorphisms were not associated with the genetic susceptibility to non-muscle-invasive TCC of the bladder in Mexican patients. The distribution of AA, AG, and GG genotypes of MCP-1-2518 was significantly different in bladder cancer patients compared with controls (P = .006). There was a significant decrease both in the frequency of the G mutant allele (P = .021, OR = 1.752; C 95% CI 1.088-2.828) and in the GG genotype (P = .001, OR = 6.097 95% CI 1.885-19.570) in TCC patients, compared with controls. This preliminary study shows that MCP-1 polymorphism is associated with TCC. 	Urology	D016428
24108539	20131011	Effect of F8 B domain gene variants on synthesis, secretion, activity and stability of factor VIII protein.	The B domain of the coagulation factor (F)VIII comprises some unique characteristics. Though the B domain is important for processing, intracellular transport and secretion of FVIII protein, its role in the coagulation still remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the influence of 19 reported B domain variants on quantity and quality of expressed FVIII protein. F8 variants were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells. Media and cell lysates were collected after 72 hours. FVIII synthesis, relative secretion, activity and thermostability were analysed in comparison to FVIII wild-type. Eleven of 19 analysed B domain variants showed normal FVIII activity (FVIII:C), and antigen values (40-150 %). Eight variants exhibited a decreased FVIII:C, corresponding to a mild phenotype most likely due to impaired expression and secretion mechanism, reduced thermostability or combined mechanisms. One variant, p.His1066Tyr, showed markedly reduced FVIII antigen in cell lysate. The variants p.Asp845Glu, p.His998Gln, and p.Ala1610Ser revealed a significantly decreased relative secretion. Additionally, six B domain variants significantly reduced stability of FVIII. In conclusion, none of the analysed missense mutations was causative for a severe haemophilia A (HA) phenotype. Nevertheless, the mutations p.Asp845Glu, p.Pro947Arg, p.Glu1057Lys, p.His1066Tyr, p.Arg1126Trp, p.Arg1329His, p.Leu1481Pro, and p.Ala1610Ser resulted in decreased FVIII:C values that may explain mild HA phenotypes.

18854998	20081016	[The spectrum of microbiological agents causing pulmonary MALT-type lymphomas. A 16S rRNA-based analysis of microbial diversity].	For several anatomical localisations of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type (eMZBCL), an association with chronic inflammation caused by microbiological agents (e.g. Helicobacter pylori in the stomach) has been described. In the lung, a link between lymphomagenesis and a defined causative organism is still missing. A comprehensive diversity survey using 16S-rDNA library construction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, sequencing, and phylogenetic tree construction was employed for nine cases each of BALT lymphoma and control lung tissues (normal foetal lung, pneumonitis, carcinoid). This highly sensitive method, hereafter termed SHARP screening allowed for identification of the entire bacterial population in the tissue in a cultivation-independent manner. It was noteworthy that in eight of the nine cases of BALT lymphoma, bacteria of the Alcaligenaceae family (Alcaligenes, Achromobacter, AKIW733), were detected, whereas none of the control cases showed the presence of these clades. 16S-rDNA library construction in combination with RFLP screening and phylogenetic analyses, hereafter described as SHARP screening, is a cultivation-independent tool for analysing the microbial environment in chronic inflammation processes giving rise to extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of MALT-type. Betaproteobacteria of the Alcaligenaceae family may be affiliated with and possibly involved in the lymphomagenesis of BALT lymphomas. 	Pathologe	D004740 D016428
17434145	20070417	Phosphorylation of ataxin-3 by glycogen synthase kinase 3beta at serine 256 regulates the aggregation of ataxin-3.	Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is a dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine tract in MJD-1 gene product, ataxin-3. Recently, studies show that phosphorylation of polyglutamine disease proteins, such as huntingtin, ataxin-1 and DRPLA, plays an important role in regulating pathogenesis. However, the kinase that phosphorylates ataxin-3 remains unknown. Here we show that S256 site in ataxin-3 is phosphorylated by GSK 3beta. Moreover, S256A mutant of expanded ataxin-3 forms high molecular weight protein aggregation, whereas S256D mutant and expanded ataxin-3 without mutation on this site are monomeric. The molecular chaperone Hsp70 represses the aggregation of S256A mutant. Our results imply that phosphorylation of serine 256 in ataxin-3 by GSK 3beta regulates ataxin-3 aggregation.

24795740	20140506	Plant responses to Agrobacterium tumefaciens and crown gall development.	Agrobacterium tumefaciens causes crown gall disease on various plant species by introducing its T-DNA into the genome. Therefore, Agrobacterium has been extensively studied both as a pathogen and an important biotechnological tool. The infection process involves the transfer of T-DNA and virulence proteins into the plant cell. At that time the gene expression patterns of host plants differ depending on the Agrobacterium strain, plant species and cell-type used. Later on, integration of the T-DNA into the plant host genome, expression of the encoded oncogenes, and increase in phytohormone levels induce a fundamental reprogramming of the transformed cells. This results in their proliferation and finally formation of plant tumors. The process of reprogramming is accompanied by altered gene expression, morphology and metabolism. In addition to changes in the transcriptome and metabolome, further genome-wide (&quot;omic&quot;) approaches have recently deepened our understanding of the genetic and epigenetic basis of crown gall tumor formation. This review summarizes the current knowledge about plant responses in the course of tumor development. Special emphasis is placed on the connection between epigenetic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, and morphological changes in the developing tumor. These changes not only result in abnormally proliferating host cells with a heterotrophic and transport-dependent metabolism, but also cause differentiation and serve as mechanisms to balance pathogen defense and adapt to abiotic stress conditions, thereby allowing the coexistence of the crown gall and host plant.

22646749	20120601	Engineering of Aerococcus viridans L-lactate oxidase for site-specific PEGylation: characterization and selective bioorthogonal modification of a S218C mutant.	A defined bioconjugate of Aerococcus viridans L-lactate oxidase and poly(ethylene glycol) 5000 was prepared and characterized in its structural and functional properties in comparison to the unmodified enzyme. Because the L-lactate oxidase in the native form does not contain cysteines, we introduced a new site for chemical modification via thiol chemistry by substituting the presumably surface-exposed serine-218, a nonconserved residue in the amino acid sequence, with cysteine. The resulting S218C mutant was isolated from Escherichia coli and shown in kinetic assays to be similarly (i.e., about half as) active as the native enzyme, thus validating the structure-guided design of the mutation. Using maleimide-activated methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) 5000 in about 10-fold molar excess over protein, the S218C mutant was converted in high yield (94%) into PEGylated derivative, while the native enzyme was totally unreactive under equivalent conditions. PEGylation caused only a relatively small decrease (30%) in the specific activity of the S218C mutant, and it did not change the protein stability. PEGylation went along with enhancement of the apparent size of the homotetrameric L-lactate oxidase in gel permeation chromatography, from 170 kDa to 250 kDa. The protein hydrodynamic diameter determined by dynamic light scattering increased from 11.9 nm in unmodified S218C mutant to 16.4 nm in the PEGylated form. Site-selective PEGylation of the mutated L-lactate oxidase, using orthogonal maleimide-thiol coupling, could therefore facilitate incorporation of the enzyme into biosensors currently employed for determination of blood L-lactate levels, and it could also support different applications of the enzyme in applied biocatalysis.

22607229	20120522	Overexpression of an exotic thermotolerant ?-glucosidase in trichoderma reesei and its significant increase in cellulolytic activity and saccharification of barley straw.	Trichoderma reesei is a widely used industrial strain for cellulase production, but its low yield of ?-glucosidase has prevented its industrial value. In the hydrolysis process of cellulolytic residues by T. reesei, a disaccharide known as cellobiose is produced and accumulates, which inhibits further cellulases production. This problem can be solved by adding ?-glucosidase, which hydrolyzes cellobiose to glucose for fermentation. It is, therefore, of high vvalue to construct T. reesei strains which can produce sufficient ?-glucosidase and other hydrolytic enzymes, especially when those enzymes are capable of tolerating extreme conditions such as high temperature and acidic or alkali pH. We successfully engineered a thermostable ?-glucosidase gene from the fungus Periconia sp. into the genome of T. reesei QM9414 strain. The engineered T. reesei strain showed about 10.5-fold (23.9?IU/mg) higher ?-glucosidase activity compared to the parent strain (2.2 IU/mg) after 24 h of incubation. The transformants also showed very high total cellulase activity (about 39.0 FPU/mg) at 24 h of incubation whereas the parent strain almost did not show any total cellulase activity at 24 h of incubation. The recombinant ?-glucosidase showed to be thermotolerant and remains fully active after two-hour incubation at temperatures as high as 60?C. Additionally, it showed to be active at a wide pH range and maintains about 88% of its maximal activity after four-hour incubation at 25?C in a pH range from 3.0 to 9.0. Enzymatic hydrolysis assay using untreated, NaOH, or Organosolv pretreated barley straw as well as microcrystalline cellulose showed that the transformed T. reesei strains released more reducing sugars compared to the parental strain. The recombinant T. reesei overexpressing Periconia sp. ?-glucosidase in this study showed higher ?-glucosidase and total cellulase activities within a shorter incubation time (24 h) as well as higher hydrolysis activity using biomass residues. These features suggest that the transformants can be used for ?-glucosidase production as well as improving the biomass conversion using cellulases. 	Microb._Cell_Fact.	D016428 D013485
24043862	20130918	Divergent effects of ?- and ?-myosin heavy chain isoforms on the N terminus of rat cardiac troponin T.	Divergent effects of ?- and ?-myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms on contractile behavior arise mainly because of their impact on thin filament cooperativity. The N terminus of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) also modulates thin filament cooperativity. Our hypothesis is that the impact of the N terminus of cTnT on thin filament activation is modulated by a shift from ?- to ?-MHC isoform. We engineered two recombinant proteins by deleting residues 1-43 and 44-73 in rat cTnT (RcTnT): RcTnT(1-43?) and RcTnT(44-73?), respectively. Dynamic and steady-state contractile parameters were measured at sarcomere length of 2.3 ?m after reconstituting proteins into detergent-skinned muscle fibers from normal (?-MHC) and propylthiouracil-treated (?-MHC) rat hearts. ?-MHC attenuated Ca(2+)-activated maximal tension (?46%) in RcTnT(1-43?) fibers. In contrast, ?-MHC decreased tension only by 19% in RcTnT(1-43?) fibers. Both ?- and ?-MHC did not affect tension in RcTnT(44-73?) fibers. The instantaneous muscle fiber stiffness measurements corroborated the divergent impact of ?- and ?-MHC on tension in RcTnT(1-43?) fibers. pCa50 (-log of [Ca(2+)]free required for half-maximal activation) decreased significantly by 0.13 pCa units in ?-MHC + RcTnT(1-43?) fibers but remained unaltered in ?-MHC + RcTnT(1-43?) fibers, demonstrating that ?-MHC counteracted the attenuating effect of RcTnT(1-43?) on myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity. ?-MHC did not alter the sudden stretch-mediated recruitment of new cross-bridges (ER) in RcTnT(1-43?) fibers, but ?-MHC attenuated ER by 36% in RcTnT(1-43?) fibers. The divergent impact of ?- and ?-MHC on how the N terminus of cTnT modulates contractile dynamics has implications for heart disease; alterations in cTnT and MHC are known to occur via changes in isoform expression or mutations.

24837825	20140520	Tetrahelical monomolecular architecture of DNA: a new building block for nanotechnology.	DNA nanotechnology typically relies on Watson-Crick base pairing as both a recognition and structural element. This limits structural versatility and introduces errors during self-assembly of DNA. Guanine (G) quartet motifs show promise as an alternative to DNA duplexes, but the synthesis of long, precisely defined molecules is a significant challenge. Here we demonstrate a continuous tetrahelical DNA architecture capable of programmed self-assembly. We report that the homopolymer consisting of (G3T)3G3 monomeric units has the capability to fold into a monomolecular DNA tetrahelix with unprecedented speed and stability. For instance, in the presence of 1 mM K(+) ions the dimer, (G3T)2, folds readily and melts above 100 ?C. These findings have the potential to revolutionize DNA nanotechnology by introducing fast and error-free self-assembly of long and extraordinarily stable molecules. 	J_Phys_Chem_B	D016428 D013485
27033538	20160402	Characterization of aspartate kinase and homoserine dehydrogenase from Corynebacterium glutamicum IWJ001 and systematic investigation of L-isoleucine biosynthesis.	Previously we have characterized a?threonine dehydratase mutant TD(F383V) (encoded by ilvA1) and an acetohydroxy acid synthase mutant AHAS(P176S, D426E, L575W) (encoded by ilvBN1) in Corynebacterium glutamicum IWJ001, one of the best L-isoleucine producing strains. Here, we further characterized an?aspartate kinase mutant AK(A279T) (encoded by lysC1) and a homoserine dehydrogenase mutant HD(G378S) (encoded by hom1) in IWJ001, and analyzed the consequences of all these mutant enzymes on amino acids production in the wild type background. In vitro enzyme tests confirmed that AK(A279T) is completely resistant to feed-back inhibition by L-threonine and L-lysine, and that HD(G378S) is partially resistant to L-threonine with the half maximal inhibitory concentration between 12 and 14?mM. In C. glutamicum ATCC13869, expressing lysC1 alone led to exclusive L-lysine accumulation, co-expressing hom1 and thrB1 with lysC1 shifted partial carbon flux from L-lysine (decreased by 50.1?%) to L-threonine (4.85?g/L) with minor L-isoleucine and no L-homoserine accumulation, further co-expressing ilvA1 completely depleted L-threonine and strongly shifted carbon flux from L-lysine (decreased by 83.0?%) to L-isoleucine (3.53?g/L). The results demonstrated the strongly feed-back resistant TD(F383V) might be the main driving force for L-isoleucine over-synthesis in this case, and the partially feed-back resistant HD(G378S) might prevent the accumulation of toxic intermediates. Information exploited from such mutation-bred production strain would be useful for metabolic engineering. 	J._Ind._Microbiol._Biotechnol.	D016428
25471352	20141205	TSNARE1 polymorphisms are associated with schizophrenia susceptibility in Han Chinese.	t-SNARE domain containing 1 gene (TSNARE1) is located at human chromosome 8q24.3, and may play a crucial role in intracellular protein transport and synaptic transmission. Recently, a large-scale meta-analysis of genome-wide association study dataset identified that rs10098073 and rs4129585, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within TSNARE1, were closely associated with the risk of schizophrenia in Caucasians. However, this finding has not been validated in other populations or ethnic groups thus far. In the current study, we conducted a case-control study to confirm the association of these two SNPs with the schizophrenia risk in a Han Chinese population comprising 440 schizophrenia patients and 450 control subjects. According to the genotype data of Han Chinese from Beijing in 1,000 Genomes Project database, rs10098073 and rs4129585 were located in one haplotype block and were in almost complete linkage disequilibrium (D' = 1, r (2) ? 0.952). Therefore, only rs10098073 was selected for the subsequent analysis. We showed for the first time that the minor allele (A) of rs10098073 was associated with a reduced risk of schizophrenia (OR = 0.753; 95 % CI 0.613-0.924; P = 0.007). Furthermore, we found that the A allele of rs10098073 reduced the schizophrenia risk through a recessive manner (A/A vs. A/C + C/C, OR = 0.563; 95 % CI 0.357-0.89; P = 0.013, P Bonferroni corrected = 0.026) rather than a dominant manner (A/A + A/C vs. C/C, OR = 0.762; 95 % CI 0.586-0.992; P = 0.043, P Bonferroni corrected = 0.086). Taken together, these findings demonstrate a significant association between TSNARE1 polymorphisms and schizophrenia risk in a Han Chinese population, suggesting TSNARE1 may represent a susceptibility gene for this disease.

21455600	20110402	Structural models of CFTR-AMPK and CFTR-PKA interactions: R-domain flexibility is a key factor in CFTR regulation.	Cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common lethal genetic disease among Caucasians, is caused by mutations in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR's main role is to transport chloride ions across epithelial cell membranes. It also regulates many cell functions. However, the exact role of CFTR in cellular processes is not yet fully understood. It is recognized that a key factor in CFTR-related regulation is its phosphorylation state. The important kinases regulating CFTR are cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). PKA and AMPK have opposite effects on CFTR activity despite their highly similar structures and recognition motifs. Utilizing homology modeling, in silico mutagenesis and literature mining, we supplement available information regarding the atomic-resolution structures of PKA, AMPK and CFTR, and the complexes CFTR-PKA and CFTR-AMPK. The atomic-resolution structural predictions reveal an unexpected availability of CFTR Ser813 for phosphorylation by both PKA and AMPK. These results indicate the key role of the structural flexibility of the serine-rich R-domain in CFTR regulation by phosphorylation. 	J_Mol_Model	D016428
10431819	19990804	Identification of catalytically essential residues in Escherichia coli esterase by site-directed mutagenesis.	Escherichia coli esterase (EcE) is a member of the hormone-sensitive lipase family. We have analyzed the roles of the conserved residues in this enzyme (His103, Glu128, Gly163, Asp164, Ser165, Gly167, Asp262, Asp266 and His292) by site-directed mutagenesis. Among them, Gly163, Asp164, Ser165, and Gly167 are the components of a G-D/E-S-A-G motif. We showed that Ser165, Asp262, and His292 are the active-site residues of the enzyme. We also showed that none of the other residues, except for Asp164, is critical for the enzymatic activity. The mutation of Asp164 to Ala dramatically reduced the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme by the factor of 10(4) without seriously affecting the substrate binding. This residue is probably structurally important to make the conformation of the active-site functional. 	FEBS_Lett.	D016428
11287604	20010405	Phosphorylation of nuclear phospholipase C beta1 by extracellular signal-regulated kinase mediates the mitogenic action of insulin-like growth factor I.	It is well established that a phosphoinositide (PI) cycle which is operationally distinct from the classical plasma membrane PI cycle exists within the nucleus, where it is involved in both cell proliferation and differentiation. However, little is known about the regulation of the nuclear PI cycle. Here, we report that nucleus-localized phospholipase C (PLC) beta1, the key enzyme for the initiation of this cycle, is a physiological target of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) caused rapid nuclear translocation of activated ERK and concurrently induced phosphorylation of nuclear PLC beta1, which was completely blocked by the MEK inhibitor PD 98059. Coimmunoprecipitation detected a specific association between the activated ERK and PLC beta1 within the nucleus. In vitro studies revealed that recombinant PLC beta1 could be efficiently phosphorylated by activated mitogen-activated protein kinase but not by PKA. The ERK phosphorylation site was mapped to serine 982, which lies within a PSSP motif located in the characteristic carboxy-terminal tail of PLC beta1. In cells overexpressing a PLC beta1 mutant in which serine 982 is replaced by glycine (S982G), IGF-I failed to activate the nuclear PI cycle, and its mitogenic effect was also markedly attenuated. Expression of S982G was found to inhibit ERK-mediated phosphorylation of endogenous PLC beta1. This result suggests that ERK-evoked phosphorylation of PLC beta1 at serine 982 plays a critical role in the activation of the nuclear PI cycle and is also crucial to the mitogenic action of IGF-I.

2523729	19890124	Comparison of rate constants for (PO3-) transfer by the Mg(II), Cd(II), and Li(I) forms of phosphoglucomutase.	Net rate constants that define the steady-state rate through a sequence of steps and the corresponding effective energy barriers for two (PO3-)-transfer steps in the phosphoglucomutase reaction were compared as a function of metal ion, M, where M = Mg2+ and Cd2+. These steps involve the reaction of either the 1-phosphate or the 6-phosphate of glucose 1,6-bisphosphate (Glc-P2) bound to the dephosphoenzyme (ED) to produce the phosphoenzyme (EP) and the free monophosphates, glucose 1-phosphate (Glc-1-P) or glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P): EP.M + Glc-1-P----ED.M.Glc-P2----EP.M.Glc-6-P6. Before this comparison was made, net rate constants for the Cd2+ enzyme, obtained at high enzyme concentration via 31P NMR saturation-transfer studies [Post, C. B., Ray, W. J., Jr., &amp; Gorenstein, D. G. (1989) Biochemistry (preceding paper in this issue)], were appropriately scaled by using the observed constants to calculate both the expected isotope-transfer rate at equilibrium and the steady-state rate under initial velocity conditions and comparing the calculated values with those measured in dilute solution. For the Mg2+ enzyme, narrow limits on possible values of the corresponding net rate constants were imposed on the basis of initial velocity rate constants for the forward and reverse directions plus values for the equilibrium distribution of central complexes, since direct measurement is not feasible. The effective energy barriers for both the Mg2+ and Cd2+ enzymes, calculated from the respective net rate constants, together with previously values for the equilibrium distribution of complexes in both enzymic systems [Ray, W. J., Jr., &amp; Long, J. W. (1976) Biochemistry 15, 4018-4025], show that the 100-fold decrease in the kappa cat for the Cd2+ relative to the Mg2+ enzyme is caused by two factors: the increased stability of the intermediate bisphosphate complex and the decreased ability to cope with the phosphate ester involving the 1-hydroxyl group of the glucose ring. In fact, it is unlikely that the efficiency of (PO3-) transfer to the 6-hydroxyl group of bound Glc-1-P (thermodynamically favorable direction) is reduced by more than an order of magnitude in the Cd2+ enzyme. By contrast, the efficiency of the Li+ enzyme in the same (PO3-)-transfer step is less than 4 x 10(-8) that of the Mg2+ enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) 	Biochemistry	D003160 D016428 D013487
22802746	20120718	Clinical practice guideline for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumor in Korea.	Despite their rarity in incidence and prevalence, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) have emerged as a distinct and noteworthy pathogenetic entity. The clinical management of GISTs has rapidly evolved due to the recent elucidation of their oncogenic signal transduction pathway and the introduction of molecular-targeted therapies. Successful management of GISTs requires a multidisciplinary approach firmly based on an accurate histopathologic diagnosis. In 2007, the Korean GIST study group published the first guideline for optimal diagnosis and treatment of GISTs in Korea. The second version of the guideline was published in 2010. Herein, we provide the results of relevant clinical studies for the purpose of further revision to the guideline. We expect this new guideline will enhance the accuracy of diagnosis, as performed by members of the Korean associate of physicians involved in GIST patient care, thus improving the efficacy of treatment.

To describe clinical data and to characterize mutations in the transforming growth factor beta-induced (TGFBI) gene in patients from three unrelated Chilean families with lattice corneal dystrophy type I (LCDI). Snellen acuity tests, anterior segment slit lamp examinations, dilated fundus evaluations, and tonometry were performed for seven patients--five females and two males belonging to three unrelated families--affected with lattice corneal dystrophy Type I. Genomic DNA was also extracted from peripheral leukocytes from the seven patients and four healthy relatives. The 417C&gt;T mutation (R124C) was screened using PCR-RFLP for the seven patients and four healthy relatives. Exons 11, 12, 13, and 14 were sequenced in one patient not carrying the mutation in codon 124. Comparison of phenotype to genotype was performed. The seven patients studied exhibited LCDI in both eyes, most of which were symmetric. Affected individuals demonstrated progression from central subepithelial needlelike deposits and polymorphic anterior stromal opacities. The age at onset of symptoms varied between six to 15 years old in Family One; the patient in Family Two was five years old and the patient in Family Three was 21 years old. Visual acuity varied from 1.0 to 0.05. Two patients, aged 50 and 45 years, underwent penetrating keratoplasty in both eyes, and two patients, aged 47 and 24 years, underwent penetrating keratoplasty in one eye. The only patient in Family Three exhibited a somewhat distinct phenotype, with yellowish discoloration in the anterior stroma and fewer, but thicker lattice lines than the patients in Families One and Two. Screening for the mutation C&gt;T at the nucleotide position 417 (R124C) in exon 4 in the three families revealed the heterozygous R124C mutation in Families One and Two. In Family Two, the mutation was a de novo mutation, as neither parent was a carrier. Screening by sequencing analysis for mutation in exons 11, 12, 13, and 14 in the affected patient in Family Three revealed a heterozygous A1762G mutation (H572R) in exon 13. This is the second report of the 417C&gt;T mutation and the first report of 1762 A&gt;G mutation (H572R) in Chilean patients. The H572R mutation identified is associated with a distinct lattice corneal dystrophy type I phenotype. 	Mol._Vis.	D002363 D016428 D013485

The incidence of CF varies between 1 in 2000 to 3000 live-births in various ethnic groups. The disease is rare in East Asians. Here we report a 9 year old Thai male patient, who was diagnosed to have CF based on recurrent pneumonia, a slow weight gain, pancreatic insufficiency and repeatedly elevated sweat chloride levels by two different methods. A comprehensive genetic analysis showed the splicing mutation, 1898+ 1G--&gt;T, which was apparently of maternal origin. Literature search found 39 documented cases of CF patients in East Asians. CFTR (MIM# 602421) genotyping was performed in 14 patients including our patient and in 9 of them a CF allele was identified. The findings seem to indicate that the splicing mutations, 1898+ 1G--&gt;T and 1898+ 5G--&gt;T are more common in East Asian CF patients. 	Hum._Mutat.	D002363 D016428 D013485
27252779	20160603	DNA microarray of global transcription factor mutant reveals membrane-related proteins involved in n-butanol tolerance in Escherichia coli.	Escherichia coli has been explored as a platform host strain for biofuels production such as butanol. However, the severe toxicity of butanol is considered to be one major limitation for butanol production from E. coli. The goal of this study is therefore to construct butanol-tolerant E. coli strains and clarify the tolerance mechanisms. A recombinant E. coli strain harboring ?(70) mutation capable of tolerating 2?% (v/v) butanol was isolated by the global transcription machinery engineering (gTME) approach. DNA microarrays were employed to assess the transcriptome profile of butanol-tolerant strain B8. Compared with the wild-type strain, 329 differentially expressed genes (197 up-regulated and 132 down-regulated) (p?&lt;?0.05; FC???2) were identified. These genes are involved in carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, two-component signal transduction system, oxidative stress response, lipid and cell envelope biogenesis and efflux pump. Several membrane-related proteins were proved to be involved in butanol tolerance of E. coli. Two down-regulated genes, yibT and yghW, were identified to be capable of affecting butanol tolerance by regulating membrane fatty acid composition. Another down-regulated gene ybjC encodes a predicted inner membrane protein. In addition, a number of up-regulated genes, such as gcl and glcF, contribute to supplement metabolic intermediates for glyoxylate and TCA cycles to enhance energy supply. Our results could serve as a practical strategy for the construction of platform E. coli strains as biofuel producer. 	Biotechnol_Biofuels	D016428
9525926	19980509	Improved fluorescence and dual color detection with enhanced blue and green variants of the green fluorescent protein.	The green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria is a versatile reporter protein for monitoring gene expression and protein localization in a variety of systems. Applications using GFP reporters have expanded greatly due to the availability of mutants with altered spectral properties, including several blue emission variants, all of which contain the single point mutation Tyr-66 to His in the chromophore region of the protein. However, previously described &quot;BFP&quot; reporters have limited utility, primarily due to relatively dim fluorescence and low expression levels attained in higher eukaryotes with such variants. To improve upon these qualities, we have combined a blue emission mutant of GFP containing four point mutations (Phe-64 to Leu, Ser-65 to Thr, Tyr-66 to His, and Tyr-145 to Phe) with a synthetic gene sequence containing codons preferentially found in highly expressed human proteins. These mutations were chosen to optimize expression of properly folded fluorescent protein in mammalian cells cultured at 37 degreesC and to maximize signal intensity. The combination of improved fluorescence and higher expression levels yield an enhanced blue fluorescent protein that provides greater sensitivity and is suitable for dual color detection with green-emitting fluorophores.

16246960	20051026	Phenotypic variability and unusual clinical severity of congenital long-QT syndrome in a founder population.	In the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), there can be a marked phenotypic heterogeneity. Founder effects, by which many individuals share a mutation identical by descent, represent a powerful tool to further understand the underlying mechanisms and to predict the natural history of mutation-associated effects. We are investigating one such founder effect, originating in South Africa in approximately ad 1700 and segregating the same KCNQ1 mutation (A341V). The study population involved 320 subjects, 166 mutation carriers (MCs) and 154 noncarriers. When not taking beta-blocker therapy, MCs had a wide range of QTc values (406 to 676 ms), and 12% of individuals had a normal QTc (&lt; or =440 ms). A QTc &gt;500 ms was associated with increased risk for cardiac events (OR=4.22; 95% CI, 1.12 to 15.80; P=0.033). We also found that MCs with a heart rate &lt;73 bpm were at significantly lower risk (OR=0.23; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.86; P=0.035). This study also unexpectedly determined that KCNQ1-A341V is associated with greater risk than that reported for large databases of LQT1 patients: A341V MCs are more symptomatic by age 40 years (79% versus 30%) and become symptomatic earlier (7+/-4 versus 13+/-9 years, both P&lt;0.001). Accordingly, functional studies of KCNQ1-A341V in CHO cells stably expressing IKs were conducted and identified a dominant negative effect of the mutation on wild-type channels. KCNQ1-A341V is a mutation associated with an unusually severe phenotype, most likely caused by the dominant negative effect of the mutation. The availability of an extended kindred with a common mutation allowed us to identify heart rate, an autonomic marker, as a novel risk factor. 	Circulation	D016428 D052061 D013485 D013487

27450411	20160725	Study protocol, rationale and recruitment in a European multi-centre randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy and safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6?months in primary ciliary dyskinesia.	Clinical management of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) respiratory disease is currently based on improving mucociliary clearance and controlling respiratory infections, through the administration of antibiotics. Treatment practices in PCD are largely extrapolated from more common chronic respiratory disorders, particularly cystic fibrosis, but no randomized controlled trials (RCT) have ever evaluated efficacy and safety of any pharmacotherapeutics used in the treatment of PCD. Maintenance therapy, with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin, is currently widely used in chronic respiratory diseases including PCD. In addition to its antibacterial properties, azithromycin is considered to have beneficial anti-inflammatory and anti-quorum-sensing properties. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6?months on respiratory exacerbations in PCD. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of azithromycin on lung function, ventilation inhomogeneity, hearing impairment, and symptoms (respiratory, sinus, ears and hearing) measured on a PCD-specific health-related quality of life instrument, and to assess the safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy in PCD. The BESTCILIA trial is a European multi-centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. The intervention is tablets of azithromycin 250/500?mg according to body weight or placebo administered three times a week for 6?months. Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of PCD, age 7-50 years, are eligible for inclusion. Chronic pulmonary infections with Gram-negative bacteria or any recent occurrence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria are exclusion criteria. The planned number of subjects to be included is 125. The trial has been approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the participating institutions. We present a study protocol of an ongoing RCT, evaluating for the first time, the efficacy and safety of a pharmacotherapeutic treatment for patients with PCD. The RCT evaluates azithromycin maintenance therapy, a drug already commonly prescribed in other chronic respiratory disorders. Furthermore, the trial will utilize the Lung clearance index and new, PCD-specific quality of life instruments as outcome measures for PCD. Recruitment is hampered by frequent occurrence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, exacerbations at enrolment, and the patients' perception of disease severity and necessity of additional management and treatment during trial participation.

21563967	20110514	Transcript variants, expression, and polymorphisms of the pig prosaposin gene.	Prosaposin (PASP) is a sphingolipid hydrolysis protein that plays roles in both the nervous and reproduction systems. In this study, we cloned the pig PASP gene and studied its genomic organization, polymorphism, and expression pattern. Two PASP transcripts, TV1 (HQ245644) and TV2 (HQ245646), were identified in pig. TV1 was the complete transcript that encoded 527 amino acids, whereas TV2 was 9?bp shorter due to an exon 8 deletion. The pig PASP gene spanned over 34?kb in length on chromosome 14 (SSC14), and consisted of 15 exons and 14 introns. The pig PASP gene (TV1 and TV2) expressed predominantly in the cerebellum, lymphnode, pituitary, abdominal fat, hypothalamus, and cerebrum in both females and males. PASP TV1 expressed mainly in teh cerebrum, cerebellum, hypothalamus, pituitary, heart, subcutaneous fat, and foreleg muscle, while TV2 was expressed in the liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and lymphnode. In foreleg muscle, the predominant transcript was TV2 in males and TV1 in females. Some potential transcriptional elements were predicted in 5' flanking region (~3000?bp) of the PASP gene, and they were TATA boxes, RORE, Sp1, SRY, oct-1, Cdx A, and cap. Additionally, we identified 68 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 9 indels in the pig PASP gene, and three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (C77932320T or L15F; C77928094T or P191L; A77917401G or K522R) were nonsynonymous substitutions. These results provide useful information for future functional investigations of the pig PASP gene. 	DNA_Cell_Biol.	D016428 D013485
26057169	20150610	Characterization of two-step deglycosylation via oxidation by glycoside oxidoreductase and defining their subfamily.	Herein, we report a two-step deglycosylation mediated by the oxidation of glycoside which is different from traditional glycoside hydrolase (GH) mechanism. Previously, we reported a novel flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent glycoside oxidoreductase (FAD-GO) having deglycosylation activity. Various features of the reaction of FAD-GO such as including mechanism and catalytic residue and substrate specificity were studied. In addition, classification of novel FAD-GO subfamily was attempted. Deglycosylation of glycoside was performed spontaneously via oxidation of 3-OH of glycone moiety by FAD-GO mediated oxidation reaction. His493 residue was identified as a catalytic residue for the oxidation step. Interestingly, this enzyme has broad glycone and aglycon specificities. For the classification of FAD-GO enzyme subfamily, putative FAD-GOs were screened based on the FAD-GO from Rhizobium sp. GIN611 (gi 365822256) using BLAST search. The homologs of R. sp. GIN611 included the putative FAD-GOs from Stenotrophomonas strains, Sphingobacterium strains, Agrobacterium tumefaciens str. C58, and etc. All the cloned FAD-GOs from the three strains catalyzed the deglycosylation via enzymatic oxidation. Based on their substrate specificities, deglycosylation and oxidation activities to various ginsenosides, the FAD-GO subfamily members can be utilized as novel biocatalysts for the production of various aglycones.

25448583	20141203	Formulation, characterization and anti-malarial activity of homolipid-based artemether microparticles.	The anti-malarial activity of artemether is dependent on its bioavailability. The purpose of the research is to improve the solubility, bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of lipophilic artemether using homolipid-based microparticles. Irvingia fat was extracted from Irvingia gabonensis var. excelsa (Irvingia wombolu), and its lipid matrices (LM) with Phospholipon(?) 90G (P90G) were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). Solid lipid microparticles were formulated, characterized, filled and compressed into capsules and tablets, respectively, and drug release studied. In vivo anti-plasmodial activity of artemether SLMs was evaluated in mice. The crystallinity of the phyto-lipid reduced in the presence of P90G, which was integrated into the irvingia fat crystal lattice. SLM dispersions with 3:1 irvingia fat/P90G composition showed higher diffusion and permeability through dialysis membrane while lower proportion of P90G (9:1 LM) favored increased dissolution rate of artemether from capsules (p&lt;0.05). Significant increase (p&lt;0.05) in % plasmodial growth inhibition and reduced parasitemia were observed in mice administered with the SLM dispersions compared with the controls. Therefore, SLMs prepared with composite mixtures of a homolipid and P90G could be used to improve the solubility, dissolution, permeability, bioavailability and anti-malarial efficacy of artemether.

22512696	20120420	Potent aminocyclitol glucocerebrosidase inhibitors are subnanomolar pharmacological chaperones for treating gaucher disease.	Amino-myo-inositol derivatives have been found to be potent inhibitors of glucocerebrosidase (GCase), the ?-glucosidase enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease (GD). When tested using lymphoblasts derived from patients with GD homozygous for N370S or L444P mutations, the compounds enhanced GCase activity at very low concentrations. The most potent inhibitor, (1R,2S,3R,4S,5S,6R)-5-(nonylamino)-6-(nonyloxy)cyclohexane-1,2,3,4-tetraol had a K(i) of 1 nM using isolated enzyme and an IC(50) of 4.3 nM when assayed in human fibroblast cell culture. This aminocyclitol produced maximum increases of GCase activities of 90% in N370S lymphoblasts at 1 nM and 40% in L444P at 0.01 nM following a three-day incubation. In addition to inhibitory potency, this compound has the permeability, subcellular distribution, and cell metabolism characteristics that are important for use as a pharmacological chaperone. It is a remarkable finding that picomolar concentrations of aminocyclitols are sufficient to enhance activity in the L444P variant, which produces a severe neuronopathic form of GD without clinical treatment.

7341617	19811201	Nutrient digestibility and performance of pigs fed sorghums varying in tannin concentration.	Four sorghums, ranging widely in tannin content, and yellow corn were evaluated in two 5 x 5 Latin square digestion trials and a growth trial. All grains were grown in the same field under similar conditions. The sorgums and their tannin contents (milligrams of catechin/100 mg of dry matter, as determined by a modified vanillin-HCl method) were: Ga615, 3.40; NK300, 3.17; TAM680, .83, and G766-W, .88. Diets were supplemented with casein to provide .70 and .60% lysine in digestion trials 1 and 2, respectively. In trial 1, conducted with noncannulated, 25-kg pigs, digestibilities of dry matter, gross energy and N averaged for the low tannin sorghums (TAM680 and G766-W) were higher (P greater than .01) than the corresponding digestibilities averaged for the high tannin sorghums (Ga615 and NK300). N balance data indicated that utilization of absorbed N was not reduced in pigs fed the high tannin sorghums. Corn and the low tannin sorghums had similar digestibilities. In trial 2, conducted with 50-kg pigs fitted with T-cannulas at the terminal ileum, digestibilities of dry matter, gross energy, N and all amino acids again averaged higher (P greater than .01) for the low tannin sorghums than for the high tannin sorghums, whether measured at the end of the small intestine or over the total digestive tract. The one exception was methionine digestibilities at the terminal ileum, which did not differ between the high and low tannin sorghums. Among the amino acids, digestibilities of glycine, proline and histidine appeared to be the most depressed in the high tannin sorghums, as compared to the low tannin sorghums. Digestibilities of most nutrients were higher for NK300 than Ga615, suggesting a difference in type of tannin, or other compound, between grains. Corn and the low tannin sorghums, averaged together, had similar digestibilities for most nutrients. In the growth trial, 10 pigs, individually fed form 20 to 94 kg, received grain-soybean meal diets based on each grain except NK300. Gains were not affected by diet, but feed consumption was 9% higher (P greater than.05) and feed efficiency 10% (P greater than .01) poorer for pigs fed Ga615 than for those fed low tannin sorghums. Performance was similar (P greater than .10) for animals fed the low tannin sorghums and those fed corn. 	J._Anim._Sci.	D003160 D016428

25621824	20150127	Protein arginine deiminase 2 binds calcium in an ordered fashion: implications for inhibitor design.	Protein arginine deiminases (PADs) are calcium-dependent histone-modifying enzymes whose activity is dysregulated in inflammatory diseases and cancer. PAD2 functions as an Estrogen Receptor (ER) coactivator in breast cancer cells via the citrullination of histone tail arginine residues at ER binding sites. Although an attractive therapeutic target, the mechanisms that regulate PAD2 activity are largely unknown, especially the detailed role of how calcium facilitates enzyme activation. To gain insights into these regulatory processes, we determined the first structures of PAD2 (27 in total), and through calcium-titrations by X-ray crystallography, determined the order of binding and affinity for the six calcium ions that bind and activate this enzyme. These structures also identified several PAD2 regulatory elements, including a calcium switch that controls proper positioning of the catalytic cysteine residue, and a novel active site shielding mechanism. Additional biochemical and mass-spectrometry-based hydrogen/deuterium exchange studies support these structural findings. The identification of multiple intermediate calcium-bound structures along the PAD2 activation pathway provides critical insights that will aid the development of allosteric inhibitors targeting the PADs.

7814375	19950106	Stable expression of a truncated AT1A receptor in CHO-K1 cells. The carboxyl-terminal region directs agonist-induced internalization but not receptor signaling or desensitization.	Phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in the carboxyl-terminal region of many G-protein-coupled receptors directs the rapid uncoupling from signal transduction pathways. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, we have stably expressed a truncated mutant of the angiotensin II (AT1A) receptor devoid of the carboxyl-terminal 45 amino acids, encompassing 13 serine/threonine residues. One clone, designated TL314 to indicate truncation after leucine 314, expressed a single class of angiotensin II receptors with a dissociation constant of 1.08 nM and a receptor density of 560 fmol/mg of protein (approximately 75,000 receptors/cell). A nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP accelerated the angiotensin II-induced dissociation of [125I]angiotensin II from TL314 plasma membranes 3.6-fold, indicating G-protein coupling. In TL314 cells, angiotensin II stimulated the release of intracellular calcium and the induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, the level of which were comparable with the full-length AT1A receptor. The AII-stimulated calcium response was rapidly desensitized in both full-length and truncated AT1A receptors. Interestingly, angiotensin II-induced endocytosis of the truncated receptor was almost completely inhibited, suggesting that a recognition motif within the carboxyl-terminal 45 amino acids of the AT1A receptor promotes sequestration. Thus, truncation of the AT1A receptor after leucine 314 inhibits agonist-induced internalization without affecting the capacity of the expressed protein to adopt the correct conformation necessary for high affinity binding of angiotensin II, coupling to G-proteins, and activation of signal transduction pathways. The rapid desensitization and refractoriness of the angiotensin II-induced calcium transient in the TL314 cell line, in which putative carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites are absent, suggests that the mechanism of AT1A receptor desensitization differs from that of other prototypical G-protein-coupled receptors.

15623516	20041230	Spectral differentiation of blue opsins between phylogenetically close but ecologically distant goldfish and zebrafish.	Zebrafish and goldfish are both diurnal freshwater fish species belonging to the same family, Cyprinidae, but their visual ecological surroundings considerably differ. Zebrafish are surface swimmers in conditions of broad and shortwave-dominated background spectra and goldfish are generalized swimmers whose light environment extends to a depth of elevated short wavelength absorbance with turbidity. The peak absorption spectrum (lambdamax) of the zebrafish blue (SWS2) visual pigment is consistently shifted to short wavelength (416 nm) compared with that of the goldfish SWS2 (443 nm). Among the amino acid differences between the two pigments, only one (alanine in zebrafish and serine in goldfish at residue 94) was previously known to cause a difference in absorption spectrum (14-nm lambdamax shift in newt SWS2). In this study, we reconstructed the ancestral SWS2 pigment of the two species by applying likelihood-based Bayesian statistics and performing site-directed mutagenesis. The reconstituted ancestral photopigment had a lambdamax of 430 nm, indicating that zebrafish and goldfish achieved short wavelength (-14 nm) and long wavelength (+13 nm) spectral shifts, respectively, from the ancestor. Unexpectedly, the S94A mutation resulted in only a -3-nm spectral shift when introduced into the goldfish SWS2 pigment. Nearly half of the long wavelength shift toward the goldfish pigment was achieved instead by T116L (6 nm). The S295C mutation toward zebrafish SWS2 contributed to creating a ridge of absorbance around 400 nm and broadening its spectral sensitivity in the short wavelength direction. These results indicate that the evolutionary engineering approach is very effective in deciphering the process of functional divergence of visual pigments. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
20307995	20100324	The obese phenotype-inducing N82K mutation in human leptin disrupts receptor-binding and biological activity.	A novel homozygous mutation of the leptin gene was recently reported in an Egyptian child and his sister with severe early onset obesity. This mutation results from the substitution of asparagine (AAC) by lysine (AAA) at codon 103 of a non-mature (signal peptide-containing) leptin and corresponds to the N82K mutation in the mature protein. The patient had very low serum leptin levels, raising the question of whether the obese phenotype resulted from low leptin levels or from its lower intrinsic activity. To answer this question, we characterized the functional consequences of the N82K mutation. Wild-type (WT) human leptin was mutated accordingly, expressed in Escherichia coli at high yield, purified to homogeneity as a monomer and compared to WT human leptin prepared by the same methodology. Circular dichroism analysis of the mutated leptin indicated proper refolding and a secondary structure identical to that of the WT human leptin. In contrast to WT human leptin, the N82K mutant did not form a detectable complex with human leptin-binding domain (hLBD) and its binding capacity to hLBD assessed in a nonradioactive receptor-binding assay was at least 500-fold lower than that of WT human leptin. The biological activity of the N82K mutant, tested in two cell bioassays, was reduced by more than three orders of magnitude relative to WT human leptin. Therefore, though the present report does not explain the reason for the low circulating leptin levels it definitely documents that the reported obese phenotype originates not only from low serum leptin levels but also from the N82K mutant's almost total lack of intrinsic leptin activity.

24729084	20140415	Analyzing 395,793 samples shows significant association between rs999737 polymorphism and breast cancer.	Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted and reported the association between rs999737 polymorphism at 14q24.1 (RAD51L1) and breast cancer risk. Following studies investigated rs999737 polymorphism in European and Asian populations. However, some of these studies reported weak and no significant association. Here, we reevaluated this association using large-scale samples from previous 11 studies (n=395,793; 162,261 cases and 233,532 controls) from the PubMed database. We evaluated the genetic heterogeneity among the selected studies. The pooled odds ratio (OR) is calculated by the fixed effect model. All statistical tests for heterogeneity and meta-analysis were computed using R package. We did not identify significant heterogeneity among the included studies using the allele model (P=0.1314 and I (2)=33.4 %). We observed significant association between rs999737 and breast cancer using the allele model (P=2.47E?-?35, OR=0.92, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.91-0.93). Our analysis further supports previous findings that the rs999737 polymorphism contributes to breast cancer susceptibility. We believe that our finding will be very useful for future genetic studies in breast cancer. 	Tumour_Biol.	D016428
25893977	20150421	Phylogeographical Structure in Mitochondrial DNA of Legume Pod Borer (Maruca vitrata) Population in Tropical Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.	This study was undertaken to assess the genetic diversity and host plant races of M. vitrata population in South and Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene was used to understand the phylogenetic relationship of geographically different M. vitrata population, but previous studies did not include population from Southeast Asia, the probable center of origin for Maruca, and from east Africa. Extensive sampling was done from different host plant species in target countries. Reference populations from Oceania and Latin America were used. An amplicon of 658 bp was produced by polymerase chain reaction, and 64 haplotypes were identified in 686 M. vitrata individuals. Phylogenetic analysis showed no difference among the M. vitrata population from different host plants. However, the results suggested that M. vitrata has formed two putative subspecies (which cannot be differentiated based on morphological characters) in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, as indicated by the high pairwise FST values (0.44-0.85). The extremely high FST values (? 0.93) of Maruca population in Latin America and Oceania compared to Asian and African population seem to indicate a different species. On the continental or larger geographical region basis, the genetic differentiation is significantly correlated with the geographical distance. In addition, two putative species of Maruca, including M. vitrata occur in Australia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. The negative Tajima's D and Fu's FS values showed the recent demographic expansion of Maruca population. The haplotype network and Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery analyses confirmed the results of phylogenetic analysis. Thus, this study confirmed the presence of three putative Maruca species, including one in Latin America, one in Oceania (including Indonesia) and M. vitrata in Asia, Africa and Oceania. Hence, the genetic differences in Maruca population should be carefully considered while designing the pest management strategies in different regions. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
27242844	20160601	Gibberellin Deficiency Confers Both Lodging and Drought Tolerance in Small Cereals.	Tef [Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter] and finger millet [Eleusine coracana Gaertn] are staple cereal crops in Africa and Asia with several desirable agronomic and nutritional properties. Tef is becoming a life-style crop as it is gluten-free while finger millet has a low glycemic index which makes it an ideal food for diabetic patients. However, both tef and finger millet have extremely low grain yields mainly due to moisture scarcity and susceptibility of the plants to lodging. In this study, the effects of gibberellic acid (GA) inhibitors particularly paclobutrazol (PBZ) on diverse physiological and yield-related parameters were investigated and compared to GA mutants in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The application of PBZ to tef and finger millet significantly reduced the plant height and increased lodging tolerance. Remarkably, PBZ also enhanced the tolerance of both tef and finger millet to moisture deficit. Under moisture scarcity, tef plants treated with PBZ did not exhibit drought-related symptoms and their stomatal conductance was unaltered, leading to higher shoot biomass and grain yield. Semi-dwarf rice mutants altered in GA biosynthesis, were also shown to have improved tolerance to dehydration. The combination of traits (drought tolerance, lodging tolerance and increased yield) that we found in plants with altered GA pathway is of importance to breeders who would otherwise rely on extensive crossing to introgress each trait individually. The key role played by PBZ in the tolerance to both lodging and drought calls for further studies using mutants in the GA biosynthesis pathway in order to obtain candidate lines which can be incorporated into crop-breeding programs to create lodging tolerant and climate-smart crops.

20690080	20100807	Citrullinemia type I: molecular screening of the ASS1 gene by exonic sequencing and targeted mutation analysis.	We developed a mutation-screening protocol for the ASS1 gene in order to guide clinical management of neonates with elevated citrulline detected during routine newborn screening. An exon-based amplification and sequencing method was designed and successfully applied to patients to identify disease-associated mutations. The sequencing-based method was applied to three patients with mild or asymptomatic clinical courses. Identification of a homozygous mutation in these patients, c.787G&gt;A (p.Val263Met), led to the development of a tetra-primer ARMS-PCR method that successfully detected the mutation in DNA extracted from blood or from Guthrie card spots.

11707265	20011115	Thr40 and Met122 are new partial loss-of-function natural mutations of the human melanocortin 1 receptor.	Activation by melanocortins of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), expressed in epidermal melanocytes, stimulates melanogenesis. Human MC1R gene loss-of-function mutations are associated with fair skin, poor tanning and increased skin cancer risk. We identified two natural alleles: Ile40Thr, probably associated with skin types I-II, and Val122Met. Val122Met bound [(125)I][Nle(4), D-Phe(7)]-alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone with lower affinity than the wild-type. Dose-response curves of cAMP accumulation were right-shifted for both forms. The Val122Met form failed to achieve maximal cAMP responses comparable to the wild-type or Ile40Thr receptors. Thus, the Ile40Thr and Val122Met variants are partial loss-of-function natural mutations of MC1R. 	FEBS_Lett.	D016428 D013485
11791712	20020117	Immunochemical and mutational analyses of P-type ATPase Spf1p involved in the yeast secretory pathway.	The yeast SPF1 gene encodes a novel P-type ATPase, the substrate of which specificity has not been identified. It is required for sensitivity to SMKT, a killer toxin produced by the halotolerant yeast Pichia farinosa. To investigate the function of Spf1p, Asp487, the putative phosphorylation site of Spf1p, was replaced by Asn. Expression of the altered SPF1, with Asp487 replaced by Asn, did not suppress the SMKT-resistant phenotype of spf1 mutants, suggesting that the catalytic activity of this ATPase is required for acquisition of sensitivity to SMKT. Subcellular fractionation experiments indicated that the fractionation pattern of Spf1p was similar to that of an early Golgi protein, Och1p. Cells lacking Spf1p had an abnormal fractionation pattern of Sec12p. The spf1 disruptant also showed increased expression of Kar2p and sensitivity to tunicamycin. The glycosylation-defective phenotype and possible role of Spf1p in the secretory pathway are discussed. 	Biosci._Biotechnol._Biochem.	D016428 D013485
20724649	20100821	Prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance in nondiabetic U.S. adults.	To estimate the rates of prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). A representative sample of the U.S. population (the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES]) from 2005-2006 including 1,547 nondiabetic adults (&gt;18 years of age) without a history of myocardial infarction was assessed to determine the proportion of adults who met the criteria for IFG/IGT, and the proportion of IFG/IGT subjects who: 1) reported receiving a diagnosis from their physicians; 2) were prescribed lifestyle modification or an antihyperglycemic agent; and 3) were currently on therapy. We used multivariable regression analysis to identify predictors of diagnosis and treatment. Of the 1,547 subjects, 34.6% (CI 30.3-38.9%) had pre-diabetes; 19.4% had IFG only; 5.4% had IGT only, and 9.8% had both IFG and IGT. Only 4.8% of those with pre-diabetes reported having received a formal diagnosis from their physicians. No subjects with pre-diabetes received oral antihyperglycemics, and the rates of recommendation for exercise or diet were 31.7% and 33.5%, respectively. Among the 47.7% pre-diabetic subjects who exercised, 49.4% reported exercising for at least 30 min daily. Three years after a major clinical trial demonstrated that interventions could greatly reduce progression from IFG/IGT to type 2 diabetes, the majority of the U.S. population with IFG/IGT was undiagnosed and untreated with interventions. Whether this is due to physicians being unaware of the evidence, unconvinced by the evidence, or clinical inertia is unclear. 	Diabetes_Care	D016428 D052061 D013485
11851893	20020220	Deletion of the cytoplasmatic domain of BP180/collagen XVII causes a phenotype with predominant features of epidermolysis bullosa simplex.	BP180/collagen XVII is a hemidesmosomal transmembrane molecule serving as cell-surface receptor. Mutations in its gene cause junctional epidermolysis bullosa. Here, we report a patient with mutations in the gene for BP180/collagen XVII, COL17A1, but predominant phenotypic features of epidermolysis bullosa simplex. At birth, the proband presented with bullous lesions on the trunk, face, and hands. Ultrastructurally, hemidesmosomes were fairly normal, but the attachment of intermediate filaments with the hemidesmosomal plaques appeared to be impaired. Blister formation demonstrated both intraepidermal and junctional cleavage. Immunofluorescence staining with antibodies to keratins, several hemidesmosomal proteins, and the extracellular domain of BP180/collagen XVII showed normal staining patterns, whereas an antibody against the intracellular domain of BP180/collagen XVII yielded a negative immunofluorescence signal. Analysis of BP180/collagen XVII cDNA revealed a 1172 bp deletion corresponding to an in-frame deletion from Ile-18 to Asn-407 from the intracellular domain of the polypeptide. Mutation analysis of the COL17A1 gene disclosed a paternal nonsense mutation, R1226X, and a large maternal genomic deletion extending from intron 2 to intron 15, but no mutations in basal keratin genes. These findings underline the functional importance of the intracellular BP180/collagen XVII domain for the interaction of hemidesmosomes with keratin intermediate filaments and for the spatial stability of basal keratinocytes, and provide a functional explanation for the epidermolysis-bullosa- simplex-like phenotype. Further, the data demonstrate that defects in a given gene can cause unexpected phenotypes of epidermolysis bullosa categories, depending on the function of the affected protein domain.

16624273	20060421	Oral phenylalanine loading test for the diagnosis of dominant guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1 deficiency.	To evaluate the usefulness of Phe loading test in patients for the diagnosis of guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1 deficiency (GTPCH). We studied one family composed of 13 members harbouring the Q89X mutation in the GTPCH gene, a non-related pediatric patient with GTPCH deficiency and 8 pediatric controls. 100 mg/kg of L-phenylalanine was orally administered, and blood spot samples were taken at baselines 1, 2, 4 and 6 h post-load. Two out of 7 pediatric patients showed a phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio higher than the previously reported cut-off value of 5.25 at 4 h, while 6 of the 7 adult patients showed a higher value. The only adult patient with a phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio below 5.25 at 4 h was asymptomatic. A cut-off value of 5.25 seems reliable for interpreting Phe loading test in adult patients with GTPCH deficiency, although a lower value should be established for pediatric patients. 	Clin._Biochem.

11402448	20010613	[Association analysis of attempted suicide and 5-HT2A receptor gene].	To examine the relationship of attempted suicide with A-1438G and T102C polymorphisms of 5-HT2A receptor gene. Genotypes and allele frequencies of A-1438G and T102C polymorphisms of 5-HT2A receptor gene in 149 attempted suicides and 190 normal controls were examined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism(PCR-RFLP). No differences in genotypes and allele frequencies of A-1438G and T102C polymorphisms of 5-HT2A receptor gene were observed between attempted suicides and the controls. However, an association between male attempted suicides and genotype(GG) of A-1438G polymorphism was found. These results suggested that liability to suicide behavior might be associated with A-1438G polymorpyhism of 5-HT2A receptor gene in male subjects.

19502258	20090609	Renin-angiotensin system polymorphisms and the association between use of angiotensin II receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the risk of diabetes.	We assessed the influence of genetic polymorphisms in the renin-angiotensin system on the risk of diabetes associated with the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. We performed a matched case-control study among antihypertensive drug users. Pharmacy records and questionnaires were used to ascertain incident diabetes (cases), antihypertensive drug use, and risk factors. Controls did not (yet) have diabetes.We genotyped ACE (G4656C, which is in complete linkage disequilibrium with the ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism), angiotensinogen (M235T), and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (A1166C). Among 495 cases of incident diabetes and 2,624 controls, homozygous 1166C carriers of angiotensin II type 1 receptor who used angiotensin II receptor blockers had an increased risk of diabetes compared to 1166A carriers (interaction odds ratio 5.3 [95% confidence interval: 1.8-16.1]). Homozygous ACE GG subjects who used ACE inhibitors &gt;or= 1 defined daily dose/day had a higher risk of diabetes compared to subjects with the ACE C allele (interaction odds ratio 2.3 [95% confidence interval: 1.2-4.5]). Angiotensin II receptor blockers increase the occurrence of diabetes in homozygous 1166C carriers of angiotensin II type 1 receptor, but not in 1166A carriers. ACE inhibitors at doses &gt;or= 1 defined daily dose/day increase the risk of diabetes among homozygous ACE GG carriers, but not in 4656C carriers.

27279909	20160610	Redox Regulation of Stem-like Cells Though the CD44v-xCT Axis in Colorectal Cancer: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Implications.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common neoplastic disease and a frequent cause of death. Drug resistance is a major challenge to CRC treatment and stem-like side-population (SP) cells may play a key role in this resistance. Although it has been recognized that cancer stem cells may be affected by redox status, the underlying mechanisms for this effect and the roles of celllular redox adaptation and antioxidant capacity in CRC remain elusive. Our study shows that CRC SP cells are highly dependent on cellular GSH to maintain ROS levels below those of non-SP cells. Exposing CRC cells to H2O2 produced a significant decrease in the percentage of SP cells, which was rescued by adding N-acetylcysteine. Mechanistically, CD44v interacts with and stabilizes xCT and thereby promotes the uptake of cysteine for GSH synthesis and stimulates SP cell enrichment. Additionally, miR-1297 levels were inversely correlated with the expression of xCT; thus, reduced miR-1297 contributes to SP cell enrichment in CRC tumors, which results in tumor aggressiveness and poor clinical outcomes. Importantly, redox modification by PEITC significantly reduces CRC SP cells in vitro and impairs tumors growth in vivo. The combination of 5FU and PEITC led to synergistic cytotoxic effects against CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our data suggest that a GSH-mediated reduction in cellular ROS levels is an essential regulator of CRC SP cells mediated by the CD44v-xCT axis, and disrupting the redox status may eliminate the chemotherapy-resistant CRC SP cells with potentially significant benefits for cancer treatment.

17298885	20070215	GSTM1 and TNF-alpha gene polymorphisms and relations between blood lead and inflammatory markers in a non-occupational population.	Inflammation is known to be an important underlying condition in the development of a variety of diseases. To investigate whether blood lead induces inflammatory reactions in non-occupationally exposed adults and the effects of genetic susceptibility associated with GSTM1 and TNF-alpha gene polymorphisms on this inflammatory response, we measured blood lead levels in 300 healthy university students. Total serum TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels and WBC counts were determined to evaluate the inflammatory response. Allelic loss of GSTM1 and the TNF-alpha-308 G&gt;A polymorphism were determined by PCR and RFLP. Positive relations between blood lead and three inflammation biomarkers were shown in male subjects with blood lead &gt; or =2.51microg/dl (median value) (TNF-alpha, p=0.015; IL-6, p=0.082; and WBC, p=0.044). However, subgroup analysis by genotype showed an effect of blood lead on the three biomarkers only in individuals with the GSTM1 null (TNF-alpha, p=0.020; IL-6, p=0.096; and WBC, p=0.017) or TNF-alpha GG (TNF-alpha, p=0.017; IL-6, p=0.088; and WBC, p=0.095) genotype, and not in individuals with GSTM1 present (all three inflammatory biomarkers, p&gt;0.1) or the TNF-alpha GA or AA (all three biomarkers, p&gt;0.1) genotype. These results suggest that blood lead affects the inflammatory response and that GSTM1 and TNF-alpha gene polymorphisms are genetic factors associated with lead-induced inflammatory response.

27855782	20161119	C. elegans</i>forward motor state.	Neuromodulators shape neural circuit dynamics. Combining electron microscopy, genetics, transcriptome profiling, calcium imaging, and optogenetics, we discovered a peptidergic neuron that modulatesC. elegansmotor circuit dynamics. The Six/SO-family homeobox transcription factor UNC-39 governs lineage-specific neurogenesis to give rise to a neuron RID. RID bears the anatomic hallmarks of a specialized endocrine neuron: it harbors near-exclusive dense core vesicles that cluster periodically along the axon, and expresses multiple neuropeptides, including the FMRF-amide-related FLP-14. RID activity increases during forward movement. Ablating RID reduces the sustainability of forward movement, a phenotype partially recapitulated by removing FLP-14. Optogenetic depolarization of RID prolongs forward movement, an effect reduced in the absence of FLP-14. Together, these results establish the role of a neuroendocrine cell RID in sustaining a specific behavioral state inC. elegans. 	Elife	D016428 D013485 D052061
24365176	20131225	Common variants in the complement factor H gene confer genetic susceptibility to central serous chorioretinopathy.	To investigate whether complement factor H (CFH) gene DNA variants are associated with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR). Cross-sectional study. A case-control group of 140 CSCR subjects and 2 different control groups: 934 population-based controls and 335 hospital-based controls. Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CFH (rs3753394, rs800292, rs2284664, rs1329428, and rs106548) were evaluated for association with CSCR in 2 separate association analyses comparing CSCR subjects with 2 different control groups. Genotyping was performed using TaqMan technology (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Allele and haplotype frequencies of the 5 variants in the CFH region. Highly statistically significant associations with CSCR were found for the 5 SNPs. The strongest association was observed with rs1329428 (allelic P = 6.44?10(-6); odds ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39-2.31, cases vs. population-based controls), which accounted for 35.5% of the population-attributable fraction for CSCR. Consistent with the analysis, rs1329428 showed the strongest disease association (allelic P = 1.00?10(-5); odds ratio, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.42-2.50) in comparing cases with hospital-based controls. The second most strongly associated SNP, rs1065489, was correlated highly with the most strongly associated SNP, rs1329428 (r(2) = 0.77), and their effects could not be distinguished statistically from each other. A conditional logistic regression analysis revealed that the 2 highly correlated SNPs, rs1329428 and rs1065489, account for the association signals detected at the CFH locus. We identified a novel association between CSCR and common CFH polymorphisms. Our findings support the involvement of CFH in the pathogenesis of CSCR; exploration of the role of CFH could yield important insights into the biological mechanisms underlying CSCR. Our identification of common CFH variants as susceptibility elements for CSCR will open new avenues for research, leading to a better understanding of CSCR pathogenesis and ultimately to the development of improved therapeutic approaches.

1609808	19920701	Nonsense-codon mutations of the ornithine aminotransferase gene with decreased levels of mutant mRNA in gyrate atrophy.	A generalized deficiency of the mitochondrial matrix enzyme ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) is the inborn error in gyrate atrophy (GA), an autosomal recessive degenerative disease of the retina and choroid of the eye. Mutations in the OAT gene show a high degree of molecular heterogeneity in GA, reflecting the genetic heterogeneity in this disease. Using the combined techniques of PCR, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and direct sequencing, we have identified three nonsense-codon mutations and one nonsense codon-generating mutation of the OAT gene in GA pedigrees. Three of them are single-base substitutions, and one is a 2-bp deletion resulting in a reading frameshift. A nonsense codon created at position 79 (TGA) by a frameshift and nonsense mutations at codons 209 (TAT----TAA) and 299 (TAC----TAG) result in abnormally low levels of OAT mRNA in the patient's skin fibroblasts. A nonsense mutation at codon 426 (CGA----TGA) in the last exon, however, has little effect on the mRNA level. Thus, the mRNA level can be reduced by nonsense-codon mutations, but the position of the mutation may be important, with earlier premature-translation termination having a greater effect than a later mutation.

22754762	20120704	Association of a functional Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2 genotype with specific immune responses.	Two frequent single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) are present in the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2 (IDO2) gene that influence its enzymatic activity. Thus, one SNP (R248W) is associated with a reduction in IDO2 catalytic activity, whereas the other SNP (Y359stop) generates a premature stop codon abolishing activity completely. In the present study, we describe the presence of a specific cellular immune response in the periphery which correlated with the functional status of the IDO2 protein. Hence, the induction of IDO2-specific T cells in peripheral blood requires the presence of a functional IDO2 protein and, consequently, is restricted to individuals that are not homozygous for the stop codon. Furthermore, we detected stronger T-cell responses in donors with the homozygous Y wild type at position 359 when compared with the heterozygous genotype. Interestingly, we found a higher number of immune responses against IDO2 in patients homozygous for the 248W giving reduction in IDO2 activity compared with the 248R. Hence, spontaneous immune responses against IDO2 seem to be correlated with reduced enzymatic activity of IDO2. The patient IDO2 genotype may well influence the outcome of IDO2-based anti-cancer vaccination. 	Oncoimmunology	D016428

The genotyping assay includes the amplification of loci of interest and further allele-specific hybridization of the fluorescent labeled amplicons with oligonucleotides immobilized on a biochip. Based on the results of genotyping of 166 patients and 128 controls APOE epsilon4 allele was found to be significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease susceptibility (OR = 2.275, 95% CI = 1.045-4.954,p = 0.034). Additionally, protective effects for the APOE epsilon2 allele and CLUT-allele (rs11136000) were observed (OR = 0.215, 95% CI = 0.090-0.516, p = 0.001 and OR = 0.679, 95% CI = 0.47-0.99, p = 0.042, respectively).

25964300	20150513	mRNA transfection of a novel TAL effector nuclease (TALEN) facilitates efficient knockout of HIV co-receptor CCR5.	Homozygosity for a natural deletion variant of the HIV-coreceptor molecule CCR5, CCR5?32, confers resistance toward HIV infection. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation from a CCR5?32-homozygous donor has resulted in the first cure from HIV ('Berlin patient'). Based thereon, genetic disruption of CCR5 using designer nucleases was proposed as a promising HIV gene-therapy approach. Here we introduce a novel TAL-effector nuclease, CCR5-Uco-TALEN that can be efficiently delivered into T cells by mRNA electroporation, a gentle and truly transient gene-transfer technique. CCR5-Uco-TALEN mediated high-rate CCR5 knockout (&gt;90% in PM1 and &gt;50% in primary T cells) combined with low off-target activity, as assessed by flow cytometry, next-generation sequencing and a newly devised, very convenient gene-editing frequency digital-PCR (GEF-dPCR). GEF-dPCR facilitates simultaneous detection of wild-type and gene-edited alleles with remarkable sensitivity and accuracy as shown for the CCR5 on-target and CCR2 off-target loci. CCR5-edited cells were protected from infection with HIV-derived lentiviral vectors, but also with the wild-type CCR5-tropic HIV-1BaL strain. Long-term exposure to HIV-1BaL resulted in almost complete suppression of viral replication and selection of CCR5-gene edited T cells. In conclusion, we have developed a novel TALEN for the targeted, high-efficiency knockout of CCR5 and a useful dPCR-based gene-editing detection method. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D013485
26327553	20150902	CK-MM Polymorphism is Associated With Physical Fitness Test Scores in Military Recruits.	Muscle-specific creatine kinase is thought to play an integral role in maintaining energy homeostasis by providing a supply of creatine phosphate. The genetic variant, rs8111989, contributes to individual differences in physical performance, and thus the purpose of this study was to determine if rs8111989 variant is predictive of Physical Fitness Test (PFT) scores in male, military infantry recruits. DNA was extracted from whole blood, and genotyping was performed in 176 Marines. Relationships between PFT measures (run, sit-ups, and pull-ups) and genotype were determined. Participants with 2 copies of the T allele for rs8111989 variant had higher PFT scores for run time, pull-ups, and total PFT score. Specifically, participants with 2 copies of the TT allele (variant) (n = 97) demonstrated an overall higher total PFT score as compared with those with one copy of the C allele (n = 79) (TT: 250 ? 31 vs. 238 ? 31; p = 0.02), run score (TT: 82 ? 10 vs. 78 ? 11; p = 0.04) and pull-up score (TT: 78 ? 11 vs. 65 ? 21; p = 0.04) or those with the CC/CT genotype. These results demonstrate an association between physical performance measures and genetic variation in the muscle-specific creatine kinase gene (rs8111989). 	Mil_Med	D016428 D052061 D013486
24225424	20131115	Preferential scattering by interfacial charged defects for enhanced thermoelectric performance in few-layered n-type Bi2Te3.	Over the past two decades several nano-structuring methods have helped improve the figure of merit (ZT) in the state-of-the art bulk thermoelectric materials. While these methods could enhance the thermoelectric performance of p-type Bi2Te3, it was frustrating to researchers that they proved ineffective for n-type Bi2Te3 due to the inevitable deterioration of its thermoelectric properties in the basal plane. Here, we describe a novel chemical-exfoliation spark-plasma-sintering (CE-SPS) nano-structuring process, which transforms the microstructure of n-type Bi2Te3 in an extraordinary manner without compromising its basal plane properties. The CE-SPS processing leads to preferential scattering of electrons at charged grain boundaries, and thereby increases the electrical conductivity despite the presence of numerous grain boundaries, and mitigates the bipolar effect via band occupancy optimization leading to an upshift (by ~ 100 K) and stabilization of the ZT peak over a broad temperature range of ~ 150 K.

17594509	20070628	Comparative analysis of transposed element insertion within human and mouse genomes reveals Alu's unique role in shaping the human transcriptome.	Transposed elements (TEs) have a substantial impact on mammalian evolution and are involved in numerous genetic diseases. We compared the impact of TEs on the human transcriptome and the mouse transcriptome. We compiled a dataset of all TEs in the human and mouse genomes, identifying 3,932,058 and 3,122,416 TEs, respectively. We than extracted TEs located within human and mouse genes and, surprisingly, we found that 60% of TEs in both human and mouse are located in intronic sequences, even though introns comprise only 24% of the human genome. All TE families in both human and mouse can exonize. TE families that are shared between human and mouse exhibit the same percentage of TE exonization in the two species, but the exonization level of Alu, a primate-specific retroelement, is significantly greater than that of other TEs within the human genome, leading to a higher level of TE exonization in human than in mouse (1,824 exons compared with 506 exons, respectively). We detected a primate-specific mechanism for intron gain, in which Alu insertion into an exon creates a new intron located in the 3' untranslated region (termed 'intronization'). Finally, the insertion of TEs into the first and last exons of a gene is more frequent in human than in mouse, leading to longer exons in human. Our findings reveal many effects of TEs on these two transcriptomes. These effects are substantially greater in human than in mouse, which is due to the presence of Alu elements in human.

22438876	20120323	Oligomeric status and nucleotide binding properties of the plastid ATP/ADP transporter 1: toward a molecular understanding of the transport mechanism.	Chloroplast ATP/ADP transporters are essential to energy homeostasis in plant cells. However, their molecular mechanism remains poorly understood, primarily due to the difficulty of producing and purifying functional recombinant forms of these transporters. In this work, we describe an expression and purification protocol providing good yields and efficient solubilization of NTT1 protein from Arabidopsis thaliana. By biochemical and biophysical analyses, we identified the best detergent for solubilization and purification of functional proteins, LAPAO. Purified NTT1 was found to accumulate as two independent pools of well folded, stable monomers and dimers. ATP and ADP binding properties were determined, and Pi, a co-substrate of ADP, was confirmed to be essential for nucleotide steady-state transport. Nucleotide binding studies and analysis of NTT1 mutants lead us to suggest the existence of two distinct and probably inter-dependent binding sites. Finally, fusion and deletion experiments demonstrated that the C-terminus of NTT1 is not essential for multimerization, but probably plays a regulatory role, controlling the nucleotide exchange rate.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a classic antibody-mediated systemic autoimmune disease characterised by the development of autoantibodies to ubiquitous self-antigens (such as antinuclear antibodies and antidouble-stranded DNA antibodies) and widespread deposition of immune complexes in affected tissues. Deposition of immune complexes in the kidney results in glomerular damage and occurs in all forms of lupus nephritis. The development of nephritis carries a poor prognosis and high risk of developing end-stage renal failure despite recent therapeutic advances. Here we review the role of DNA-anti-DNA immune complexes in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis and possible new treatment strategies aimed at their control. 	Int_J_Nephrol_Renovasc_Dis	D016428
22880005	20120811	Adaptive capacity of the habitat modifying sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii to ocean warming and ocean acidification: performance of early embryos.	Predicting effects of rapid climate change on populations depends on measuring the effects of climate stressors on performance, and potential for adaptation. Adaptation to stressful climatic conditions requires heritable genetic variance for stress tolerance present in populations. We quantified genetic variation in tolerance of early development of the ecologically important sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii to near-future (2100) ocean conditions projected for the southeast Australian global change hot spot. Multiple dam-sire crosses were used to quantify the interactive effects of warming (+2-4 ?C) and acidification (-0.3-0.5 pH units) across twenty-seven family lines. Acidification, but not temperature, decreased the percentage of cleavage stage embryos. In contrast, temperature, but not acidification decreased the percentage of gastrulation. Cleavage success in response to both stressors was strongly affected by sire identity. Sire and dam identity significantly affected gastrulation and both interacted with temperature to determine developmental success. Positive genetic correlations for gastrulation indicated that genotypes that did well at lower pH also did well in higher temperatures. Significant genotype (sire) by environment interactions for both stressors at gastrulation indicated the presence of heritable variation in thermal tolerance and the ability of embryos to respond to changing environments. The significant influence of dam may be due to maternal provisioning (maternal genotype or environment) and/or offspring genotype. It appears that early development in this ecologically important sea urchin is not constrained in adapting to the multiple stressors of ocean warming and acidification. The presence of tolerant genotypes indicates the potential to adapt to concurrent warming and acidification, contributing to the resilience of C. rodgersii in a changing ocean.

16212814	20051011	ERCC1 and ERCC2 polymorphisms and adult glioma.	ERCC2 and ERCC1 are important in DNA nucleotide excision repair and lie on chromosome 19q13.3 near a putative glioma suppressor region. We genotyped constitutive variants ERCC1 C8092A and ERCC2 K751Q and R156R in approximately 450 adults with glioma and 500 controls from two independent population-based series, uniformly reviewed patients' tumors to determine histopathologic category, and determined a variety of tumor markers among astrocytic tumors. Odds ratios (ORs) for glioblastoma for those carrying two ERCC1 A alleles versus none or one were 1.67 in series 1 and 1.64 in series 2, which yielded a combined OR of 1.67 (95% CI, 0.93-3.02; P = 0.09), adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, and series. Odds ratios for the ERCC2 variants were not consistently elevated or reduced for the two series in all cases versus controls. However, among whites, for those with ERCC2 K751Q genotype QQ versus QK/KK, the OR for nonglioblastoma histologies versus controls was 1.82 (95% CI, 0.97-3.44; P = 0.06). Also, among whites, glioma patients were significantly more likely than controls to be homozygous for variants in both ERCC1 C8092A and ERCC2 K751Q (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.1-9.3). Given the numbers of comparisons made, these findings could be due to chance. However, the results might warrant clarification in additional series in conjunction with the nearby putative glioma suppressor genes (GLTSCR1 and GLTSCR2).

20949087	20101016	Strand transfer and elongation of HIV-1 reverse transcription is facilitated by cell factors in vitro.	Recent work suggests a role for multiple host factors in facilitating HIV-1 reverse transcription. Previously, we identified a cellular activity which increases the efficiency of HIV-1 reverse transcription in vitro. Here, we describe aspects of the activity which shed light on its function. The cellular factor did not affect synthesis of strong-stop DNA but did improve downstream DNA synthesis. The stimulatory activity was isolated by gel filtration in a single fraction of the exclusion volume. Velocity-gradient purified HIV-1, which was free of detectable RNase activity, showed poor reverse transcription efficiency but was strongly stimulated by partially purified cell proteins. Hence, the cell factor(s) did not inactivate an RNase activity that might degrade the viral genomic RNA and block completion of reverse transcription. Instead, the cell factor(s) enhanced first strand transfer and synthesis of late reverse transcription suggesting it stabilized the reverse transcription complex. The factor did not affect lysis of HIV-1 by Triton X-100 in the endogenous reverse transcription (ERT) system, and ERT reactions with HIV-1 containing capsid mutations, which varied the biochemical stability of viral core structures and impeded reverse transcription in cells, showed no difference in the ability to be stimulated by the cell factor(s) suggesting a lack of involvement of the capsid in the in vitro assay. In addition, reverse transcription products were found to be resistant to exogenous DNase I activity when the active fraction was present in the ERT assay. These results indicate that the cell factor(s) may improve reverse transcription by facilitating DNA strand transfer and DNA synthesis. It also had a protective function for the reverse transcription products, but it is unclear if this is related to improved DNA synthesis. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
12138104	20020726	Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide activates the Raf-Mek1/2-ERK1/2 module via a cyclic AMP/cAMP-dependent protein kinase/Rap1-mediated pathway.	The gastrointestinal hormone, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), is one of the most important regulators of insulin secretion following ingestion of a meal. GIP stimulates insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta-cell via its G protein-coupled receptor activation of adenylyl cyclase and other signal transduction pathways, but there is little known regarding subsequent protein kinase pathways that are activated. A screening technique was used to determine the relative abundance of 75 protein kinases in CHO-K1 cells expressing the GIP receptor and in two pancreatic beta-cell lines (betaTC-3 and INS-1 (832/13) cells). This information was used to identify kinases that are potentially regulated following GIP stimulation, with a focus on GIP regulation of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway. In CHO-K1 cells, GIP induced phosphorylation of Raf-1 (Ser-259), Mek1/2 (Ser-217/Ser-221), ERK1/2 (Thr-202 and Tyr-204), and p90 RSK (Ser-380) in a concentration-dependent manner. Activation of ERK1/2 was maximal at 4 min and was cAMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent and protein kinase C-independent. Studies using a beta-cell line (INS-1 clone 832/13) corroborated these findings, and it was also demonstrated that the ERK1/2 module could be activated by GIP in the absence of glucose. Finally, we have shown that GIP regulation of the ERK1/2 module is via Rap1 but does not involve Gbetagamma subunits nor Src tyrosine kinase, and we propose that cAMP-based regulation occurs via B-Raf in both CHO-K1 and beta-cells. These results establish the importance of GIP in the cellular regulation of the ERK1/2 module and identify a role for cAMP in coupling its G protein-coupled receptors to ERK1/2 activity in pancreatic beta-cells.

24141495	20131022	High-throughput fingerprinting of human pluripotent stem cell fate responses and lineage bias.	Populations of cells create local environments that lead to emergent heterogeneity. This is particularly evident with human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs): microenvironmental heterogeneity limits hPSC cell fate control. We developed a high-throughput platform to screen hPSCs in configurable microenvironments in which we optimized colony size, cell density and other parameters to achieve rapid and robust cell fate responses to exogenous cues. We used this platform to perform single-cell protein expression profiling, revealing that Oct4 and Sox2 costaining discriminates pluripotent, neuroectoderm, primitive streak and extraembryonic cell fates. We applied this Oct4-Sox2 code to analyze dose responses of 27 developmental factors to obtain lineage-specific concentration optima and to quantify cell line-specific endogenous signaling pathway activation and differentiation bias. We demonstrated that short-term responses predict definitive endoderm induction efficiency and can be used to rescue differentiation of cell lines reticent to cardiac induction. This platform will facilitate high-throughput hPSC-based screening and quantification of lineage-induction bias. 	Nat._Methods	D016428 D013485
23119005	20121103	HLA and celiac disease susceptibility: new genetic factors bring open questions about the HLA influence and gene-dosage effects.	Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder triggered after gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible individuals. The major genetic determinants are HLA-DQA1*05 and HLA-DQB1*02, which encode the DQ2 heterodimer. These alleles are commonly inherited in cis with DRB1*03?01, which is associated with numerous immune-related disorders, in some cases contributing with a different amount of risk depending on the haplotype context. We aimed at investigating those possible differences involving DRB1*03?01-carrying haplotypes in CD susceptibility. A family (274 trios) and a case-control sample (369 CD cases/461 controls) were analyzed. DRB1*03?01-carrying individuals were classified according to the haplotype present (ancestral haplotype (AH) 8.1, AH 18.2 or non-conserved haplotype) after genotyping of HLA-DRB1, -DQA1, -DQB1, -B8, TNF -308, TNF -376 and the TNFa and TNFb microsatellites. We observe that the AH 8.1 confers higher risk than the remaining DRB1*03?01-carrying haplotypes, and this effect only involves individuals possessing a single copy of DQB1*02. CD risk for these individuals is similar to the one conferred by inherit DQA1*05 and DQB1*02 in trans. It seems that an additional CD susceptibility factor is present in the AH 8.1 but not in other DRB1*03?01-carrying haplotypes. This factor could be shared with individuals possessing DQ2.5 trans, according to the similar risk observed in those two groups of individuals. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485

Tonic GABAA receptors are a subpopulation of receptors that generate long-lasting inhibition and thereby control network excitability. In recent years, these receptors have been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. Their distinct subunit composition and function, compared to phasic GABAA receptors, opens the possibility to specifically modulate network properties. In this review, the role of tonic GABAA receptors in epilepsy and as potential antiepileptic target will be discussed. 	Mol._Neurobiol.	D016428 D016454

To develop and evaluate the feasibility of emerging interventions, animal models with accurate anatomical environment are required. We aimed to establish a clinically relevant colorectal tumor model with canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) utilizing endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) imaging guidance. Survival study using a canine model. Endoscopic animal research laboratory at a tertiary cancer center. This study involved five canines. A colorectal tumor model was established and evaluated in five canines under cyclosporine immune suppression. Under endoscopic imaging guidance, saline was injected into the submucosal layer forming a bleb. Subsequently, CTVT was inoculated into the bleb under EUS guidance. Endoscopy was the primary method of assessing tumor growth. Tumors developed in 60-130 days. Upon detection of lesions &gt;1 cm, the animals were euthanized and the tumors were harvested for histopathological characterization. Success rate of tumor growth. The presence or absence of vasculature inside tumors. Colorectal tumor successfully developed in three out of the five animals (60%). Among the ones with tumor growth, average inoculated CTVT volume, incubation time, and tumor size was 1.8 cc, 65.7 days, and 2.0 cm, respectively. The two animals without tumor growth were observed for &gt;100 days. In all the tumors, vascular structure was characterized with CD31 imunohistochemical stain. Small number of animals. We succeeded in creating a new colorectal tumor canine model with CTVT utilizing EUS. 	Endosc_Ultrasound	D016428
22379939	20120303	[Analysis of the odds ratio for developing breast cancer in women].	Malignant breast cancer is the most common neoplasm in women in most developed countries. The majority of cases of breast cancer are probably connected with environmental factors and lifestyle. According to the current state of knowledge, modification of risk factors may contribute to the reduction of breast cancer cases and individual assessment performed by selecting a group of women with increased risk may help to reduce mortality. The purpose of the study was to analyze risk factors affecting the increase of odds ratio (OR) for developing breast cancer and to define in which range OR increases or decreases significantly. The participants of the study were healthy women with no changes in mammary glands and women with breast cancer diagnosed on the basis of histopathological examination. The study was carried out in Great Poland and Lubuskie province between 2005 and 2006. The total number of participants was 371 females, aged 35-70 years. The highest risk of breast cancer was observed in women over 55, BMI &gt; 30, who had &gt; 5 deliveries, with cancer family history and suffering from severe depression. Apart from cancer family history all other factors are potentially modifiable. Appropriate education of women can result in reduction of breast cancer risk. 	Ginekol._Pol.	D003160 D004740 D016428
20505556	20100528	Association of DISC1 gene with schizophrenia in families from two distinct French and Algerian populations.	The Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) gene is a promising genetic risk factor for major mental illnesses, especially schizophrenia. Several variants encompassing the DISC1 gene have been associated with schizophrenia and specific clinical features. Negative results were nevertheless observed, stratification biases, heterogeneity of the analyzed samples and low statistical power being potentially involved. We analyzed four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including three non-synonymous SNPs, of DISC1 in two independent samples of trios, from France and Algeria, using family-based association tests to elude statistical limits. In 114 French schizophrenia trios, the C allele of non-synonymous rs6675281/Leu607Phe/C1872T was significantly over-transmitted [odds ratio (OR)=2.3, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.1-4.4]. This same SNP was also more frequently transmitted in the 100 Algerian schizophrenia trios (OR=2.6, 95% CI=0.9-7.3). In the combined 214 trios, a significant over-transmission of the C allele of rs6675281 to the affected probands was observed (P=0.002), even after correction for multiple testing (P corrected=0.01 OR=2.4 and 95% CI=1.3-4.2). Assessing if a dimension of schizophrenia could be more specifically involved, we found that patients with the C allele had a significantly higher Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms total score (P=0.0002). The analysis adds convergent evidence in favor of a significant role of the DISC1 gene as a risk factor for schizophrenia, as present in two different samples, in family trios rather than with a case--control approach, and even when multiple tests are controlled for. We could further potentially attribute this effect to the negative dimension of schizophrenia. 	Psychiatr._Genet.	D016428 D013485
25006970	20140710	Nitrogen removal over nitrite by aeration control in aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactors.	This study investigated the potential of aeration control for the achievement of N-removal over nitrite with aerobic granular sludge in sequencing batch reactors. N-removal over nitrite requires less COD, which is particularly interesting if COD is the limiting parameter for nutrient removal. The nutrient removal performances for COD, N and P have been analyzed as well as the concentration of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in the granular sludge. Aeration phase length control combined with intermittent aeration or alternate high-low DO, has proven to be an efficient way to reduce the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria population and hence achieve N-removal over nitrite. N-removal efficiencies of up to 95% were achieved for an influent wastewater with COD:N:P ratios of 20:2.5:1. The total N-removal rate was 0.18 kgN?m-3?d-1. With N-removal over nitrate the N-removal was only 74%. At 20 ?C, the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria concentration decreased by over 95% in 60 days and it was possible to switch from N-removal over nitrite to N-removal over nitrate and back again. At 15 ?C, the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria concentration decreased too but less, and nitrite oxidation could not be completely suppressed. However, the combination of aeration phase length control and high-low DO was also at 15 ?C successful to maintain the nitrite pathway despite the fact that the maximum growth rate of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria at temperatures below 20 ?C is in general higher than the one of ammonium-oxidizing bacteria.

23284453	20130104	5-(4-Hexyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole.	The title compound, C(14)H(17)N(5)O, a 1,2,3-triazole derivative of benzoxadiazole (C(14)H(17)N(5)O), was synthesized via Cu-catal-ysed azide-alkyne cyclo-addition (CuAAC) from the corres-ponding n-octyne and 4-azido-benzoxadiazole. The benz-oxa-diazole and triazole rings show a roughly planar orientation [dihedral angle between the ring planes = 12.18?(5)?]. The alkane chain adopts a zigzag conformation, which deviates from the central triazole ring by 20.89?(6)?. These two torsion angles result in an overall twist to the structure, with a dihedral angle of 32.86?(7)? between the benzoxadiazole group and the hexyl chain. The crystal structure features C-H?N hydrogen bonds leading to chains propagating along [2-10] and offset parallel stacking inter-actions of the triazole and benzoxadiazole rings. The centroid of the extended ?-system formed by the benzoxadiazole and triazole rings (14 atoms total) was calculated; the centroid-centroid distance was 4.179??, interplanar separation was 3.243??, and the resulting offset was 2.636??.

22122760	20111130	Evaluation of a droplet digital polymerase chain reaction format for DNA copy number quantification.	Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a new technology that was recently commercialized to enable the precise quantification of target nucleic acids in a sample. ddPCR measures absolute quantities by counting nucleic acid molecules encapsulated in discrete, volumetrically defined, water-in-oil droplet partitions. This novel ddPCR format offers a simple workflow capable of generating highly stable partitioning of DNA molecules. In this study, we assessed key performance parameters of the ddPCR system. A linear ddPCR response to DNA concentration was obtained from 0.16% through to 99.6% saturation in a 20,000 droplet assay corresponding to more than 4 orders of magnitude of target DNA copy number per ddPCR. Analysis of simplex and duplex assays targeting two distinct loci in the Lambda DNA genome using the ddPCR platform agreed, within their expanded uncertainties, with values obtained using a lower density microfluidic chamber based digital PCR (cdPCR). A relative expanded uncertainty under 5% was achieved for copy number concentration using ddPCR. This level of uncertainty is much lower than values typically observed for quantification of specific DNA target sequences using currently commercially available real-time and digital cdPCR technologies.

9614746	19980606	Performance assessment of standard algorithms for dynamic R-T interval measurement: comparison between R-Tapex and R-T(end) approach.	Three automatic approaches to ventricular repolarisation duration measurement (R-Tapex, R-T(end threshold) and R-T(end fitting) methods) are compared on computer-generated and real ECG signals, in relation to their reliability in the presence of the most common electrocardiographic artefacts (i.e. additive broadband noise and additive and multiplicative periodical disturbances). Simulations permit the evaluation of the amount of R-T beat-to-beat variability induced by the artefacts. The R-T(end threshold) method performs better than the R-T(end fitting) one, and, hence, the latter should be used with caution when R-T(end) variability is addressed. Whereas the R-Tapex method is more robust with regard to broadband noise than the R-T(end threshold) one, the reverse situation is observed in the presence of periodical amplitude modulations. A high level of broadband noise dose not prevent the detection of the central frequency of underlying R-T periodical changes. Comparison between the power spectra of the beat-to-beat R-T variability series obtained from three orthogonal ECG leads (X,Y,Z) is used to assess the amount of real and artefactual variability in 13 normal subjects at rest. The R-Tapex series displays rhythms at high frequency (HF) with a percentage power on the Z lead (57.1 +/- 4.9) greater than that on the X and Y leads (41.9 +/- 4.6 and 46.1 +/- 4.9, respectively), probably because of respiratory-related artefacts affecting the Z lead more remarkably. More uniform HF power distributions over X,Y,Z leads are observed in the R-T(end threshold) series (31.8 +/- 3.8, 39.2 +/- 4.1 and 35.1 +/- 4.2, respectively), thus suggesting minor sensitivity of the R-T(end threshold) measure to respiratory-related artefacts.

24931981	20140617	MIRA: mutual information-based reporter algorithm for metabolic networks.	Discovering the transcriptional regulatory architecture of the metabolism has been an important topic to understand the implications of transcriptional fluctuations on metabolism. The reporter algorithm (RA) was proposed to determine the hot spots in metabolic networks, around which transcriptional regulation is focused owing to a disease or a genetic perturbation. Using a z-score-based scoring scheme, RA calculates the average statistical change in the expression levels of genes that are neighbors to a target metabolite in the metabolic network. The RA approach has been used in numerous studies to analyze cellular responses to the downstream genetic changes. In this article, we propose a mutual information-based multivariate reporter algorithm (MIRA) with the goal of eliminating the following problems in detecting reporter metabolites: (i) conventional statistical methods suffer from small sample sizes, (ii) as z-score ranges from minus to plus infinity, calculating average scores can lead to canceling out opposite effects and (iii) analyzing genes one by one, then aggregating results can lead to information loss. MIRA is a multivariate and combinatorial algorithm that calculates the aggregate transcriptional response around a metabolite using mutual information. We show that MIRA's results are biologically sound, empirically significant and more reliable than RA. We apply MIRA to gene expression analysis of six knockout strains of Escherichia coli and show that MIRA captures the underlying metabolic dynamics of the switch from aerobic to anaerobic respiration. We also apply MIRA to an Autism Spectrum Disorder gene expression dataset. Results indicate that MIRA reports metabolites that highly overlap with recently found metabolic biomarkers in the autism literature. Overall, MIRA is a promising algorithm for detecting metabolic drug targets and understanding the relation between gene expression and metabolic activity. The code is implemented in C# language using .NET framework. Project is available upon request. 	Bioinformatics	D016428 D052061 D013485 D013486
18416134	20080418	[Polymorphisms of tumor necrosis factor genes in sporadic and hereditary breast cancer].	A first attempt at investigating polymorphism of microsatellite TNFa and SNP-308 (G/A) in promoter of TNFalpha was made in patients with sporadic and hereditary breast cancer. 308 (A) TNFalpha and TNFa 12 alleles frequencies were significantly higher while that of TNFa10--significantly lower in the hereditary cancer group as compared with donors as well as sporadic cancer patients. That was contributed by cases of infiltrative-lobular tumors. Conversely, because of infiltrative-ductal tumors fraction, TNFa 7 allele frequency in sporadic cancer group was significantly higher than in donors and hereditary breast cancer patients. It was suggested that polymorphism of 308 (G/A) TNFalpha and TNFa depended, first of all, on patterns of breast and, secondly, on the elevated TNFalpha expression as a factor of pathogenesis of hereditary breast cancer.

21986706	20111012	The association of variants in the FTO gene with longitudinal body mass index profiles in non-Hispanic white children and adolescents.	To investigate possible age-related changes in associations between polymorphisms in the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene and higher body mass index (BMI). Multilevel mixed regression models were used to examine associations between four FTO variants and longitudinal BMI profiles in non-Hispanic white and African American children and adolescents 8-17 years of age from two different longitudinal cohort studies, the Bogalusa Heart Study (BHS) and Project HeartBeat! (PHB). In the BHS, there were 1551 examinations of 478 African Americans and 3210 examinations of 1081 non-Hispanic whites; in PHB, there were 971 examinations of 131 African Americans and 4458 examinations of 505 non-Hispanic whites. In African Americans, no significant FTO associations with BMI were found. In non-Hispanic whites, linkage disequilibrium among all four variants made haplotype analysis superfluous, so we focused on the single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs9939609. In longitudinal multilevel models, the A/A genotype of rs9939609 was associated with higher BMI in non-Hispanic whites in both cohorts at all ages. A significant age-by-genotype interaction found only in the BHS cohort predicted that in those with the A/A genotype, BMI would be ?0.7 kg?m(-2) higher at age 8 and ?1.6 kg?m(-2) higher at age 17 than in those with A/T or T/T genotypes. The design of PHB limited follow-up of any single individual to 4 years, and may have reduced the ability to detect any age-by-genotype interaction in this cohort. The A/A genotype of rs9939609 in the FTO gene is associated with higher longitudinal BMI profiles in non-Hispanic whites from two different cohorts. The association may change with age, with the A/A genotype being associated with a larger BMI difference in late adolescence than in childhood, though this was observed only in the BHS cohort and requires verification.

26751389	20160112	Human Gut Bacteria Are Sensitive to Melatonin and Express Endogenous Circadian Rhythmicity.	Circadian rhythms are fundamental properties of most eukaryotes, but evidence of biological clocks that drive these rhythms in prokaryotes has been restricted to Cyanobacteria. In vertebrates, the gastrointestinal system expresses circadian patterns of gene expression, motility and secretion in vivo and in vitro, and recent studies suggest that the enteric microbiome is regulated by the host's circadian clock. However, it is not clear how the host's clock regulates the microbiome. Here, we demonstrate at least one species of commensal bacterium from the human gastrointestinal system, Enterobacter aerogenes, is sensitive to the neurohormone melatonin, which is secreted into the gastrointestinal lumen, and expresses circadian patterns of swarming and motility. Melatonin specifically increases the magnitude of swarming in cultures of E. aerogenes, but not in Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae. The swarming appears to occur daily, and transformation of E. aerogenes with a flagellar motor-protein driven lux plasmid confirms a temperature-compensated circadian rhythm of luciferase activity, which is synchronized in the presence of melatonin. Altogether, these data demonstrate a circadian clock in a non-cyanobacterial prokaryote and suggest the human circadian system may regulate its microbiome through the entrainment of bacterial clocks.

24959373	20140625	The association of -330 interleukin-2 gene polymorphism with its plasma concentration in Iranian multiple sclerosis patients.	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. The cytokine genes are involved in autoimmune diseases such as MS. In this study, we report the influence of -330 interleukin-2 (IL2) gene polymorphism on its plasma levels in a group of Iranian MS patients. In this study 100 MS patients and 100 ethnically, age, and sex matched healthy controls were selected from Medical Genetics Department of Sarem Women Hospital. Blood samples of all individuals were collected in EDTA tubes. The restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR (RFLP) method was applied to determine various alleles and genotypes in these individuals. Plasma concentration of IL2 was measured in all the samples using human IL2 kit. The frequency of -330 T/T IL2 genotype was higher in MS patients compared to normal individuals. Accordingly, the plasma levels of IL2 were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.0001) in patients when compared to the control group. In conclusion, in case of MS patients the -330 T/T IL2 genotype is associated with higher plasma levels of IL2. 	Scientifica_(Cairo)	D016428
26795348	20160123	Discordant Haplotype Sequencing Identifies Functional Variants at the 2q33 Breast Cancer Risk Locus.	The findings from genome-wide association studies hold enormous potential for novel insight into disease mechanisms. A major challenge in the field is to map these low-risk association signals to their underlying functional sequence variants (FSV). Simple sequence study designs are insufficient, as the vast numbers of statistically comparable variants and a limited knowledge of noncoding regulatory elements complicate prioritization. Furthermore, large sample sizes are typically required for adequate power to identify the initial association signals. One important question is whether similar sample sizes need to be sequenced to identify the FSVs. Here, we present a proof-of-principle example of an extreme discordant design to map FSVs within the 2q33 low-risk breast cancer locus. Our approach employed DNA sequencing of a small number of discordant haplotypes to efficiently identify candidate FSVs. Our results were consistent with those from a 2,000-fold larger, traditional imputation-based fine-mapping study. To prioritize further, we used expression-quantitative trait locus analysis of RNA sequencing from breast tissues, gene regulation annotations from the ENCODE consortium, and functional assays for differential enhancer activities. Notably, we implicate three regulatory variants at 2q33 that target CASP8 (rs3769823, rs3769821 in CASP8, and rs10197246 in ALS2CR12) as functionally relevant. We conclude that nested discordant haplotype sequencing is a promising approach to aid mapping of low-risk association loci. The ability to include more efficient sequencing designs into mapping efforts presents an opportunity for the field to capitalize on the potential of association loci and accelerate translation of association signals to their underlying FSVs.

25705170	20150224	Understanding Rifampicin Resistance in Tuberculosis through a Computational Approach.	The disease tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. The evolution of drug-resistant tuberculosis causes a foremost threat to global health. Most drug-resistant MTB clinical strains are showing resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin (RIF), the frontline anti-tuberculosis drugs. Mutation in rpoB, the beta subunit of DNA-directed RNA polymerase of MTB, is reported to be a major cause of RIF resistance. Amongst mutations in the well-defined 81-base-pair central region of the rpoB gene, mutation at codon 450 (S450L) and 445 (H445Y) is mainly associated with RIF resistance. In this study, we modeled two resistant mutants of rpoB (S450L and H445Y) using Modeller9v10 and performed a docking analysis with RIF using AutoDock4.2 and compared the docking results of these mutants with the wild-type rpoB. The docking results revealed that RIF more effectively inhibited the wild-type rpoB with low binding energy than rpoB mutants. The rpoB mutants interacted with RIF with positive binding energy, revealing the incapableness of RIF inhibition and thus showing resistance. Subsequently, this was verified by molecular dynamics simulations. This in silico evidence may help us understand RIF resistance in rpoB mutant strains. 	Genomics_Inform	D016428
22245114	20120117	The diagnostic utility of the GNAS mutation in patients with fibrous dysplasia: meta-analysis of 168 sporadic cases.	GNAS mutations have been implicated in the development of fibrous dysplasia and multiple endocrinopathies of the Albright-McCune syndrome. To investigate the diagnostic utility of GNAS mutations in patients with fibrous dysplasia, we performed mutational analyses of histologically confirmed fibrous dysplasia and conducted a meta-analysis of the literature. We collected 48 cases of fibrous dysplasia from 3 institutions from 2002 to 2011 and performed polymerase chain reaction and direct bidirectional sequencing of exons 8 and 9 of GNAS using paraffin-embedded tissues. We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, and the KoreaMed databases from 1997 to 2011 and included an additional 155 cases of fibrous dysplasia from 8 representative studies to conduct a meta-analysis. In our sample, 28 (58.3%) of 48 cases showed point mutations of codon 201 at exon 8. Twenty-five cases had a substitution of arginine at codon 201 for histidine (p.R201H), and 3 cases had a substitution for cysteine (p.R201C). One case had a new mutation at codon 224 (p.V224A). The incidence of GNAS mutations was significantly greater in cases that involved long bones than in cases that involved flat bones (P = .017) and was higher in polyostotic cases than in monostotic cases (P = .067). In meta-analysis, 9 studies and 203 patients were included. The overall positive rate of GNAS mutation in fibrous dysplasia was 71.9% (146/203). The major types of mutations were missense mutations such as R201H (66.4%) and R201C (30.8%). As a result, the detection of GNAS mutation could be a valuable adjunct to conventional histopathologic diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia. 	Hum._Pathol.	D016428 D017418 D013485
26584427	20151120	PCR Real time Mismatch Amplification Mutation Assay (MAMA Real Time PCR) for evaluation of TNF-? promoter gene polymorphism -308 G/A in patients with psoriasis.	Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory disease, the plaques are infiltrated by leukocytes producing high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and TNF-?. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the gene promoters have been shown to affect gene expression. The -308 G/A polymorphism could affect TNF synthesis at transcriptional level. The present study develops a MAMA Real Time PCR assay, in order to identify homozygosis or heterozygosis for TNF-? -308 G/A polymorphism. Seventy patients with psoriasis and 235 controls were considered for the development of the real time PCR assay. Whole blood was processed for nucleic acid extraction. A percentage of 36.17% controls and 38.6% patients were heterozygosis, considering Amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR assay while 23% and 22.85% were heterozygosis using Mismatch Amplification Mutation Assay (MAMA)-PCR. On the contrary, 1.3% and 1.4% were homozygosis A, while 75.7% and 75.75% presented homozygosis G, taking into account the MAMA-PCR results. The two assays were significantly different (P=0.0004 at ?2 Test), but MAMA-PCR showed a better performance for TNF-? -308 G/A gene polymorphism investigation. Further studies are needed for a better comprehension of the role of this polymorphism, such as MAMA real time PCR assays development for other players in cellular immune response.

22497295	20120414	Genome-wide association analysis for feed efficiency in Angus cattle.	Estimated breeding values for average daily feed intake (AFI; kg/day), residual feed intake (RFI; kg/day) and average daily gain (ADG; kg/day) were generated using a mixed linear model incorporating genomic relationships for 698 Angus steers genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 assay. Association analyses of estimated breeding values (EBVs) were performed for 41,028 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and permutation analysis was used to empirically establish the genome-wide significance threshold (P &lt; 0.05) for each trait. SNPs significantly associated with each trait were used in a forward selection algorithm to identify genomic regions putatively harbouring genes with effects on each trait. A total of 53, 66 and 68 SNPs explained 54.12% (24.10%), 62.69% (29.85%) and 55.13% (26.54%) of the additive genetic variation (when accounting for the genomic relationships) in steer breeding values for AFI, RFI and ADG, respectively, within this population. Evaluation by pathway analysis revealed that many of these SNPs are in genomic regions that harbour genes with metabolic functions. The presence of genetic correlations between traits resulted in 13.2% of SNPs selected for AFI and 4.5% of SNPs selected for RFI also being selected for ADG in the analysis of breeding values. While our study identifies panels of SNPs significant for efficiency traits in our population, validation of all SNPs in independent populations will be necessary before commercialization.

25239251	20140921	Gene polymorphisms in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis from Mozambique.	Several host and environmental factors contribute to tuberculosis outcome, interestingly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes have been evaluated in populations with different ethnicities and TB infection. In the present study we focused on SNPs in cytokine and inflammatory mediator genes: tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -308G&gt;A (rs1800629), interleukin-10 (IL10) -819C&gt;T (rs1800871), interferon-gamma (IFNG) +874T&gt;A (rs2430561), and leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) rs1978331, rs17525495 and rs2660898 in a case-control study involving 102 pulmonary tuberculosis patients and 456 controls from Mozambique. LTA4H, IL10 and IFNG SNPs showed no associations with pulmonary tuberculosis. However, distribution of the TNF -308A allele, genotype and carrier frequencies showed a significant risk association with tuberculosis that was maintained after adjustment for non-genetic variables and Bonferroni correction (AA genotype, OR = 1.9, p Bonf &lt; 0.001; A allele OR = 2.9, p Bonf = 0.005 and GA/AA carrier OR = 2.6, p Bonf = 0.035). Interestingly, this association has not been reported in a sub-Saharan African population before. Our results suggest a role of -308 TNF polymorphism and tuberculosis susceptibility. 	Mol._Biol._Rep.

22878964	20120811	P.R4810K, a polymorphism of RNF213, the susceptibility gene for moyamoya disease, is associated with blood pressure.	Moyamoya disease-an idiopathic vascular disorder of intracranial arteries-is often accompanied by hypertension. RNF213 has been identified as a susceptibility gene for moyamoya disease. In the present study, the association of p.R4810K (G&gt;A) with blood pressure (BP) was investigated in a Japanese population. Three independent study populations, the Nyukawa (n?=?984), Noshiro (n?=?2,443) and Field (n?=?881) studies, joined this study. BP, body weight and height were measured. Past and present symptoms and disease and medication histories were assessed by interview. Associations of p.R4810K (rs112735431, ss179362673) of RNF213 with BP were investigated. Two linkage disequilibrium blocks were constructed for moyamoya patients with p.R4810K (n?=?140) and the general population (n?=?384) using 39 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning 390?kb around RNF213. A total of 60 carriers (3 for AA genotype and 57 for GA genotype) were found in these samples, and the minor allele frequencies were 1.4?% in the Nyukawa and Field studies and 0.2?% in the Noshiro study. Regression analyses adjusted for age, sex and body mass index based on an additive model demonstrated significant associations with systolic BP (mmHg/allele): ? (standard error) was 8.2 (2.9) in the Nyukawa study (P?=?4.7??10(-3)), 18.7 (5.4) in the Noshiro study (P?=?4.6??10(-4)) and 8.9 (2.0) (P?=?1.0??10(-5)) in the three populations. In contrast, diastolic BP showed significant associations only in the Noshiro study. Linkage disequilibrium blocks contained none of the BP-associated proxy SNPs reported by previous studies. Our study suggests that p.R4810K of RNF213 is associated strongly with systolic BP. 	Environ_Health_Prev_Med	D016428 D013485
25237709	20140920	Regulatory mutations in the A2M gene are involved in the mastitis susceptibility in dairy cows.	Mutations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in the 5?-flanking and microRNA (miRNA) regulatory regions may result in altered gene expression levels and cause diseases. Alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) has the function of binding host or foreign peptides and particles, and thereby serves as a defense barrier against pathogens in the plasma and tissues of animals. To investigate the functional markers of the A2M gene associated with mastitis, the promoter was characterized and SNPs that affect promoter activity or binding affinity with the target miRNA were identified using the luciferase reporter assay and real-time quantitative PCR method. Results showed that the core promoter of A2M was found between the bases g.-2641 and g.-2479. Four novel SNPs (g.-724A&gt;G, g.-665G&gt;A, g.-535C&gt;G and g.-520_-519insA) in the promoter region were completely linked. The activity of the mutant haplotype (GAGA) increased by 177% compared with that of the wild haplotype (AGC-). Bta-miR-2898 was upregulated by 6.25-fold in the mammary gland tissues of mastitis-infected cows compared with that of the healthy cows. One SNP (c.4659_4661delC) located in the 3?-untranslated region of the A2M gene may affect the binding affinity with the target bta-miR-2898. Five SNPs exhibited tight linkage. Association analysis showed that the milk somatic cell score for cows with the mutant haplotype (GAGA-) was lower than that for cows with the wild haplotype. Thus, the mutant type can be used as a potential functional marker for a mastitis resistance breeding program in dairy cows. Our findings provided the molecular basis for A2M transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations. A close relationship between regulatory mutations and mastitis susceptibility of cows also was established. 	Anim._Genet.	D016428 D013485

This study evaluated wild-type EGFR, E746-A750 frame deletion in exon 19, and L858R point mutation in exon 21 by immunohistochemistry in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). A retrospective study included 99 untreated early-stage and advanced-stage TNBC patients. Immunohistochemical localization of wild-type EGFR, EGFR E746-A750 deletion in exon 19, and EGFR L858R mutation in exon 21 was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks using mutation-specific primary antibodies. EGFR protein expression was noted in 27% (27/99) of patients with 2+ or 3+ staining intensity in 7% (7/99) of patients. Significant correlation of EGFR protein expression with subgroups of clinicopathologic parameters was not found. In univariate and multivariate survival analysis, high EGFR expression (2+ or 3+) emerged as a significant prognostic factor for disease-free survival. With respect to mutation status, exon 19 deletion was observed in 3% (3/99) of patients. One patient with exon 19 deletion having high EGFR protein (2+) expression developed lung metastasis, whereas the other 2 patients with exon 19 deletion had low EGFR protein (1+) expression and remained disease free during the study period. EGFR protein overexpression was observed in one fourth of TNBCs with very low incidence of EGFR-activating mutations in patients of western India. 	Appl._Immunohistochem._Mol._Morphol.

26889969	20160219	An epigenome-wide association meta-analysis of prenatal maternal stress in neonates: A model approach for replication.	Prenatal maternal stress exposure has been associated with neonatal differential DNA methylation. However, the available evidence in humans is largely based on candidate gene methylation studies, where only a few CpG sites were evaluated. The aim of this study was to examine the association between prenatal exposure to maternal stress and offspring genome-wide cord blood methylation using different methods. First, we conducted a meta-analysis and follow-up pathway analyses. Second, we used novel region discovery methods [i.e., differentially methylated regions (DMRs) analyses]. To this end, we used data from two independent population-based studies, the Generation R Study (n = 912) and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, n = 828), to (i) measure genome-wide DNA methylation in cord blood and (ii) extract a prenatal maternal stress composite. The meta-analysis (ntotal = 1,740) revealed no epigenome-wide (meta P &lt;1.00e-07) associations of prenatal maternal stress exposure with neonatal differential DNA methylation. Follow-up analyses of the top hits derived from our epigenome-wide meta-analysis (meta P &lt;1.00e-04) indicated an over-representation of the methyltransferase activity pathway. We identified no Bonferroni-corrected (P &lt;1.00e-06) DMRs associated with prenatal maternal stress exposure. Combining data from two independent population-based samples in an epigenome-wide meta-analysis, the current study indicates that there are no large effects of prenatal maternal stress exposure on neonatal DNA methylation. Such replication efforts are essential in the search for robust associations, whether derived from candidate gene methylation or epigenome-wide studies. 	Epigenetics	D016428 D017418 D052061 D013485

25250787	20140925	Xanthene derivatives increase glucose utilization through activation of LKB1-dependent AMP-activated protein kinase.	5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a highly conserved serine-threonine kinase that regulates energy expenditure by activating catabolic metabolism and suppressing anabolic pathways to increase cellular energy levels. Therefore AMPK activators are considered to be drug targets for treatment of metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus. To identify novel AMPK activators, we screened xanthene derivatives. We determined that the AMPK activators 9H-xanthene-9-carboxylic acid {2,2,2-trichloro-1-[3-(3-nitro-phenyl)-thioureido]-ethyl}-amide (Xn) and 9H-xanthene-9-carboxylic acid {2,2,2-trichloro-1-[3-(3-cyano-phenyl)-thioureido]-ethyl}-amide (Xc) elevated glucose uptake in L6 myotubes by stimulating translocation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4). Treatment with the chemical AMPK inhibitor compound C and infection with dominant-negative AMPKa2-virus inhibited AMPK phosphorylation and glucose uptake in myotubes induced by either Xn or Xc. Of the two major upstream kinases of AMPK, we found that Xn and Xc showed LKB1 dependency by knockdown of STK11, an ortholog of human LKB1. Single intravenous administration of Xn and Xc to high-fat diet-induced diabetic mice stimulated AMPK phosphorylation of skeletal muscle and improved glucose tolerance. Taken together, these results suggest that Xn and Xc regulate glucose homeostasis through LKB1-dependent AMPK activation and that the compounds are potential candidate drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

16940553	20060831	Single Cl- channels activated by Ca2+ in Drosophila S2 cells are mediated by bestrophins.	Mutations in human bestrophin-1 (VMD2) are genetically linked to several forms of retinal degeneration but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Bestrophin-1 (hBest1) has been proposed to be a Cl(-) channel involved in ion and fluid transport by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). To date, however, bestrophin currents have only been described in overexpression systems and not in any native cells. To test whether bestrophins function as Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) (CaC) channels physiologically, we used interfering RNA (RNAi) in the Drosophila S2 cell line. S2 cells express four bestrophins (dbest1-4) and have an endogenous CaC current. The CaC current is abolished by several RNAi constructs to dbest1 and dbest2, but not dbest3 or dbest4. The endogenous CaC current was mimicked by expression of dbest1 in HEK cells, and the rectification and relative permeability of the current were altered by replacing F81 with cysteine. Single channel analysis of the S2 bestrophin currents revealed an approximately 2-pS single channel with fast gating kinetics and linear current-voltage relationship. A similar channel was observed in CHO cells transfected with dbest1, but no such channel was seen in S2 cells treated with RNAi to dbest1. This provides definitive evidence that bestrophins are components of native CaC channels at the plasma membrane. 	J._Gen._Physiol.	D016428 D052061
24341808	20131218	Rough colony morphology of Mycobacterium massiliense Type II genotype is due to the deletion of glycopeptidolipid locus within its genome.	Recently, we introduced the complete genome sequence of Mycobacterium massiliense clinical isolates, Asan 50594 belonging to Type II genotype with rough colony morphology. Here, to address the issue of whether the rough colony morphotype of M. massiliense Type II genotype is genetically determined or not, we compared polymorphisms of the glycopeptidolipid (GPL) gene locus between M. massiliense Type II Asan 50594 and other rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) strains via analysis of genome databases. We found deletions of 10 genes (24.8 kb), in the GPL biosynthesis related gene cluster of Asan 50594 genome, but no deletions in those of other smooth RGMs. To check the presence of deletions of GPL biosynthesis related genes in Mycobacterium abscessus--complex strains, PCRs targeting 12 different GPL genes (10 genes deleted in Asan 50594 genome as well as 2 conserved genes) were applied into 76 clinical strains of the M. abscessus complex strains [54 strains (Type I: 33, and Type II: 21) of M. massiliense and 22 strains (rough morphoype: 11 and smooth morphotype: 11) of M. abscessus]. No strains of the Type II genotype produced PCR amplicons in a total of 10 deleted GPL genes, suggesting loss of GPL biosynthesis genes in the genome of M. massiliense type II genotype strains. Our data suggested that the rough colony morphotype of the M. massiliense Type II genotype may be acquired via deletion events at the GPL gene locus for evolutionary adaptation between the host and pathogen.

17706308	20070821	Significant reduction of acute toxicity following pelvic irradiation with helical tomotherapy in patients with localized prostate cancer.	To assess and quantify the possible benefit deriving from IMRT with Helical Tomotherapy (HTT) delivery to the pelvic nodal area in patients with prostate cancer in terms of reduction of acute and late toxicities. Thirty-five patients candidate to radical or postoperative RT on whole pelvis (WPRT) were treated with HTT, while receiving a concomitant boost to the prostate or the prostatic bed (median 74.2 and 72 Gy, respectively) within a moderately hypofractionated (28-33 fractions; median HTT duration 44 days) regimen. Median and mean doses to whole pelvis were 52 and 54 Gy, respectively. One of the major goals of planning optimisation was to minimize the dose received by the intestinal cavity (IC) outside the nodal PTV. HTT resulted to be very efficient in sparing the IC even at dose levels below 30-35 Gy and guaranteed a significant sparing of bladder and rectum even at intermediate-low doses (V20-V40). No acute Grade 3 RTOG toxicity was recorded. Eighteen G1 and two G2 GU acute toxicities, 13 G1 upper GI acute toxicities, 8 G1 and 1 G2 acute proctitis were observed; no patient experienced G2 upper GI toxicity. After a median FU of 11.5 months (&gt;10 in 18 patients) one case of late G3 GU toxicity was reported in one post-prostatectomy treated patient; no G2 late rectal bleeding or other GI toxicity was recorded. WPRT with HTT resulted in a very low incidence of acute Grade 2 and in the disappearance of acute Grade 3 toxicities. 	Radiother_Oncol	D016428
25528060	20141222	Towards a comprehensive characterization of durum wheat landraces in Moroccan traditional agrosystems: analysing genetic diversity in the light of geography, farmers' taxonomy and tetraploid wheat domestication history.	Crop diversity managed by smallholder farmers in traditional agrosystems is the outcome of historical and current processes interacting at various spatial scales, and influenced by factors such as farming practices and environmental pressures. Only recently have studies started to consider the complexity of these processes instead of simply describing diversity for breeding purposes. A first step in that aim is to add multiple references to the collection of genetic data, including the farmers' varietal taxonomy and practices and the historical background of the crop. On the basis of interview data collected in a previous study, we sampled 166 populations of durum wheat varieties in two traditional Moroccan agrosystems, in the Pre-Rif and Atlas Mountains regions. Using a common garden experiment, we detected a high phenotypic variability on traits indicative of taxonomical position and breeding status, namely spike shape and plant height. Populations often combined modern (short) with traditional-like (tall) statures, and classical durum squared spike shape (5 flowers/spikelet) with flat spike shape (3 flowers/ spikelet) representative of primitive domesticated tetraploid wheat (ssp. dicoccum). By contrast, the genetic diversity assessed using 14 microsatellite markers was relatively limited. When compared to the genetic diversity found in a large collection of tetraploid wheat, it corresponded to free-threshing tetraploid wheat. Within Morocco, the two studied regions differed for both genetic diversity and variety names. Within regions, neither geography nor variety names nor even breeding status constituted strong barriers to gene exchange despite a few significant patterns. This first assessment of morphological and genetic diversity allowed pointing out some important factors that may have influenced the structure and evolutionary dynamics of durum wheat in Morocco: the significance of variety names, the occurrence of mixtures within populations, the relative strength of seed exchange between farmers and local adaptation, as well as the fate of modern varieties once they have been introduced. Further, multidisciplinary studies at different spatial scales are needed to better understand these complex agrosystems of invaluable importance for food security. 	BMC_Evol._Biol.	D016428 D013485
26681045	20151219	Investigation of polymorphisms in anti-inflammatory cytokine genes in hematogenous osteomyelitis.	Osteomyelitis is a progressive bone infection disease caused by destructive immunological inflammatory reactions following new bone formation. Anti-inflammatory cytokines are a series of immunoregulatory molecules that control the pro-inflammatory cytokine response. In this study, we investigated 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 5 different cytokine/cytokine receptor genes in hematogenous osteomyelitis (HO) patients, and compared their outcomes with normal healthy individuals. Sequence-specific forward and reverse primers and two TaqMan? MGB probes with dyes (VIC? and FAM?) that specifically detect Allele 1 and Allele 2 of each SNP were utilized. The genotypes CC (P = 0.009) and CT (P = 0.041) of SNP rs2070874, and alleles A (P = 0.044) and G of SNP rs1800871 were significantly different between the patients and healthy controls. The expression of the CC genotype or C allele at rs2070874 was a risk factor for HO development, with higher frequencies of CT and T being found in the control samples. The expression of the A allele of rs1800871 was also significantly higher in patients than in controls, and was therefore considered a risk factor. 	Genet._Mol._Res.	D016428 D013485
16381801	20051231	Compensatory contribution of Cav2.3 channels to acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction of tottering mice.	Tottering (Tg) mice carry the mutation P601L in their Cacna1a encoded Cav2.1 channels. Transmitter release at the wild-type neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is almost exclusively mediated by Cav2.1 channels, and we used this model synapse to study synaptic consequences of the Tg mutation. With electrophysiology, and using subtype-specific Cav2 channel-blocking toxins, we assessed a possible compensatory contribution of non-Cav2.1 channels to evoked acetylcholine (ACh) release at Tg NMJs. Release was reduced by approximately 75% by the Cav2.1 channel blocker omega-agatoxin-IVA, which was less than the approximately 95% reduction observed in wild-type. Release at Tg NMJs, but not at wild-type synapses, was reduced by approximately 15% by SNX-482, a Cav2.3 channel blocker. No Cav2.2 channel involvement was found. Probably, there is a small reduction in functional presynaptic Cav2.1 channels at Tg NMJs, which is compensated for by Cav2.3 channels. The remaining Cav2.1 channels are likely to convey enlarged Ca2+ flux, because evoked ACh release at Tg NMJs, at low extracellular Ca2+ concentration, was approximately sixfold higher than at wild-type NMJs. This is the first report of compensatory expression of non-Cav2.1 channels at NMJs of mice with a single amino acid change in Cav2.1. 	J._Neurophysiol.	D016428 D013485

The influence from the specific distribution of charge and hydrophobic patches in protein surfaces on the self-association of proteins and their complex coacervation were investigated. A simple and direct method to quantify the contribution of hydrophobic interaction on protein complex formation was introduced. Highly accordant pH dependence of charges in proteins and phase boundaries for the complex coacervation was observed. Comparing to BSA, beta-lactoglobulin had a higher probability and a broader pH window to form complex coacervate. The major cause is the higher self-association proneness of beta-lactoglobulin, as evidenced by the more negative second virial coefficients. The double-point mutations of G64D/V118A from BLGB to BLGA caused the latter one to have a stronger self-association proneness. It was revealed that the larger negative charge patch in BLGA synergistically enhanced the attraction of the strongest binding site, a positive charge patch, when pH was close to or above the isoelectric point of the protein. These findings suggest that the coarse grained simulation is competent to explore the delicate influences from different proteins in protein-polysaccharide complex coacervates.

20865685	20100925	The left and right ventricle of a patient with a R723G mutation of the beta-myosin heavy chain and severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy show no differences in the expression of myosin mRNA.	In familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC), asymmetric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy has been considered to be the predominant phenotypic expression, whereas right ventricular (RV) involvement is still ambiguous. In most cases, the right ventricle remains unaffected until secondary pulmonary hypertension develops. Several FHC-causing mutations of genes encoding sarcomere-related proteins have been identified which are transmitted in an autosomal-dominant manner. We report the case of a 61 year old member of a Catalan family with a Arg723Gly missense mutation of the ?-myosin heavy chain (?-MHC), that is associated with a malignant phenotype characterized by sudden cardiac death and heart failure. Because of progressive systolic LV dysfunction, the patient received a heart transplant in 2003. Molecular analysis of the myocardial tissue of the explanted heart, taken from the left and right ventricle, showed a similar deviation of the ratio of mutant vs wild type mRNA of the ?-MHC of 71.8 ? 5% and 68.5 ? 3%, respectively. This finding was confirmed for LV biopsies of this patient on protein level, showing a similar proportion of mutated ?-myosin. But since the patient is heterozygous for the ?-MHC mutation and the mutation is located in a coding region, the relative increase of the expression of the mutant allele is unexpected. It has been demonstrated before by our group for several ?-MHC mutations that the relative abundance of mutated mRNA/protein correlates with the clinical severity of the disease. But since the right ventricle shows no (or only minor) manifestation in terms of hypertrophy or dysfunction, the level of mRNA and protein expression is not the only factor responsible for the development of the phenotype of FHC. Several mechanisms through which cardiac stresses may incite maladaptive cardiac remodeling primarily of the left ventricle that result in myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure are proposed. One of those triggers could be the enhanced work load of the left ventricle, especially if a LV outflow tract gradient is present, in contrast to the lesser demands to the right ventricle which is adapted to the low pressure system of the pulmonary circulation. Further studies are needed to confirm the results of this case, as well as functional studies involving both ventricles. 	Cardiol_J	D002363 D016428
20598712	20100706	Association of the -344C/T aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) gene variant with hypertension and stroke.	Stroke is a complex disease caused by combination of multiple risk factors. Recent findings have suggested that stroke has a significant genetic component. Various types of genetic polymorphisms have been suggested to contribute to the risk of stroke. Gene polymorphisms of renin-angiontensin aldosterone system (RAAS) have been suggested to be risk factors for hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and stroke. In the present case-control study we investigated the association of -344C/T (rs1799998) [corrected] polymorphism in the promoter region of the human aldosterone (CYP11B2) gene with genetic predisposition to hypertension, ischemic stroke and stroke subtypes classified according to TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) classification. Four hundred and three stroke patients (hypertensives:normotensives=219:184) and three hundred and ninety four, sex and age matched healthy controls (hypertensives:normotensives=118:276) were involved in the study. The region of interest in the CYP11B2 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and genotypes determined by subjecting the PCR products to restriction digestion by the enzyme HaeIII. Significant difference was observed in the genotypic distribution and allelic frequency between the stroke patients and healthy controls. TT genotype and T allele associated significantly with hypertension and stroke (p&lt;0.000 in hypertension and p=0.000 in case of stroke). A stepwise logistic regression analysis confirmed these findings. To establish that this polymorphism is associated with stroke independent of hypertension, we compared stroke patients without hypertension with normotensive controls. Significant difference was observed in genotypic distribution and allelic frequency between the two groups (p=0.000). Further evaluating the association of this polymorphism with stroke subtypes we found significant associations with intracranial large artery atherosclerosis, lacunar stroke and cardioembolic stroke (p=0.000 in each case). In conclusion our study suggests that -344T allele of CYP11B2 gene is an important risk factor for hypertension and ischemic stroke. However, this is a preliminary study and the results need to be confirmed in a larger cohort. 	J._Neurol._Sci.	D016428
9514048	19980326	NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 reduces the mutagenicity of DNA caused by NADPH:P450 reductase-activated metabolites of benzo(a)pyrene quinones.	The role of microsomal NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase (P450 reductase) and cytosolic NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1 or DT-diaphorase) in the mutagenicity of benzo(a)pyrene-3,6-quinone (BP-3,6-Q) was studied using supF tRNA gene as the mutational target. pUB3 carrying the supF tRNA gene upon transformation into the Escherichia coli ES87 cells exhibited a spontaneous mutation frequency of 0.62 x 10(-6). Chemical modification of the pUB3 DNA with BP-3,6-Q caused a fourfold increase in the mutation frequency, compared with the spontaneous mutations. P450 reductase catalysed metabolic activation of BP-3,6-Q into reactive products (semiquinone and reactive oxygen species), which caused a further increase in the mutation frequency to eightfold over spontaneous mutations. Oxygen radical scavengers (SOD and catalase) blocked the P450 reductase-activated BP-3,6-Q-induced stimulation of mutations. This indicates that redox cycling of the semiquinone leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was directly responsible for the increased mutation frequency of P450 reductase-activated BP-3,6-Q. Analysis of the mutation spectra revealed that P450 reductase-activated BP-3,6-Q showed a significantly higher preference for frameshift mutations, particularly deletions, compared with the spontaneous mutations and the mutations generated by benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE). The single most frequently observed mutation by P450 reductase-activated quinone (semiquinone + ROS) was deletion of a single guanosine. Among the base substitutions, G:C --&gt; T:A, G:C --&gt; A:T and G:C --&gt; C:G were also noticed. Interestingly, NQO1 competed with P450 reductase and specifically prevented the P450 reductase-activated BP-3,6-Q-induced mutations. However, BP-hydroquinone (BP-3,6-HQ) generated during the metabolic reduction of BP-3,6-Q catalysed by NQO1 caused specific mutations involving the deletion of a single cytosine from the DNA sequence 5'-CCCCC-3' in supF tRNA gene at a significantly high frequency. A similar cytosine deletion was also observed with benzoquinone hydroquinone (HQ), indicating that the deletion of cytosine is associated with a hydroquinone class of compounds. These results suggest that: (1) quinones and P450 reductase-activated products of quinones (semiquinones and ROS) are mutagenic compounds; (2) the mutational spectra of quinones, semiquinones and hydroquinones differ from each other with respect to their mutational frequency and specificity; (3) NQO1 competes with P450 reductase and protects the cells from quinone mutagenicity; and (4) the NQO1 -metabolized quinones (hydroquinones), if not eliminated, cause specific mutations that are not observed with quinones and P450 reductase-activated quinones (semiquinones and ROS).

20480106	20100519	High-resolution microcontact printing and transfer of massive arrays of microorganisms on planar and compartmentalized nanoporous aluminium oxide.	Handling microorganisms in high throughput and their deployment into miniaturized platforms presents significant challenges. Contact printing can be used to create dense arrays of viable microorganisms. Such &quot;living arrays&quot;, potentially with multiple identical replicates, are useful in the selection of improved industrial microorganisms, screening antimicrobials, clinical diagnostics, strain storage, and for research into microbial genetics. A high throughput method to print microorganisms at high density was devised, employing a microscope and a stamp with a massive array of PDMS pins. Viable bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum, Esherichia coli), yeast (Candida albicans) and fungal spores (Aspergillus fumigatus) were deposited onto porous aluminium oxide (PAO) using arrays of pins with areas from 5 x 5 to 20 x 20 microm. Printing onto PAO with up to 8100 pins of 20 x 20 microm area with 3 replicates was achieved. Printing with up to 200 pins onto PAO culture chips (divided into 40 x 40 microm culture areas) allowed inoculation followed by effective segregation of microcolonies during outgrowth. Additionally, it was possible to print mixtures of C. albicans and spores of A. fumigatus with a degree of selectivity by capture onto a chemically modified PAO surface. High resolution printing of microorganisms within segregated compartments and on functionalized PAO surfaces has significant advantages over what is possible on semi-solid surfaces such as agar.

23505389	20130319	A WRKY transcription factor recruits the SYG1-like protein SHB1 to activate gene expression and seed cavity enlargement.	Seed development in Arabidopsis and in many dicots involves an early proliferation of the endosperm to form a large embryo sac or seed cavity close to the size of the mature seed, followed by a second phase during which the embryo grows and replaces the endosperm. Short hypocotyl under BLUE1 (SHB1) is a member of the SYG1 protein family in fungi, Caenorhabditis elegans, flies, and mammals. SHB1 gain-of-function enhances endosperm proliferation, increases seed size, and up-regulates the expression of the WRKY transcription factor gene MINISEED3 (MINI3) and the LRR receptor kinase gene HAIKU2 (IKU2). Mutations in either IKU2 or MINI3 retard endosperm proliferation and reduce seed size. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment of the seed cavity and hence the seed size remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the expression of MINI3 and IKU2 is repressed before fertilization and after 4 days after pollination (DAP), but is activated by SHB1 from 2 to 4 DAP prior to the formation of the seed cavity. SHB1 associates with their promoters but without a recognizable DNA binding motif, and this association is abolished in mini3 mutant. MINI3 binds to W-boxes in, and recruits SHB1 to, its own and IKU2 promoters. Interestingly, SHB1, but not MINI3, activates transcription of pMINI3::GUS or pIKU2::GUS. We reveal a critical developmental switch through the activation of MINI3 expression by SHB1. The recruitment of SHB1 by MINI3 to its own and IKU2 promoters represents a novel two-step amplification to counter the low expression level of IKU2, which is a trigger for endosperm proliferation and seed cavity enlargement.

18254947	20080208	Statistical issues in the analysis of Illumina data.	Illumina bead-based arrays are becoming increasingly popular due to their high degree of replication and reported high data quality. However, little attention has been paid to the pre-processing of Illumina data. In this paper, we present our experience of analysing the raw data from an Illumina spike-in experiment and offer guidelines for those wishing to analyse expression data or develop new methodologies for this technology. We find that the local background estimated by Illumina is consistently low, and subtracting this background is beneficial for detecting differential expression (DE). Illumina's summary method performs well at removing outliers, producing estimates which are less biased and are less variable than other robust summary methods. However, quality assessment on summarised data may miss spatial artefacts present in the raw data. Also, we find that the background normalisation method used in Illumina's proprietary software (BeadStudio) can cause problems with a standard DE analysis. We demonstrate that variances calculated from the raw data can be used as inverse weights in the DE analysis to improve power. Finally, variability in both expression levels and DE statistics can be attributed to differences in probe composition. These differences are not accounted for by current analysis methods and require further investigation. Analysing Illumina expression data using BeadStudio is reasonable because of the conservative estimates of summary values produced by the software. Improvements can however be made by not using background normalisation. Access to the raw data allows for a more detailed quality assessment and flexible analyses. In the case of a gene expression study, data can be analysed on an appropriate scale using established tools. Similar improvements can be expected for other Illumina assays.

19301661	20090324	Therapeutic targeting of gene expression by siRNAs directed against BCR-ABL transcripts in a patient with imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia.	Within the recent years, RNA interference (RNAi) has become an almost-standard method for in vitro knockdown of any target gene of interest. Now, one major focus is to further explore its potential in vivo, including the development of novel therapeutic strategies. From the mechanism, it becomes clear that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) play a pivotal role in triggering RNAi. Thus, the efficient delivery of target gene-specific siRNAs is one major challenge in the establishment of therapeutic RNAi. Here we show that in vivo application of targeted nonvirally delivered synthetic bcr-abl siRNA in a female patient with recurrent Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) resistant to imatinib (Y253F mutation) and chemotherapy after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can silence the expression of bcr-abl gene. We found a remarkable inhibition of the overexpressed bcr-abl oncogene resulting in increased apoptosis of CML cells. In vivo siRNA application was well tolerated without any clinically adverse events. Our findings imply that the clinical application of synthetic siRNA is feasible, safe and has real potential for genetic-based therapies using synthetic nonviral carriers. 	Methods_Mol._Biol.

21599965	20110524	Genotype-specific responses in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) subject to dietary fish oil replacement by vegetable oil: a liver transcriptomic analysis.	Expansion of aquaculture is seriously limited by reductions in fish oil (FO) supply for aquafeeds. Terrestrial alternatives such as vegetable oils (VO) have been investigated and recently a strategy combining genetic selection with changes in diet formulations has been proposed to meet growing demands for aquaculture products. This study investigates the influence of genotype on transcriptomic responses to sustainable feeds in Atlantic salmon. A microarray analysis was performed to investigate the liver transcriptome of two family groups selected according to their estimated breeding values (EBVs) for flesh lipid content, 'Lean' or 'Fat', fed diets containing either FO or a VO blend. Diet principally affected metabolism genes, mainly of lipid and carbohydrate, followed by immune response genes. Genotype had a much lower impact on metabolism-related genes and affected mostly signalling pathways. Replacement of dietary FO by VO caused an up-regulation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, but there was a clear genotype effect as fatty acyl elongase (elovl2) was only up-regulated and desaturases (?5 fad and ?6 fad) showed a higher magnitude of response in Lean fish, which was reflected in liver fatty acid composition. Fatty acid synthase (FAS) was also up-regulated by VO and the effect was independent of genotype. Genetic background of the fish clearly affected regulation of lipid metabolism, as PPAR? and PPAR? were down-regulated by the VO diet only in Lean fish, while in Fat salmon SREBP-1 expression was up-regulated by VO. In addition, all three genes had a lower expression in the Lean family group than in the Fat, when fed VO. Differences in muscle adiposity between family groups may have been caused by higher levels of hepatic fatty acid and glycerophospholipid synthesis in the Fat fish, as indicated by the expression of FAS, 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase and lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase 2. This study has identified metabolic pathways and key regulators that may respond differently to alternative plant-based feeds depending on genotype. Further studies are required but data suggest that it will be possible to identify families better adapted to alternative diet formulations that might be appropriate for future genetic selection programmes.

15685537	20050203	Mechanisms of resistance to imatinib mesylate in gastrointestinal stromal tumors and activity of the PKC412 inhibitor against imatinib-resistant mutants.	Resistance is a major challenge in the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). We investigated the mechanisms of resistance in patients with progressive GISTs with primary KIT mutations and the efficacy of the kinase inhibitor PKC412 for the inhibition of imatinib-resistant mutants. We performed a cytogenetic analysis and screened for mutations of the KIT and PDGFRA kinase domains in 26 resistant GISTs. KIT autophosphorylation status was assessed by Western immunoblotting. Imatinib-resistant GIST cells and Ba/F3 cells expressing these mutant proteins were tested for sensitivity to imatinib and PKC412. Six distinct secondary mutations in KIT were detected in 12 progressive tumors, with V654A and T670I found to be recurrent. One progressive tumor showed acquired PDGFRA -D842V mutation. Amplification of KIT or KIT / PDGFRA was found in 2 patients. Eight of 10 progressive tumors available for analysis showed phosphorylated KIT. Two remaining progressive tumors lost KIT protein expression. GIST cells carrying KIT -del557-558/T670I or KIT -InsAY502-503/V654A mutations were resistant to imatinib, while PKC412 significantly inhibited autophosporylation of these mutants. Resistance to imatinib and sensitivity to PKC412 of KIT -T670I and PDGFRA -D842V mutants was confirmed using Ba/F3 cells. This study shows the high frequency of KIT/PDGFRA kinase domain mutations in patients with secondary resistance and defines genomic amplification of KIT / PDGFRA as an alternative cause of resistance to the drug. In a subset of patients, cancer cells lost their dependence on the targeted tyrosine kinase. Our findings show the sensitivity of the imatinib-resistant KIT -T670I and KIT -V654A and of PDGFRA -D842V mutants to PKC412. 	Gastroenterology	D016428 D013485
1380206	19920801	Beta-thalassemia intermedia with exceptionally high hemoglobin A2: relationship to mutations in the beta-gene promoter.	Small deletions of the 5' portion of the beta-globin gene that remove the promoters but stop 3' to the delta-globin gene are recognized as the sole cause of beta-thalassemia with exceptionally high hemoglobin A2 (HbA2) levels. Two patients with beta-thalassemia intermedia and exceptionally high levels of HbA2 (10.4 and 12.0%) were examined. One patient was a combined heterozygote for the -88 C----T and a novel -87 C----A mutation, while the other was homozygous for the -29 A----G beta(+)-thalassemia mutation. The remainder of the beta genes were normal. There was no evidence for deletions involving the 5' portion of the beta gene or the region between the beta and delta genes. Gene mapping studies excluded the possibility of a beta delta-anti-Lepore hemoglobin gene with beta promoters and delta coding sequences. There were no mutations in the promoters of the G gamma or A gamma-globin genes that have been associated with the hereditary persistence of HbF phenotype. The delta-globin gene promoters were normal from codon 17 to position -145 relative to the mRNA capping site. There appears to be considerable heterogeneity of HbA2 and HbF levels in patients who are homozygous or mixed heterozygotes for mutations in the TATA box and other promoter elements of the beta-globin gene. The capacity for proteolysis within the erythrocyte may vary among individuals. The authors hypothesize that in the exceptionally high HbA2 beta-thalassemia intermedia phenotype, proteolysis of superfluous alpha-globin chains is less efficient than in patients with customary levels of HbA2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) 	Am._J._Med._Sci.

22500757	20120417	pH-responsive titratable inotropic performance of histidine-modified cardiac troponin I.	Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) functions as the molecular switch of the thin filament. Studies have shown that a histidine button engineered into cTnI (cTnI A164H) specifically enhances inotropic function in the context of numerous pathophysiological challenges. To gain mechanistic insight into the basis of this finding, we analyzed histidine ionization states in?vitro by studying the myofilament biophysics of amino acid substitutions that act as constitutive chemical mimetics of altered histidine ionization. We also assessed the role of histidine-modified cTnI in?silico by means of molecular dynamics simulations. A functional in?vitro analysis of myocytes at baseline (pH 7.4) indicated similar cellular contractile function and myofilament calcium sensitivity between myocytes expressing wild-type (WT) cTnI and cTnI A164H, whereas the A164R variant showed increased myofilament calcium sensitivity. Under acidic conditions, compared with WT myocytes, the myocytes expressing cTnI A164H maintained a contractile performance similar to that observed for the constitutively protonated cTnI A164R variant. Molecular dynamics simulations showed similar intermolecular atomic contacts between the WT and the deprotonated cTnI A164H variant. In contrast, simulations of protonated cTnI A164H showed various potential structural configurations, one of which included a salt bridge between His-164 of cTnI and Glu-19 of cTnC. This salt bridge was recapitulated in simulations of the cTnI A164R variant. These data suggest that differential histidine ionization may be necessary for cTnI A164H to act as a molecular sensor capable of modulating sarcomere performance in response to changes in the cytosolic milieu.

26731745	20160106	Platoon Interactions and Real-World Traffic Simulation and Validation Based on the LWR-IM.	Platoon based traffic flow models form the underlying theoretical framework in traffic simulation tools. They are essentially important in facilitating efficient performance calculation and evaluation in urban traffic networks. For this purpose, a new platoon-based macroscopic model called the LWR-IM has been developed in [1]. Preliminary analytical validation conducted previously has proven the feasibility of the model. In this paper, the LWR-IM is further enhanced with algorithms that describe platoon interactions in urban arterials. The LWR-IM and the proposed platoon interaction algorithms are implemented in the real-world class I and class II urban arterials. Another purpose of the work is to perform quantitative validation to investigate the validity and ability of the LWR-IM and its underlying algorithms to describe platoon interactions and simulate performance indices that closely resemble the real traffic situations. The quantitative validation of the LWR-IM is achieved by performing a two-sampled t-test on queues simulated by the LWR-IM and real queues observed at these real-world locations. The results reveal insignificant differences of simulated queues with real queues where the p-values produced concluded that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Thus, the quantitative validation further proved the validity of the LWR-IM and the embedded platoon interactions algorithm for the intended purpose. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
19752398	20090916	Genetic variation at the NPC1L1 gene locus, plasma lipoproteins, and heart disease risk in the elderly.	Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein (NPC1L1) plays a critical role in intestinal cholesterol absorption. Our objective was to examine whether five variants (-133A&gt;G, -18A&gt;C, L272L, V1296V, and U3_28650A&gt;G) at the NPC1L1 gene have effects on lipid levels, prevalence, and incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and lipid-lowering response to pravastatin. We studied 5,804 elderly participants from the PROSPER study, who were randomized to prava-statin 40 mg/day or placebo and were followed on average for 3.2 years. In the adjusted gender-pooled analyses, homozygous carriers of the minor alleles at four NPC1L1 sites (-18A&gt;C, L272L, V1296V, and U3_28650A&gt;G, minor allele frequencies 0.15-0.33) had 2-8% higher LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels at baseline than homozygous carriers of the common alleles (P &lt; 0.05). Homozygotes for the rare alleles also had a significant increase in the risk of CHD events on trial (range of hazard ratios 1.50-1.67; P &lt; 0.02), regardless of the treatment regimen. The -133 A&gt;G polymorphism and not other variants was associated with 6 month LDL-C lowering (P = 0.02). Our data indicate that variation in the NPC1L1 gene is associated with plasma total and LDL-C levels and CHD risk. 	J._Lipid_Res.	D016428 D016449 D052061 D013486
27863764	20161120	Diagnosis and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia: recommendations from the Brazilian Group of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is characterized by clonal proliferation and progressive accumulation of B-cell lymphocytes that typically express CD19+, CD5+and CD23+. The lymphocytes usually infiltrate the bone marrow, peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and spleen. The diagnosis is established by immunophenotyping circulating B-lymphocytes, and prognosis is defined by two staging systems (Rai and Binet) established by physical examination and blood counts, as well as by several biological and genetic markers. In this update, we present the recommendations from the Brazilian Group of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The following recommendations are based on an extensive literature review with the aim of contributing to more uniform patient care in Brazil and possibly in other countries with a similar social-economic profile.

18056999	20071207	Mechanism of small heat shock protein function in vivo: a knock-in mouse model demonstrates that the R49C mutation in alpha A-crystallin enhances protein insolubility and cell death.	alphaA-crystallin (Cryaa/HSPB4) is a small heat shock protein and molecular chaperone that prevents nonspecific aggregation of denaturing proteins. Several point mutations in the alphaA-crystallin gene cause congenital human cataracts by unknown mechanisms. We took a novel approach to investigate the molecular mechanism of cataract formation in vivo by creating gene knock-in mice expressing the arginine 49 to cysteine mutation (R49C) in alphaA-crystallin (alphaA-R49C). This mutation has been linked with autosomal dominant hereditary cataracts in a four-generation Caucasian family. Homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells was performed using a plasmid containing the C to T transition in exon 1 of the cryaa gene. alphaA-R49C heterozygosity led to early cataracts characterized by nuclear opacities. Unexpectedly, alphaA-R49C homozygosity led to small eye phenotype and severe cataracts at birth. Wild type littermates did not show these abnormalities. Lens fiber cells of alphaA-R49C homozygous mice displayed an increase in cell death by apoptosis mediated by a 5-fold decrease in phosphorylated Bad, an anti-apoptotic protein, but an increase in Bcl-2 expression. However, proliferation measured by in vivo bromodeoxyuridine labeling did not decline. The alphaA-R49C heterozygous and homozygous knock-in lenses demonstrated an increase in insoluble alphaA-crystallin and alphaB-crystallin and a surprising increase in expression of cytoplasmic gamma-crystallin, whereas no changes in beta-crystallin were observed. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed increased interaction between alphaA-crystallin and lens substrate proteins in the heterozygous knock-in lenses. To our knowledge this is the first knock-in mouse model for a crystallin mutation causing hereditary human cataract and establishes that alphaA-R49C promotes protein insolubility and cell death in vivo.

26795595	20160123	detectMITE: A novel approach to detect miniature inverted repeat transposable elements in genomes.	Miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are prevalent in eukaryotic genomes, including plants and animals. Classified as a type of non-autonomous DNA transposable elements, they play important roles in genome organization and evolution. Comprehensive and accurate genome-wide detection of MITEs in various eukaryotic genomes can improve our understanding of their origins, transposition processes, regulatory mechanisms, and biological relevance with regard to gene structures, expression, and regulation. In this paper, we present a new MATLAB-based program called detectMITE that employs a novel numeric calculation algorithm to replace conventional string matching algorithms in MITE detection, adopts the Lempel-Ziv complexity algorithm to filter out MITE candidates with low complexity, and utilizes the powerful clustering program CD-HIT to cluster similar MITEs into MITE families. Using the rice genome as test data, we found that detectMITE can more accurately, comprehensively, and efficiently detect MITEs on a genome-wide scale than other popular MITE detection tools. Through comparison with the potential MITEs annotated in Repbase, the widely used eukaryotic repeat database, detectMITE has been shown to find known and novel MITEs with a complete structure and full-length copies in the genome. detectMITE is an open source tool (https://sourceforge.net/projects/detectmite).

12753658	20030520	TNF-alpha polymorphisms and type 2 diabetes mellitus in Taiwanese patients.	Type 2 diabetic mellitus (type 2 DM) comprises more than 95% of all Taiwanese patients with DM. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression is linked with insulin resistance, and is under strong genetic control. The correlation between TNF promoter genotypes and type 2 DM is still controversial, because discrepancies among different studies exist. Ethnic differences play certain roles in these conflicting results, because the distribution of TNF promoter polymorphisms is different among study subjects with different racial origins. Therefore, we examined the relationship between the incidence of type 2 diabetes in Taiwanese and two polymorphisms of the TNF-alpha promoter region (positions -238 and -308) as well as the correlation between these polymorphisms and the patients' biochemical manifestations. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells of 261 Taiwanese patients with type 2 DM and 189 non-diabetic control study subjects, and their TNF promoter G-238A and G-308A polymorphisms were analyzed by PCR-RFLP analysis. No significant association between TNF-alpha G-238A and G-308A polymorphisms with type 2 diabetic incidence was observed. However, associations between TNF-alpha G-238A and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and between G-308A promoter polymorphism and high-fasting plasma glucose levels, using multiple linear regression analysis with adjustment for the subjects' age, sex, body mass index and diabetic status, were found. Our results suggested that though TNF-alpha G-238A and G-308A polymorphisms were not involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 DM, type 2 diabetic patients carrying TNFA-A or TNF-308*2 genotype might be more susceptible to diabetic complications such as atherosclerosis.

23118860	20121103	Amino acid substitutions of MagA in Klebsiella pneumoniae affect the biosynthesis of the capsular polysaccharide.	Mucoviscosity-associated gene A (magA) of Klebsiella pneumoniae contributes to K1 capsular polysaccharide (CPS) biosynthesis. Based on sequence homology and gene alignment, the magA gene has been predicted to encode a Wzy-type CPS polymerase. Sequence alignment with the Wzy_C and RfaL protein families (which catalyze CPS or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis) and topological analysis has suggested that eight highly conserved residues, including G308, G310, G334, G337, R290, P305, H323, and N324, were located in a hypothetical loop region. Therefore, we used site-directed mutagenesis to study the role of these residues in CPS production, and to observe the consequent phenotypes such as mucoviscosity, serum and phagocytosis resistance, and virulence (as assessed in mice) in pyogenic liver abscess strain NTUH-K2044. Alanine substitutions at R290 or H323 abolished all of these properties. The G308A mutant was severely impaired for these functions. The G334A mutant remained mucoid with decreased CPS production, but its virulence was significantly reduced in vivo. No phenotypic change was observed for strains harboring magA G310A, G337A, P305A, or N324A mutations. Therefore, R290, G308, H323, and G334 are functionally important residues of the MagA (Wzy) protein of K. pneumoniae NTUH-K2044, capsular type K1. These amino acids are also likely to be important for the function of Wzy in other capsular types in K. pneumoniae and other species bearing Wzy_C family proteins. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
23861789	20130718	Wildtype and A30P mutant alpha-synuclein form different fibril structures.	Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. One of the key players in the development of the disease is the protein ?-synuclein (aSN), which aggregates in the brain of PD patients. The aSN mutant A30P has been reported to cause early-onset familial PD and shows different aggregation behavior compared to wt aSN. Here we use a multidisciplinary approach to compare the aggregation process of wt and A30P aSN. In agreement with previous studies, we observe an initial lag phase followed by a continuous structural development of fibrils until reaching an apparent monomer-aggregate equilibrium state and a plateau in Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence intensity. However, at later timepoints A30P shows greater propensity than ?SN wt to form dense bundled fibril networks. Combining small angle x-ray scattering, x-ray fibre diffraction and linear dichroism, we demonstrate that while the microscopic structure of the individual fibril essentially remains constant throughout the experiment, the formation of dense A30P fibril networks occur through a continuous assembly pathway while the formation of less dense wt fibril networks with fewer contact points follows a continuous path during the elongation phase and a second rearrangement phase after reaching the ThT fluorescence plateau. Our work thus highlights that structural rearrangements proceed beyond the plateau in ThT-based monitoring of the fibrillation process, and the density and morphology of the resulting fibril networks is highly dependent on the aSN form studied.

22927710	20120829	Genetic markers of cardiovascular disease in rheumatoid arthritis.	Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the most common cause of premature mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is the result of an accelerated atherosclerotic process. Both RA and atherosclerosis are complex polygenic diseases. Besides traditional CV risk factors and chronic inflammation, a number of studies have confirmed the role of genetic factors in the development of the atherogenesis observed in RA. In this regard, besides a strong association between the HLA-DRB1?04 shared epitope alleles and both endothelial dysfunction, an early step in the atherosclerotic process, and clinically evident CV disease, other polymorphisms belonging to genes implicated in inflammatory and metabolic pathways, located inside and outside the HLA region, such as the 308 variant (G &gt; A, rs1800629) of the TNFA locus, the rs1801131 polymorphism (A &gt; C; position + 1298) of the MTHFR locus, or a deletion of 32 base pairs on the CCR5 gene, seem to be associated with the risk of CV disease in patients with RA. Despite considerable effort to decipher the genetic basis of CV disease in RA, further studies are required to better establish the genetic influence in the increased risk of CV events observed in patients with RA.

25096197	20140807	Concommitant adaptation of a GH11 xylanase by directed evolution to create an alkali-tolerant/thermophilic enzyme.	As part of an ongoing directed evolution program, the catalytic performance of the Xylanase A from Bacillus subtilis (XynA), which presents temperature and pH optima of 50?C and 6.0, respectively, has been enhanced to create a highly thermostable and alkali-tolerant enzyme. A library of random XynA mutants generated by error-prone polymerase chain reaction was screened by halo formation on agar containing xylan at pH 8.0. Two mutants showing higher catalytic activity at elevated pH in relation to the wild-type XynA were selected, and pooled with a further 5 XynA variants selected by screening thermostable XynA obtained from a previous directed evolution study for activity at alkaline pH. This pool of variants was used as a template for a further round of error-prone polymerase chain reaction and DNase fragment shuffling, with screening at pH 12.0 at 55?C. Selected mutants were subjected to further DNase shuffling, and a final round of screening at pH 12.0 and 80?C. A XynA variant containing eight mutations was isolated (Q7H/G13R/S22P/S31Y/T44A/I51V/I107L/S179C) that presented a temperature optimum of 80?C, a 3-fold increase in the specific activity compared with the wild-type enzyme at pH 8.0, and a 50% loss of activity (t50) of 60 min at 80?C (wild type &lt;2 min). This directed evolution strategy therefore allows the concomitant adaption of increased thermostability and alkali tolerance of an endo-xylanase. 	Protein_Eng._Des._Sel.	D016428 D013485
12297979	20020926	Frequency of the Amsterdam criteria in a regional German cohort of patients with colorectal cancer.	Estimates of the colon cancer burden associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) vary from less than 1 % to more than 5 %. Amsterdam criteria fulfilled within a kindred (classic Amsterdam and Amsterdam II criteria) are widely used to identify patients prone to HNPCC. The present study was initiated to assess the frequency of the Amsterdam criteria within a regional German cohort of 207 patients with a history of colorectal cancer (CRC). Data on individual and family cancer histories were available in 154 patients (73 women, 81 men; mean age at diagnosis 62.4 +/- 13.3 years). A total of 843 first degree relatives have been identified within the kindreds of whom 121 had verified cancers. In 28 of 154 families (18 %), at least one first degree relative of the index patient had CRC. With respect to a typical family history, five kindreds (3.2 %) were likely to suffer from HNPCC on a clinical basis (4 kindreds met the classic Amsterdam criteria and one kindred the Amsterdam II criteria). Testing for microsatellite instability could additionally be performed in 4 of 5 patients who met the Amsterdam criteria and revealed DNA instability in 3 cases. Moreover, a missense mutation of MSH2 (Gly965Asp) was detected in one patient with microsatellite instability. Based on the classic Amsterdam and Amsterdam II criteria approximately 3 % of a regional German cohort of patients with CRC are likely to suffer from HNPCC. However, the final diagnosis of HNPCC can only be established by detection of pathogenic germline mutations within the DNA mismatch repair genes. 	Z_Gastroenterol	D016428 D013485
23643458	20130507	Evaluation of memory endophenotypes for association with CLU, CR1, and PICALM variants in black and white subjects.	Genetic variants at the CLU, CR1, and PICALM loci associate with risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in genomewide association studies. In this study, our aim was to determine whether the LOAD risk variants at these three loci influence memory endophenotypes in black and white subjects. We pursued an association study between single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes at the CLU, CR1, and PICALM loci and memory endophenotypes. We assessed black subjects (AA series: 44 with LOAD and 224 control subjects) recruited at Mayo Clinic Florida and whites recruited at Mayo Clinic Minnesota (RS series: 372 with LOAD and 1690 control subjects) and Florida (JS series: 60 with LOAD and 529 control subjects). Single nucleotide polymorphisms at the LOAD risk loci CLU (rs11136000), CR1 (rs6656401, rs3818361), and PICALM (rs3851179) were genotyped and tested for association with Logical Memory immediate recall, Logical Memory delayed recall, Logical Memory percent retention, Visual Reproduction immediate recall, Visual Reproduction delayed recall, and Visual Reproduction percent retention scores from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised using multivariable linear regression analysis, adjusting for age at exam, sex, education, and apolipoprotein E ?4 dosage. We identified nominally significant or suggestive associations between the LOAD-risky CR1 variants and worse Logical Memory immediate recall scores in blacks (P = .068-.046, ? = -2.7 to -1.2). The LOAD-protective CLU variant is associated with better logical memory endophenotypes in white subjects (P = .099-.027, ? = 0.31-0.93). The CR1 associations persisted when the control subjects from the AA series were assessed separately. The CLU associations appeared to be driven by one of the white series (RS) and were also observed when the control subset from RS was analyzed. These results suggest for the first time that LOAD risk variants at CR1 may influence memory endophenotypes in blacks. In addition, the CLU LOAD-protective variant may confer enhanced memory in whites. Although these results would not remain significant after stringent corrections for multiple testing, they need to be considered in the context of the LOAD associations with which they have biological consistency. They also provide estimates for effect sizes on memory endophenotypes that could guide future studies. The detection of memory effects for these variants in clinically normal subjects, implies that these LOAD risk loci might modify memory prior to clinical diagnosis of AD.

17234651	20070120	The TNFRSF1A R92Q mutation is frequent in rheumatoid arthritis but shows no evidence for association or linkage with the disease.	TNFRSF1A mutations cause TNFRSF1A-associated periodic syndrome (MIM#142680). A recent study suggested that the R92Q mutation was associated with polyarthritis. We aimed to search for this and other TNFRSF1A mutations in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to test for linkage. The DNA of 100 trio families and 86 index cases of RA-affected sib-pair (ASP) families from the French Caucasian population were investigated by denatured high-performance liquid chromatography for TNFRSF1A mutations in exons 2 to 4. The test for association compared cases and controls (derived from un-transmitted parental chromosomes). The test for linkage relied on the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) in trio families and cosegregation in ASP families. Only the R92Q mutation was detected--in 2 of the 100 index cases of trio families and in 5 (5.8%) of the index cases of ASP families, but also in 5% of the controls, showing no association with the disease. No RA linkage evidence was found in TDT and ASP RA families. This TNFRSF1A investigation in RA from the French Caucasian population showed only the R92Q mutation, with a frequency of 4.5%, but no evidence for RA association or linkage to the disease. The R92Q mutation could be considered to be a low-penetrance variant. 	Ann._Rheum._Dis.	D016428 D013485
7543385	19950301	Skipping of exon 12 as a consequence of a point mutation (1898 + 5G--&gt;T) in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene found in a consanguineous Chinese family.	A point mutation (1898 + 5G--&gt;T) located five base pairs downstream from the donor splice site in intron 12 of the CFTR gene has been identified in a consanguineous CF patient of Chinese origin. To determine if this nucleotide substitution could affect mRNA splicing, PCR analysis was performed with RNA isolated from the lymphoblastoid cell line of the mother of the deceased patient. While exon 12-minus transcript was detected in this sample, it was also found in individuals without 1898 + 5G--&gt;T, albeit in a smaller proportion. Using a sequence polymorphism associated with each of the two alleles in the mother, however, we showed that mutant transcript was almost exclusively produced by the 1898 + 5G--&gt;T allele. Skipping of exon 12 would result in the deletion of 29 amino acids from the first nucleotide binding domain of CFTR, rendering the protein non-functional. The possibility of a low level (&lt; or = 2.5%) of normal transcript from the mutant allele cannot be excluded and it may explain the pancreatic sufficient phenotype of the patient. The 1898 + 5G--&gt;T mutation was found in two other CF patients of Chinese origin, but it was not detected in 192 CF chromosomes of Caucasian origin and 30 other chromosomes from Chinese individuals without a family history of CF.

27007662	20160324	Risk of bradykinin B2 receptor -58T/C gene polymorphism on hypertension: A meta-analysis.	The risk of bradykinin B2 receptor (BDKRB2)-58T/C gene polymorphism on hypertension remains controversial. The Cochrane Library, Chinese Biomedical Database, EBSCO, Embase, ISI, MEDLINE, and PubMed were retrieved, and relevant articles were selected. The significant association between BDKRB2 -58T/C gene polymorphism and risk of hypertension were found under C-allele comparison (odds ratio (OR): 1.22, 95% confidential intervals (CI): 1.05-1.42), recessive model (OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.07-1.64), dominant model (OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.58-0.94), homozygote model (OR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.11-2.47) and heterozygote model (OR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.06-1.43). The magnitude of the association between the BDKRB2-58T/C gene polymorphism and risk of hypertension was substantiated in Asians under C-allele comparison (OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.04-1.49), recessive model (OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.04-1.86), dominant model (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.56-0.93), homozygote model (OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.09-2.90) and heterozygote model (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.07-1.49). No publication bias was found in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis suggested -58C allele and -58CC genotype increase the risk of hypertension in Asians and African-Americans. Inversely, -58TT genotype decreases the risk of hypertension in Asians and African-Americans. 	Nephrology_(Carlton)	D016428 D017418 D016454
27195345	20160520		In August 2010, the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) published an Optimal Therapy Report which assessed the clinical and cost-effectiveness of second-line therapies for patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin. The results from the CADTH review indicated that there were no apparent differences in efficacy across drug classes, and that sulfonylureas were the most cost-effective treatment option. Based on these analyses, the Canadian Optimal Medication Prescribing and Utilization Service (COMPUS) Expert Review Committee (CERC) recommended that most patients requiring a second treatment after metformin should be prescribed a sulfonylurea. CADTH followed this report with a Therapeutic Review which examined the evidence for third-line treatment options for adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin and a sulfonylurea. The results demonstrated that insulins (basal, biphasic, bolus), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues, and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) all produced statistically significant reductions in hemoglobin A1C in combination with metformin and a sulphonylurea. Meglitinides and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, however, did not. The addition of insulin neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) to metformin plus a sulfonylurea was associated with the most favourable cost-effectiveness estimates. CADTH?s Therapeutic Review Panel (TRP) recommended that, for most adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin and a sulfonylurea, insulin NPH should be added as the third-line agent. Long-acting insulin analogues at prices similar to insulin NPH were also considered an option for patients inadequately controlled on metformin and a sulfonylurea. The original clinical reviews of second- and third-line pharmacotherapy for type 2 diabetes included GLP-1 analogues and DPP-4 inhibitors currently available in Canada; however, the cost-effectiveness analyses and subsequent recommendations could not address the use of GLP-1 analogues, as there were no agents approved for use in Canada at the time of the reviews. Two GLP-1 analogues, exenatide (Byetta) and liraglutide (Victoza), are now approved for use in Canada. As well, sitagliptin and saxagliptin were the only DPP-4 inhibitors considered in the original economic analyses and recommendations, while agents in this class that were not yet approved by Health Canada (e.g., linagliptin) were excluded. Therefore, there is interest in updated optimal therapy recommendations for second- and third-line therapy in diabetes that incorporate the GLP-1 analogues and newer DPP-4 inhibitors. Since the original CADTH reports were published, interest has emerged in the combined use of incretins and insulin, and some incretins have received regulatory approval for combined use with insulin in Canada and other jurisdictions. Hence, the updated clinical reviews will also address a supplemental research topic regarding the combination use of incretin agents with insulin. 	[Book]	
22476181	20120406	[Spleen infarction and S hemoglobinopathies S in the high altitude lands].	The hemoglobin S is a consequence of the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at position 6 of beta globin chain. The problem arises when some individuals with Hb S is moved to the mountains and exposed to hypoxia. The decrease in oxygen saturation distorts the red blood cell with HbS-shaped crescent (sickle cell). Sickle cell (rigid and fragile) tends to adhere to the other red blood cells, generating a series of intravascular alterations that can lead to tissue ischemia or infarction. The spleen by type of movement and lack of lateral communications between the branches of the splenic artery was the most susceptible to sickle cell crisis. Splenic infarction at altitude corresponding to different circumstances can evolve in three stages: a) Acute (focal, uncomplicated), b) massive attack (more than 50% of parenchyma) and c) spontaneous rupture.Early diagnosis is crucial, allowing the quick and timely introduction of various measures, including adequate hydration and oxygenation continues until its evacuation to lower altitude locations. These measures would reduce the phenomenon of sickle and some patients may overcome this acute trance without major complications. The delay in diagnosis leads to action that can exacerbate tissue hypoxia and cause ischemia or infarction of various organs. A large population of black and mixed race of African descent living in the Peruvian coast, 10% and 2% respectively have hemoglobin S; Caucasian subjects with Mediterranean ancestry this hemoglobin also can carry. It is therefore essential to disseminate within the clinicians working in regions of high status and to thus prevent potentially fatal complications in patients with Hb S; is also essential to promote preventive measures for individuals with African or Mediterranean ancestry know their sickle cell status before traveling to places above 2,500 m.

27720678	20161011	A novel missense mutation of NDP in a Chinese family with X-linked familial exudative vitreoretinopathy.	Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is a hereditary ocular disorder characterized by a failure of peripheral retinal vascularization. In this report, we describe a novel missense mutation of the Norrie disease gene (NDP) in a Chinese family with X-linked FEVR. Ophthalmologic evaluation was performed on four male patients and seven unaffected individuals after informed consent was obtained. Venous blood was collected from the 11 members of this family, and genomic DNA was extracted using standard methods. The coding exons 2 and 3 and their corresponding exon-intron junctions of NDP were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and then subjected to direct DNA sequencing. A novel missense mutation (c.310A&gt;C) in exon 3, leading to a lysine-to-glutamine substitution at position 104 (p.Lys104Gln), was identified in all four patients with X-linked FEVR. Three unaffected female individuals (III2, IV3, and IV11) were found to be carriers of the mutation. This mutation was not detected in other unaffected individuals. The mutation c.310A&gt;C (p.Lys104Gln) in exon 3 of NDP is associated with FEVR in the studied family. This result further enriches the mutation spectrum of FEVR. 	J_Chin_Med_Assoc	D016428
27957076	20161214	Observations Of Electrical Coupling Index Using the Contact? System During Pulmonary Vein Electrical Isolation Procedures.	The Contact (St Jude Medical) System uses a novel impedance- based measure of Electrical Coupling Index (ECI) to assess the quality of catheter tip to endocardium contact. We sought to establish average ECI measurements and behaviour during pulmonary vein (PV) isolation procedures. Forty-five patients undergoing PV isolation for atrial fibrillation (AF) were studied.'Non-contact' and upper range 'in-contact' catheter positioning was performed for system calibration. ECI measurements were recorded pre-ablation at 14 standardized locations around the PV antra. The mean ECI non-contact value was 77 ? 11 (range 63-107); the mean upper range in-contact value was 111 ? 16 (range 81-145). Mean ECI values pre-ablation around the PV antra ranged from 85 ? 18 to 107 ? 19. A trend towards higher mean ECI values was noted with increasing body mass index (BMI). Pre-ablation mean ECI values were 92 ? 10 (BMI 20-25), 95 ? 12 (BMI 26-30) and 104 ? 11 (BMI &gt;30) (p&lt; 0.01 for 20-25 vs. &gt;30). A positive correlation was noted for mean pre-ablation ECI values and BMI (r=0.50). An expected range of ECI values during PV isolation has been documented in this study. Observed ECI values correlate with patient BMI. The potential limitations of the current generation Contact System and scope for future clinical applications are discussed.

22020298	20111025	Tubulin tyrosine ligase structure reveals adaptation of an ancient fold to bind and modify tubulin.	Tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL) catalyzes the post-translational C-terminal tyrosination of ?-tubulin. Tyrosination regulates recruitment of microtubule-interacting proteins. TTL is essential. Its loss causes morphogenic abnormalities and is associated with cancers of poor prognosis. We present the first crystal structure of TTL (from Xenopus tropicalis), defining the structural scaffold upon which the diverse TTL-like family of tubulin-modifying enzymes is built. TTL recognizes tubulin using a bipartite strategy. It engages the tubulin tail through low-affinity, high-specificity interactions, and co-opts what is otherwise a homo-oligomerization interface in structurally related ATP grasp-fold enzymes to form a tight hetero-oligomeric complex with the tubulin body. Small-angle X-ray scattering and functional analyses reveal that TTL forms an elongated complex with the tubulin dimer and prevents its incorporation into microtubules by capping the tubulin longitudinal interface, possibly modulating the partition of tubulin between monomeric and polymeric forms.

18685869	20080808	TGF-beta1 gene polymorphisms and primary vesicoureteral reflux in childhood.	The aim of this study was to assess the association between the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) gene polymorphisms rs1800469 (commonly known as T-509C) and rs1982073 (commonly known as Leu (10)--&gt;Pro) and primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and renal scarring. Using a case-control approach, we examined 121 children with primary VUR and 169 controls. Genotyping of the TGF-beta1 gene polymorphisms was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The (99m)Tc-DMSA- or (99m)Tc-unitiol-single photon emission computed tomography method was used to evaluate renal scars in 84 of 121 VUR children. Statistical analysis revealed differences in rs1800469 genotype frequencies between VUR patients and controls (p = 0.0021). Our data demonstrate that individuals homozygous for the TT genotype are at risk of primary VUR [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 2.7 (1.46-5.08)]. Distribution of the rs1982073 polymorphism was similar in VUR children and controls. In terms of renal scarring, patients were stratified into non-scar and scar subgroups, and no differences in the genotype frequencies of either polymorphism was found. Previous reports have shown that the TT genotype of the rs1800469 polymorphism is a risk factor for renal scarring in primary VUR, and the results of our study suggest that this same polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to this congenital uropathy.

12915772	20030814	Association of uteroglobulin-related protein 1 with bronchial asthma.	Chromosomal region 5q31 harbours a number of genes associated with atopic phenotypes, for example the genes coding for interleukin (IL) 4, IL13 and the beta(2)-adrenoreceptor. A new gene within this region was identified only very recently. The encoded protein - uteroglobin-related protein 1 (UGRP1) - is thought to act as an anti-inflammatory agent and is mainly expressed in the lung and trachea. The functional promoter polymorphism A-112G in UGRP1 was shown to be associated with bronchial asthma in a Japanese population. We were thus interested in finding out whether the polymorphism so far identified or others within UGRP1 were associated with bronchial asthma in a German Caucasian population. We performed direct genomic sequencing of the promoter and coding region of UGRP1 in 15 asthmatic children and 15 controls. The identified polymorphisms were genotyped by means of RFLP. Statistical analysis was performed with the Armitage trend test. We identified 5 non-coding variants, 4 of which being described for the first time. Three polymorphisms were common and typed in 182 asthmatic children and 270 controls. None of the polymorphisms were associated with bronchial asthma in our population. We conclude from our data that UGRP1 does not play a major role in the development of bronchial asthma in our Caucasian population. 	Int._Arch._Allergy_Immunol.	D016428 D013485
25200861	20140910	Estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) genetic variations in cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Emerging published data on the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene and cancer susceptibility are inconsistent. This review and meta-analysis is performed to derive a more precise evaluation of this relationship. The literature search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and CNKI databases was conducted from their inception through June 2014. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the association. Twenty-two literatures were enrolled in this meta-analysis. The results indicated that ESR1 rs1801132 (C&gt;G) was associated with cancer risk in Caucasian populations. However, the results of stratified analysis by cancer type and source of controls indicated that no significant association was found. Furthermore, rs2077647 (A&gt;G) was only associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, but was an adverse effect on cancer risk in Caucasian populations. This present meta-analysis indicated that rs1801132 (C&gt;G) and rs2077647 (A&gt;G) may be protective factors in Caucasian populations. Meanwhile, rs2077647 (A&gt;G) may be closely related with hepatocellular carcinoma. 	Clin_Res_Hepatol_Gastroenterol	D016428 D017418 D016454
24721142	20140412	Identification of two SNPs in myostatin (MSTN) gene of Takifugu rubripes and their association with growth traits.	The myostatin (MSTN) is a member of transforming growth factor-? superfamily which inhibits muscle growth. In this study, the genomic DNA sequence of MSTN gene was cloned from Takifugu rubripes (T. rubripes). Two polymorphisms of the MSTN gene were detected by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and DNA sequencing methods in 296 T. rubripes. One A748G locates in exon 2 and the other, C1197T, in intron 2. Analysis showed that the A748G mutation caused an amino acid change from Thr to Ala (Ala166Glu). These two SNPs showed a low degree of linkage disequilibrium and four haplotypes were identified. The most frequent haplotype was AC, which occurred at a frequency of 44.3%. Association analyses between these two SNPs and growth traits showed that the individuals with genotype CT and TT of the mutation C1197T had significantly higher body mass, body length and body height than those with genotype CC (P &lt; 0.05). These results show that MSTN gene can be utilized as a candidate gene for molecular marker-assisted breeding of T. rubripes. 	Mol._Cell._Probes	D016428 D013485

Extensive laboratory screening showed a low plasma fibrinogen level of approximately l g/l detected by PT-derived fibrinogen assay. The fibrinogen level in the immunological assay was 3 g/l. The functional Clauss assay yielded an intermediate result of 1.78 g/l. During her fourth and fifth pregnancy, the patient received fibrinogen concentrates (Haemocomplettan, CLS Behring, Marburg, Germany), starting with 4 grams of human fibrinogen, followed by 2 grams every second day until the 15(th) week of pregnancy. The further course of these pregnancies was uneventful. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting showed doublet bands in the positions of the high-molecular weight (HMW)- and low-molecular-weight (LMW)-fibrinogen, a single LMW' fibrinogen band, plus additional bands with higher molecular weight than HMW-fibrinogen, which were also reactive with anti-human serum albumin (HSA) antiserum. These bands correspond to variant fibrinogen conjugated with albumin. Reduced SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-fibrinopeptide A antiserum disclosed one additional Aalpha-chain band with lower molecular weight. Amplification and sequencing of exon 5 of the alpha gene indicated heterozygosity for a novel single nucleotide deletion at codon Aalpha494 (C1537delA). His494 is replaced by Pro and this is followed by 23 (LMKLPSSTLPQLEKHSQ VSSHLC) new amino acids before premature truncation after Cys517, yielding a free C-terminal cysteine, which may link with albumin. This new fibrinogen mutation, leads to a balanced array of homo- and heterodimeric fibrinogen molecules, some of which are conjugated to albumin. 	Thromb._Haemost.	D002363 D016428
20110149	20100130	An evolutionary approach to the high frequency of the Delta F508 CFTR mutation in European populations.	The diffusion of the cattle pastoralism across Europe during the Neolithic period was probably accompanied by the emergence and spread of diverse contagious diseases that were unknown in the Paleolithic and that would have affected the frequency of genes directly or indirectly associated with differential susceptibility and/or resistance to infectious pathogens. We therefore propose that the high frequency of the CFTR gene, and in particular, the common Delta F508 allele mutation in current European and European-derived populations might be a consequence of the impact of selective pressures generated by the transmission of pathogenic agents from domesticated animals, mainly bovine cattle, to the man. Intestinal infectious diseases were probably a major health problem for Neolithic peoples. In such a context, a gene mutation that conferred an increased resistance to the diseases caused by pathogens transmitted by dairy cattle would have constituted a definite selective advantage, particularly in those human groups where cow's milk became an essential component of the diet. This selective advantage would be determined by an increased resistance to Cl(-)-secreting diarrheas of those individuals carrying a single copy of the Delta F508 CFTR mutation (heterozygote resistance). This hypothesis is supported by the strong association between the geography of the diffusion of cattle pastoralism (assessed indirectly by the lactase persistence distribution), the geographic distribution of a sizeable number of HLA alleles (as indicative of potential selective pressures generated by epidemic mortality) and the geographic distribution of the most common mutation causing cystic fibrosis (Delta F508). The systematic interaction of humans with infectious pathogens would have begun in northern Europe, among the carriers of the Funnel Beaker Culture, the first farmers of the North European plain, moving progressively to the south with the dissemination of the cattle pastoralism. This gradual exposure to epidemic mortality among populations located further and further south in Europe as cattle pastoralism expanded could have generated differences in CFTR gene frequencies, thereby shaping the latitudinal frequency gradients observed in present-day European populations.

26564798	20151114	Actin- and microtubule-dependent regulation of Golgi morphology by FHDC1.	The Golgi apparatus is the central hub of intracellular trafficking and consists of tethered stacks of cis, medial, and trans cisternae. In mammalian cells, these cisternae are stitched together as a perinuclear Golgi ribbon, which is required for the establishment of cell polarity and normal subcellular organization. We previously identified FHDC1 (also known as INF1) as a unique microtubule-binding member of the formin family of cytoskeletal-remodeling proteins. We show here that endogenous FHDC1 regulates Golgi ribbon formation and has an apparent preferential association with the Golgi-derived microtubule network. Knockdown of FHDC1 expression results in defective Golgi assembly and suggests a role for FHDC1 in maintenance of the Golgi-derived microtubule network. Similarly, overexpression of FHDC1 induces dispersion of the Golgi ribbon into functional ministacks. This effect is independent of centrosome-derived microtubules and instead likely requires the interaction between the FHDC1 microtubule-binding domain and the Golgi-derived microtubule network. These effects also depend on the interaction between the FHDC1 FH2 domain and the actin cytoskeleton. Thus our results suggest that the coordination of actin and microtubule dynamics by FHDC1 is required for normal Golgi ribbon formation. 	Mol._Biol._Cell	D016428 D013485
22163042	20111214	Inhibition of interferon induction and action by the nairovirus Nairobi sheep disease virus/Ganjam virus.	The Nairoviruses are an important group of tick-borne viruses that includes pathogens of man (Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus) and livestock animals (Dugbe virus, Nairobi sheep disease virus (NSDV)). NSDV is found in large parts of East Africa and the Indian subcontinent (where it is known as Ganjam virus). We have investigated the ability of NSDV to antagonise the induction and actions of interferon. Both pathogenic and apathogenic isolates could actively inhibit the induction of type 1 interferon, and also blocked the signalling pathways of both type 1 and type 2 interferons. Using transient expression of viral proteins or sections of viral proteins, these activities all mapped to the ovarian tumour-like protease domain (OTU) found in the viral RNA polymerase. Virus infection, or expression of this OTU domain in transfected cells, led to a great reduction in the incorporation of ubiquitin or ISG15 protein into host cell proteins. Point mutations in the OTU that inhibited the protease activity also prevented it from antagonising interferon induction and action. Interestingly, a mutation at a peripheral site, which had little apparent effect on the ability of the OTU to inhibit ubiquitination and ISG15ylation, removed the ability of the OTU to block the induction of type 1 and the action of type 2 interferons, but had a lesser effect on the ability to block type 1 interferon action, suggesting that targets other than ubiquitin and ISG15 may be involved in the actions of the viral OTU.

11406649	20010615	Truncated typeXVII collagen expression in a patient with non-herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa caused by a homozygous splice-site mutation.	Type XVII collagen (180-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen) is a structural component of hemidesmosomes. Mutations in the type XVII collagen gene (COL17A1) have been established to be the molecular basis of non-Herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB-nH), an inherited skin blistering disorder. Here we report for the first time truncated type XVII collagen expression, caused by homozygosity for a COL17A1 donor splice-site mutation (4261+1 g --&gt; c), which was identified by PCR amplification on genomic DNA. By RT-PCR and sequencing of cDNA derived from mRNA from the patient's cultured keratinocytes, we provide evidence of cryptic splicing and exon skipping, most abundantly of exon 52. JEB-nH patients with COL17A1 splice-site mutations resulting in an exon skip often have no immunologically detectable type XVII collagen. However, in our patient with the generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa subtype, a small amount of type XVII collagen was detectable in the skin, and immunoblotting of cultured keratinocytes revealed that the 180-kDa protein was 10 kDa shorter. We hypothesize that the function of this truncated type XVII collagen polypeptide, which is expressed at low levels, is impaired, explaining the JEB-nH phenotype. 	Lab._Invest.

25866756	20150414	Parkinsonism in spinocerebellar ataxia.	Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) presents heterogeneous clinical phenotypes, and parkinsonism is reported in diverse SCA subtypes. Both levodopa responsive Parkinson disease (PD) like phenotype and atypical parkinsonism have been described especially in SCA2, SCA3, and SCA17 with geographic differences in prevalence. SCA2 is the most frequently reported subtype of SCA related to parkinsonism worldwide. Parkinsonism in SCA2 has unique genetic characteristics, such as low number of expansions and interrupted structures, which may explain the sporadic cases with low penetrance. Parkinsonism in SCA17 is more remarkable in Asian populations especially in Korea. In addition, an unclear cutoff of the pathologic range is the key issue in SCA17 related parkinsonism. SCA3 is more common in western cohorts. SCA6 and SCA8 have also been reported with a PD-like phenotype. Herein, we reviewed the epidemiologic, clinical, genetic, and pathologic features of parkinsonism in SCAs. 	Biomed_Res_Int	D016428 D013485 D016454
14722121	20040115	Residues 110-126 in the A1 domain of factor VIII contain a Ca2+ binding site required for cofactor activity.	Generation of factor VIII cofactor activity requires divalent metal ions such as Ca2+ or Mn2+. Evaluation of cofactor reconstitution from isolated factor VIIIa subunits revealed the presence of a functional Ca2+ binding site within the A1 subunit. Isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrated at least two Ca2+ binding sites of similar affinity (K(d) = 0.74 microm) within the A1 subunit. Mutagenesis of an acidic residue-rich region in the A1 domain (residues 110-126) homologous to a putative Ca2+ binding site in factor V (Zeibdawi, A. R., and Pryzdial, E. L. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 19929-19936) and expression of B-domainless factor VIII molecules yielded reagents to probe Ca2+ and Mn2+ binding in a functional assay. Basal activity observed for wild type factor VIII in a metal ion-free buffer was enhanced approximately 2-fold with saturating Ca2+ or Mn2+ and yielded functional K(d) values of 1.2 and 1.40 microm, respectively. Ca2+ binding affinity was greatly reduced (or lost) in several mutants including E110A, E110D, D116A, E122A, D125A, and D126A. Alternatively, E113A, D115A, and E124A showed wild type-like activity with little or no reduction in Ca2+ affinity. However, Mn2+ affinity was minimally altered except for mutant D125A (and D116A). These results are consistent with region 110-126 serving a critical role for Ca2+ coordination with selected residues capable of contributing to a partially overlapping site for Mn2+, and that occupancy of either site is required for maximal cofactor activity.

24731097	20140416	Essential roles of epithelial bone morphogenetic protein signaling during prostatic development.	Prostate is a male sex-accessory organ. The prostatic epithelia consist primarily of basal and luminal cells that differentiate from embryonic urogenital sinus epithelia. Prostate tumors are believed to originate in the basal and luminal cells. However, factors that promote normal epithelial differentiation have not been well elucidated, particularly for bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signaling. This study shows that Bmp signaling prominently increases during prostatic differentiation in the luminal epithelia, which is monitored by the expression of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8. To elucidate the mechanism of epithelial differentiation and the function of Bmp signaling during prostatic development, conditional male mutant mouse analysis for the epithelial-specific Bmp receptor 1a (Bmpr1a) was performed. We demonstrate that Bmp signaling is indispensable for luminal cell maturation, which regulates basal cell proliferation. Expression of the prostatic epithelial regulatory gene Nkx3.1 was significantly reduced in the Bmpr1a mutants. These results indicate that Bmp signaling is a key factor for prostatic epithelial differentiation, possibly by controlling the prostatic regulatory gene Nkx3.1.

23311859	20130115	Transcription factors in late megakaryopoiesis and related platelet disorders.	Cell type-specific transcription factors regulate the repertoire of genes expressed in a cell and thereby determine its phenotype. The differentiation of megakaryocytes, the platelet progenitors, from hematopoietic stem cells is a well-known process that can be mimicked in culture. However, the efficient formation of platelets in culture remains a challenge. Platelet formation is a complicated process including megakaryocyte maturation, platelet assembly and platelet shedding. We hypothesize that a better understanding of the transcriptional regulation of this process will allow us to influence it such that sufficient numbers of platelets can be produced for clinical applications. After an introduction to gene regulation and platelet formation, this review summarizes the current knowledge of the regulation of platelet formation by the transcription factors EVI1, GATA1, FLI1, NFE2, RUNX1, SRF and its co-factor MKL1, and TAL1. Also covered is how some platelet disorders including myeloproliferative neoplasms, result from disturbances of the transcriptional regulation. These disorders give us invaluable insights into the crucial role these transcription factors play in platelet formation. Finally, there is discussion of how a better understanding of these processes will be needed to allow for efficient production of platelets in vitro. 	J._Thromb._Haemost.	D016428 D013485 D016454
25945683	20150507	Behavioral Abnormalities in Lagotto Romagnolo Dogs with a History of Benign Familial Juvenile Epilepsy: A Long-Term Follow-Up Study.	Lagotto Romagnolo (LR) dogs with benign juvenile epilepsy syndrome often experience spontaneous remission of seizures. The long-term outcome in these dogs currently is unknown. In humans, behavioral and psychiatric comorbidities have been reported in pediatric and adult-onset epilepsies. The objectives of this study were to investigate possible neurobehavioral comorbidities in LR with a history of benign familial juvenile epilepsy (BFJE) and to assess the occurrence of seizures after the remission of seizures in puppyhood. A total of 25 LR with a history of BFJE and 91 control dogs of the same breed. Owners of the LR dogs in the BFJE and control groups completed an online questionnaire about each dog's activity, impulsivity, and inattention. Principal component analysis (PCA) served to extract behavioral factors from the data. We then compared the scores of these factors between the 2 groups in a retrospective case-control study. We also interviewed all dog owners in the BFJE group by telephone to inquire specifically about possible seizures or other neurological problems after remission of seizures as a puppy. Lagotto Romagnolo dogs with BFJE showed significantly higher scores on the factors Inattention and Excitability/Impulsivity than did the control group (P = .003; P = .021, respectively). Only 1 of the 25 BFJE LR exhibited seizures after remission of epilepsy in puppyhood. Although the long-term seizure outcome in BFJE LR seems to be good, the dogs exhibit behavioral abnormalities resembling attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in humans, thus suggesting neurobehavioral comorbidities with epilepsy.

6770057	19800601	Preparation and preliminary biodistribution of &quot;no carrier added&quot; fluorine1-8 fluoroethanol.	No-carrier-added [18F] fluoroethanol has been prepared by two routes. The first involves fluoride-ion displacement on alpha-p-toluene sulfonyl ethyl glycolate followed by reduction of the alpha-fluoroethyl acetate. The second involves a ring-opening reaction on glycol sulfite to give an alpha-fluorosulfinic acid derivative that is hydrolyzed to fluoroethanol. The specific activity was measured as 10(5) Ci/millimole, and the stable fluorine-19 was traced to the cesium hydroxide used to trap the H18F. Following intracarotid injection, the labeled fluoroethanol was not trapped in the brain, and thus is not a microsphere analog as has been suggested. Tomographic images of the myocardium were obtained using the fluoroethanol as a tracer. 	J._Nucl._Med.	D016428 D013487
2681187	19891025	In vitro translocation through the yeast nuclear envelope. Signal-dependent transport requires ATP and calcium.	Nuclei rapidly purified from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a cytochalasin B enucleation procedure are substantially free of cell wall, secretory vesicle, plasma membrane vacuolar, and cytoplasmic and mitochondrial contamination. Nuclei obtained in this manner in high yield retain transport properties comparable to nuclei in situ. An in vitro nuclear import assay system has been developed using isolated nuclei and radiolabeled proteins prepared by a coupled in vitro transcription/translation system. Both wild-type SV40 large T-antigen and nucleoplasmin are imported into isolated yeast nuclei, whereas a missense cytoplasmic mutant of the SV40 large T-antigen (Lys128----Thr) and cytoplasmic dihydrofolate reductase are not imported. Association and import of these proteins in a time- and signal-dependent manner resulted in their protection from trypsin that was tethered to agarose beads. Greater than 70% of the labeled protein harboring a karyophilic signal was imported in a reaction that could be blocked by prior treatment of nuclei with trypsin-agarose. Nuclear accumulation of SV40 large T-antigen and nucleoplasmin was unidirectional, ATP and Ca2+ dependent, and was not inhibited by a vast excess of exogenous nonnuclear competitor protein. This system provides an important new tool in combination with powerful yeast genetic methods for analysis of the mechanism and the apparatus for transport at the nuclear envelope. 	J._Biol._Chem.

24819706	20140514	De novo GLI3 mutation in esophageal atresia: reproducing the phenotypic spectrum of Gli3 defects in murine models.	Esophageal atresia is a common and life-threatening birth defect with a poorly understood etiology. In this study, we analyzed the sequence variants of coding regions for a set of esophageal atresia-related genes including MYCN, SOX2, CHD7, GLI3, FGFR2 and PTEN for mutations using PCR-based target enrichment and next-generation sequencing in 27 patients with esophageal atresia. Genomic copy number variation analysis was performed using Affymetrix SNP 6.0. We found a de novo heterozygous mutation in the N-terminal region of the GLI3 gene (c.332T&gt;C, p.M111T) in a patient with esophageal atresia and hemivertebrae. The N-terminal region (amino acids 1-397) of GLI3 contains the repressor domain, which interacts with SKI family proteins. Using the co-immunoprecipitation assay, we found that interaction of GLI3 with the SKI family protein SKIL was significantly compromised by the p.M111T mutation of GLI3. Thus far, all the identified mutations mapped within the repressor domain of GLI3 were nonsense and frame-shift mutations. In this study, a missense mutation was initially detected in this region. Our finding is the first to link this GLI3 gene mutation with esophageal atresia in humans, which was previously suggested in an animal model. 	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D013485
25596882	20150119	Genetic predictive biomarkers of anti-VEGF treatment response in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration.	Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapies for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) have proven efficacy at a study-population level, although individual patient responses vary, with most of the patients responding well to anti-VEGF therapies, while a few respond poorly. The pathogenesis of AMD is known to have a genetic component, but it is unclear if any particular genotype can predict response to anti-VEGF therapy. With the advent of less expensive genotyping technology, there have been numerous studies within this area. Here we analyze potential biomarker candidates identified that could be used in a clinical setting to predict response to anti-VEGF treatment of nAMD. We analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified from 39 publications. The SNPs that appeared to be of most importance fell into two main groups: those previously associated with AMD pathogenesis and those within the signaling pathway targeted by anti-VEGF therapies. A number of small studies found evidence supporting an association between anti-VEGF treatment response and two SNPs, CFH rs1061170 and VEGFA rs699947, but results from randomized controlled trials found no such association. It is possible that, in the future, the cumulative effect of several high-risk SNPs may prove useful in a clinical setting and that other genetic biomarkers may emerge.

24634862	20140318	Anticipation, anti-glaucoma drug treatment response and phenotype of a Chinese family with glaucoma caused by the Pro370Leu myocilin mutation.	To describe the anticipation and anti-glaucoma drugs response of a Chinese family with juvenile-onset open angle glaucoma (JOAG) caused by the Pro370Leu myocilin (MYOC) mutation. Fifteen members of a three-generation Chinese family with JOAG were recruited to this study. They all underwent ophthalmic common examinations. Patients suspected to have JOAG got an assessment of visual field and optical coherence tomography. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) of four patients were measured at 8, 10, 12, 14, 17 o'clock respectively after using anti-glaucoma drugs. Mutation screening of all MYOC gene coding exons of the participants was performed by using direct sequencing of PCR products. Clinical examinations and pedigree analysis revealed eight family members were suffered from JOAG. Apparent genetics anticipation phenomenon was observed in this family. Their clinical features included elevated IOP of 35-55mmHg, loss of visual field, thinning of retinal nerve fiber layer, and glaucomatous optic disc damage. Noticeably, their intraocular pressure levels could be controlled within normal range at 8 and 10 o'clock by anti-glaucoma drugs, but their IOPs would elevate &gt;21mmHg after 12 o'clock. Seven patients received trabeculectomy produced thin-walled, pale, and saccate filtering blebs maintaining lower intraocular pressure efficiently. Mutation screening indentified a heterozygous C?T missense mutation in the MYOC gene at position 1 109 in exon 3, corresponding to a substitution of a highly conserved proline to leucine at codon 370 in the olfactomedin domain of MYOC. The clinical characteristics of JOAG in this family were 1) genetics anticipation; 2) high IOP; 3) temporay response to anti-glaucoma drugs; 4) filtering surgery produced thin-walled and saccate filtering blebs, helping maintain lower IOP.

26024390	20150530	TP53: an oncogene in disguise.	The standard classification used to define the various cancer genes confines tumor protein p53 (TP53) to the role of a tumor suppressor gene. However, it is now an indisputable fact that many p53 mutants act as oncogenic proteins. This statement is based on multiple arguments including the mutation signature of the TP53 gene in human cancer, the various gains-of-function (GOFs) of the different p53 mutants and the heterogeneous phenotypes developed by knock-in mouse strains modeling several human TP53 mutations. In this review, we will shatter the classical and traditional image of tumor protein p53 (TP53) as a tumor suppressor gene by emphasizing its multiple oncogenic properties that make it a potential therapeutic target that should not be underestimated. Analysis of the data generated by the various cancer genome projects highlights the high frequency of TP53 mutations and reveals that several p53 hotspot mutants are the most common oncoprotein variants expressed in several types of tumors. The use of Muller's classical definition of mutations based on quantitative and qualitative consequences on the protein product, such as 'amorph', 'hypomorph', 'hypermorph' 'neomorph' or 'antimorph', allows a more meaningful assessment of the consequences of cancer gene modifications, their potential clinical significance, and clearly demonstrates that the TP53 gene is an atypical cancer gene.

17541027	20070602	Mouse models for atherosclerosis and pharmaceutical modifiers.	Atherosclerosis is a multifactorial highly-complex disease with numerous etiologies that work synergistically to promote lesion development. The ability to develop preventive and ameliorative treatments will depend on animal models that mimic the human subject metabolically and pathophysiologically and will develop lesions comparable to those in humans. The mouse is the most useful, economic, and valid model for studying atherosclerosis and exploring effective therapeutic approaches. Among the most widely used mouse models for atherosclerosis are apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) and LDL receptor-deficient (LDLr-/-) mice. An up-and-coming model is the ApoE*3Leiden (E3L) transgenic mouse. Here, we review studies that have explored how and to what extent these mice respond to compounds directed at treatment of the risk factors hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, and inflammation. An important outcome of this survey is that the different models used may differ markedly from one another in their response to a specific experimental manipulation. The choice of a model is therefore of critical importance and should take into account the risk factor to be studied and the working spectrum of the compounds tested.

20006382	20091217	Synthesizing and binding dual-mode poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanobubbles for cancer targeting and imaging.	Accurate assessment of tumor boundaries and recognition of occult disease are important oncologic principles in cancer surgeries. However, existing imaging modalities are not optimized for intraoperative cancer imaging applications. We developed a nanobubble (NB) contrast agent for cancer targeting and dual-mode imaging using optical and ultrasound (US) modalities. The contrast agent was fabricated by encapsulating the Texas Red dye in poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) NBs and conjugating NBs with cancer-targeting ligands. Both one-step and three-step cancer-targeting strategies were tested on the LS174T human colon cancer cell line. For the one-step process, NBs were conjugated with the humanized HuCC49 Delta C(H)2 antibody to target the over-expressed TAG-72 antigen. For the three-step process, cancer cells were targeted by successive application of the biotinylated HuCC49 Delta C(H)2 antibody, streptavidin, and the biotinylated NBs. Both one-step and three-step processes successfully targeted the cancer cells with high binding affinity. NB-assisted dual-mode imaging was demonstrated on a gelatin phantom that embedded multiple tumor simulators at different NB concentrations. Simultaneous fluorescence and US images were acquired for these tumor simulators and linear correlations were observed between the fluorescence/US intensities and the NB concentrations. Our research demonstrated the technical feasibility of using the dual-mode NB contrast agent for cancer targeting and simultaneous fluorescence/US imaging. 	Biomaterials	D016428 D013486
23185501	20121128	Passage of a Sendai virus recombinant in embryonated chicken eggs leads to markedly rapid accumulation of U-to-C transitions in a limited region of the viral genome.	The P gene of paramyxoviruses is unique in producing not only P but also &quot;accessory&quot; C and/or V proteins. Successful generation of C- or V-deficient recombinant viruses using a reverse genetics technique has been revealing their importance in viral pathogenesis as well as replication. As for Sendai virus (SeV), the C proteins, a nested set of four polypeptides C', C, Y1, and Y2, have been shown to exert multiple functions in escaping from the host innate immunity, inhibiting virus-induced apoptosis, promoting virus assembly and budding, and regulating viral RNA synthesis. In this study, we subjected the 4C(-) recombinant lacking expression of all four C proteins to serial passages through eggs, and found the rapid emergence of a C-recovered revertant virus. Unlike the SeV strains or the recombinants reported previously or tested in this study, this was caused by an exceptionally quick accumulation of U-to-C transitions in a limited region of the 4C(-) genome causing recovery of the C protein expression. These results suggest that a lack of C proteins could lead unexpectedly to strong selective pressures, and that the C proteins might play more critical roles in SeV replication than ever reported.

24968198	20140627	A virulent strain of deformed wing virus (DWV) of honeybees (Apis mellifera) prevails after Varroa destructor-mediated, or in vitro, transmission.	The globally distributed ectoparasite Varroa destructor is a vector for viral pathogens of the Western honeybee (Apis mellifera), in particular the Iflavirus Deformed Wing Virus (DWV). In the absence of Varroa low levels DWV occur, generally causing asymptomatic infections. Conversely, Varroa-infested colonies show markedly elevated virus levels, increased overwintering colony losses, with impairment of pupal development and symptomatic workers. To determine whether changes in the virus population were due Varroa amplifying and introducing virulent virus strains and/or suppressing the host immune responses, we exposed Varroa-na?ve larvae to oral and Varroa-transmitted DWV. We monitored virus levels and diversity in developing pupae and associated Varroa, the resulting RNAi response and transcriptome changes in the host. Exposed pupae were stratified by Varroa association (presence/absence) and virus levels (low/high) into three groups. Varroa-free pupae all exhibited low levels of a highly diverse DWV population, with those exposed per os (group NV) exhibiting changes in the population composition. Varroa-associated pupae exhibited either low levels of a diverse DWV population (group VL) or high levels of a near-clonal virulent variant of DWV (group VH). These groups and unexposed controls (C) could be also discriminated by principal component analysis of the transcriptome changes observed, which included several genes involved in development and the immune response. All Varroa tested contained a diverse replicating DWV population implying the virulent variant present in group VH, and predominating in RNA-seq analysis of temporally and geographically separate Varroa-infested colonies, was selected upon transmission from Varroa, a conclusion supported by direct injection of pupae in vitro with mixed virus populations. Identification of a virulent variant of DWV, the role of Varroa in its transmission and the resulting host transcriptome changes furthers our understanding of this important viral pathogen of honeybees.

18657335	20080729	Effect of ENPP1/PC-1-K121Q and PPARgamma-Pro12Ala polymorphisms on the genetic susceptibility to T2D in the Tunisian population.	Diabetes mellitus is the most common chronic metabolic disease. The raising diabetes epidemic is unfolding as an interaction between several environmental factors and a genetic predisposition. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the role of the PPARgamma-Pro12Ala and ENPP1-K121Q polymorphisms on type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk in a case-control study in the Tunisian population. To assess for any association of ENPP1-K121Q and PPARgamma-Pro12Ala polymorphisms with T2D risk, we analysed the genotypic and allelic distributions of each variant in the studied cohort. Our results support that the genetic variation at ENPP1-K121Q predisposes to T2D in the Tunisian population after adjustment on gender, age and BMI status (OR=1.55, 95%CI [1.11-2.16], p=0.007). Conversely, the PPARgamma-Pro12Ala variant seems not to have a significant effect on T2D risk in our Tunisian cohort. However, the minor A-allele would convey protection against overweight in the Tunisian population. In fact, the over weighted subjects showed a significantly lower frequency of A-allele than lean controls (OR=0.49, 95%CI [0.25-0.97], p=0.02). In conclusion, our findings support the hypothesis that ENPP1-121Q is involved in the genetic susceptibility of T2D in the Tunisian population, while the PPARgamma-12Ala allele may confer protection against overweight.

26733286	20160107	Distal acroosteolysis, poikiloderma and joint stiffness: a novel laminopathy?	LMNA encodes lamin A and lamin C, two major components of the nuclear lamina, and its pathogenic variants lead to a dozen distinct clinical entities collectively known as laminopathies. Most LMNA-related laminopathies are autosomal dominant but four are autosomal recessive; furthermore, some of the dominant variants have been associated with distinct phenotypes when inherited recessively, further complicating the ability to correlate genotype with phenotype. We report a consanguineous family in which the index presented with an apparently unique constellation of poikiloderma, joint motion restriction and distal acroosteolysis but lacks features of muscle weakness, lipodystrophy, or cardiac or craniofacial involvement. Molecular analysis revealed the presence of a novel homozygous LMNA missense variant (NM_170707.3:c.1774G&gt;A; p.(Gly592Arg)) within an area of autozygome that is not shared by his unaffected siblings. The proposed causal link is further supported by in silico analysis of this variant. Our case suggests an expansion of LMNA allelic disorders to include distal acroosteolysis, poikiloderma and joint stiffness (DAPJ). 	Eur._J._Hum._Genet.	D002363 D016428 D013485
16819291	20060705	Association between excision repair cross-complementation group 1 polymorphism and clinical outcome of platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.	ERCC1 is a DNA repair gene and has been associated with resistance to DNA damaging agents. In this study we hypothesized that a polymorphism of ERCC1 Asn118Asn (C -&gt; T) might affect the platinum-resistance of epithelial ovarian cancer patients to platinum-taxane chemotherapy administered postoperatively. Using the SNapShot assay, we assessed this polymorphism in ERCC1 in 60 ovarian cancer patients. Platinum-resistance was defined as progression on platinum-based chemotherapy or recurrence within 6 months of completing therapy. Although not significant, platinum-resistance was less frequently observed in patients with the C/T+T/T genotype (P=0.064). Multivariate analysis showed that the C/T+T/T genotypes constituted an independent predictive factor of reduced risk of platinum-resistance in ovarian cancer (odds ratio 0.17, 95% confidence interval 0.04-0.74, P=0.018, Fisher's exact test). No significant correlation was observed between overall survival and the ERCC1 polymorphism. Our results suggest that genotyping of the ERCC1 polymorphism Asn118Asn may be useful for predicting the platinum-resistance of epithelial ovarian cancer patients. However, these findings require prospective confirmation. 	Exp._Mol._Med.	D016428 D013485
24586180	20140304	Loss of Trabid, a new negative regulator of the drosophila immune-deficiency pathway at the level of TAK1, reduces life span.	A relatively unexplored nexus in Drosophila Immune deficiency (IMD) pathway is TGF-beta Activating Kinase 1 (TAK1), which triggers both immunity and apoptosis. In a cell culture screen, we identified that Lysine at position 142 was a K63-linked Ubiquitin acceptor site for TAK1, required for signalling. Moreover, Lysine at position 156 functioned as a K48-linked Ubiquitin acceptor site, also necessary for TAK1 activity. The deubiquitinase Trabid interacted with TAK1, reducing immune signalling output and K63-linked ubiquitination. The three tandem Npl4 Zinc Fingers and the catalytic Cysteine at position 518 were required for Trabid activity. Flies deficient for Trabid had a reduced life span due to chronic activation of IMD both systemically as well as in their gut where homeostasis was disrupted. The TAK1-associated Binding Protein 2 (TAB2) was linked with the TAK1-Trabid interaction through its Zinc finger domain that pacified the TAK1 signal. These results indicate an elaborate and multi-tiered mechanism for regulating TAK1 activity and modulating its immune signal. 	PLoS_Genet.	D016428 D013485
26158510	20150710	Atrial Fibrillation Is Associated with a Marker of Endothelial Function and Oxidative Stress in Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction.	Atrial fibrillation (AF), whether silent or symptomatic, is a frequent and severe complication of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous eNOS inhibitor, is a risk factor for endothelial dysfunction. We addressed the relationship between ADMA plasma levels and AF occurrence in AMI. 273 patients hospitalized for AMI were included. Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring (CEM) ?48 hours was recorded and ADMA was measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography on admission blood sample. The incidence of silent and symptomatic AF was 39(14%) and 29 (11%), respectively. AF patients were markedly older than patients without AF (? 20 y). There was a trend towards higher ADMA levels in patients with symptomatic AF than in patients with silent AF or no AF (0.53 vs 0.49 and 0.49 ?mol/L, respectively, p = 0.18,). After matching on age, we found that patients with symptomatic AF had a higher heart rate on admission and a higher rate of patients with LV dysfunction (28% vs. 3%, p = 0.025). Patients who developed symptomatic AF had a higher ADMA level than patients without AF (0.53 vs. 0.43 ?mol/L; p = 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis to estimate symptomatic AF occurrence showed that ADMA was independently associated with symptomatic AF (OR: 2.46 [1.21-5.00], p = 0.013) beyond history of AF, LVEF&lt;40% and elevated HR. We show that high ADMA level is associated with the occurrence of AF. Although no causative role can be concluded from our observational study, our work further supports the hypothesis that endothelial dysfunction is involved in the pathogenesis of AF in AMI.

12866915	20030718	Genetics of the lipoprotein lipase gene and hypertriglyceridaemia.	The aim of this study is to assess whether genetic variation at the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene is related to fasting triglyceride levels or to the presence of vascular disease. Hypertriglyceridaemic patients are genotyped for the N291S, G188E, and P207L variants and the HindIII and PvuII restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the LPL gene. Sequence analysis is carried out on exons 1-9 of the LPL gene for patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia, to search for new gene variants. No differences were found between the patient and control group for the N291S, G188E and P207L variants. The HindIII and PvuII allelic frequencies were found to be similar for patients and controls; however, the frequency of the PvuII P2 allele was higher in patients with vascular disease (allele frequency: 0.56) than patients with no vascular disease (allele frequency, 0.42) (P=0.03). Sequence analysis revealed no exon sequence variants in the LPL gene but two intron sequence variants were found in intron 5 in two patients. 	Br._J._Biomed._Sci.	D016428
26962506	20160311	Effects of platelet-rich plasma on lateral epicondylitis of the elbow: prospective randomized controlled trial.	To evaluate the effects of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) infiltration in patients with lateral epicondylitis of the elbow, through analysis of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) questionnaires. Sixty patients with lateral epicondylitis of the elbow were prospectively randomized and evaluated after receiving infiltration of three milliliters of PRP, or 0.5% neocaine, or dexamethasone. For the scoring process, the patients were asked to fill out the DASH and PRTEE questionnaires on three occasions: on the day of infiltration and 90 and 180 days afterwards. Around 81.7% of the patients who underwent the treatment presented some improvement of the symptoms. The statistical tests showed that there was evidence that the cure rate was unrelated to the substance applied (p?=?0.62). There was also intersection between the confidence intervals of each group, thus demonstrating that the proportions of patients whose symptoms improved were similar in all the groups. At a significance level of 5%, there was no evidence that one treatment was more effective than another, when assessed using the DASH and PRTEE questionnaires. 	Rev_Bras_Ortop	D016428
6837892	19830401	Circulating immune complexes in patients with colorectal cancer.	We have attempted to better define host humoral immune response in neoplasia by quantitating serial circulating immune complex values before and after surgery in patients with primary or metastatic colorectal cancer. Circulating immune complex levels were correlated with serial carcinoembryonic antigen values and tumor courses in patients with primary resectable colorectal cancer (four patients), resectable liver metastases (three patients), diffuse liver metastases treated with regional chemotherapy (three patients), and untreated intrahepatic (one patient) and extrahepatic metastases (one patient). Circulating immune complex levels, as measured by an antigen-nonspecific assay, which utilized 4 percent polyethylene glycol insolubilization, were increased in all patients at presentation (734 delta OD450 +/- 381) when compared with normal human control sera (202 +/- 4, p less than 0.05). No particular relation was found between presenting circulating immune complex levels and tumor burden. Progressive circulating immune complex increases were demonstrated only in patients whose tumors were either completely removed or dramatically responded to regional therapy (that is, when the tumor antigen load, as reflected by the carcinoembryonic antigen value, rapidly diminished). Serum samples obtained at times of presumed antibody excess in the patients with gastrointestinal cancers were found to contain unexpectedly high concentrations of IgA. We believe these data demonstrate the kinetics of circulating immune complex change during tumor course and they have allowed us to begin to identify circulating immune complex components in patients with colorectal cancer. The results confirm our earlier findings in patients with gestational tumors and differ from accepted relations between immune complexes and tumor growth. 	Am._J._Surg.	D016428 D013485 D013487
15773571	20050319	Immunobiochemical analysis of cross-reactive glutathione-S-transferase allergen from different fungal sources.	Clinical observations suggest the presence of cross-reactive allergens. There is a need to identify these cross-reactive allergens to improve the treatment used for allergic disorders. The present study was aimed to identify and characterize a cross-reactive allergenic protein from fungi. Allergen extracts of various fungi viz. Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus fumigatus, Cladosporium herbarum, Curvularia lunata, and Epicoccum purpurascens showed GST enzymatic activity ranging from 0.765 to 1.004 delta340 nm/min/microg where as activity of rGST was 1.123 delta340 nm/min/microg. Immunoblot with GST antibodies showed a band of approximately 26 kDa in all these fungal extracts. Sera of fungal allergy patients showed the presence of IgE antibodies to GST. Rabbit antibodies raised against the fungal extracts reacted with rGST confirming the presence of GST-like protein in these extract. ELISA inhibition using GST antibodies revealed inhibition with C. herbarum, A. alternata, C. lunata, A. fumigatus, and E. purpurascens demonstrating that fungal GST competes for binding to anti-GST. In summary, a GST-like protein was recognized as cross-reactive allergen in these fungal extracts. 	Immunol._Invest.	D016428 D013485
21408011	20110317	The contribution of coevolving residues to the stability of KDO8P synthase.	The evolutionary tree of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate (KDO8P) synthase (KDO8PS), a bacterial enzyme that catalyzes a key step in the biosynthesis of bacterial endotoxin, is evenly divided between metal and non-metal forms, both having similar structures, but diverging in various degrees in amino acid sequence. Mutagenesis, crystallographic and computational studies have established that only a few residues determine whether or not KDO8PS requires a metal for function. The remaining divergence in the amino acid sequence of KDO8PSs is apparently unrelated to the underlying catalytic mechanism. The multiple alignment of all known KDO8PS sequences reveals that several residue pairs coevolved, an indication of their possible linkage to a structural constraint. In this study we investigated by computational means the contribution of coevolving residues to the stability of KDO8PS. We found that about 1/4 of all strongly coevolving pairs probably originated from cycles of mutation (decreasing stability) and suppression (restoring it), while the remaining pairs are best explained by a succession of neutral or nearly neutral covarions. Both sequence conservation and coevolution are involved in the preservation of the core structure of KDO8PS, but the contribution of coevolving residues is, in proportion, smaller. This is because small stability gains or losses associated with selection of certain residues in some regions of the stability landscape of KDO8PS are easily offset by a large number of possible changes in other regions. While this effect increases the tolerance of KDO8PS to deleterious mutations, it also decreases the probability that specific pairs of residues could have a strong contribution to the thermodynamic stability of the protein.

26469189	20151016	Comparison of 454 Ultra-Deep Sequencing and Allele-Specific Real-Time PCR with Regard to the Detection of Emerging Drug-Resistant Minor HIV-1 Variants after Antiretroviral Prophylaxis for Vertical Transmission.	Pregnant HIV-infected women were screened for the development of HIV-1 drug resistance after implementation of a triple-antiretroviral transmission prophylaxis as recommended by the WHO in 2006. The study offered the opportunity to compare amplicon-based 454 ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) and allele-specific real-time PCR (ASPCR) for the detection of drug-resistant minor variants in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Plasma samples from 34 Tanzanian women were previously analysed by ASPCR for key resistance mutations in the viral RT selected by AZT, 3TC, and NVP (K70R, K103N, Y181C, M184V, T215Y/F). In this study, the RT region of the same samples was investigated by amplicon-based UDS for resistance mutations using the 454 GS FLX System. Drug-resistant HIV-variants were identified in 69% (20/29) of women by UDS and in 45% (13/29) by ASPCR. The absolute number of resistance mutations identified by UDS was twice that identified by ASPCR (45 vs 24). By UDS 14 of 24 ASPCR-detected resistance mutations were identified at the same position. The overall concordance between UDS and ASPCR was 61.0% (25/41). The proportions of variants quantified by UDS were approximately 2-3 times lower than by ASPCR. Amplicon generation from samples with viral loads below 20,000 copies/ml failed more frequently by UDS compared to ASPCR (limit of detection = 650 copies/ml), resulting in missing or insufficient sequence coverage. Both methods can provide useful information about drug-resistant minor HIV-1 variants. ASPCR has a higher sensitivity than UDS, but is restricted to single resistance mutations. In contrast, UDS is limited by its requirement for high viral loads to achieve sufficient sequence coverage, but the sequence information reveals the complete resistance patterns within the genomic region analysed. Improvements to the UDS limit of detection are in progress, and UDS could then facilitate monitoring of drug-resistant minor variants in the HIV-1 quasispecies.

9298988	19970923	Expression of TRPC3 in Chinese hamster ovary cells results in calcium-activated cation currents not related to store depletion.	TRPC3 (or Htrp3) is a human member of the trp family of Ca2+-permeable cation channels. Since expression of TRPC3 cDNA results in markedly enhanced Ca2+ influx in response to stimulation of membrane receptors linked to phospholipase C (Zhu, X., J. Meisheng, M. Peyton, G. Bouley, R. Hurst, E. Stefani, and L. Birnbaumer. 1996. Cell. 85:661-671), we tested whether TRPC3 might represent a Ca2+ entry pathway activated as a consequence of depletion of intracellular calcium stores. CHO cells expressing TRPC3 after intranuclear injection of cDNA coding for TRPC3 were identified by fluorescence from green fluorescent protein. Expression of TRPC3 produced cation currents with little selectivity for Ca2+ over Na+. These currents were constitutively active, not enhanced by depletion of calcium stores with inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate or thapsigargin, and attenuated by strong intracellular Ca2+ buffering. Ionomycin led to profound increases of currents, but this effect was strictly dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Likewise, infusion of Ca2+ into cell through the patch pipette increased TRPC3 currents. Therefore, TRPC3 is stimulated by a Ca2+-dependent mechanism. Studies on TRPC3 in inside-out patches showed cation-selective channels with 60-pS conductance and short (&lt;2 ms) mean open times. Application of ionomycin to cells increased channel activity in cell-attached patches. Increasing the Ca2+ concentration on the cytosolic side of inside-out patches (from 0 to 1 and 30 microM), however, failed to stimulate channel activity, even in the presence of calmodulin (0.2 microM). We conclude that TRPC3 codes for a Ca2+-permeable channel that supports Ca2+-induced Ca2+-entry but should not be considered store operated. 	J._Cell_Biol.	D016428 D013485
17660293	20070731	MeCP2-chromatin interactions include the formation of chromatosome-like structures and are altered in mutations causing Rett syndrome.	hMeCP2 (human methylated DNA-binding protein 2), mutations of which cause most cases of Rett syndrome (RTT), is involved in the transmission of repressive epigenetic signals encoded by DNA methylation. The present work focuses on the modifications of chromatin architecture induced by MeCP2 and the effects of RTT-causing mutants. hMeCP2 binds to nucleosomes close to the linker DNA entry-exit site and protects approximately 11 bp of linker DNA from micrococcal nuclease. MeCP2 mutants differ in this property; the R106W mutant gives very little extra protection beyond the approximately 146-bp nucleosome core, whereas the large C-terminal truncation R294X reveals wild type behavior. Gel mobility assays show that linker DNA is essential for proper MeCP2 binding to nucleosomes, and electron microscopy visualization shows that the protein induces distinct conformational changes in the linker DNA. When bound to nucleosomes, MeCP2 is in close proximity to histone H3, which exits the nucleosome core close to the proposed MeCP2-binding site. These findings firmly establish nucleosomal linker DNA as a crucial binding partner of MeCP2 and show that different RTT-causing mutations of MeCP2 are correspondingly defective in different aspects of the interactions that alter chromatin architecture.

24206898	20131112	The prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its predominant components among pre-and postmenopausal Ghanaian women.	Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a clump of risk factors for development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. Menopause and age are thought to predispose women to the development of metabolic syndrome. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of MetS and identify its predominant components among pre-and postmenopausal women in the Kumasi Metropolis, Ghana.Two hundred and fifty (250) Ghanaian women were randomly selected for the study. They were evaluated for the prevalence of metabolic syndrome using the World Health Organization (WHO), National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III), International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and Harmonization (H_MS) criteria. Out of the total subjects, 143 (57.2%) were premenopausal and 107 (42.8%) menopausal. The study population was between the ages of 20-78?years. The overall percentage prevalence of MetS were 14.4%, 25.6%, 29.2% and 30.4% according to the WHO, NCEP-ATP III, IDF and H_MS criteria, respectively. The prevalence was found to increase with age, irrespective of criterion used. Generally, MetS was significantly higher among postmenopausal women (p?&lt;?0.05 by all criteria) compared to their premenopausal cohort, but with marked inter-criteria variations. Abdominal obesity, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, triglyceride, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride-high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio were significantly (p?&lt;?0.05) different among the two groups of women.Central obesity, higher blood pressure and raised fasting blood glucose were the predominant components that contributed to the syndrome in Ghanaian women. The higher prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in postmenopausal women is an indication that they are at risk of developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Therefore women in that group should be monitored for the two conditions and also be advised to adopt healthy lifestyles to minimize the incidence of these conditions. 	BMC_Res_Notes	D016428

20351782	20100331	Identification of a tsetse fly salivary protein with dual inhibitory action on human platelet aggregation.	Tsetse flies (Glossina sp.), the African trypanosome vectors, rely on anti-hemostatic compounds for efficient blood feeding. Despite their medical importance, very few salivary proteins have been characterized and functionally annotated. Here we report on the functional characterisation of a 5'nucleotidase-related (5'Nuc) saliva protein of the tsetse fly Glossina morsitans morsitans. This protein is encoded by a 1668 bp cDNA corresponding at the genomic level with a single-copy 4 kb gene that is exclusively transcribed in the tsetse salivary gland tissue. The encoded 5'Nuc protein is a soluble 65 kDa glycosylated compound of tsetse saliva with a dual anti-hemostatic action that relies on its combined apyrase activity and fibrinogen receptor (GPIIb/IIIa) antagonistic properties. Experimental evidence is based on the biochemical and functional characterization of recombinant protein and on the successful silencing of the 5'nuc translation in the salivary gland by RNA interference (RNAi). Refolding of a 5'Nuc/SUMO-fusion protein yielded an active apyrase enzyme with K(m) and V(max) values of 43+/-4 microM and 684+/-49 nmol Pi/min xmg for ATPase and 49+/-11 microM and 177+/-37 nmol Pi/min xmg for the ADPase activity. In addition, recombinant 5'Nuc was found to bind to GPIIb/IIIa with an apparent K(D) of 92+/-25 nM. Consistent with these features, 5'Nuc potently inhibited ADP-induced thrombocyte aggregation and even caused disaggregation of ADP-triggered human platelets. The importance of 5'Nuc for the tsetse fly hematophagy was further illustrated by specific RNAi that reduced the anti-thrombotic activities in saliva by approximately 50% resulting in a disturbed blood feeding process. These data show that this 5'nucleotidase-related apyrase exhibits GPIIb/IIIa antagonistic properties and represents a key thromboregulatory compound of tsetse fly saliva. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
16648557	20060502	A T3587G germ-line mutation of the MDR1 gene encodes a nonfunctional P-glycoprotein.	The human multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) encodes a plasma membrane P-glycoprotein (P-gp) that functions as an efflux pump for various structurally unrelated anticancer agents. We have identified two nonsynonymous germ-line mutations of the MDR1 gene, C3583T MDR1 and T3587G MDR1, in peripheral blood cell samples from Japanese cancer patients. Two patients carried the C3583T MDR1 allele that encodes H1195Y P-gp, whereas a further two carried T3587G MDR1 that encodes I1196S P-gp. Murine NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pCAL-MDR-IRES-ZEO constructs carrying either wild-type (WT), C3583T, or T3587G MDR1 cDNA and selected with zeocin. The resulting zeocin-resistant mixed populations of transfected cells were designated as 3T3/WT, 3T3/H1195Y, and 3T3/I1196S, respectively. The cell surface expression of I1196S P-gp in 3T3/I1196S cells could not be detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, although low expression of I1196S P-gp was found by Western blotting. H1195Y P-gp expression levels in 3T3/H1195Y cells were slightly lower than the corresponding WT P-gp levels in 3T3/WT cells. By immunoblotting analysis, both WT P-gp and H1195Y P-gp were detectable as a 145-kDa protein, whereas I1196S P-gp was visualized as a 140-kDa protein. 3T3/I1196S cells did not show any drug resistance unlike 3T3/H1195Y cells. Moreover, a vanadate-trap assay showed that the I1196S P-gp species lacks ATP-binding activity. Taken together, we conclude from these data that T3587G MDR1 expresses a nonfunctional P-gp and this is therefore the first description of such a germ-line mutation. We contend that the T3587G MDR1 mutation may affect the pharmacokinetics of MDR1-related anticancer agents in patients carrying this allele. 	Mol._Cancer_Ther.	D016428 D013485
20127165	20100204	Effect of the g.-723G--&gt;T polymorphism in the bovine myogenic factor 5 (Myf5) gene promoter region on gene transcript level in the longissimus dorsi muscle and on meat traits of Polish Holstein-Friesian cattle.	Myogenic factor 5 (Myf5), a product of the Myf5 gene, belongs to the MRF family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that regulate myogenesis. Their roles in muscle growth and development make their genes candidates for molecular markers of meat production in livestock, but nucleotide sequence polymorphism has not been thoroughly studied in MRF genes. We detected four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within exon 1 of the Myf5 gene, encoding the NH-terminal transactivation domain of the Myf5 protein. Three of these mutations change the amino acid sequence. The distribution of these SNPs was highly skewed in cattle populations; most of the mutations were found in only a few or even single individuals. Of the nine SNPs found in the promoter region of Myf5, one (transversion g.-723G--&gt;T) was represented by all three genotypes distributed in the cattle populations studied. This polymorphism showed an influence on Myf5 gene expression in the longissimus dorsi muscle and was associated with sirloin weight and fat weight in sirloin in carcasses of Holstein-Friesian cattle.

23394390	20130212	Influence of genetic polymorphisms in the glutamatergic and GABAergic systems and their interactions with environmental stressors on antidepressant response.	To investigate the role of genetic polymorphisms in glutamatergic and GABAergic genes and their interactions with environmental stressors in antidepressant response. A set of 114 SNPs of 34 glutamatergic and GABAergic genes, mainly in promoter and coding regions, were genotyped in 281 Chinese Han major depressive disorder patients. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was used to evaluate the symptom severity and therapeutic efficacy. Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and Life Events Scale were used for assessing early-onset and recent stressful life events, respectively. The single SNPs rs1954787 (GRIK4), rs1992647 (GABRA6), rs10036156 (GABRP) and rs3810651 (GABRQ) were significantly associated with antidepressant response, as were haplotypes in GRIK4 and GABRP genes. A genetic interaction between rs11542313 (GAD1), rs13303344 (GABRD) and rs2256882 (GABRE) was identified as impacting therapeutic response. SNPs in GRIA3 demonstrated interactions with early-onset adverse events and recent negative life stress that influence treatment outcome. Genetic polymorphisms in the glutamatergic and GABAergic systems and certain genetic interactions, as well as gene-environment interactions, are associated with antidepressant response.

HPV-16, -18, -31, and -45 seroprevalence was 15, 15, 16, and 11%, respectively. Of women DNA-positive for HPV-16, -18, -31, or -45, seropositivity was 45, 34, 51, and 28%, respectively. Peak HPV seroprevalence occurred a decade after DNA prevalence; lifetime number of sexual partners was the key determinant of seropositivity independent of DNA status and age. DNA- and sero-positive women showed the highest risk for concurrent CIN3/cancer, followed by DNA-positive, sero-negative women. 	Br._J._Cancer	D003160 D016428 D013486 D013487

16342264	20051213	Mutations in alpha-helical solvent-exposed sites of eglin c have long-range effects: evidence from molecular dynamics simulations.	Eglin c is a small protease inhibitor whose structural and thermodynamic properties have been well studied. Previous thermodynamic measurements on mutants at solvent-accessible positions in the protein's helix have shown the unexpected result that the data could be best fit by the inclusion of residue- and position-specific parameters to the model. To explore the origins of this surprising result, long molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent have been performed. These simulations indicate specific long-range interactions between the solvent-exposed residues in the eglin c alpha-helix and binding loop, an unexpected observation for such a small protein. The residues involved in the interaction are on opposite sides of the protein, about 25 A apart. Simulations of alanine substitutions at the solvent-exposed helix positions, arginine 22, glutamic acid 23, threonine 26, and leucine 27, show both small and large perturbations of eglin c dynamics. Two mutations exhibit large impacts on the long-range helix-loop interactions. Previous stability measurements (Yi et al., Biochemistry 2003;42:7594-7603) had indicated that an alanine substitution at position 27 was less stabilizing than at other solvent-exposed positions in the helix. The L27A mutation effects observed in these simulations suggest that the position-dependent loss of stability measured in wet bench experiments is derived from changes in dynamics that involve long-range interactions; thus, these simulations support the hypothesis that solvent-exposed positions in helices are not always equivalent.

22977564	20120915	Interleukin-28B polymorphisms are associated with an early viral response in patients receiving hepatitis C therapy.	Prediction of the efficacy of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) therapy against hepatitis C (HCV) infection is valuable for determining its applications. This study investigated the relationship between the early response of HCV to PEG-IFN/RBV therapy and the inter-leukin (IL)-28B genetic polymorphism in patients with HCV infection. The genotypes of IL-28B rs8099917 T&gt;G single nucleotide polymorphism were determined in 144 patients with HCV infection. Among them, 59 were treated with PEG-IFN/RBV. The frequency of IL-28B TT homozygosity was 75.2% in patients with HCV serotype 1 and 84.6% in patients with serotype 2. Multivariate analysis showed that IL-28B TT homozygosity (P=0.014) and the platelets number (P=0.030) was associated with the early suppression of HCV-RNA at 12 weeks after the start of PEG-IFN/RBV therapy. The IL-28B polymorphism was a significant pre-treatment predictor of the response to PEG-IFN/RBV therapy in patients with HCV infection. 	Exp_Ther_Med	D016428
25045281	20140722	Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.	Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and/or progressive loss of ?-cell function. T2DM patients are at increased risk of micro- and macrovascular disease, and are often considered as representing an atherosclerotic coronary heart disease (CHD) risk equivalent. Interventions directed at glucose and lipid level control in T2DM patients may reduce micro- and macrovascular disease. The optimal T2DM agent is one that lowers glucose levels with limited risk for hypoglycemia, and with no clinical trial evidence of worsening CHD risk. Lipid-altering drugs should preferably reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (apo B) and have evidence that the mechanism of action reduces CHD risk. Statins reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apo B and have evidence of improving CHD outcomes, and are thus first-line therapy for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. In patients who do not achieve optimal lipid levels with statin therapy, or who are intolerant to statin therapy, add-on therapy or alternative therapies may be indicated. Additional available agents to treat hypercholesterolemic patients with T2DM include bile acid sequestrants, fibrates, niacin, and ezetimibe. This review discusses the use of these alternative agents to treat hypercholesterolemia in patients with T2DM, either as monotherapy or in combination with statin therapy.

24653668	20140322	Androgen receptor (AR) pathophysiological roles in androgen-related diseases in skin, bone/muscle, metabolic syndrome and neuron/immune systems: lessons learned from mice lacking AR in specific cells.	The androgen receptor (AR) is expressed ubiquitously and plays a variety of roles in a vast number of physiological and pathophysiological processes. Recent studies of AR knockout (ARKO) mouse models, particularly the cell type- or tissue-specific ARKO models, have uncovered many AR cell type- or tissue-specific pathophysiological roles in mice, which otherwise would not be delineated from conventional castration and androgen insensitivity syndrome studies. Thus, the AR in various specific cell types plays pivotal roles in production and maturation of immune cells, bone mineralization, and muscle growth. In metabolism, the ARs in brain, particularly in the hypothalamus, and the liver appear to participate in regulation of insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. The AR also plays key roles in cutaneous wound healing and cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm. This article will discuss the results obtained from the total, cell type-, or tissue-specific ARKO models. The understanding of AR cell type- or tissue-specific physiological and pathophysiological roles using these in vivo mouse models will provide useful information in uncovering AR roles in humans and eventually help us to develop better therapies via targeting the AR or its downstream signaling molecules to combat androgen/AR-related diseases.

6799208	19811001	Two kappa immunoglobulin genes are expressed in the myeloma S107.	We have cloned two rearranged kappa immunoglobulin genes from the mouse myeloma cell line S107, and find that both are expressed. One gene, designated S107A, encodes the secreted kappa chain that participates in phosphocholine binding and expression of the T-15 idiotype. The other gene, designated S107B, as described here, contains an unusual junction between a V region unrelated to that of S107A and a different J region. The V-J junction preserves the triplet reading frame, but 6 nucleotides have been deleted at the recombination site. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the germline V-region precursor of S107B in comparison with other germline kappa-variable sequences reveals an &quot;extra&quot; 2 nucleotides in S107B between codon 95 and the palindromic heptanucleotide CACAGTG previously implicated in V-J recombination; this difference may be relevant to the 6 nucleotide deletion. Both S107A and S107B genes are expressed in the S107 cell as protein products, but unlike the S107A kappa chain, the S107B protein product is not secreted into the medium. The expression of these two kappa genes in the S107 cell has implications for theories of allelic exclusion. 	Cell	D016428 D013485 D013486 D013487
26539241	20151106	Short-term, high-fat diet accelerates disuse atrophy and protein degradation in a muscle-specific manner in mice.	A short-term high-fat diet impairs mitochondrial function and the ability of skeletal muscle to respond to growth stimuli, but it is unknown whether such a diet alters the ability to respond to atrophy signals. The purpose of this study was to determine whether rapid weigh gain induced by a high-fat (HF) diet accelerates denervation-induced muscle atrophy. Adult, male mice (C57BL/6) were fed a control or HF (60?% calories as fat) diet for 3?weeks (3wHF). Sciatic nerve was sectioned unilaterally for the final 5 or 14?days of the diet. Soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were removed and incubated in vitro to determine rates of protein degradation and subsequently homogenized for determination of protein levels of LC3, ubiquitination, myosin heavy chain (MHC) distribution, and mitochondrial subunits. When mice were fed the 3wHF diet, whole-body fat mass more than doubled, but basal (innervated) muscle weights, rates of protein degradation, LC3 content, mitochondrial protein content, and myosin isoform distribution were not significantly different than with the control diet in either soleus or EDL. However in the 14?day denervated soleus, the 3wHF diet significantly augmented loss of mass, proteolysis rate, amount of the autophagosome marker LC3 II, and the amount of overall ubiquitination as compared to the control fed mice. On the contrary, the 3wHF diet had no significant effect in the EDL on amount of mass loss, proteolysis rate, LC3 levels, or ubiquitination. Fourteen days denervation also induced a loss of mitochondrial proteins in the soleus but not the EDL, regardless of the diet. Taken together, a short-term, high-fat diet augments denervation muscle atrophy by induction of protein degradation in the mitochondria-rich soleus but not in the glycolytic EDL. These findings suggest that the denervation-induced loss of mitochondria and HF diet-induced impairment of mitochondrial function may combine to promote skeletal muscle atrophy.

20400671	20100420	Stenotrophomonas daejeonensis sp. nov., isolated from sewage.	A Gram-stain-negative, motile, aerobic bacterial strain, designated MJ03(T), was isolated from sewage and was characterized taxonomically by using a polyphasic approach. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain MJ03(T) belongs to the family Xanthomonadaceae, class Gammaproteobacteria, and was related most closely to Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila AMX 19(T) (97.9 ?% sequence similarity), Stenotrophomonas humi R-32729(T) (97.1 ?%), Stenotrophomonas nitritireducens L2(T) (96.9? %), Stenotrophomonas maltophila ATCC 13637(T) (96.8? %) and Stenotrophomonas terrae R-32768(T) (96.7 ?%). The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain MJ03(T) was 64.7 mol%. The detection of a quinone system with ubiquinone Q-8 as the predominant component and a fatty acid profile with iso-C??:?, iso-C??:?, iso-C??:?, iso-C??:??9c, iso-C??:? 3-OH and iso-C??:? 3-OH as major components supported the affiliation of strain MJ03(T) to the genus Stenotrophomonas. However, levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain MJ03(T) and the type strains of five closely related species of the genus Stenotrophomonas ranged from 11 to 34? %, showing clearly that the isolate represents a novel genospecies. Strain MJ03(T) could be differentiated clearly from its phylogenetic neighbours on the basis of several phenotypic, genotypic and chemotaxonomic features. Therefore, strain MJ03(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Stenotrophomonas, for which the name Stenotrophomonas daejeonensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MJ03(T) (=KCTC 22451(T) =JCM 16244(T)). 	Int._J._Syst._Evol._Microbiol.	D016428 D013485
23703862	20130525	Genetic association and gene expression profiles of TGFB1 and the contribution of TGFB1 to otosclerosis susceptibility.	Otosclerosis (OTSC) is a common form of acquired hearing loss resulting from disturbed bone remodeling in the otic capsule of the middle ear. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFB1) produced by osteoblasts is the most abundant growth factor in human bone. Previous studies have shown the contribution of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TGFB1 toward the risk of developing OTSC in some ethnic populations. The present study was aimed at investigating the genetic association and expression profiles of TGFB1 in OTSC patients. Two SNPs (c.-800G &gt; A and c.-509C &gt; T) in the promoter region and three SNPs (c.29T &gt; C, c.74G &gt; C, and c.788C &gt; T) in the coding region were genotyped in 170 cases and 170 controls. The genetic association analysis revealed the significant association between c.-509C &gt; T (p = 0.0067; odds ratio [OR]?= 1.562; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.140-2.139) and OTSC. The increased minor allele &quot;T&quot; frequency in cases (0.42) compared to controls (0.31) indicates its possible role in the etiology of the disease. The minor allele frequencies for the SNPs c.-800G &gt; A, c.29T &gt; C, and c.74G &gt;C were similar among the cases (0.04, 0.47, and 0.08, respectively) and controls (0.05, 0.42, 0.07, respectively). We found that c.788C &gt; T was monomorphic in this population. Interestingly, a four-locus haplotype (G-T-T-G) from these SNPs was found to be significantly associated with OTSC (p = 0.0077). We identified a de novo heterozygous mutation c.-832G &gt; A in the promoter region of TGFB1 in 1 patient. In a secondary analysis, we investigated the possibility of abnormal TGFB1 expression and irregular bone growth in OTSC by expression analysis of TGFB1 mRNA in disease tissue compared to control. We found relatively increased expression of TGFB1 mRNA in the stapes tissues of cases compared to controls (p = 0.0057). In conclusion, this study identified a risk variant c.-509C &gt; T and a risk haplotype G-T-T-G in the TGFB1 gene that contribute toward the susceptibility to OTSC. 	J._Bone_Miner._Res.

25897955	20150422	Atherogenic dyslipidemia in children: evaluation of clinical, biochemical and genetic aspects.	The precursors of atherogenic dyslipidemia (AD) are not well defined. Therefore, we investigated 62 non-obese, non-diabetic AD and 221 normolipemic children. Anthropometric parameters, blood pressure and biochemical measures were obtained in index children, their parents and all available siblings. The heritability (h(2)) of anthropometric and biochemical traits was estimated by SOLAR. Rare and common variants in APOA1 and LPL genes were screened by re-sequencing. Compared to normolipemic, AD children showed increased body mass index, waist circumference, plasma glucose, insulin, ApoB, HOMA-IR, hs-CRP and lower adiponectin (p&lt;0.001 for all). Metabolic syndrome was present in 40% of AD while absent in controls. All traits (except adiponectin and hs-CRP) showed a strong familial aggregation, with plasma glucose having the highest heritability (89%). Overall, 4 LPL loss-of-function mutations were detected (p.Asp9Asn, p.Ser45Asn, p.Asn291Ser, p.Leu365Val) and their cumulative prevalence was higher in AD than in control children (0.073 vs. 0.026; P=0.038). The LPL p.S447* gain-of-function mutation, resulted to be less frequent in AD than in control children (0.064 vs. 0.126; P=0.082). No variant in the APOA1 gene was found. Our data indicate that AD is a rather common dyslipidemia in childhood; it associates with metabolic abnormalities typical of insulin resistant state and shows a strong familial aggregation. LPL variants may contribute to the development of AD phenotype. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
22574214	20120511	Involvement of Girdin in the determination of cell polarity during cell migration.	Cell migration is a critical cellular process that determines embryonic development and the progression of human diseases. Therefore, cell- or context-specific mechanisms by which multiple promigratory proteins differentially regulate cell migration must be analyzed in detail. Girdin (girders of actin filaments) (also termed GIV, G?-interacting vesicle associated protein) is an actin-binding protein that regulates migration of various cells such as endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, neuroblasts, and cancer cells. Here we show that Girdin regulates the establishment of cell polarity, the deregulation of which may result in the disruption of directional cell migration. We found that Girdin interacts with Par-3, a scaffolding protein that is a component of the Par protein complex that has an established role in determining cell polarity. RNA interference-mediated depletion of Girdin leads to impaired polarization of fibroblasts and mammary epithelial cells in a way similar to that observed in Par-3-depleted cells. Accordingly, the expression of Par-3 mutants unable to interact with Girdin abrogates cell polarization in fibroblasts. Further biochemical analysis suggests that Girdin is present in the Par protein complex that includes Par-3, Par-6, and atypical protein kinase C. Considering previous reports showing the role of Girdin in the directional migration of neuroblasts, network formation of endothelial cells, and cancer invasion, these data may provide a specific mechanism by which Girdin regulates cell movement in biological contexts that require directional cell movement.

27355027	20160630	Are Attributes of Pregnancy and the Delivery Room Experience Related to Development of Autism? A Review of the Perinatal and Labor Risk Factors and Autism.	Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder marked by severe deficits in social communication and interactions. It is a complex condition that lacks an established preventive method, warranting a need for research to identify possible environmental triggers. The identification of external factors particularly perinatal risk factors forms the initial critical step in preventing and alleviating risks. We conducted a literature review to assess evidence suggested in the worldwide literature. Perinatal risk factors that have a suggested association include ?2 adrenergic receptor agonists, labor induction and augmentation, maternal infection and disease (i.e., antiphospholipid syndrome), antiepileptic drugs, cocaine use, and oral supplements. Smoking has not been found to have a direct association. Pollutants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, artificial insemination, and fertility medications may have a link, but results are often conflicted. Factors related to the delivery room experience may be associated with meconium aspiration syndrome, birth weight, and labor time. Several risk factors during the pregnancy and labor periods have been associated with autism; yet further studies with large populations are needed to establish definitive associations. The fact that several risk factors during the prenatal and labor periods are implicated in autism should prompt the medical community to focus on the pregnancy and labor periods as preventive measures to curb the incidence of autism.

1850959	19910501	Identification of a cell membrane protein that binds alveolar surfactant.	Alveolar surfactants are complex mixtures of proteins and phospholipids produced by type II alveolar cells and responsible for lowering pulmonary surface tension. The process by which surfactant is produced and exported and by which its production by pulmonary cells is regulated are not well understood. This study was designed to identify a cellular receptor for surfactant constituents. To do so, monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies directed against antibodies to porcine and rabbit surfactant proteins were prepared. These monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies bind both alveolar lining and bronchial epithelial cells in rabbit, porcine, and human lungs. Macrophages and other nonepithelial cells do not react with these antibodies. Western blot analysis indicates that both A2R and A2C recognize the same proteins in both pig and rabbit lungs: a 30-kd protein and additional proteins at 52 and 60 kd. Preincubating lung wash cells with A2C or A2R prevents binding of porcine or rabbit surfactant preparations, respectively, by these cells. Preincubating frozen sections of lung tissue with surfactant inhibits binding of A2R and A2C to the lung. Antibody directed to a cell membrane protein that recognizes alveolar surfactant may be useful in elucidating the structure and function of this receptor and in understanding the cellular physiology and pathophysiology of the surfactant system.

10367566	19990615	Coordinated regulation of P-glycoprotein activity and cytochrome P-4501A induction in sublines of rat hepatoma McA RH7777 cells with different levels of colchicine resistance.	The constitutive and induced activities of cytochrome P-4501A isoforms in hepatoma McA 7777 sublines with different levels of colchicine (CH) resistance were studied. The higher CH resistance was associated with the elevated functional activity of P-glycoprotein (Pgp). The constitutive level of benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase and 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (cytochrome P-4501A-dependent activities) were the same in sublines with different CH resistance levels. However, benzo(a)-anthracene, a cytochrome P-4501A inducing agent, more effectively induced benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase and 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activities in sublines with elevated P-glycoprotein activity. The toxicity of benzo(a)pyrene, a compound which is simultaneously a cytochrome P-4501A-inducing agent and a toxic agent activated by cytochrome P-4501A, is more effective in sublines with elevated CH resistance. These results support the suggestion about the coordinated regulation of enzyme systems involved in the defence against various lipophilic xenobiotics. The possibility to overcome the Pgp-mediated MDR of some tumours by using a combination of some drugs including compounds which induce the cytochrome P-4501A isoforms and are activated by them is discussed.

14691136	20031224	Myo4p and She3p are required for cortical ER inheritance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	Myo4p is a nonessential type V myosin required for the bud tip localization of ASH1 and IST2 mRNA. These mRNAs associate with Myo4p via the She2p and She3p proteins. She3p is an adaptor protein that links Myo4p to its cargo. She2p binds to ASH1 and IST2 mRNA, while She3p binds to both She2p and Myo4p. Here we show that Myo4p and She3p, but not She2p, are required for the inheritance of cortical ER in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Consistent with this observation, we find that cortical ER inheritance is independent of mRNA transport. Cortical ER is a dynamic network that forms cytoplasmic tubular connections to the nuclear envelope. ER tubules failed to grow when actin polymerization was blocked with the drug latrunculin A (Lat-A). Additionally, a reduction in the number of cytoplasmic ER tubules was observed in Lat-A-treated and myo4Delta cells. Our results suggest that Myo4p and She3p facilitate the growth and orientation of ER tubules. 	J._Cell_Biol.	D016428 D013487
27222678	20160526	Extramedullary Involvement by Chronic Myelogeneous Leukemia in Five Patients With Unusual Clinicopathologic Features: A Review of the Effectiveness of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors.	Chronic myelogeneous leukemia (CML) is associated with BCR-ABL1 fusion gene leading to an abnormal tyrosine kinase molecule. The accepted first-line treatment is imatinib mesylate (IM). CML uncommonly occurs in the extramedullary sites at initial presentation or relapse. Here we report five adult patients with CML who developed myeloid sarcoma (MS) while on treatment with IM. A retrospective medical chart analysis was performed to identify CML patients with MS who were diagnosed and treated at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The age ranged between 21 and 36 years (median: 28.5) with a male to female ratio of 4:1. All of the patients were diagnosed with CML in chronic phase with initial treatment including IM. The median interval period between the initial diagnosis of CML and MS was 27 months (range 7 - 60 months). The sites of extramedullary involvement included lymph nodes (n = 2), central nervous system (n = 2) and hepatobiliary organs (n = 1). All patients were treated with either induction therapy or stem cell transplant (SCT) following the diagnosis of MS. The median survival was 16 months (range 1 - 72 months). The longest survival was observed in a patient who successfully received SCT therapy. IM is frequently used as the first therapeutic choice in new diagnosed CML; however, its penetration and effectiveness in extramedullary tissue is still unclear. The current report also supports the literature with less favorable prognosis of CML in younger individuals. 	J_Clin_Med_Res	D016428
25455139	20141203	Influence of component 5a receptor 1 (C5AR1) -1330T/G polymorphism on nonsedating H1-antihistamines therapy in Chinese patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria.	The nonsedating H1-antihistamines are the first-line medicines for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) patients. However, not all these patients respond well to the antihistamines, and the mechanisms underlying the interindividual differences are still unclear. C5AR1 gene encodes the component 5a receptor (C5aR) protein, which has been reported to play an important role in chronic spontaneous urticaria. This study aimed to investigate whether the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in C5AR1 are associated with CSU susceptibility and antihistamines therapeutic efficacy in Chinese CSU patients. A total of 191 CSU patients and 102 healthy controls were prospectively studied in our study. CSU patients were treated by nonsedating H1-antihistamines monotherapy for 4 weeks. The C5AR1 -1330T/G (rs11673309) genotype was determined by Sequenom Massarray. Among these 191 CSU patients, there were 114 patients who were treated with desloratadine, 65 were treated with mizolastine, and 12 with fexofenadine. The-1330T alleles in CSU patients were significantly higher than controls (0.555 vs. 0.466, P=0.040, OR=1.429 [1.016-2.010]). The poorest response to desloratadine was observed in heterozygotes, when compared with either GG or TT homozgote (P=0.001). However, there was no significant difference in three genotypes when treated with mizolastine group (P=0.215). We concluded that the C5AR1 SNP -1330T/G may serve as a useful pharmacodynamic predictor of nonsedating H1-antihistamines efficacy in CSU patients, and -1330T alleles may be taken as a risk factor for the CSU.

19268887	20090310	ARMS2 (LOC387715) variants in Japanese patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy.	To determine the characteristics of the polymorphisms in the ARMS2 gene in Japanese patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and those with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) and in healthy controls, and also to show possible associations of the polymorphisms with the disease. Case-control association study. Fifty-six unrelated Japanese individuals with AMD, 55 with PCV, and 77 controls were studied. The most common polymorphism in the ARMS2 gene on chromosome 10 was resequenced. Association tests were performed for inferred haplotypes. A total of 22 polymorphisms were identified, and 13 were shared with those in White persons with AMD. The sequence of the deletion-and-insertion polymorphism, de1443ins54, a functional polymorphism causing an instability of the messenger ribonucleic acid of ARMS2 in the Japanese, did not differ from that in White persons. Among the polymorphisms seen in the White population, rs10490923 (R3H) as well as 7 other polymorphisms were not observed in the Japanese. One haplotype, which contained the T allele of the rs10490924 (A69S) and the variant of de1443ins54 polymorphism, had an odds ratio of 3.14 (P = 7.8 x 10(-6)) for AMD and 2.00 (P = .0058) for PCV. Among the 9 polymorphisms that were unique to the Japanese population, 2 had a minor allelic frequency of more than 0.05, and these 2 polymorphism were included as nonrisk haplotypes. The de1443ins54 polymorphism is a common variant between White and Japanese populations. It is strongly associated not only with AMD but also with PCV. 	Am._J._Ophthalmol.	D016428 D013485
20682701	20100805	The genetic basis of colorectal cancer in a population-based incident cohort with a high rate of familial disease.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most frequent cancer in developed countries. Newfoundland has the highest incidence of CRC in Canada and the highest rate of familial CRC yet reported in the world. To determine the impact of mutations in known CRC susceptibility genes and the contribution of the known pathways to the development of hereditary CRC, an incident cohort of 750 patients with CRC (708 different families) from the Newfoundland population was studied. Microsatellite instability (MSI) testing was performed on tumours, together with immunohistochemistry analysis for mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Where indicated, DNA sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplifications of MMR genes and APC was undertaken. DNA from all patients was screened for MUTYH mutations. The presence of the BRAF variant, p.V600E, and of MLH1 promoter methylation was also tested in tumours. 4.6% of patients fulfilled the Amsterdam criteria (AC), and an additional 44.6% fulfilled the revised Bethesda criteria. MSI-high (MSI-H) was observed in 10.7% (n=78) of 732 tumours. In 3.6% (n=27) of patients, CRC was attributed to 12 different inherited mutations in six known CRC-related genes associated with chromosomal instability or MSI pathways. Seven patients (0.9%) carried a mutation in APC or biallelic mutations in MUTYH. Of 20 patients (2.7%) with mutations in MMR genes, 14 (70%) had one of two MSH2 founder mutations. 17 of 28 (61%) AC families did not have a genetic cause identified, of which 15 kindreds fulfilled the criteria for familial CRC type X (FCCTX). Founder mutations accounted for only 2.1% of cases and this was insufficient to explain the high rate of familial CRC. Many of the families classified as FCCTX may have highly penetrant mutations segregating in a Mendelian-like manner. These families will be important for identifying additional CRC susceptibility loci. 	Gut	D016428 D052061 D013485
12369836	20021009	Mutations in the putative pore-forming segment favor short-lived wild-type Kir2.1 pore conformations.	We have characterized single and double mutations in the M1-M2 segment of an inwardly rectifying K(+) channel, Kir2.1, using the cell-attached configuration of the patch-clamp technique. These mutations generated novel N-glycosylation sites at positions 128, 140, 143, and 147. Previously, we showed that these mutants were glycosylated, functional, and at the cell surface, which indicated that the putative pore-forming segment, including the invariant G(Y/F)G sequence of K(+) channels, was extracellular [Schwalbe, R. A., Rudin, A., Xia, S.-L., and Wingo, C. S. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 24382-24389]. In this study, three conductance states, corresponding to the main open state and two subconductance states, were identified in WT Kir2.1 channels expressed in infected Sf9 cells. Kir2.1 channels with mutations in the M1-M2 linker had at least one distinguishable conductance state of WT channels. In addition, these mutations altered the transitions, duration, and frequency of the defined populations of permeating and nonpermeating states. Of note, S128N had permeation rates similar to those of WT Kir2.1, but the total duration of the lower subconductance state was 3-5 times longer. Mutations in the signature sequence, I143N/Y145T, produced channels with permeation rates similar to those of the main open state and lower subconductance state of WT Kir2.1; however, the frequencies of these states were substantially different. These results demonstrate a novel functional role of the M1-M2 segment in regulating the transitions of the Kir2.1 channel and therefore suggest that this segment is a critical structural determinant in adjustments of pore conformations. Additionally, our results indicate that these mutants are correctly folded and thus further substantiate that the M1-M2 segment, including the G(Y/F)G sequence, is topologically extracellular.

9704931	19980815	Characterization of the oligomerization defects of two p53 mutants found in families with Li-Fraumeni and Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome.	Recently two germline mutations in the oligomerization domain of p53 have been identified in patients with Li-Fraumeni and Li-Fraumeni-like Syndromes. We have used biophysical and biochemical methods to characterize these two mutants in order to better understand their functional defects and the role of the p53 oligomerization domain (residues 325-355) in oncogenesis. We find that residues 310-360 of the L344P mutant are monomeric, apparently unfolded and cannot interact with wild-type (WT) p53. The full length L344P protein is unable to bind sequence specifically to DNA and is therefore an inactive, but not a dominant negative mutant. R337C, on the other hand, can form dimers and tetramers, can hetero-oligomerize with WTp53 and can bind to a p53 consensus element. However, the thermal stability of R337C is much lower than that of WTp53 and at physiological temperatures more than half of this mutant is less than tetrameric. Thus, the R337C mutant retains some functional activity yet leads to a predisposition to cancer, suggesting that even partial inactivation of p53 oligomerization is sufficient for accelerated tumour progression.

16699843	20060516	Neural network model of the primary visual cortex: from functional architecture to lateral connectivity and back.	The role of intrinsic cortical dynamics is a debatable issue. A recent optical imaging study (Kenet et al., 2003) found that activity patterns similar to orientation maps (OMs), emerge in the primary visual cortex (V1) even in the absence of sensory input, suggesting an intrinsic mechanism of OM activation. To better understand these results and shed light on the intrinsic V1 processing, we suggest a neural network model in which OMs are encoded by the intrinsic lateral connections. The proposed connectivity pattern depends on the preferred orientation and, unlike previous models, on the degree of orientation selectivity of the interconnected neurons. We prove that the network has a ring attractor composed of an approximated version of the OMs. Consequently, OMs emerge spontaneously when the network is presented with an unstructured noisy input. Simulations show that the model can be applied to experimental data and generate realistic OMs. We study a variation of the model with spatially restricted connections, and show that it gives rise to states composed of several OMs. We hypothesize that these states can represent local properties of the visual scene.

25934528	20150503	Polymorphism in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene is associated with impaired proinsulin conversion--A meta-analysis.	Available evidence supports the emerging hypothesis that the T-Allele of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 may be associated with the risk of impaired proinsulin conversion, but no consensus was available up to now. A computer-based search of electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) and reference lists of relevant articles was carried out, and then 19 studies involving 15830 subjects were identified. The combined weighted mean difference (WMD) and their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated by a fixed or random effect. In the overall analysis, the T-Allele was observed to be significantly associated with the risk of impaired proinsulin conversion (up-regulate fasting proinsulin concentration WMD -0.40 pM/L (95% CI -0.57 to -0.23); down-regulate fasting insulin concentration 3.86 pM/L (95% CI 1.91 to 5.81)). Subgroup analyse stratified by subjects population characteristics and ethnicity were performed. The results indicated the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism was associated with the risk of impaired proinsulin conversion in various population characteristics study. With only a few of subjects in Asians and Africans were available, we failed to detect significant ethnic difference about TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism and the risk of impaired proinsulin conversion. Our results indicated that the T-Allele of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 is a significantly risk factor for impaired proinsulin conversion. Future research should gather more data about the effect of TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism on Asians and Africans. 	Diabetes_Res._Clin._Pract.	D016428 D017418 D013485
18158301	20071226	G-quadruplex preferentially forms at the very 3' end of vertebrate telomeric DNA.	Human chromosome ends are protected with kilobases repeats of TTAGGG. Telomere DNA shortens at replication. This shortening in most tumor cells is compensated by telomerase that adds telomere repeats to the 3' end of the G-rich telomere strand. Four TTAGGG repeats can fold into G-quadruplex that is a poor substrate for telomerase. This property has been suggested to regulate telomerase activity in vivo and telomerase inhibition via G-quadruplex stabilization is considered a therapeutic strategy against cancer. Theoretically G-quadruplex can form anywhere along the long G-rich strand. Where G-quadruplex forms determines whether the 3' telomere end is accessible to telomerase and may have implications in other functions telomere plays. We investigated G-quadruplex formation at different positions by DMS footprinting and exonuclease hydrolysis. We show that G-quadruplex preferentially forms at the very 3' end than at internal positions. This property provides a molecular basis for telomerase inhibition by G-quadruplex formation. Moreover, it may also regulate those processes that depend on the structure of the very 3' telomere end, for instance, the alternative lengthening of telomere mechanism, telomere T-loop formation, telomere end protection and the replication of bulky telomere DNA. Therefore, targeting telomere G-quadruplex may influence more telomere functions than simply inhibiting telomerase. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D013485
24744624	20140419	The Effects of Endothelial Protein C Receptor Gene Polymorphisms on the Plasma sEPCR Level in Venous Thrombosis Patients.	The aim of this study was to investigate variations in the endothelial cell protein C receptor gene (EPCRgene) that may play a role in thrombosis and the effects of these variations on the plasma soluble endothelial cell proteinC receptor (sEPCR) level in Turkish patients with venous thrombosis. This study included 111 thrombosis patients and 73 healthy controls. Following DNAextraction, PCR, SSCP, and DNA sequencing analysis of 4 exons of the EPCR gene was performed. Plasma sEPCR wasmeasured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In all, 3 polymorphisms were detected in exons 1-4. C3998T (SNP no: rs2069952) polymorphism was detectedin intron 2 and C4678G (A1 haplotype) (SNP no: rs9574) in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). There weren't anysignificant differences in C3998T polymorphism between the control and patient groups. There wasn't a significantdifference in plasma sEPCR levels between both controls and patients that carried the A1 allele. A4600G substitution (A3haplotype) (SNP no: rs867186) was observed in exon 4 and was associated with a 2.04-fold higher risk of thrombosis.A3 allele carriers had higher sEPCR levels than those without the allele. Mean sEPCR level in the patients with thehomozygous A3 allele was 289 ng ?L-1, versus 113.42 ng ?L-1 in those with the homozygous A1 allele. The A1 haplotype might offer protection against thrombosis and the A3 haplotype might be associatedboth with elevated plasma sEPCR and elevated risk of venous thrombosis in the Turkish population. Plasma sEPCRlevels were significantly higher in those that carried the A3 allele (4600A&gt;G) (both patients and controls). Among theparticipants that carried the A1 allele (4678C&gt;G), plasma sEPCR did not differ significantly. 	Turk_J_Haematol	D016428
25689313	20150218	Two novel SNPs in ATXN3 3' UTR may decrease age at onset of SCA3/MJD in Chinese patients.	Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), or Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), is an autosomal dominantly-inherited disease that produces progressive problems with movement. It is caused by the expansion of an area of CAG repeats in a coding region of ATXN3. The number of repeats is inversely associated with age at disease onset (AO) and is significantly associated with disease severity; however, the degree of CAG expansion only explains 50 to 70% of variance in AO. We tested two SNPs, rs709930 and rs910369, in the 3' UTR of ATXN3 gene for association with SCA3/MJD risk and with SCA3/MJD AO in an independent cohort of 170 patients with SCA3/MJD and 200 healthy controls from mainland China. rs709930 genotype frequencies were statistically significantly different between patients and controls (p = 0.001, ? = 0.05). SCA3/MJD patients carrying the rs709930 A allele and rs910369 T allele experienced an earlier onset, with a decrease in AO of approximately 2 to 4 years. The two novel SNPs found in this study might be genetic modifiers for AO in SCA3/MJD. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
10212398	19990423	Characterization and comparative pharmacological studies of a functional gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor cloned from the tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens (Noctuidae:Lepidoptera).	This paper reports the functional expression and pharmacological characterization of a full length complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) (pIVY12) cloned from a Heliothis virescens fertilized egg cDNA library that encodes for a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunit (HVRDL-Ser 285). Two electrode voltage clamp recordings of Xenopus oocytes expressing the HVRDL GABA-gated chloride channel revealed robust chloride ion conductance in response to GABA and the GABAA receptor agonist, muscimol. Baclofen, a GABAB agonist had no effect. Phenobarbital showed a positive dose-dependent allosteric modulatory effect, whereas the benzodiazepine, flunitrazepam, had no effect. Chloride conductance was depressed by the novel insecticide, fipronil ((+/-)-5-amino-1-(2,6 dichloro-alpha, alpha, alpha-trifluoro-p-tolyl)-4-trifluoromethyl-sulfinylpyrazole-3-carb onitrile) and the GABAA antagonist, picrotoxinin. The HVRDL GABA receptor was insensitive to blockage by dieldrin and the GABAA antagonist, bicuculline. The comparative actions of fipronil, picrotoxinin and dieldrin were examined on oocytes expressing the H. virescens wild-type (HVRDL-Ser 285), the site-directed mutant (HVRDL-Ala 285), the Drosophila melanogaster Rdl wild-type (DMRDL-Ala 302) and the Rdl dieldrin resistant (DMRDL-Ser 302) homo-oligomeric GABA receptors. HVRDL-Ala 285 was 15-fold more sensitive to blockage by fipronil than HVRDL-Ser 285. DMRDL-Ala 302 and DMRDL-Ser-302 showed a similar level of sensitivity to blockage by fipronil. HVRDL-Ser 285 and DMRDL-Ser 302 exhibited a similar level of insensitivity to picrotoxinin. HVRDL-Ala 285 and DMRDL-Ala 302 showed a similar range of picrotoxinin sensitivity. DMRDL-Ala 302 and HVRDL-Ala 285 showed some sensitivity to blockage by dieldrin. Fipronil sensitivity was significantly altered by the serine to alanine mutation at position 285 in the M2 region of the HVRDL subunit, whereas no difference was observed between the DMRDL-Ser 302 and DMRDL-Ala 302 receptors.

26038726	20150604	Identification of miR-194-5p as a potential biomarker for postmenopausal osteoporosis.	The incidence of osteoporosis is high in postmenopausal women due to altered estrogen levels and continuous calcium loss that occurs with aging. Recent studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the development of osteoporosis. These miRNAs may be used as potential biomarkers to identify women at a high risk for developing the disease. In this study, whole blood samples were collected from 48 postmenopausal Chinese women with osteopenia or osteoporosis and pooled into six groups according to individual T-scores. A miRNA microarray analysis was performed on pooled blood samples to identify potential miRNA biomarkers for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Five miRNAs (miR-130b-3p, -151a-3p, -151b, -194-5p, and -590-5p) were identified in the microarray analysis. These dysregulated miRNAs were subjected to a pathway analysis investigating whether they were involved in regulating osteoporosis-related pathways. Among them, only miR-194-5p was enriched in multiple osteoporosis-related pathways. Enhanced miR-194-5p expression in women with osteoporosis was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. For external validation, a significant correlation between the expression of miR-194-5p and T-scores was found in an independent patient collection comprised of 24 postmenopausal women with normal bone mineral density, 30 postmenopausal women with osteopenia, and 32 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (p &lt; 0.05). Taken together, the present findings suggest that miR-194-5p may be a viable miRNA biomarker for postmenopausal osteoporosis. 	PeerJ	D016428
26833750	20160203	Dietary folate, one-carbon metabolism-related genes, and gastric cancer risk in Korea.	We evaluated the interactions between polymorphisms involved in one-carbon metabolism-related genes and dietary folate intake in gastric cancer risk within the Korean population through a hospital-based case-control study. A total of 542 controls and 271 cases were included. Genotype data were selected from data produced by the Affymetrix Axiom(?) Exome 319 Array. We considered seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of five genes whose SNPs are located in the coding region with a minor allele frequency &gt; 5%: MTHFR (G1793A, A1298C, C677T), MTR A2756G, MTRR A66G, SHMT1 C1420T, and SLC19A1 G80A. Our study found that MTR A2756G was associated with a decreased gastric cancer risk. MTHFR G1793A showed a statistically significant interaction between dietary folate intake and gastric cancer. Our results suggest that MTR A2756G is significantly associated with gastric cancer risk, and that MTHFR G1793A statistically interacts with dietary folate intake. Our findings indicate that gene-folate interactions may contribute to gastric cancer risk. 	Mol_Nutr_Food_Res	D016428 D013485
25949994	20150508	Heart failure: advanced development in genetics and epigenetics.	Heart failure (HF) is a complex pathophysiological syndrome that arises from a primary defect in the ability of the heart to take in and/or eject sufficient blood. Genetic mutations associated with familial dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy can contribute to the various pathologies of HF. Therefore, genetic screening could be an approach for guiding individualized therapies and surveillance. In addition, epigenetic regulation occurs via key mechanisms, including ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, DNA methylation, histone modification, and RNA-based mechanisms. MicroRNA is also a hot spot in HF research. This review gives an overview of genetic mutations associated with cardiomyopathy and the roles of some epigenetic mechanisms in HF.

19134204	20090113	Feeling manipulated: cytomegalovirus immune manipulation.	No one likes to feel like they have been manipulated, but in the case of cytomegalovirus (CMV) immune manipulation, we do not really have much choice. Whether you call it CMV immune modulation, manipulation, or evasion, the bottom line is that CMV alters the immune response in such a way to allow the establishment of latency with lifelong shedding. With millions of years of coevolution within their hosts, CMVs, like other herpesviruses, encode numerous proteins that can broadly influence the magnitude and quality of both innate and adaptive immune responses. These viral proteins include both homologues of host proteins, such as MHC class I or chemokine homologues, and proteins with little similarity to any other known proteins, such as the chemokine binding protein. Although a strong immune response is launched against CMV, these virally encoded proteins can interfere with the host's ability to efficiently recognize and clear virus, while others induce or alter specific immune responses to benefit viral replication or spread within the host. Modulation of host immunity allows survival of both the virus and the host. One way of describing it would be a kind of &quot;mutually assured survival&quot; (as opposed to MAD, Mutually Assured Destruction). Evaluation of this relationship provides important insights into the life cycle of CMV as well as a greater understanding of the complexity of the immune response to pathogens in general. 	Virol._J.

25815499	20150328	[Association between rs1079595 polymorphisms in the DRD2 gene and the distractibility based the temperament in school-age children].	To study the association between rs1079595 polymorphisms in the DRD2 gene and the distractibility in school-age children. The genotyping at rs1079595 was performed and the distractibility was measured based on the temperament questionnaire in 120 8-12 years old school-age children in order to analyze the effects of the rs1079595 polymorphism and its interaction with the gender, age and delivery mode on the distractibility. There was an association between the distractibility and rs1079595 polymorphisms. The distractibility score in children with GG/GT genotypes was significantly higher than in children with the TT genotype (4.3 ? 0.6 vs 4.0 ? 0.7; P&lt;0.05). The interaction between rs1079595 polymorphisms and the delivery mode produced an effect on the distractibility. The normal delivery children with T alleles were associated with a low distractibility (OR=0.037, P&lt;0.01). The distractibility based the temperament might be influenced by the rs1079595 polymorphism and its interaction with the delivery mode in school-age children.

27567897	20160829	The therapeutic efficacy of intensive medical therapy in ameliorating high-density lipoprotein dysfunction in subjects with type two diabetes.	To determine whether 12?months of intensive medical therapy (IMT) improves HDL functionality parameters in subjects with type II diabetes (T2D). Retrospective, randomized, and controlled 12-month IMT intervention trial that enrolled 13-subjects with T2D (age 51- years, fasting glucose 147?mg/dL, body mass index [BMI] 36.5?kg/m(2)) and nine healthy control (46-years, fasting glucose 90?mg/dL, BMI 26.5?kg/m2). Subjects with T2D underwent IMT and HDL functionality measures (pro-inflammatory index of high-density lipoprotein (pHDL)), paraoxonase one (PON1), ceruloplasmin (Cp), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were performed on samples at baseline and at 12-months following IMT. At baseline, pHDL index was significantly higher in subjects with T2D (p?&lt;?0.001) and apolipoprotein A-1 levels were significantly lower (p?=?0.013) vs. After 12-months, there was a trend for improved pHDL activity (p?=?0.083), as indicated by intent-to-treat analysis, but when the non-adherent subject was omitted (per-protocol), significant attenuations in pHDL activity (p?=?0.040) were noted; ? pHDL activity at 12-months was associated with ? weight (r?=?0.62, p?=?0.032) and ? fasting glucose (r?=?0.65, p?=?0.022). Moreover, PON1 activity significantly improved (p?&lt;?0.001). The aforementioned occurred in association with improvements in inflammatory markers (i.e., C-reactive protein &amp; tumor necrosis factor), hemoglobin A1C, fasting glucose, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein levels and adipokines. IMT ameliorates pHDL index and significantly improves anti-oxidative function, as measured by PON1. Improvements in weight and fasting glucose mediated the decrease in pHDL index. Pharmacological aids and lifestyle modification are required to improve cardiovascular risk factors, subsequent mortality risk, and promote T2D remission. Application of either form of therapy alone may only have relatively miniscule effects on the aforementioned factors, in relation to the aggregate. 	Lipids_Health_Dis	D016428 D016449
22124882	20111130	Detection and comparison of two types of ATP2C1 gene mutations in Chinese patients with Hailey-Hailey disease.	The gene ATP2C1 is identified as the defective gene in Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD). The nonsense and missense are two common types of mutations and have, respectively, been detected in many HHD patients. The aims of our study were to identify the pathogenic ATP2C1 abnormality in Chinese HHD patients, and to compare nonsense and missense mutations in vivo to provide further understanding of the molecular and the physiological basis of HHD. The nucleotide sequencing of the ATP2C1 gene was performed in HHD patients, unaffected family members and 100 unrelated individuals. Meanwhile, we detected and analyzed the clinical manifestations, the expression of ATP2C1 mRNA and hSPCA1 protein in the two types of mutations. Three heterozygous mutations were identified, including a previously reported nonsense mutation (R799X), two novel missense mutations (D644G) and (R417K). The results of comparisons between two types of mutations showed that the common clinical features, the similarly low-level expressions of ATP2C1 mRNA and hSPCA1 protein, but the ATP2C1 mRNA expression of nonsense mutation was lower than missense mutation and even less than half the level of normal people. Our findings expand the known spectrum of ATP2C1 mutations in HHD. We supported the haploinsufficiency theory as prevalent mechanism in both types of mutations, and believed that the differences of ATP2C1 mRNA expressions in peripheral blood may relate with the type of mutation and reflect the state of illness of patients.

An abdominal computed tomography revealed a localized, hypoattenuated lesion in a hepatic lateral segment, and kidney biopsy showed oxalate crystal deposition with tubular necrosis. In addition, the patient?s 24-hour urinary excretion of oxalate was increased. Her kidney and liver injury improved after sessions of hemodialysis, and urinary oxalate excretion was normalized. Major mutations in primary hyperoxaluria have not been proven. A full sequencing of target genes may be helpful to diagnose a rare form of primary hyperoxaluria. 	Kidney_Res_Clin_Pract	D016428
19170536	20090128	Structure of the analgesic mu-conotoxin KIIIA and effects on the structure and function of disulfide deletion.	Mu-conotoxin mu-KIIIA, from Conus kinoshitai, blocks mammalian neuronal voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) and is a potent analgesic following systemic administration in mice. We have determined its solution structure using NMR spectroscopy. Key residues identified previously as being important for activity against VGSCs (Lys7, Trp8, Arg10, Asp11, His12, and Arg14) all reside on an alpha-helix with the exception of Arg14. To further probe structure-activity relationships of this toxin against VGSC subtypes, we have characterized the analogue mu-KIIIA[C1A,C9A], in which the Cys residues involved in one of the three disulfides in mu-KIIIA were replaced with Ala. Its structure is quite similar to that of mu-KIIIA, indicating that the Cys1-Cys9 disulfide bond could be removed without any significant distortion of the alpha-helix bearing the key residues. Consistent with this, mu-KIIIA[C1A,C9A] retained activity against VGSCs, with its rank order of potency being essentially the same as that of mu-KIIIA, namely, Na(V)1.2 &gt; Na(V)1.4 &gt; Na(V)1.7 &gt;or= Na(V)1.1 &gt; Na(V)1.3 &gt; Na(V)1.5. Kinetics of block were obtained for Na(V)1.2, Na(V)1.4, and Na(V)1.7, and in each case, both k(on) and k(off) values of mu-KIIIA[C1A,C9A] were larger than those of mu-KIIIA. Our results show that the key residues for VGSC binding lie mostly on an alpha-helix and that the first disulfide bond can be removed without significantly affecting the structure of this helix, although the modification accelerates the on and off rates of the peptide against all tested VGSC subtypes. These findings lay the groundwork for the design of minimized peptides and helical mimetics as novel analgesics. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D052061 D013485
15123708	20040505	Human deafness mutation of myosin VI (C442Y) accelerates the ADP dissociation rate.	The missense mutation of Cys(442) to Tyr of myosin VI causes progressive postlingual sensorineural deafness. Here we report the affects of the C442Y mutation on the kinetics of the actomyosin ATP hydrolysis mechanism and motor function of myosin VI. The largest changes in the kinetic mechanism of ATP hydrolysis produced by the C442Y mutation are about 10-fold increases in the rate of ADP dissociation from both myosin VI and actomyosin VI. The rates of ADP dissociation from acto-C442Y myosin VI-ADP and C442Y myosin VI-ADP are 20-40 times more rapid than the steady state rates and cannot be the rate-limiting steps of the hydrolysis mechanism in the presence or absence of actin. The 2-fold increase in the actin gliding velocity of C442Y compared with wild type (WT) may be explained at least in part by the more rapid rate of ADP dissociation. The C442Y myosin VI has a significant increase ( approximately 10-fold) in the steady state ATPase rate in the absence of actin relative to WT myosin VI. The steady state rate of actin-activated ATP hydrolysis is unchanged by the C442Y mutation at low (&lt;10(-7) m) calcium but is calcium-sensitive with a 1.6-fold increase at high ( approximately 10(-4) m) calcium that does not occur with WT. The actin gliding velocity of the C442Y mutant decreases significantly at low surface density of myosin VI, suggesting that the mutation hampers the processive movement of myosin VI. 	J._Biol._Chem.

10923816	20000803	Autoxidation of ascorbic acid catalyzed by the copper(II) bound to L-histidine oligopeptides, (His)iGly and acetyl-(His)i Gly (i=9, 19, 29). Relationship between catalytic activity and coordination mode.	Spectroscopic and kinetic studies on the autoxidation of ascorbic acid catalyzed by copper complexes of histidine oligopeptides, (His)iGly (i=4, 9, 19, 29), and their acetyl derivatives, Ac-(His)iGly (i=9, 19) have been carried out at pH 4.4 and 25 degrees C under dioxygen. The reaction was monitored at 260 nm using a stopped-flow spectrophotometric technique. The reaction fitted the &quot;Michaelis- Menten&quot; mechanism, and ascorbate was oxidized by the &quot;Ping-Pong&quot; mechanism. The Cu(lI) complexed with the oligopeptide (i &gt; or = 9) enhanced the reaction approximately two-fold relative to the aqueous Cu(II). The catalytic activity depends on the molecular weight which is related to the number of histidyl residues and on the coordination mode of the copper-binding site. Results of circular dichroism (CD) experiments revealed the existence of two types of Cu(II). The catalytically active Cu(II), which is accommodated in the imidazole clusters composed of at least six histidyl residues, exhibits d-d transition bands at 520 and 630 nm, and is easily dissociable, enhances the autoxidation; Ac-(His)19Gly is likely to accommodate approximately three active Cu(II) ions. The Cu(II), which is complexed tightly with the terminal H2N-X-Y-His- moiety, where X and Y denote amino acids, inhibits the autoxidation, and exhibits absorption bands at 480 and 550 nm.

18439317	20080429	Association between promoter -1607 polymorphism of MMP1 and lumbar disc disease in Southern Chinese.	Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix of the intervertebral disc. A SNP for guanine insertion/deletion (G/D), the -1607 promoter polymorphism, of the MMP1 gene was found significantly affecting promoter activity and corresponding transcription level. Hence it is a good candidate for genetic studies in DDD. Southern Chinese volunteers between 18 and 55 years were recruited from the population. DDD in the lumbar spine was defined by MRI using Schneiderman's classification. Genomic DNA was isolated from the leukocytes and genotyping was performed using the Sequenom platform. Association and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium checking were assessed by Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U test. Our results showed substantial evidence of association between -1607 promoter polymorphism of MMP1 and DDD in the Southern Chinese subjects. D allelic was significantly associated with DDD (p value = 0.027, odds ratio = 1.41 with 95% CI = 1.04-1.90) while Genotypic association on the presence of D allele was also significantly associated with DDD (p value = 0.046, odds ratio = 1.50 with 95% CI = 1.01-2.24). Further age stratification showed significant genotypic as well as allelic association in the group of over 40 years (genotypic: p value = 0.035, odds ratio = 1.617 with 95% CI = 1.033-2.529; allelic: p value = 0.033, odds ratio = 1.445 with 95% CI = 1.029-2.029). Disc bulge, annular tears and the Schmorl's nodes were not associated with the D allele. We demonstrated that individuals with the presence of D allele for the -1607 promoter polymorphism of MMP1 are about 1.5 times more susceptible to develop DDD when compared with those having G allele only. Further association was identified in individuals over 40 years of age. Disc bulge, annular tear as well as Schmorl's nodes were not associated with this polymorphism. 	BMC_Med._Genet.

21179726	20101225	[Analysis on relationship of Chinese medicine syndrome pattern with urinary albumin excretion rate and its related factors in early stage diabetic nephropathy].	To investigate the relationship of Chinese medicine syndrome pattern with urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) and its related factors in patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN). Sixty-three early stage DN patients were subjected to the study, the Chinese medicine syndrome patterns were differentiated, and their condition of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutation was detected (shown by gene polymorphism of 677 base pairs). Meantime, plasma levels of homocysteine (Hcy), folic acid, fasting and postprandial glucose (FG and PG), glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), blood lipids as well as UAER were measured. Syndrome pattern was differentiated as yin-deficiency with heat-flourishing in 17 patients, qi-yin deficiency in 24, and yin-yang deficiency in 22; while accompanied blood stasis syndrome (BSS) was found in 35. Gene polymorphism detection indicated that 19 patients were of CC-type, 17 of TT-type, and 27 of CT-type. Analysis showed that higher UAER level often revealed in patients with BSS, as compared with that in patients of non-BS pattern, the difference was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). UAER levels in patients of different genotypes were insignificantly different (P &gt; 0.05), but showed a linear regressive relation, namely positively correlated with Hcy level in patients of isogeneic type (r = 0.674, P &lt; 0.05). No statistical significance was found between levels of UAER and other related factors (P &gt; 0.05). UAER level in early stage DN patients of BSS pattern is rather higher, and it shows a linear regression relationship (positive correlation) with Hcy level in patients of isogeneic type.

20454499	20100511	Isolated familial somatotropinoma: 11q13-loh and gene/protein expression analysis suggests a possible involvement of aip also in non-pituitary tumorigenesis.	Non-pituitary tumors have been reported in a subset of patients harboring germline mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP) gene. However, no detailed investigations of non-pituitary tumors of AIP-mutated patients have been reported so far. We examined a MEN1- and p53-negative mother-daughter pair with acromegaly due to somatotropinoma. Subsequently, the mother developed a large virilizing adrenocortical carcinoma and a grade II B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Mutational analysis was performed by automated sequencing. Loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) analysis was carried out by sequencing and microsatellite analysis. AIP expression was assessed through quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry. The functional inactivating mutation c.241C&gt;T (R81X), which blocks the AIP protein from interacting with phosphodiesterase 4A (PDE4A), was identified in the heterozygous state in the leukocyte DNA of both patients. Analyzing the tumoral DNA revealed that the AIP wild-type allele was lost in the daughter's somatotropinoma and the mother's adrenocortical carcinoma. Both tumors displayed low AIP protein expression levels. Low AIP gene expression was confirmed by qPCR in the adrenocortical carcinoma. No evidence of LOH was observed in the DNA sample from the mother's B-cell lymphoma, and this tumor displayed normal AIP immunostaining. Our study presents the first molecular analysis of non-pituitary tumors in AIP-mutated patients. The finding of AIP inactivation in the adrenocortical tumor suggests that further investigation of the potential role of this recently identified tumor suppressor gene in non-pituitary tumors, mainly in those tumors in which the cAMP and the 11q13 locus are implicated, is likely to be worthwhile.

23172224	20121123	The neuroendocrine protein 7B2 suppresses the aggregation of neurodegenerative disease-related proteins.	Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer (AD) and Parkinson (PD) are characterized by abnormal aggregation of misfolded ?-sheet-rich proteins, including amyloid-? (A?)-derived peptides and tau in AD and ?-synuclein in PD. Correct folding and assembly of these proteins are controlled by ubiquitously expressed molecular chaperones; however, our understanding of neuron-specific chaperones and their involvement in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases is limited. We here describe novel chaperone-like functions for the secretory protein 7B2, which is widely expressed in neuronal and endocrine tissues. In in vitro experiments, 7B2 efficiently prevented fibrillation and formation of A?(1-42), A?(1-40), and ?-synuclein aggregates at a molar ratio of 1:10. In cell culture experiments, inclusion of recombinant 7B2, either in the medium of Neuro-2A cells or intracellularly via adenoviral 7B2 overexpression, blocked the neurocytotoxic effect of A?(1-42) and significantly increased cell viability. Conversely, knockdown of 7B2 by RNAi increased A?(1-42)-induced cytotoxicity. In the brains of APP/PSEN1 mice, a model of AD amyloidosis, immunoreactive 7B2 co-localized with aggregation-prone proteins and their respective aggregates. Furthermore, in the hippocampus and substantia nigra of human AD- and PD-affected brains, 7B2 was highly co-localized with A? plaques and ?-synuclein deposits, strongly suggesting physiological association. Our data provide insight into novel functions of 7B2 and establish this neural protein as an anti-aggregation chaperone associated with neurodegenerative disease. 	J._Biol._Chem.

19065535	20081210	[Association of the polymorphisms in NURR1 gene with Parkinson's disease].	To investigate the association between the polymorphisms of [c.-2922(C)2-3 and IVS6+ 18insG] in the NURR1 gene and Parkinson's disease (PD) in a Han population from Sichuan province. PCR, allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were used to determine the genotype of each subject. The two polymorphic sites in 241 PD patients and 236 controls with matched age, gender and ethnicity were analyzed. In the IVS6+ 18insG site, the difference of genotype frequencies of 3G/3G, 3G/2G and 2G/2G was not statistically significant. However, the 3G/2G genotype frequency was significantly higher in the PD with age of onset being &lt; 50 years than that in controls (chi (2)= 6.537, P= 0.011; OR= 1.913, 95%CI: 1.159-3.158). No significant differences were found in allele and genotype frequencies of the c.-2922(C)2-3 site in the promoter region between the PD and controls (P= 0.766). This study suggested that the IVS6+ 18insG polymorphism may be associated with genetic susceptibility of PD with age of onset being &lt; 50 years and the c.-2922(C)2-3 site in the promoter region may not be a risk factor for PD in authors' patient group.

20098674	20100126	Dissociation of the octameric enolase from S. pyogenes--one interface stabilizes another.	Most enolases are homodimers. There are a few that are octamers, with the eight subunits arranged as a tetramer of dimers. These dimers have the same basic fold and same subunit interactions as are found in the dimeric enolases. The dissociation of the octameric enolase from S. pyogenes was examined, using NaClO(4), a weak chaotrope, to perturb the quaternary structure. Dissociation was monitored by sedimentation velocity. NaClO(4) dissociated the octamer into inactive monomers. There was no indication that dissociation of the octamer into monomers proceeded via formation of significant amounts of dimer or any other intermediate species. Two mutations at the dimer-dimer interface, F137L and E363G, were introduced in order to destabilize the octameric structure. The double mutant was more easily dissociated than was the wild type. Dissociation could also be produced by other salts, including tetramethylammonium chloride (TMACl) or by increasing pH. In all cases, no significant amounts of dimers or other intermediates were formed. Weakening one interface in this protein weakened the other interface as well. Although enolases from most organisms are dimers, the dimeric form of the S. pyogenes enzyme appears to be unstable. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
16784245	20060621	Probing the ubiquinol-binding site in cytochrome bd by site-directed mutagenesis.	To probe the structure of the quinol oxidation site in loop VI/VII of the Escherichia coli cytochrome bd, we substituted three conserved residues (Gln249, Lys252, and Glu257) in the N-terminal region and three glutamates (Glu278, Glu279, and Glu280) in the first internal repeat. We found that substitutions of Glu257 by Ala or Gln, and Glu279 and Glu280 by Gln, severely reduced the oxidase activity and the expression level of cytochrome bd. In contrast, Lys252 mutations reduced only the oxidase activity. Blue shifts in the 440 and 630 nm peaks of the reduced Lys252 mutants and in the 561 nm peak of the reduced Glu257 mutants indicate the proximity of Lys252 to the heme b(595)-d binuclear center and Glu257 to heme b(558), respectively. Perturbations of reduced heme b(558) upon binding of aurachin D support structural changes in the quinol-binding site of the mutants. Substitutions of Lys252 and Glu257 caused large changes in kinetic parameters for the ubiquinol-1 oxidation. These results indicate that Lys252 and Glu257 in the N-terminal region of the Q-loop are involved in the quinol oxidation by bd-type terminal oxidase. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485
12437331	20021120	Substrate routes to the buried active site may vary among cytochromes P450: mutagenesis of the F-G region in P450 2B1.	Until recently, all known structures of bacterial cytochromes P450 suggested that substrate access to the buried active site occurred via the F-G region, a surface loop distal to the heme cavity. However, the structure of P450 51 indicates a large opening from the protein surface along the I helix N-terminus, at right angles to the F-G channel. The single available microsomal P450 structure (2C5) does not obviously favor one potential access route over the other. To determine whether the F-G region forms part of the substrate access channel in the microsomal cytochrome P450 2B1, 11 residues between positions 208 and 230 were substituted with smaller and larger side chains in a highly expressed truncated form of the enzyme. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined with the substrates testosterone, 7-ethoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (7-EFC), and 7-benzyoxyresorufin (7-BR). The largest changes, 2-6-fold increases in k(cat) with testosterone and 7-EFC, were observed for L209A, which also exhibits an altered testosterone metabolite profile and probably forms part of the active site roof. F219W demonstrated little or no activity with any of the three substrates examined, although the K(s) value for benzphetamine binding was unaltered. S221F showed little activity with 7-BR. No significant changes were observed in K(m)(testosterone) or S(50)(7-EFC) values for any of the mutants, in stark contrast to the 10-fold and 100-fold changes in K(m) observed for mutants in this region of other cytochromes P450. The minimal changes in 2B1 do not support access via the F-G region of 2B1 and suggest the alternate access route identified in P450 51. 	Chem._Res._Toxicol.	D003160 D016428
20616539	20100710	Is the JAK2 V617F mutation a hallmark for different forms of thrombosis?	The association between venous thrombosis outside the splanchnic area as well arterial thromboembolism and the JAK2 V617F mutation, an important marker for chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), is not completely clear. Four hundred forty-four patients with venous thrombosis of the lower/upper limbs and/or pulmonary embolism and 60 patients with ischemic stroke were screened for the JAK2 V617F mutation, factor V Leiden, and factor II G20210A. The JAK2 V617F mutation was detected in 1.4% of patients with venous thrombosis and in 3.3% of patients with ischemic stroke. Because 6 out of 2,430 control individuals with no medical history of venous thrombosis, stroke, or MPN were positive for the JAK2 V617F mutation, a significant association was observed (OR 5.53, CI 1.77-17.2, p = 0.0053 for venous thrombosis; OR 13.9, CI 2.75-70.5, p = 0.0145 for stroke). We provide evidence of the association between the JAK2 V617F mutation and different forms of thrombosis. This association is comparable with the association between inherited risk factors (factor V Leiden and factor II G20210A) and thrombotic events, but with a much lower prevalence of the mutation. Finally, the JAK2 V617F mutation is not absent from the general population despite being considered somatic and an acquired genetic variation. 	Acta_Haematol.	D016428
7619792	19950718	Aspartic acid 26 in reduced Escherichia coli thioredoxin has a pKa &gt; 9.	Apparent pKa values of active site residues Asp26, Cys32, and Cys35 in reduced thioredoxin have been characterized. Both wild-type thioredoxin and mutant D26A thioredoxin were selectively 13C-enriched on cysteine beta-carbons. In both proteins, the variation with pH of 1HB1, 1HB2, and 13CB NMR chemical shifts has been measured. In wild-type reduced thioredoxin, for both cysteines, the pH versus chemical shift plots of HB1 protons can be fit to one titration with pKa values of 7.0-7.1. In contrast, the HB2 protons and beta-carbons give pH--chemical shift plots that clearly reflect more than one titration; fits to the data give apparent pKa values of 7.0-7.3 and 9.5 for HB2 protons and 7.5-7.9 and 9.2-10.2 for CB carbons. In reduced D26A, all three probe chemical shifts have a pH dependence that is fit by one titration with pKa of 7.4-7.9. The absence of a titration with pKa &gt; 9 in D26A, taken together with cysteine thiol pKa values of 7.1 and 7.9 determined by Raman spectroscopy [Li et al. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 5800-5808], indicates that the pKa &gt; 9 in reduced thioredoxin is that of Asp26. This is highly significant in view of the previous observation that, in oxidized thioredoxin, Asp26 pKa is 7.5 [Langsetmo et al. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 7603-7609]. The very high pKa values of these carboxyls is consistent with their local environment in the three-dimensional structure; the Asp26 side chain in oxidized thioredoxin is almost but not completely buried, and in reduced thioredoxin it may be even more buried.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013487
27780828	20161027	Lurbinectedin induces depletion of tumor-associated macrophages, an essential component of its in vivo synergism with gemcitabine, in pancreatic adenocarcinoma mouse models.	We explored whether the combination of lurbinectedin (PM01183) with the antimetabolite gemcitabine could result in a synergistic antitumor effect in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) mouse models. We also studied the contribution of lurbinectedin to this synergism. This drug presents a dual pharmacological effect that contributes to its in vivo antitumor activity: (i) specific binding to DNA minor grooves, inhibiting active transcription and DNA repair; and (ii) specific depletion of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We evaluated the in vivo antitumor activity of lurbinectedin and gemcitabine as single agents and in combination in SW-1990 and MIA PaCa-2 cell-line xenografts and in patient-derived PDA models (AVATAR). Lurbinectedin-gemcitabine combination induced a synergistic effect on both MIA PaCa-2 [combination index (CI)=0.66] and SW-1990 (CI=0.80) tumor xenografts. It also induced complete tumor remissions in four out of six patient-derived PDA xenografts. This synergism was associated with enhanced DNA damage (anti-?-H2AX), cell cycle blockage, caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. In addition to the enhanced DNA damage, which is a consequence of the interaction of the two drugs with the DNA, lurbinectedin induced TAM depletion leading to cytidine deaminase (CDA) downregulation in PDA tumors. This effect could, in turn, induce an increase of gemcitabine-mediated DNA damage that was especially relevant in high-density TAM tumors. These results show that lurbinectedin can be used to develop 'molecularly targeted' combination strategies. 	Dis_Model_Mech	D016428 D013485
22451137	20120328	Major effect of retinal short-chain dehydrogenase reductase (RDHE2) on bovine fat colour.	Beef with yellow fat is considered undesirable by consumers in most European and Asian markets. ?-Carotene is the major carotenoid deposited in the adipose tissue and milk fat of cattle (Bos taurus), which can result in the yellowness. The effects of retinal short-chain dehydrogenase reductase (RDHE2) and ?, ?-carotene 9',10-dioxygenase (BCO2) were considered jointly as major candidate genes for causing the yellow fat colour, based on their genomic locations in the fat colour quantitative trait loci (QTL) and their roles in the metabolism of ?-carotene. In a secondary pathway, BCO2 cleaves ?-carotene into retinoic acid, the most potent form of vitamin A. RDHE2 converts trans-retinol to trans-retinal, a less active form of vitamin A. We evaluated the effects of two amino acid variants of the RDHE2 gene (V6A and V33A) along with a mutation in the BCO2 gene that results in a stop codon (W80X) in seven cattle populations. The RDHE2 V6A genotype affected several fat colour traits but the size of the effect varied in the populations studied. The genotype effect of the RDHE2 V33A variant was observed only in New Zealand samples of unknown breed. In general, the individual effects of RDHE2 V6A and V33A SNPs genotypes were greater in the random New Zealand samples than in samples from pedigreed Jersey-Limousin backcross progeny, accounting for 8-17 % of the variance in one population. Epistasis between the BCO2 W80X and RDHE2 variants was observed, and in some populations this explained more of the variation than the effects of the individual RDHE2 variants.

27796577	20161101	Regulation of human cardiac Kv1.5 channels by extracellular acidification.	Human Kv1.5 channels (hKv1.5) conduct the ultra-rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IKur), which plays an important role in action potential repolarization of atrial myocytes. The present study was undertaken to examine the effects of acidic pH on hKv1.5 wild-type (WT) and its pore mutant channels heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using site-directed mutagenesis combined with whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Both extracellular and intracellular acidifications equally and reversely reduced the amplitude of hKv1.5 currents. The extracellular acidification significantly shifted the voltage dependence of current activation to more depolarized potentials and accelerated deactivation kinetics of the current. The ancillary ? subunits Kv?1.3 and Kv?1.2, known to modify the pharmacological sensitivities of hKv1.5, enhanced the extracellular proton-induced inhibitory effect on hKv1.5 current. In addition, several mutants (T462C, T479A, T480A, and I508A) exhibited significantly higher sensitivity to acidic pH-induced inhibition compared with WT channel, whereas the inhibitory effect of acidic pH was markedly reduced in H463G mutant. These observations indicate that (1) extracellular acidification modifies hKv1.5 gating and activity, (2) ? subunits and several residues (T462, T479, T480, and I508) play critical roles in determining the sensitivity of the channel to acidic exposure, and (3) H463 may be a critical sensor for the channel inhibition by extracellular protons.

9210705	19970701	In situ simultaneous detection of hepatitis C virus RNA and hepatitis C virus-related antigens in hepatocellular carcinoma.	The overwhelming evidence that chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is based on epidemiologic, case-control, and cohort studies as well as laboratory investigations. To address better the pathogenesis of HCV infection at the single-cell level, the authors developed a specific reproducible method for the simultaneous detection of HCV specific sequences and antigens in liver tissue, using a combination of nonradioactive in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. After immunohistochemical staining of the liver sections for E2/NS-1, C22-3, C33c, C100-3, and NS-5 antigens with immunogold-silver technique, in situ hybridization was performed on the same sections using digoxigenin-labeled HCV 5' NonCoding specific probes. The hybridization signal was detected by an antidigoxigenin, Fab fragment-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. This simultaneous detection permitted the subcellular localization of HCV RNA and antigens with excellent preservation of tissue morphology and absence of background staining. In addition, the types and percentages of cells harboring HCV in tissue could be determined. The in situ detection of HCV showed positive signals in both cancerous and noncancerous areas of liver tissue in six of six HCV-infected patients with HCC and in none of four controls, including three HCV negative HCC patients and one patient with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Two classes of infected cells were distinguished throughout the liver: (1) cells containing large amounts of negative-stranded HCV RNA, which were probably undergoing active viral replication; and (2) cells displaying positive-stranded HCV RNA only, with unpredictable levels of viral replication. Both types expressed core, envelope, and NS-3, -4, and -5 proteins. HCV RNA and antigens were exclusively cytoplasmic. Detection of viral proteins was highly predictive of the presence of large amounts of HCV RNA in the same cell. Fewer HCV positive cells were consistently demonstrated in the cancerous area. These findings support the contention that HCV infects hepatocytes and replicates in them, even after their malignant transformation. 	Cancer	D016430 D003160 D018848 D016428 D013485
11555397	20010914	Analysis of Btk mutations in patients with X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA) and determination of carrier status in normal female relatives: a nationwide study of Btk deficiency in Greece.	Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, critical for B-cell development and function. Mutations that inactivate this kinase were found in families with X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA). In this study the Btk gene was analyzed in 13 registered Greek patients with XLA phenotype originated from 12 unrelated families, in order to provide a definite diagnosis of the XLA. The structure of Btk was analyzed at the cDNA level using the recently developed method, NIRCA (Non-Isotopic-Rnase-Cleavage-Assay). Alterations were detected in all patients and sequencing analysis confirmed the results and defined six novel XLA-associated Btk mutations (three missense mutations: C337G, L346R, L452P; one nonsense mutation: Y392X, and two frameshift alterations: c1211-1212delA, c1306-1307insA). Having defined the genetic alteration in the affected males of these families, the information was used to design polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers and the Btk segments containing the mutated sequences were amplified from peripheral blood derived genomic DNA of potential female carriers. The PCR products were directly sequenced and carrier status was determined in 12 out of 16 phenotypically normal females analyzed. This protocol can be used once the nature of the Btk mutation has been defined in one of the affected males and provides a convenient, simple and reliable way to determine the carrier status of other female family members. Molecular genetic analysis constitutes a determinative tool for the definitive diagnosis of XLA and may allow accurate carrier and prenatal diagnosis for genetic counselling. 	Scand._J._Immunol.

23242215	20121218	Increased expression of BubR1 protects against aneuploidy and cancer and extends healthy lifespan.	The BubR1 gene encodes for a mitotic regulator that ensures accurate segregation of chromosomes through its role in the mitotic checkpoint and the establishment of proper microtubule-kinetochore attachments. Germline mutations that reduce BubR1 abundance cause aneuploidy, shorten lifespan and induce premature ageing phenotypes and cancer in both humans and mice. A reduced BubR1 expression level is also a feature of chronological ageing, but whether this age-related decline has biological consequences is unknown. Using a transgenic approach in mice, we show that sustained high-level expression of BubR1 preserves genomic integrity and reduces tumorigenesis, even in the presence of genetic alterations that strongly promote aneuplodization and cancer, such as oncogenic Ras. We find that BubR1 overabundance exerts its protective effect by correcting mitotic checkpoint impairment and microtubule-kinetochore attachment defects. Furthermore, sustained high-level expression of BubR1 extends lifespan and delays age-related deterioration and aneuploidy in several tissues. Collectively, these data uncover a generalized function for BubR1 in counteracting defects that cause whole-chromosome instability and suggest that modulating BubR1 provides a unique opportunity to extend healthy lifespan.

28002442	20161222	Overexpression of TIMP-3 in Chondrocytes Produces Transient Reduction in Growth Plate Length but Permanently Reduces Adult Bone Quality and Quantity.	Bone development and length relies on the growth plate formation, which is dependent on degradative enzymes such as MMPs. Indeed, deletion of specific members of this enzyme family in mice results in important joint and bone abnormalities, suggesting a role in skeletal development. As such, the control of MMP activity is vital in the complex process of bone formation and growth. We generated a transgenic mouse line to overexpress TIMP3 in mouse chondrocytes using the Col2a1-chondrocyte promoter. This overexpression in cartilage resulted in a transient shortening of growth plate in homozygote mice but bone length was restored at eight weeks of age. However, tibial bone structure and mechanical properties remained compromised. Despite no transgene expression in adult osteoblasts from transgenic mice in vitro, their differentiation capacity was decreased. Neonates, however, did show transgene expression in a subset of bone cells. Our data demonstrate for the first time that transgene function persists in the chondro-osseous lineage continuum and exert influence upon bone quantity and quality. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428
16567465	20060329	Roles of K149, G352, and H401 in the channel functions of ClC-0: testing the predictions from theoretical calculations.	The ClC family of Cl(-) channels and transporters comprises membrane proteins ubiquitously present in species ranging from prokaryotes to mammals. The recently solved structures of the bacterial ClC proteins have provided a good model to guide the functional experiments for the eukaryotic Cl(-) channels. Theoretical calculations based on the bacterial ClC structures have identified several residues critical for the Cl(-) binding energy in the Cl(-) transport pathway. It was speculated that the corresponding residues in eukaryotic Cl(-) channels might play similar roles for the channel functions. In this study, we made a series of mutations in three such residues in eukaryotic ClC Cl(-) channels (K149, G352, and H401 in ClC-0) and studied the functional consequences on the channel properties. A cysteine modification approach was also employed to evaluate the electrostatic effects of the charge placed at these three positions. The experimental results revealed that among the three residues tested, K149 plays the most important role in controlling both the gating and the permeation functions of ClC-0. On the other hand, mutations of H401 alter the channel conductance but not the gating properties, while mutations of G352 result in very little functional consequence. The mutation of K149 into a neutral residue leucine (K149L) shifts the activation curve and leads to flickery channel openings. The anion permeability ratios derived from bi-ionic experiments are also significantly altered in that the selectivity of Cl(-) over other anions is decreased. Furthermore, removing the positive charge at this position reduces and increases, respectively, the accessibility of the negatively and positively charged methane thiosulfonate reagents to the pore. The control of the accessibility to charged MTS reagents and the regulation of the anion permeation support the idea that K149 exerts an electrostatic effect on the channel function, confirming the prediction from computational studies.

27236826	20160530	Role of adiponectin gene variants, adipokines and hydrometry-based percent body fat in metabolically healthy and abnormal obesity.	Metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) subjects have better metabolic parameters than metabolically abnormal obesity (MAO) subjects, but the possible mechanisms underlying this remain unknown. Our study was designed to investigate the interrelationships among genes, adipokines, body fat and its distribution in MHO and MAO. From 2007 to 2009, 103 males and 131 females aged 18-50 years were enrolled by an intention-to-treat design in a weight management clinic. Participants were divided into MHO and MAO groups. Percent body fat (PBF) was measured by a deuterium oxide dilution method. Four polymorphic variants, including PPAR?2 (Pro12Ala and C1431T) and adiponectin (T45G and G276T) genes, and three adipokines (adiponectin, leptin and resistin) were obtained. Of the 234 obese subjects, 130 (55.6%) were MHO. In the univariate analysis, the MAO group has significantly higher anthropometric, metabolic indices and leptin levels than the MHO group. Logistic regression analysis revealed that age, male gender, the T allele of adiponectin T45G polymorphism, leptin and PBF were positively associated with MAO. ANCOVA analysis revealed that the T allele of adiponectin T45G polymorphism was associated with higher fasting and postprandial glucose levels. We further found that TT genotype has a lower high molecular weight (HMW)/low molecular weight (LMW) adiponectin ratio than GG genotype. The factors associated with MAO are age, male gender, the T allele of adiponectin T45G polymorphism, leptin, and PBF. The net effects of T45G polymorphism on the MAO phenotype may be achieved by changes in the adiponectin oligomer ratio and glucose levels. 	Obes_Res_Clin_Pract	D016428
26482462	20151021	Association of XPD (Lys751Gln) and XRCC1 (Arg280His) gene polymorphisms in myelodysplastic syndrome.	Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are heterogeneous hematopoietic disease characterized by ineffective haematopoiesis that frequently transforms into acute leukaemia. Alterations in many individual biologic pathways have been reported in MDS pathophysiology. Disease progression along the MDS, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) continuum is believed to be a consequence of stepwise accumulation of DNA mutations which infers a defect in DNA repair. The present study investigated the association between DNA repair genes (XRCC1, XRCC3, OGG1, XPD and RAD51) and the risk of developing MDS. The study was carried out in 92 primary MDS patients. The genotyping study was carried out by PCR-RFLP technique. We have studied seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of five DNA repair genes (XRCC1 (Arg194Trp, Arg280His, Arg399Gln), XRCC3, XPD, RAD51 and OGG1). Significantly, a high frequency of DNA repair gene XRCC1 (Arg280His) (p=0.05) and XPD (Lys751Gln) (p=0.01) polymorphism was observed in MDS patients compared to controls. The distribution of polymorphisms in MDS subgroups showed a significant association of XRCC1 with RAEB I compared to other subgroup. Though a high frequency of XRCC1 gene polymorphism was observed in farmers and tobacco chewers, it was not statistically significant. Our study suggests that XRCC1 (Arg280His) and XPD polymorphisms are associated with risk of MDS and XRCC1 polymorphism strongly associated with advanced MDS subgroup. Hence, these polymorphisms can be used as a prognostic marker in MDS. 	Ann._Hematol.	D016428 D013485
26151378	20150708	Identifying active vascular microcalcification by (18)F-sodium fluoride positron emission tomography.	Vascular calcification is a complex biological process that is a hallmark of atherosclerosis. While macrocalcification confers plaque stability, microcalcification is a key feature of high-risk atheroma and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Positron emission tomography and X-ray computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging of atherosclerosis using (18)F-sodium fluoride ((18)F-NaF) has the potential to identify pathologically high-risk nascent microcalcification. However, the precise molecular mechanism of (18)F-NaF vascular uptake is still unknown. Here we use electron microscopy, autoradiography, histology and preclinical and clinical PET/CT to analyse (18)F-NaF binding. We show that (18)F-NaF adsorbs to calcified deposits within plaque with high affinity and is selective and specific. (18)F-NaF PET/CT imaging can distinguish between areas of macro- and microcalcification. This is the only currently available clinical imaging platform that can non-invasively detect microcalcification in active unstable atherosclerosis. The use of (18)F-NaF may foster new approaches to developing treatments for vascular calcification. 	Nat_Commun	D016428 D013485
23202889	20121204	Prognostic and predictive roles of KRAS mutation in colorectal cancer.	The RAS gene family is among the most studied and best characterized of the known cancer-related genes. Of the three human ras isoforms, KRAS is the most frequently altered gene, with mutations occurring in 17%-25% of all cancers. In particular, approximately 30%-40% of colon cancers harbor a KRAS mutation. KRAS mutations in colon cancers have been associated with poorer survival and increased tumor aggressiveness. Additionally, KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer lead to resistance to select treatment strategies. In this review we examine the history of KRAS, its prognostic value in patients with colorectal cancer, and evidence supporting its predictive value in determining appropriate therapies for patients with colorectal cancer.

22092591	20111119	Mutational analysis of YgfZ, a folate-dependent protein implicated in iron/sulphur cluster metabolism.	Proteins of the YgfZ family occur in all domains of life and are characterized by the conserved dodecapeptide motif KGC[Y/F]-x-GQE-x(3) -[R/K]. YgfZ proteins are known to participate in assembly or repair of iron/sulphur clusters, and to require folate for biological activity, but their mechanism of action is unknown. To assess the importance of individual residues in the conserved motif, Escherichia coli Ygf?Z was expressed from a plasmid in a ?ygfZ strain and subjected to alanine-scanning mutagenesis. The impacts on YgfZ functionality were evaluated by assays of growth and of the in vivo activity of the iron/sulphur enzyme MiaB, which modifies tRNA. By these criteria, the motif's tyrosine residue (Y229) had a detectable influence but only the cysteine residue (C228) was critical, for only the C228A mutant failed to complement the growth and MiaB activity phenotypes of the ?ygfZ strain. Immunoblots confirmed that the latter result was not simply because of a low level of the C228A mutant protein. Collectively, these data demonstrate a pivotal role for the Ygf?Z motif's cysteine residue and a subsidiary one for the adjacent tyrosine, and help formulate a hypothesis about the folate requirement of Ygf?Z proteins.

27144573	20160505	Bioprospecting Sponge-Associated Microbes for Antimicrobial Compounds.	Sponges are the most prolific marine organisms with respect to their arsenal of bioactive compounds including antimicrobials. However, the majority of these substances are probably not produced by the sponge itself, but rather by bacteria or fungi that are associated with their host. This review for the first time provides a comprehensive overview of antimicrobial compounds that are known to be produced by sponge-associated microbes. We discuss the current state-of-the-art by grouping the bioactive compounds produced by sponge-associated microorganisms in four categories: antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal and antiprotozoal compounds. Based on in vitro activity tests, identified targets of potent antimicrobial substances derived from sponge-associated microbes include: human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) (2-undecyl-4-quinolone, sorbicillactone A and chartarutine B); influenza A (H1N1) virus (truncateol M); nosocomial Gram positive bacteria (thiopeptide YM-266183, YM-266184, mayamycin and kocurin); Escherichia coli (sydonic acid), Chlamydia trachomatis (naphthacene glycoside SF2446A2); Plasmodium spp. (manzamine A and quinolone 1); Leishmania donovani (manzamine A and valinomycin); Trypanosoma brucei (valinomycin and staurosporine); Candida albicans and dermatophytic fungi (saadamycin, 5,7-dimethoxy-4-p-methoxylphenylcoumarin and YM-202204). Thirty-five bacterial and 12 fungal genera associated with sponges that produce antimicrobials were identified, with Streptomyces, Pseudovibrio, Bacillus, Aspergillus and Penicillium as the prominent producers of antimicrobial compounds. Furthemore culture-independent approaches to more comprehensively exploit the genetic richness of antimicrobial compound-producing pathways from sponge-associated bacteria are addressed.

22518868	20120421	Evaluation of macrolide resistance and enhanced molecular typing of Treponema pallidum in patients with syphilis in Taiwan: a prospective multicenter study.	Studies of macrolide resistance mutations and molecular typing using the newly proposed enhanced typing system for Treponema pallidum isolates obtained from HIV-infected patients in the Asia-Pacific region are scarce. Between September 2009 and December 2011, we conducted a survey to detect T. pallidum using a PCR assay using clinical specimens from patients with syphilis at six major designated hospitals for HIV care in Taiwan. The T. pallidum strains were genotyped by following the enhanced molecular typing methodology, which analyzed the number of 60-bp repeats in the acidic repeat protein (arp) gene, T. pallidum repeat (tpr) polymorphism, and the sequence of base pairs 131 to 215 in the tp0548 open reading frame of T. pallidum. Detection of A2058G and A2059G point mutations in the T. pallidum 23S rRNA was performed with the use of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). During the 2-year study period, 211 clinical specimens were obtained from 136 patients with syphilis. T. pallidum DNA was isolated from 105 (49.8%) of the specimens, with swab specimens obtained from chancres having the highest yield rate (63.2%), followed by plasma (49.4%), serum (35.7%), and cerebrospinal fluid or vitreous fluid (18.2%) specimens. Among the 40 fully typed specimens, 11 subtypes of T. pallidum were identified. Subtype 14f/f (18 isolates) was the most common isolates, followed by 14f/c (3), 14b/c (3), and 14k/f (3). Among the isolates examined for macrolide resistance, none had the A2058G or A2059G mutation. In conclusion, we found that type 14 f/f was the most common T. pallidum strain in this multicenter study on syphilis in Taiwan and that none of the isolates exhibited 23S rRNA mutations causing resistance to macrolides.

26332126	20150903	Biogeography of Parasitic Nematode Communities in the Gal?pagos Giant Tortoise: Implications for Conservation Management.	The Gal?pagos giant tortoise is an icon of the unique, endemic biodiversity of Gal?pagos, but little is known of its parasitic fauna. We assessed the diversity of parasitic nematode communities and their spatial distributions within four wild tortoise populations comprising three species across three Gal?pagos islands, and consider their implication for Gal?pagos tortoise conservation programmes. Coprological examinations revealed nematode eggs to be common, with more than 80% of tortoises infected within each wild population. Faecal samples from tortoises within captive breeding centres on Santa Cruz, Isabela and San Cristobal islands also were examined. Five different nematode egg types were identified: oxyuroid, ascarid, trichurid and two types of strongyle. Sequencing of the 18S small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene from adult nematodes passed with faeces identified novel sequences indicative of rhabditid and ascaridid species. In the wild, the composition of nematode communities varied according to tortoise species, which co-varied with island, but nematode diversity and abundance were reduced or altered in captive-reared animals. Evolutionary and ecological factors are likely responsible for the variation in nematode distributions in the wild. This possible species/island-parasite co-evolution has not been considered previously for Gal?pagos tortoises. We recommend that conservation efforts, such as the current Gal?pagos tortoise captive breeding/rearing and release programme, be managed with respect to parasite biogeography and host-parasite co-evolutionary processes in addition to the biogeography of the host.

26529612	20151104	FireProt: Energy- and Evolution-Based Computational Design of Thermostable Multiple-Point Mutants.	There is great interest in increasing proteins' stability to enhance their utility as biocatalysts, therapeutics, diagnostics and nanomaterials. Directed evolution is a powerful, but experimentally strenuous approach. Computational methods offer attractive alternatives. However, due to the limited reliability of predictions and potentially antagonistic effects of substitutions, only single-point mutations are usually predicted in silico, experimentally verified and then recombined in multiple-point mutants. Thus, substantial screening is still required. Here we present FireProt, a robust computational strategy for predicting highly stable multiple-point mutants that combines energy- and evolution-based approaches with smart filtering to identify additive stabilizing mutations. FireProt's reliability and applicability was demonstrated by validating its predictions against 656 mutations from the ProTherm database. We demonstrate that thermostability of the model enzymes haloalkane dehalogenase DhaA and ?-hexachlorocyclohexane dehydrochlorinase LinA can be substantially increased (?Tm = 24?C and 21?C) by constructing and characterizing only a handful of multiple-point mutants. FireProt can be applied to any protein for which a tertiary structure and homologous sequences are available, and will facilitate the rapid development of robust proteins for biomedical and biotechnological applications.

25435894	20141202	Phytochemical Constituents and Toxicity of Duguetia furfuracea Hydroalcoholic Extract in Drosophila melanogaster.	Duguetia furfuracea is frequently used as a medicinal plant in Brazil. However, studies have evidenced its cytotoxic, bactericide, and antitumor activities. In the present study we aimed to evaluate the potential toxicity of hydroalcoholic leaves extracts of D. furfuracea (HEDF) in a Drosophila melanogaster model. Toxicity was assessed as changes in locomotor performance, mitochondrial activity, oxidative stress, MAPKs phosphorylation, and apoptosis induction after exposure to HEDF concentrations (1-50?mg/mL) for 7 days. The phytoconstituents of the plant were screened for the presence of alkaloids, tannins, xanthones, chalcones, flavonoids, aurones, and phenolic acids. Exposure of adult flies to HEDF caused mitochondrial dysfunction, overproduction of ROS, and alterations in the activity of detoxifying enzymes GST, SOD and CAT. Induction of ERK phosphorylation and PARP cleavage was also observed, indicating occurrence of HEDF-induced cell stress and apoptotic cell death. In parallel, alterations in cholinesterase activity and impairments in negative geotaxis behavior were observed. Our study draws attention to the indiscriminate use of this plant by population and suggests oxidative stress as a major mechanism underlying its toxicity.

26833046	20160203	BRCA1/BRCA2 founder mutations and cancer risks: impact in the western Danish population.	Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes significantly contribute to hereditary breast cancer and ovarian cancer, but the phenotypic effect from different mutations is insufficiently recognized. We used a western Danish clinic-based cohort of 299 BRCA families to study the female cancer risk in mutation carriers and their untested first-degree relatives. Founder mutations were characterized and the risk of cancer was assessed in relation to the specific mutations. In BRCA1, the cumulative cancer risk at age 70 was 35?% for breast cancer and 29?% for ovarian cancer. In BRCA2, the cumulative risk was 44?% for breast cancer and 15?% for ovarian cancer. We identified 47 distinct BRCA1 mutations and 48 distinct mutations in BRCA2. Among these, 8 founder mutations [BRCA1 c.81-?_4986+?del, c.3319G&gt;T (p.Glu1107*), c.3874delT and c.5213G&gt;A (p.Gly1738Glu) and BRCA2 c.6373delA, c.7008-1G&gt;A, c.7617+1G&gt;A and c.8474delC] were found to account for 23?% of the BRCA1 mutations and for 32?% of the BRCA2 mutations. The BRCA1 mutation c.3319G&gt;T was, compared to other BRCA1 mutations, associated with a higher risk for ovarian cancer. In conclusion, founder mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 contribute to up to one-third of the families in western Denmark and among these the BRCA1 c.3319G&gt;T mutation is potentially linked to an increased risk of ovarian cancer.

8648634	19960405	Kinetic and structural consequences of replacing the aspartate bridge by asparagine in the catalytic metal triad of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase.	In each subunit of the homodimeric enzyme Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, two of the three metal cofactors Zn2+ and Mg2+, are bound by an aspartate side-chain at position 51. Using site-specific mutagenesis, Asp51 was mutated both to alanine and to asparagine to produce the D51A and D51N enzymes, respectively. Over the range of pH values examined, the D51A enzyme did not catalyze phosphate ester hydrolysis above non-enzymic levels and was not activated by the addition of millimolar excess Zn2+ or Mg2+. Replacement of Asp51 by asparagine, however, resulted in a mutant enzyme with reduced activity and a higher pH optimum, compared with the wild-type enzyme. At pH 8.0 the D51N enzyme showed about 1% of the activity of the wild-type enzyme, and as the pH was raised to 9.2, the activity of the D51N enzyme increased to about 10% of the value for the wild-type enzyme. Upon the addition of excess Mg2+ at pH 9.2, the D51N enzyme was activated in a time-dependent fashion to nearly the same level as the wild-type enzyme. The affinity for phosphate of the D51N enzyme decreased tenfold as the concentration of Mg2+ increased. Under optimal conditions, the k(cat)/K(m) ratio for the D51N enzyme indicated that it was 87% as efficient as the wild-type enzyme. To investigate the molecular basis for the observed kinetic differences, X-ray data were collected for the D51N enzyme to 2.3 angstroms resolution at pH 7.5, and then to 2.1 angstroms resolution at pH 9.2 with 20 mM MgCl2. The two structures were then refined. The low magnesium, low pH D51N structure showed that the third metal site was unoccupied, apparently blocked by the amide group of Asn51. At this pH the phosphate anion was bound via one oxygen atom, between the zinc cations at the first and second metal sites, which strongly resembled the arrangement previously determined for the D153H enzyme at pH 7.5. In the high magnesium, high pH D51N structure, the third metal site was also vacant, but the phosphate anion bound closer to the surface of the enzyme, coordinated to the first metal site alone. Electron density difference maps provide evidence that magnesium activates the D51N enzyme by replacing zinc at the second metal site. 	J._Mol._Biol.	D016428 D013487
25190155	20140906	Dose- and time-dependent gene expression alterations in prostate and colon cancer cells after in vitro exposure to carbon ion and X-irradiation.	Hadrontherapy is an advanced form of radiotherapy that uses beams of charged particles (such as protons and carbon ions). Compared with conventional radiotherapy, the main advantages of carbon ion therapy are the precise absorbed dose localization, along with an increased relative biological effectiveness (RBE). This high ballistic accuracy of particle beams deposits the maximal dose to the tumor, while damage to the surrounding healthy tissue is limited. Currently, hadrontherapy is being used for the treatment of specific types of cancer. Previous in vitro studies have shown that, under certain circumstances, exposure to charged particles may inhibit cell motility and migration. In the present study, we investigated the expression of four motility-related genes in prostate (PC3) and colon (Caco-2) cancer cell lines after exposure to different radiation types. Cells were irradiated with various absorbed doses (0, 0.5 and 2 Gy) of accelerated (13)C-ions at the GANIL facility (Caen, France) or with X-rays. Clonogenic assays were performed to determine the RBE. RT-qPCR analysis showed dose- and time-dependent changes in the expression of CCDC88A, FN1, MYH9 and ROCK1 in both cell lines. However, whereas in PC3 cells the response to carbon ion irradiation was enhanced compared with X-irradiation, the effect was the opposite in Caco-2 cells, indicating cell-type-specific responses to the different radiation types.

22057716	20111108	Left ventricular remodeling in swine after myocardial infarction: a transcriptional genomics approach.	Despite the apparent appropriateness of left ventricular (LV) remodeling following myocardial infarction (MI), it poses an independent risk factor for development of heart failure. There is a paucity of studies into the molecular mechanisms of LV remodeling in large animal species. We took an unbiased molecular approach to identify candidate transcription factors (TFs) mediating the genetic reprogramming involved in post-MI LV remodeling in swine. Left ventricular tissue was collected from remote, non-infarcted myocardium, 3?weeks after MI-induction or sham-surgery. Microarray analysis identified 285 upregulated and 278 downregulated genes (FDR?&lt;?0.05). Of these differentially expressed genes, the promoter regions of the human homologs were searched for common TF binding sites (TFBS). Eighteen TFBS were overrepresented &gt;two-fold (p?&lt;?0.01) in upregulated and 13 in downregulated genes. Left ventricular nuclear protein extracts were assayed for DNA-binding activity by protein/DNA array. Out of 345 DNA probes, 30 showed signal intensity changes &gt;two-fold. Five TFs were identified in both TFBS and protein/DNA array analyses, which showed matching changes for COUP-TFII and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) only. Treatment of swine with the GR antagonist mifepristone after MI reduced the post-MI increase in LV mass, but LV dilation remained unaffected. Thus, using an unbiased approach to study post-MI LV remodeling in a physiologically relevant large animal model, we identified COUP-TFII and GR as potential key mediators of post-MI remodeling.

27472712	20160730	The BTNL2 G16071A gene polymorphism increases granulomatous disease susceptibility: A meta-analysis including FPRP test of 8710 participants.	The butyrophilin-like 2 (BTNL2) G16071A gene polymorphism has been implicated in the susceptibility to granulomatous diseases, but the results were inconclusive. The objective of the current study was to precisely explore the relationship between BTNL2 G16071A gene polymorphism and granulomatous disease susceptibility by the meta-analysis including false-positive report probability (FPRP) test. A systematic literature search in the PubMed, Embase, and Wanfang databases, China National Knowledge Internet, and commercial Internet search engines was conducted to identify studies published up to April 1, 2016. The odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the effect size. Statistical analysis was conducted using the STATA 12.0 software and FPRP test sheet. In total, all 4324 cases and 4386 controls from 14 eligible studies were included in the current meta-analysis. By the overall meta-analysis, we found a significant association between BTNL2 G16071A gene polymorphism and granulomatous disease susceptibility (A vs G: OR?=?1.25, 95% CI?=?1.07-1.45, P?=?0.005). The meta-regression analyses showed that a large proportion of the between-study heterogeneity was significantly attributed to the ethnicity (A vs G, P?=?0.013) and the types of granulomatous diseases (A vs G, P?=?0.002). By the subgroup meta-analysis, the BTNL2 G16071A gene polymorphism was associated with granulomatous disease susceptibility in Caucasians (A vs G: OR?=?1.37, 95% CI?=?1.18-1.58, P?&lt;?0.001). Moreover, a significant relationship between the BTNL2 G16071A gene polymorphism and sarcoidosis susceptibility (A vs G: OR?=?1.52, 95% CI?=?1.39-1.66, P?&lt;?0.001) was found. However, to avoid the &quot;false-positive report,&quot; we further investigated the significant associations observed in the present meta-analysis by the FPRP test. Interestingly, the results of FPRP test indicated that the BTNL2 G16071A gene polymorphism was truly associated with sarcoidosis susceptibility (A vs G, FPRP?&lt;?0.001). Additionally, the FPRP test confirmed that the BTNL2 G16071A gene polymorphism was associated only with granulomatous disease susceptibility among Caucasians (A vs G, FPRP?&lt;?0.001) at the level of a prior probability, which was 0.001. The meta-analysis indicated that BTNL2 G16071A gene polymorphism may as a likelihood factor contributed to granulomatous disease susceptibility, especially increasing the sarcoidosis susceptibility. In addition, the polymorphism may be greatly associated with likelihood of granulomatous diseases among Caucasians. 	Medicine_(Baltimore)	D016428 D017418
25970090	20150514	Change in the Prevalence of HIV-1 and the Rate of Transmitted Drug-Resistant HIV-1 in Haiphong, Northern Vietnam.	We previously reported a significant decrease in HIV-1 prevalence, with no increase in drug-resistant HIV-1 among injecting drug users (IDU), female sex workers (FSW), and blood donors (BD), in Haiphong, Vietnam, from 2007 to 2009. In 2012, 388 IDU, 51 FSW, and 200 BD were recruited for further analysis. None had a history of antiretroviral treatment. From 2007 to 2012, HIV-1 prevalence was reduced from 35.9% to 18.6% (p&lt;0.001), 23.1% to 9.8% (p&lt;0.05), and 2.9% to 1% (p=0.29) in IDU, FSW, and BD, respectively. Of 79 anti-HIV-1 antibody-positive samples, 61 were successfully analyzed for the pol-reverse transcriptase (RT) region. All HIV-1 strains were CRF01_AE. Nonnucleoside RT inhibitor-resistant mutations, Y181C/I, were detected in three subjects; one had the nucleoside RT inhibitor-resistant mutations L74V and M184V and one had E138K. The prevalence of transmitted drug-resistant HIV-1 in Haiphong increased slightly from 1.8% in 2007 to 6.6% in 2012 (p=0.06). 	AIDS_Res._Hum._Retroviruses	D016428
25368629	20141105	A 2-step strategy for detecting pleiotropic effects on multiple longitudinal traits.	Genetic pleiotropy refers to the situation in which a single gene influences multiple traits and so it is considered as a major factor that underlies genetic correlation among traits. To identify pleiotropy, an important focus in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is on finding genetic variants that are simultaneously associated with multiple traits. On the other hand, longitudinal designs are often employed in many complex disease studies, such that, traits are measured repeatedly over time within the same subject. Performing genetic association analysis simultaneously on multiple longitudinal traits for detecting pleiotropic effects is interesting but challenging. In this paper, we propose a 2-step method for simultaneously testing the genetic association with multiple longitudinal traits. In the first step, a mixed effects model is used to analyze each longitudinal trait. We focus on estimation of the random effect that accounts for the subject-specific genetic contribution to the trait; fixed effects of other confounding covariates are also estimated. This first step enables separation of the genetic effect from other confounding effects for each subject and for each longitudinal trait. Then in the second step, we perform a simultaneous association test on multiple estimated random effects arising from multiple longitudinal traits. The proposed method can efficiently detect pleiotropic effects on multiple longitudinal traits and can flexibly handle traits of different data types such as quantitative, binary, or count data. We apply this method to analyze the 16th Genetic Analysis Workshop (GAW16) Framingham Heart Study (FHS) data. A simulation study is also conducted to validate this 2-step method and evaluate its performance. 	Front_Genet	D016428
10404974	19990715	Visualising individual green fluorescent proteins with a near field optical microscope.	The use of the green fluorescence protein (GFP) as an individual marker for applications in molecular biology requires detailed understanding of its photophysical and photodynamical properties. We investigated individual S65T mutants of GFP both on a glass surface and embedded in a water-pore gel. An aperture-type near field scanning optical microscope (NSOM) with two polarisation detection channels was applied to afford high spatial (approximately 70 nm) and temporal (0.5 ms) resolution. Shear-force and near field fluorescence imaging were performed simultaneously, allowing direct correlation between topographic and optical features. Polarisation data showed that the emission dipole moment of the proteins is fixed in space within both the barrel structure of the protein and the gel matrix used for spatial confinement of the proteins. The photophysical behaviour of the S65T-GFP mutants was monitored in time, with 500-micros real-time resolution and continuous imaging for periods of more than 2 h. Our results show the reversible on-off behaviour on a time scale that spans from 10(-4) to 10(3) s. Even a process generally identified as &quot;bleaching&quot; turns out to be reversible if a sufficient long observation time is allowed. As such, the photodynamics of individual GFPs appear to be much more complex than the properties deduced from ensemble-averaged measurements. 	Cytometry	D016428 D013485
9754558	19981001	Importance of a conserved TCR J alpha-encoded tyrosine for T cell recognition of an HLA B27/peptide complex.	Human HLA B27-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for the influenza A epitope NP383-391 use similar TCR alpha and beta chains, with two closely related J alpha segments used by six of nine CTL clones from three unrelated donors (Bowness et al., Eur J. Immunol. 1993. 23: 1417-1421). The role of TCR complementarity-determining region (CDR)3alpha residues 93 and 100-102 was examined by site-directed mutagenesis, following expression of the TCR alpha and beta extracellular domains from one clone as a TCR zeta fusion heterodimer in rat basophil leukemia (RBL) cells. For the first time we have measured direct binding of tetrameric HLA B*2705/NP383-391 complexes to transfected TCR. Independently peptide-pulsed antigen-presenting cells (APC) were used to induce TCR-mediated degranulation of RBL transfectants. Our results show a key role for the conserved TCRalpha CDR3 J alpha-encoded residue Y102 in recognition of HLA B27/NP383-391. Thus the Y102D mutation abolished both tetramer binding and degranulation in the presence of peptide-pulsed APC. Even the Y102F mutation, differing only by a single hydroxyl group from the native TCR, abolished detectable degranulation. Further mutations F93A and S100R also abolished recognition. Interestingly, the N101A mutation recognized HLA B27/NP in functional assays despite having significantly reduced tetramer binding, a finding consistent with &quot;kinetic editing&quot; models of T cell activation. Modeling of the GRb TCR CDR3alpha loop suggests that residue Y102 contacts the HLA B*2705 alpha1 helix. It is thus possible that selection of germ-line TCRAJ-encoded residues at position 102 may be MHC driven. 	Eur._J._Immunol.	D016428 D013485
24509724	20140211	Generation and characterization of humanized mice carrying COMT158 Met/Val alleles.	The Val158Met polymorphism of human catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) is one of the most well-studied single-nucleotide polymorphisms in neuropsychiatry; however, findings are inconsistent due to human genetic heterogeneity. We created the first 'humanized' COMTVal158Met mouse lines, which carry either human COMT Val or Met alleles via gene targeting. The 'humanized' mouse model enables strict comparison of the physiological functions of the two alleles. Consistent with human observation, Met/Met mice exhibited a 30% reduction in enzymatic activity compared with Val/Val mice. On the basis of the reported differences in human Met and Val carriers across working memory, fear processes and sensorimotor gating, we examined these functions between sibling Met/Met and Val/Val mice. Val/Val mice exhibited robust reductions in spatial working memory compared with Met/Met mice in both sexes, with tolcapone treatment significantly reversing the Val/Val alternation deficits. Sex effects were observed in other behaviors, with male Val/Val mice exhibited lower prepulse inhibition compared with Met/Met mice, whereas female mice exhibited the opposite phenotype. Female but not male Met/Met mice exhibited reduced contextual fear, increased cued fear, and reduced extinction recall. Thus, these mice (1) support the argument that human COMT Val158Met polymorphism modulates behavioral functions and most importantly (2) exhibit the expected treatment effects supporting the 'inverted U shaped' dose response of catecholamine signaling on cognitive function. This model will be invaluable for understanding the effects of human COMT Val158Met polymorphism on cortical development and behavioral functions, and how this polymorphism modulates treatment response.

16405540	20060113	Increased expression of the chemokine fractalkine in Crohn's disease and association of the fractalkine receptor T280M polymorphism with a fibrostenosing disease Phenotype.	The fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 has been shown to be involved in inflammation and immune response. Recently, two polymorphisms of CX3CR1 (V249I and T280M) were reported. Our aim was to analyze fractalkine expression and the role of CX3CR1 polymorphisms in Crohn's disease (CD). We determined fractalkine mRNA expression in the intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) line SW480 after stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines as well as in inflamed (n = 14) and noninflamed (n = 14) CD lesions by quantitative PCR. By restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, genomic DNA from 206 patients with CD and 211 unrelated controls was analyzed for the two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CX3CR1 gene, which result in the V249I and T280M substitutions. All proinflammatory stimuli (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, LPS) significantly increased fractalkine mRNA expression in IEC. There was also a significant increase in fractalkine mRNA expression in inflamed lesions of CD patients when compared to noninflamed colonic mucosa (p = 0.02). Intestinal fractalkine mRNA levels correlated highly with IL-8 mRNA expression levels (r = 0.931). However, there was no difference in the V249I and T280M genotype frequencies between CD patients and the control group. In the CD group, 33.0% were heterozygous and 8.3% homozygous for the V249I polymorphism, while 23.3% were heterozygous and 4.4% homozygous for the T280M polymorphism. All T280M homozygotes were diagnosed of intestinal stenosis (p = 0.03 vs wildtype and heterozygous carriers) and had significantly more often ileocolonic involvement more often than patients with wildtype and heterozygous genotypes (p = 0.01). These associations were independent of the CARD15 genotype status. The expression of the chemokine fractalkine is upregulated by proinflammatory cytokines and enhanced in inflamed CD lesions. The CX3CR1 T280M polymorphism appears to influence CD phenotype and localization. 	Am._J._Gastroenterol.	D003160 D016428 D013485
25288022	20141008	A nonfusogenic antigen mimic of influenza hemagglutinin glycoproteins constituted with soluble full-length HA1 and truncated HA2 proteins expressed in E. coli.	A novel method is proposed to produce a soluble recombinant antigen mimic, constituted with full-length HA1 and truncated HA2 individually expressed in E. coli, instead of a precursor form of hemagglutinin protein, that is similar to the naturally processed and disulfide-linked HA1/HA2 on the envelope of the influenza A virus strain X-31 (H3N2). A truncated ectodomain of HA2 subunit, HA2(23-185)/C137S, lacked two membrane-interacting sequences, i.e., the N-terminal fusion peptide as well as the transmembrane domain and short cytoplasmic segment at the C terminus. A recombinant HA1 (rHA1) subunit protein, HA1(1-328)/C14S/L157S, lacked the signal peptide. Mutations C137S and C14S in the HA2 and HA1 subunits, respectively, were introduced to prevent any possible disulfide linkage between the two subunit proteins. The rHA antigen mimic would be nonfusogenic mainly due to the absence of the N-terminal fusion peptide as well as the C-terminal transmembrane domain in the truncated HA2, and eventually less cytotoxic as well. Antibody responses induced by two soluble rHA antigens were evaluated by ELISA assays to detect rHA antigens injected and to validate both anti-HA1 and anti-HA2 antibodies produced in the mice sera. Antigenic rHA proteins also elicited neutralizing antibodies against homologous H3N2 influenza virus in the immunized mice, without severe body weight loss or any other adverse symptoms.

19741438	20090911	Disappearance of episodic weakness during pregnancy in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis from the SCNA4 mutation T704M.	Disappearance of episodic weakness during pregnancy and an increase in myotonia after delivery have not been reported in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (hyperPP). In a 36-year-old white woman, with typical manifestations of episodic weakness of the limb muscles since age 3 years, hyperPP was diagnosed by demonstration of the T407M SCNA4 gene point mutation. At age 34 years, the index patient became pregnant for the first time. During the first trimester of her pregnancy, she noted a marked decrease in the frequency of the hyperPP attacks. During the second and third trimesters, the attacks of weakness completely disappeared and after delivery the attacks restarted with the same intensity and frequency as before pregnancy, but myotonia persisted between the attacks. Disappearance of the attacks during pregnancy was attributed to the hormonal changes. Episodic attacks of weakness in hyperPP may disappear during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and myotonia between the attacks may persist after delivery. 	Neurologist	D002363 D016428
11737860	20011212	Fusion of the NUP98 gene with the LEDGF/p52 gene defines a recurrent acute myeloid leukemia translocation.	The NUP98 gene is involved in multiple rearrangements in haematological malignancy. The leukemic cells in an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient with a t(9;11)(p22;p15) were recently shown to have a fusion between the NUP98 gene and the LEDGF gene but it was not demonstrated that this fusion was recurrent in other leukaemia patients with the same translocation. We used RT-PCR to analyse the leukemic cells from an AML patient who presented with a cytogenetically identical translocation as the sole chromosomal abnormality. A NUP98-LEDGF fusion transcript was observed and confirmed by sequencing. The reciprocal transcript was also observed. The fusion transcript was not detectable during remission and recurred at relapse. The breakpoints in the NUP98 and LEDGF genes were different to those previously reported. The NUP98 breakpoint occurs in the intron between exons 8 and 9. It is the most 5' breakpoint reported in a translocation involving the NUP98 gene. All of the LEDGF gene is included in the fusion except for exon 1 which codes for the first 24 amino terminal amino acids. Our results show that fusion of the NUP98 and LEDGF genes is a new recurrent translocation in AML. 	BMC_Genet.	D016428 D013485
12492590	20021221	Phenotypic and genetic analysis of a compound heterozygote for dys- and hypoprothrombinaemia.	We studied a 2-year-old boy with a phenotype of combined hypo- and dysprothrombinaemia. Sequencing of polymerase-chain-reaction-amplified genomic DNA revealed three different mutations in heterozygosity, a G to A transition at position 7312, resulting in the replacement of arginine 271 by histidine, an A to G transition at position 20058, resulting in the replacement of histidine 562 by arginine, and a 2-bp deletion at 20062-20063, causing a frameshift and a premature stop codon in exon 14. The first two mutations are compatible with the dysprothrombinaemia phenotype, whereas the small deletion is thought to be the cause of hypoprothrombinaemia. 	Br._J._Haematol.

20661822	20100728	Evaluation of MTHFR677C&gt;T polymorphism in prediction and prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a case-control study in a northern Indian population.	Early diagnosis and better prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is still a challenge. Besides environmental risk factors, nutritional deficiencies have an established role in pathogenesis of ESCC. Folate deficiency and functional polymorphisms in folate metabolizing genes such as methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C&gt;T may have oncogenic role through disruption of normal DNA methylation pattern, synthesis, and impaired DNA repair. MTHFR677C&gt;T or A222V (rs1801133) polymorphism has conflicting role in susceptibility to ESCC among different populations. Thus, we aimed to study the role of MTHFR677C&gt;T polymorphism in susceptibility, survival, and interaction with environmental risk factors in ESCC patients from a northern Indian population. A case control study was performed in 208 ESCC incident cases (including 114 follow-up cases) and 223 healthy controls, and genotyping was done by PCR-RFLP. Our results show no significant association of MTHFR677C&gt;T polymorphism with ESCC, tumor locations, or gender of subjects. However, we found a trend of decreased risk of ESCC due to interaction of MTHFR677CT genotype with smoking and alcohol intake. Kaplan Meier, and Cox regression survival analysis showed no prognostic impact of MTHFR677C&gt;T polymorphism in ESCC patients. In conclusion, MTHFR677C&gt;T polymorphism does not seem to have significant role either in susceptibility or survival of ESCC in a northern Indian population. 	Nutr_Cancer	D016428 D013485
25735316	20150305	Integrative molecular profiling of routine clinical prostate cancer specimens.	Comprehensive molecular profiling led to the recognition of multiple prostate cancer (PCa) molecular subtypes and driving alterations, but translating these findings to clinical practice is challenging. We developed a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue compatible integrative assay for PCa molecular subtyping and interrogation of relevant genetic/transcriptomic alterations (MiPC). We applied MiPC, which combines capture-based next generation sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), to 53 FFPE PCa specimens representing cases not well represented in frozen tissue cohorts, including 8 paired primary tumor and lymph node metastases. Results were validated using multiplexed PCR based NGS and Sanger sequencing. We identified known and novel potential driving, somatic mutations and copy number alterations, including a novel BRAF T599_V600insHT mutation and CYP11B2 amplification in a patient treated with ketoconazole (a potent CYP11B2 inhibitor). qRT-PCR integration enabled comprehensive molecular subtyping and provided complementary information, such as androgen receptor (AR) target gene module assessment in advanced cases and SPINK1 over-expression. MiPC identified highly concordant profiles for all 8 tumor/lymph node metastasis pairs, consistent with limited heterogeneity amongst driving events. MiPC and exome sequencing were performed on separately isolated conventional acinar PCa and prostatic small cell carcinoma (SCC) components from the same FFPE resection specimen to enable direct comparison of histologically distinct components. While both components showed TMPRSS2:ERG fusions, the SCC component exclusively harbored complete TP53 inactivation (frameshift variant and copy loss) and two CREBBP mutations. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of integrative profiling of routine PCa specimens, which may have utility for understanding disease biology and enabling personalized medicine applications.

25275596	20141003	Histone deacetylase inhibitors promote glioma cell death by G2 checkpoint abrogation leading to mitotic catastrophe.	Glioblastoma multiforme is resistant to conventional anti-tumoral treatments due to its infiltrative nature and capability of relapse; therefore, research efforts focus on characterizing gliomagenesis and identifying molecular targets useful on therapy. New therapeutic strategies are being tested in patients, such as Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) either alone or in combination with other therapies. Here two HDACi included in clinical trials have been tested, suberanilohydroxamic acid (SAHA) and valproic acid (VPA), to characterize their effects on glioma cell growth in vitro and to determine the molecular changes that promote cancer cell death. We found that both HDACi reduce glioma cell viability, proliferation and clonogenicity. They have multiple effects, such as inducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, nevertheless cell death is not prevented by the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh. Importantly, we found that HDACi alter cell cycle progression by decreasing the expression of G2 checkpoint kinases Wee1 and checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1). In addition, HDACi reduce the expression of proteins involved in DNA repair (Rad51), mitotic spindle formation (TPX2) and chromosome segregation (Survivin) in glioma cells and in human glioblastoma multiforme primary cultures. Therefore, HDACi treatment causes glioma cell entry into mitosis before DNA damage could be repaired and to the formation of an aberrant mitotic spindle that results in glioma cell death through mitotic catastrophe-induced apoptosis.

26544037	20151107	A Tandem Oligonucleotide Approach for SNP-Selective RNA Degradation Using Modified Antisense Oligonucleotides.	Antisense oligonucleotides have been studied for many years as a tool for gene silencing. One of the most difficult cases of selective RNA silencing involves the alleles of single nucleotide polymorphisms, in which the allele sequence is differentiated by a single nucleotide. A new approach to improve the performance of allele selectivity for antisense oligonucleotides is proposed. It is based on the simultaneous application of two oligonucleotides. One is complementary to the mutated form of the targeted RNA and is able to activate RNase H to cleave the RNA. The other oligonucleotide, which is complementary to the wild type allele of the targeted RNA, is able to inhibit RNase H cleavage. Five types of SNPs, C/G, G/C, G/A, A/G, and C/U, were analyzed within the sequence context of genes associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), and Machado-Joseph disease. For most analyzed cases, the application of the tandem approach increased allele-selective RNA degradation 1.5-15 fold relative to the use of a single antisense oligonucleotide. The presented study proves that differentiation between single substitution is highly dependent on the nature of the SNP and surrounding nucleotides. These variables are crucial for determining the proper length of the inhibitor antisense oligonucleotide. In the tandem approach, the comparison of thermodynamic stability of the favorable duplexes WT RNA-inhibitor and Mut RNA-gapmer with the other possible duplexes allows for the evaluation of chances for the allele-selective degradation of RNA. A larger difference in thermodynamic stability between favorable duplexes and those that could possibly form, usually results in the better allele selectivity of RNA degradation.

25542735	20141228	TNF? G308A polymorphism is associated with resilience to sleep deprivation-induced psychomotor vigilance performance impairment in healthy young adults.	Cytokines such as TNF? play an integral role in sleep/wake regulation and have recently been hypothesized to be involved in cognitive impairment due to sleep deprivation. We examined the effect of a guanine to adenine substitution at position 308 in the TNF? gene (TNF? G308A) on psychomotor vigilance performance impairment during total sleep deprivation. A total of 88 healthy women and men (ages 22-40) participated in one of five laboratory total sleep deprivation experiments. Performance on a psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) was measured every 2-3h. The TNF? 308A allele, which is less common than the 308G allele, was associated with greater resilience to psychomotor vigilance performance impairment during total sleep deprivation (regardless of time of day), and also provided a small performance benefit at baseline. The effect of genotype on resilience persisted when controlling for between-subjects differences in age, gender, race/ethnicity, and baseline sleep duration. The TNF? G308A polymorphism predicted less than 10% of the overall between-subjects variance in performance impairment during sleep deprivation. Nonetheless, the differential effect of the polymorphism at the peak of performance impairment was more than 50% of median performance impairment at that time, which is sizeable compared to the effects of other genotypes reported in the literature. Our findings provided evidence for a role of TNF? in the effects of sleep deprivation on psychomotor vigilance performance. Furthermore, the TNF? G308A polymorphism may have predictive potential in a biomarker panel for the assessment of resilience to psychomotor vigilance performance impairment due to sleep deprivation. 	Brain_Behav._Immun.

26722563	20160102	Genetic association of cyclooxygenase-2 gene polymorphisms with Parkinson's disease susceptibility in Chinese Han population.	The aim of this study was to explore the genetic association of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) gene promoter region polymorphisms with Parkinson's disease (PD) susceptibility in Chinese Han population. The genotyping of COX2 gene polymorphisms was conducted by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in 122 patients with PD and 120 healthy persons. The association strength of gene polymorphism with disease was measured by odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) calculated using ?(2) test which also evaluated the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) of gene polymorphism in controls. The linkage disequilibrium and haplotype were also analyzed as evidence in the analysis of association. On condition that the genotypes distributions of COX2 -1290A&gt;G, -1195G&gt;A, -765G&gt;C in the control group all conformed to HWE, however, only the homozygous genotype AA of -1195G&gt;A polymorphism showed an association with PD (OR=0.432, 95% CI=0.196-0.950). In addition, in haplotype analysis, G-A-C haplotype frequency in cases was significantly lower than the controls, compared with the common haplotype A-G-G (P=0.031, OR=0.375, 95% CI=0.149-0.940). COX2 -1195G&gt;A polymorphism might play a protective role in the onset of PD and G-A-C haplotype in this three promoter region polymorphisms also showed a negative association.

26335208	20150904	T-REx: Transcriptome analysis webserver for RNA-seq Expression data.	Transcriptomics analyses of bacteria (and other organisms) provide global as well as detailed information on gene expression levels and, consequently, on other processes in the cell. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has over the past few years become the most accurate method for global transcriptome measurements and for the identification of novel RNAs. This development has been accompanied by advances in the bioinformatics methods, tools and software packages that deal with the analysis of the large data sets resulting from RNA-seq efforts. Based on years of experience in analyzing transcriptome data, we developed a user-friendly webserver that performs the statistical analysis on the gene expression values generated by RNA-seq. It also provides the user with a whole range of data plots. We benchmarked our RNA-seq pipeline, T-REx, using a case study of CodY mutants of Bacillus subtilis and show that it could easily and automatically reproduce the statistical analysis of the cognate publication. Furthermore, by mining the correlation matrices, k-means clusters and heatmaps generated by T-REx we observed interesting gene-behavior and identified sub-groups in the CodY regulon. T-REx is a parameter-free statistical analysis pipeline for RNA-seq gene expression data that is dedicated for use by biologists and bioinformaticians alike. The tables and figures produced by T-REx are in most cases sufficient to accurately mine the statistical results. In addition to the stand-alone version, we offer a user-friendly webserver that only needs basic input ( http://genome2d.molgenrug.nl ). 	BMC_Genomics	D016428
21846464	20110818	Two novel rare variants of APOA5 gene found in subjects with severe hypertriglyceridemia.	Common variants of APOA5 gene affect plasma triglyceride (TG) in the population and a number of rare variants APOA5 have been reported in individuals with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG). APOA5 was analysed in 98 HTG individuals (plasma TG &gt;9 mmol/L) in whom no mutations in LPL and APOC2 had been found. Two patients were found to be heterozygous for two novel APOA5 variants. The first variant (p.L253P) was identified in an obese male who consumed a diet rich in fat and simple sugars. He was also a carrier in trans of the common TG-raising p.S19W SNP (5*3 haplotype). The second variant (c.295-297 del GAG, p.E99 del) was found in a lean male with no life style or metabolic factors known to affect plasma TG. He was a carrier in trans of the TG-raising 5*2 haplotype and was homozygous for the rare c.1337T allele of a SNP of GCKR gene. No mutations in other genes affecting plasma TG (LMF1 and GPIHBP1) were found in these patients. These APOA5 variants, resulted to be deleterious in silico, were not found in 350 control subjects. These novel APOA5 variants predispose to HTG in combination with other genetic or nutritional factors. 	Clin._Chim._Acta	D016428 D013485
25579139	20150113	Genetic &amp; epigenetic approach to human obesity.	Obesity is an important clinical and public health challenge, epitomized by excess adipose tissue accumulation resulting from an imbalance in energy intake and energy expenditure. It is a forerunner for a variety of other diseases such as type-2-diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular diseases, some types of cancer, stroke, hyperlipidaemia and can be fatal leading to premature death. Obesity is highly heritable and arises from the interplay of multiple genes and environmental factors. Recent advancements in Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shown important steps towards identifying genetic risks and identification of genetic markers for lifestyle diseases, especially for a metabolic disorder like obesity. According to the 12th Update of Human Obesity Gene Map there are 253 quantity trait loci (QTL) for obesity related phenotypes from 61 genome wide scan studies. Contribution of genetic propensity of individual ethnic and racial variations in obesity is an active area of research. Further, understanding its complexity as to how these variations could influence ones susceptibility to become or remain obese will lead us to a greater understanding of how obesity occurs and hopefully, how to prevent and treat this condition. In this review, various strategies adapted for such an analysis based on the recent advances in genome wide and functional variations in human obesity are discussed. 	Indian_J._Med._Res.

17130523	20061130	A dipeptidyl aminopeptidase-like protein remodels gating charge dynamics in Kv4.2 channels.	Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase-like proteins (DPLPs) interact with Kv4 channels and thereby induce a profound remodeling of activation and inactivation gating. DPLPs are constitutive components of the neuronal Kv4 channel complex, and recent observations have suggested the critical functional role of the single transmembrane segment of these proteins (Zagha, E., A. Ozaita, S.Y. Chang, M.S. Nadal, U. Lin, M.J. Saganich, T. McCormack, K.O. Akinsanya, S.Y. Qi, and B. Rudy. 2005. J. Biol. Chem. 280:18853-18861). However, the underlying mechanism of action is unknown. We hypothesized that a unique interaction between the Kv4.2 channel and a DPLP found in brain (DPPX-S) may remodel the channel's voltage-sensing domain. To test this hypothesis, we implemented a robust experimental system to measure Kv4.2 gating currents and study gating charge dynamics in the absence and presence of DPPX-S. The results demonstrated that coexpression of Kv4.2 and DPPX-S causes a -26 mV parallel shift in the gating charge-voltage (Q-V) relationship. This shift is associated with faster outward movements of the gating charge over a broad range of relevant membrane potentials and accelerated gating charge return upon repolarization. In sharp contrast, DPPX-S had no effect on gating charge movements of the Shaker B Kv channel. We propose that DPPX-S destabilizes resting and intermediate states in the voltage-dependent activation pathway, which promotes the outward gating charge movement. The remodeling of gating charge dynamics may involve specific protein-protein interactions of the DPPX-S's transmembrane segment with the voltage-sensing and pore domains of the Kv4.2 channel. This mechanism may determine the characteristic fast operation of neuronal Kv4 channels in the subthreshold range of membrane potentials. 	J._Gen._Physiol.	D016428 D052061
23939236	20130814	Variation in IFNL4 genotype and response to interferon-based therapy of hepatitis C in HIV-positive patients with acute and chronic hepatitis C.	The IFNL4 ss469415590 polymorphism has recently be shown to better predict treatment response in chronic hepatitis than the IL28B rs12979860 variant. However, no data exist in patients with HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. Analysing 206 HCV(+)/HIV(+) and 162 HCV(+)/HIV(-) patients, we found that compared with IL28B rs12979860, IFNL4 ss469415590 was strongly associated with response to interferon/ribavirin therapy in HCV(+)/HIV(-) individuals but not in HIV(+)/HCV(+) patients. Thus, effects of the IFNL4 variant may differ in HIV(+) and HIV(-) patients. 	AIDS	D016428 D013485
15200451	20040618	Transforming growth factor-beta 1 gene polymorphisms and cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis patients.	Atherosclerotic vascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a multifunctional cytokine that inhibits the atheromatous process. We studied coding region polymorphisms of the TGF-beta1 gene (+869 T --&gt; C at codon 10 and +915 G --&gt; C at codon 25) as genetic susceptibility factors for prevalent vascular disease and cardiac outcomes in a cohort of HD patients enrolled in the HEMO Study. Genotyping was carried out using polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primer (PCR-SSP) methods with a cytokine genotyping tray. Prevalent vascular disease was coded from the Index of Disease Severity (IDS) scores for ischemic heart disease (IHD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and congestive heart failure (CHF), 0 indicating absence, and 1 to 3 increasing grades of severity. The presence of any vascular disease (VD) (i.e., any degree of IHD/PVD/CVD), and the number of coexistent vascular system diseases per patient were derived. Cardiac outcomes, one of the secondary outcomes of the HEMO Study, were expressed as a composite of the first hospitalization for, or death from, cardiac causes. The cohort consisted of 183 patients at enrollment, 56% male, 44% African American (AA), and 40% diabetic. The mean age was 62.4 +/- 12.2 years, and median dialysis vintage 2.02 years. The most frequent genotype at codon 10 was T/C (67%), and at codon 25 was G/G (72%). IHD was present in 52% of patients; 65% had at least one vascular system involvement, and 31% had 2 or more. On both univariate and multivariate analysis, the G/C genotype at codon 25 was significantly associated with the presence and extent of vascular disease at enrollment. The median time to cardiac outcome, defined as a composite of the first hospitalization for, or death from, cardiac causes, was 411 days in patients with the G/C genotype compared with 851 days in those with the G/G genotype (P= 0.03). Patients with the G/C genotype had a 1.6-fold increased hazard for cardiac outcomes after adjustment for baseline covariates (P= 0.04). The G/C substitution at codon 25 was associated with an increased risk for prevalent vascular disease, new onset cardiac morbidity, and cardiac mortality in HD patients, and may be a genetic susceptibility factor for the development of atherosclerosis. Further studies are required to evaluate the role of TGF-beta1 as a candidate gene. 	Kidney_Int.	D016428 D013485 D013487
2393391	19900831	Intracellular processing of complement pro-C3 and proalbumin is inhibited by rat alpha 1-protease inhibitor variant (Met352----Arg) in transfected cells.	Complement C3, when its cDNA was transfected into COS-1 cells, was synthesized as a precursor, pro-C3, which was intracellularly processed into the alpha and beta subunits, although not completely. A cDNA for rat alpha 1-protease inhibitor (alpha 1-PI) was mutated in vitro to encode its variant with the modified active site (Met352----Arg). In cells co-transfected with the mutant alpha 1-PI cDNA and the C3 cDNA, pro-C3 expressed was secreted without being processed into the subunits. Co-transfection of the mutant alpha 1-PI cDNA and the albumin cDNA also resulted in the inhibition of intracellular conversion of proalbumin into serum-type albumin. No inhibition of the processing of each preform was observed in cells co-transfected with the normal alpha 1-PI cDNA. Taken together, the results indicate that the alpha 1-PI variant (Met352----Arg) expressed inhibits specifically an intracellular enzyme which is involved in the proteolytic processing of both pro-C3 and proalbumin.

20379057	20100410	A SNP of NPC1L1 affects cholesterol absorption in Japanese.	Ezetimibe is known to target Niemann-Pick Type C1 Like1 (NPC1L1), a key protein in intestinal cholesterol absorption, and thus to decrease serum LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. The response of serum LDL-C levels to ezetimibe was reported to differe among NPC1L1 haplotypes.We analyzed NPC1L1 genotypes in Japanese and investigated differences in markers of cholesterol synthesis/absorption among the genotypes. Blood samples were collected from 42 adult volunteers to measure markers of cholesterol synthesis (lathosterol) and absorption (sitosterol and campesterol) by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Based on a study by Hegele RA et al. in Canada, we selected three SNPs (1735 C&gt;G, 25342 A&gt;C and 27677 T&gt;C (numbers relative to the transcription start site)) and analyzed them using PCR-RFLP. The frequencies of genotypes were as follows: 1735 C/G (46%)&gt;C/C (35%)&gt;G/G (19%), 25342 A/A (97%)&gt;A/C (3%)&gt;C/C (0%) and 27677 T/T (97%)&gt;T/C (3%)&gt;C/C (0%). Serum campesterol levels were significantly higher in the 1735 G/G group than 1735 C/G+C/C group, but lathosterol levels showed no significant differences between the genotypes. Our results revealed differences in the frequency of the NPC1L1 polymorphism between Japanese and Canadians. In Japanese, the 1735 G/G group showed enhanced cholesterol absorption from the intestine, as compared to the 1735 C/G+C/C group. 	J._Atheroscler._Thromb.	D016428
25519419	20141219	Entropy-based method for assessing the influence of genetic markers and covariates on hypertension: application to Genetic Analysis Workshop 18 data.	Many complex diseases are related to genetics, and it is of great interest to evaluate the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and disease outcome. The association of genetics with outcome can be modified by covariates such as age, sex, smoking status, and membership to the same pedigree. In this paper, we propose a block entropy method to separate two classes of SNPs, for which the association with hypertension is either sensitive or insensitive to the covariates. We also propose a consistency entropy method to further reduce the number of SNPs that might be associated with the outcome. Based on the data provided by the organizers of Genetic Analysis Workshop 18, we calculated the block entropies for six different blocking strategies. Using block entropy and consistency entropy, we identified 230 SNPs on chromosome 9 that are most likely to be associated with the outcome and whose associations with hypertension are sensitive to the covariates.

25622261	20150127	The influence of AHI1 variants on the diagnosis and treatment outcome in schizophrenia.	The present study aimed to explore whether four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the AHI1 gene could be associated with schizophrenia (SCZ) and whether they could predict the clinical outcomes in SCZ patients treated with antipsychotics. Four hundred twenty-six (426) in-patients with SCZ and 345 controls were genotyped for four AHI1 SNPs (rs11154801, rs7750586, rs9647635 and rs9321501). Baseline and clinical measures for SCZ patients were assessed through the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Allelic and genotypic frequencies in SCZ subjects were compared with those of controls using the ?2 statistics. The repeated-measure ANOVA was used for the assessment of treatment outcomes measured by PANSS changes. The case-control analysis did not show any difference in the genotypic distribution of the SNPs, while in the allelic analysis, a weak association was found between the rs9647635 A allele and SCZ. Furthermore, in the haplotype analysis, three haplotypes resulted in being associated with SCZ. On the other hand, two SNPs (rs7750586 and rs9647635) were associated with clinical improvement of negative symptoms in the allelic analysis, although in the genotypic analysis, only trends of association were found for the same SNPs. Our findings suggest a possible influence of AHI1 variants on SCZ susceptibility and antipsychotic response, particularly concerning negative symptomatology. Subsequent well-designed studies would be mandatory to confirm our results due to the methodological shortcomings of the present study. 	Int_J_Mol_Sci	D016428 D013485
9084681	19960101	Disrupted collagen architecture in the crystal structure of a triple-helical peptide with a Gly--&gt;Ala substitution.	The crystal structure of the collagen-based peptide (Pro-Hyp-Gly)4-Pro-Hyp-Ala-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)5 has provided for the first time a highly detailed picture of the architectural elements that come into play in the collagen triple helix. The center of the molecule, which harbors a Gly--&gt;Ala substitution, shows subtle conformational changes that result in a local untwisting of the triple helix. The characteristic hydrogen bonding pattern of collagen triple helices is replaced by interstitial water bridges. These effects may be relevant to the diseased states derived from Gly--&gt;X mutations in collagens. The possible implications of this disrupted architecture for collagen assemblies are discussed.

14529489	20031008	Mutation of the hydrophobic residue on helix alpha5 of the Bacillus thuringiensis Cry4B affects structural stability.	Cry4B toxin is a mosquito-larvicidal protein from the Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis. We have investigated the role of two conserved hydrophobic residues of Cry4B in structural stabilization. Substitutions of the leucine-175 and isoleucine-189 on helix alpha5 with valine and leucine did not affect the expression level, solubility and proteolytic processing. Steady state analysis of an unfolding experiment as monitored by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrated a typical two-state transition. The determined unfolding free energy for the L175V mutant revealed a structural destabilization of 10.49 kcal/mol relative to the wild type. However unfolding kinetic analysis gave identical activation energy for wild type and both mutants. Our findings suggested that a perturbation on the close packing of the hydrophobic side chains in protein interior could lead to a significant destabilization of the native conformation.

27266629	20160609	Diversity of group A rotavirus genes detected in the Tri?ngulo Mineiro region, Minas Gerais, Brazil.	Group A rotaviruses are the main causative agent of infantile gastroenteritis. The segmented nature of the viral genome allows reassortment of genome segments, which can generate genetic variants. In this study, we characterized the diversity of the VP7, VP4 (VP8*), VP6, NSP4, and NSP5 genes of the rotaviruses that circulated from 2005 to 2011 in the Tri?ngulo Mineiro (TM) region of Brazil. Samples with genotypes G2 (sublineages IVa-1 and IVa-3), G1 (sublineage I-A), G9 (lineage III), G12 (lineages II and III), G8 (lineage II), G3 (lineage III), P[4] (sublineages IVa and IVb), P[8] (sublineages P[8]-3.6, P[8]-3.3, and P[8]-3.1), I2 (lineage VII), E2 (lineages VI, XII, and X), and H2 (lineage III) were identified. The associations found in the samples were G1, G9, or G12 with P[8]-I1-E1-H1; G2 or G8 with P[4]-I2-E2-H2; G12 with I3-E3-H6; and G3 with P[4]-I2-E3-H3 (previously unreported combination). Reassortment events in G2P[4] strains and an apparent pattern of temporal segregation within the lineages were observed. Five TM samples contained genes that exhibited high nucleotide and amino acid identities with strains of animal origin. The present study includes a period of pre- and post-introduction of rotavirus vaccination in all Brazilian territories, thereby serving as a basis for monitoring changes in the genetic constitution of rotaviruses. The results also contribute to the understanding of the diversity and evolution of rotaviruses in a global context. 	Braz._J._Microbiol.	D016428
20055726	20100109	Interferon-gamma gene and interferon-gamma receptor-1 gene polymorphisms in children with tuberculosis from Turkey.	Macrophage activation by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is important in host resistance to tuberculosis (TB). In this study, the relationships of the +874 T/A polymorphism in the first intron of the IFN-gamma gene and intronic (CA)n polymorphic microsatellite marker of the interferon-gamma receptor 1 (IFN-gammaR1) gene to TB susceptibility were investigated in children. Forty children with TB and 67 age-matched controls were included. There were no significant differences between the allele frequencies and genotype frequencies of patient and control groups for the polymorphism +874 T/A in the IFN-gamma gene. Differences that were not statistically significant were found between the group of children with TB and the control group for the allelic markers (170 and 180) in the IFN-gammaR1 gene. The incidence of the allele 170 was higher in patients (30.9%) than in controls (17.4%), whereas the allele 180 was found to be more common in controls (9% vs 1.2%). In conclusion, no significant association was observed between the +874 T/A polymorphism found in the first exon of the IFN-gamma gene and TB susceptibility in Turkish children.

2117830	19900901	Aphidicolin-resistant DNA polymerase of bacteriophage phi 29 APHr71 mutant is hypersensitive to phosphonoacetic acid and butylphenyldeoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate.	Bacteriophage phi 29 DNA polymerase is sensitive to aphidicolin (APH). DNA polymerase of the APH-resistant mutant, APHr71, was more sensitive to phosphonoacetic acid and butylphenyldeoxyguanosine 5'triphosphate than the wild type. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a single transition of G at nucleotide 562 to A in the DNA polymerase gene of APHr71, indicating that APHr71 DNA polymerase (572 residues) had a single amino acid substitution from glycine at residue 188 to serine. The results suggest that the site and the neighboring conserved segment of phi 29 DNA polymerase constitute a structure interacting with deoxynucleotides, pyrophosphate, and APH.

22223122	20120107	Evidence of an association between the scavenger receptor class B member 2 gene and Parkinson's disease.	Lysosomal protein 2 (LIMP2), the product of the scavenger receptor class B member 2 (SCARB2) gene, is a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane protein that is the mannose-6-phosphate-independent receptor for glucocerebrosidase (?-GCase); a deficiency in this protein causes Gaucher disease. Several studies have shown a link between mutations in the ?-GCase gene and diseases characterized clinically by Parkinsonism and by the presence of Lewy body-related pathology. We hypothesized that genetic variants in the SCARB2 gene could be risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). A candidate-gene study of 347 Greek patients with sporadic PD and 329 healthy controls was conducted to investigate the association between 5 polymorphisms in the SCARB2 gene (rs6824953, rs6825004, rs4241591, rs9991821, and rs17234715) and the development of PD. The single-locus analysis for the 5 polymorphisms revealed an association only for the rs6825004 polymorphism: the generalized odds ratio (OR(G) ) was 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.90), and the OR for the allelic test was OR = 0.71 (95% CI, 0.56-0.90). Haplotype analysis showed an association for the GCGGT haplotype (P &lt; .01). Our study supports a genetic contribution of the SCARB2 locus to PD; future studies in larger cohorts are necessary to verify this finding. 	Mov._Disord.	D016428 D013485

In the title compound, [Zn(4)(C(11)H(9)N(2)O(2))(4)(C(7)H(5)O(2))(4)]?2(CH(3))(2)CO?CH(3)OH, the tetra-nuclear mol-ecule lies on a fourfold inversion axis. Zn(II) ions and ?(3)-O atoms in the cubane core occupy alternating vertices, forming two inter-penetrating tetra-hedra. Each Zn(II) ion is further coordinated by two N atoms from two different (py)(2)C(OH)O ligands (py is pyrid-yl) and one O atom from a monodentate benzoate ligand, forming a distorted octa-hedral environment. The (py)(2)C(OH)O ligand acts in an ?(1):?(3):?(1):?(3) manner, forming two five-membered ZnNCCO chelating rings with two different Zn(II) atoms sharing a common C-O bond, and an alkoxide-type bond to a third Zn(II) ion. There are four symmetry-related intra-molecular O-H?O hydrogen bonds between the two types of ligands. In the asymmetric unit, there is a half-occupancy acetone solvent mol-ecule and a half-occupancy methanol solvent molecule that lies on a twofold rotation axis.

24312208	20131207	Genome-wide and paternal diversity reveal a recent origin of human populations in North Africa.	The geostrategic location of North Africa as a crossroad between three continents and as a stepping-stone outside Africa has evoked anthropological and genetic interest in this region. Numerous studies have described the genetic landscape of the human population in North Africa employing paternal, maternal, and biparental molecular markers. However, information from these markers which have different inheritance patterns has been mostly assessed independently, resulting in an incomplete description of the region. In this study, we analyze uniparental and genome-wide markers examining similarities or contrasts in the results and consequently provide a comprehensive description of the evolutionary history of North Africa populations. Our results show that both males and females in North Africa underwent a similar admixture history with slight differences in the proportions of admixture components. Consequently, genome-wide diversity show similar patterns with admixture tests suggesting North Africans are a mixture of ancestral populations related to current Africans and Eurasians with more affinity towards the out-of-Africa populations than to sub-Saharan Africans. We estimate from the paternal lineages that most North Africans emerged ?15,000 years ago during the last glacial warming and that population splits started after the desiccation of the Sahara. Although most North Africans share a common admixture history, the Tunisian Berbers show long periods of genetic isolation and appear to have diverged from surrounding populations without subsequent mixture. On the other hand, continuous gene flow from the Middle East made Egyptians genetically closer to Eurasians than to other North Africans. We show that genetic diversity of today's North Africans mostly captures patterns from migrations post Last Glacial Maximum and therefore may be insufficient to inform on the initial population of the region during the Middle Paleolithic period.

11684294	20011031	Modulation of fine specificity of anti-DNA antibody by CDR3L residues.	The light chain of 2C10, an anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) autoantibody, is not favorable for DNA binding and it was suggested that the light chain might modulate the specificity of the antibody in DNA binding. We studied several mutant scFvs expressing mutated VL and normal VH of 2C10 to explore the role of the light chain in determining the fine specificity of the antibody, which we define as the preferential binding to a specific sequence of bases or a helical conformation compared to dsDNA from calf thymus. The wild-type Fab and scFv of 2C10 bind to poly(dA-dC).(dG-dT) better than to dsDNA. However, in the absence of the light chain domain, the VH domain bound dsDNA better than poly(dA-dC).(dG-dT), indicating the possible involvement of the light chain in determining the fine specificity in DNA binding. The mutations we studied were located in either CDR1L or CDR3L of the antibody. The CDR1 mutants, D28A, D30A, D31A, and D32A have been previously shown to cause an increase in the affinity of 2C10 scFv to DNA. The fine specificity of 2C10 was not affected by the CDR1 mutants which bound to poly(dA-dC).(dG-dT) better than dsDNA. However, CDR3L mutants, D92A and N93A, which had been shown to be involved in direct interaction with DNA, preferred dsDNA to poly(dA-dC).(dG-dT) in their binding. Our results indicate that the fine specificity of 2C10 in DNA binding is modulated primarily by Asp at 92 and Asn at 93 in CDR3L. The effects of CDR1L mutations indicate that this region affects only the affinity but not the fine specificity of 2C10. 	Mol._Immunol.	D016428 D013485
20882487	20101001	Lack of association between SNP rs3914132 of the RELN gene and otosclerosis in India.	Otosclerosis (MIM 166800) is primarily a metabolic bone disorder of the otic capsule, which leads to bony fixation of the stapedial footplate in the oval window; it is among the most common causes of acquired hearing loss. The etiology of this disease is largely unknown, although epidemiological studies suggest the involvement of both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, a reelin gene, SNP rs3914132, located in intron 2, was shown to be associated with otosclerosis in a European population. When we sequenced blood DNA samples of 85 individuals with otosclerosis and 85 controls, four SNPs of this gene: rs3914131 (P = 0.6463), rs3914132 (P = 0.1822), rs9641319 (P = 0.7371), and rs10227303 (P = 0.5669) were not significantly associated with this disease. In one familial case, a novel variant (C/T) at contig position 2923488 was found to be inherited by the proband and affected family members. 	Genet._Mol._Res.	D016428 D013485
8201952	19940301	Genotoxicity of paracetamol in mice and rats.	The genotoxicity of paracetamol, including covalent binding to DNA, induction of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs), and inhibition of replicative and repair synthesis of DNA, has been investigated in rodents in vivo. In the covalent binding studies male ICR mice were fasted and pretreated with diethyl maleate to deplete hepatic glutathione (GSH) and 300 mg/kg of [G-3H]paracetamol was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.). Animals were killed at 2, 6, 24, 72 and 168 h after paracetamol and hepatic or renal DNA and protein were isolated and the extent of covalent binding determined. Maximal binding to liver DNA, 8.4 +/- 3.1 pmol/mg of DNA, was observed at 2 h and declined rapidly to 2.6 pmol/mg at 24 h. Measurable binding (1.4 pmol/mg of DNA) was detected at 7 days. Protein binding in the liver in these animals peaked between 2 and 6 h (887 pmol/mg of protein at 2 h) and declined monoexponentially to 52 pmol/mg at 7 days. Although based on a limited body of data, covalent binding was also detected in DNA isolated from the kidney. DNA damage measured as SSBs by alkaline elution was induced in nuclear DNA isolated from the liver but not from the kidney, 2 h after i.p. injection of paracetamol at 600 mg/kg in male B6 mice. Only marginal DNA damage was noted at 300 mg/kg. The alkaline elution profile from damaged liver nuclei was markedly biphasic, suggesting that breaks were induced in DNA from a subpopulation of liver cells. The non-hepatotoxic paracetamol regioisomer, acetyl-m-aminophenol (600 mg/kg), which binds covalently to proteins, did not cause DNA SSBs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) 	Mutagenesis	D016428 D013485 D013487
26966436	20160312	Intrahepatic Fat Content and Markers of Hepatic Fibrosis in Obese Children.	Aim. We evaluated both direct and indirect hepatic fibrosis markers in obese children and their relationship with intrahepatic fat (IHF) content. We also aimed to investigate the possible roles of IHF and fibrosis markers in metabolic syndrome (MS). Methods. 189 obese children were divided into simple obese (SOB), simple steatosis (SS), and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) groups according to their IHF and blood alanine transaminase (ALT) levels. They were also scored for the MS components. IHF was assessed as a continuous variable by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). In addition, 30 nonobese children were enrolled as controls and their direct hepatic fibrosis markers and IHF were assessed. Results. Age was related to IHF, NFS, and FIB-4. Both NFS and APRI were related to IHF more significantly than the direct markers. In the estimation of liver function impairment, indirect markers had greater AUROC than direct markers. In MS, IHF and all the fibrosis markers showed similar AUROC. Conclusions. Both direct and indirect markers played a valuable role in evaluating MS. Indirect markers were more effective in distinguishing fatty hepatitis. Age is an important factor underlying hepatic steatosis and fibrosis even in children. 	Int_J_Endocrinol	D016428
25794286	20150321	DNA synthesis during endomitosis is stimulated by insulin via the PI3K/Akt and TOR signaling pathways in the silk gland cells of Bombyx mori.	Silk gland cells undergo multiple endomitotic cell cycles during silkworm larval ontogeny. Our previous study demonstrated that feeding is required for continued endomitosis in the silk gland cells of silkworm larvae. Furthermore, the insulin signaling pathway is closely related to nutritional signals. To investigate whether the insulin signaling pathway is involved in endomitosis in silk gland cells, in this study, we initially analyzed the effects of bovine insulin on DNA synthesis in endomitotic silk gland cells using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling technology, and found that bovine insulin can stimulate DNA synthesis. Insulin signal transduction is mainly mediated via phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, the target of rapamycin (TOR) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways in vertebrates. We ascertained that these three pathways are involved in DNA synthesis in endomitotic silk gland cells using specific inhibitors against each pathway. Moreover, we investigated whether these three pathways are involved in insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis in endomitotic silk gland cells, and found that the PI3K/Akt and TOR pathways, but not the ERK pathway, are involved in this process. These results provide an important theoretical foundation for the further investigations of the mechanism underlying efficient endomitosis in silk gland cells. 	Int_J_Mol_Sci	D016428 D013485
24338568	20131217	Control of helicase loading in the coupled DNA replication and recombination systems of bacteriophage T4.	The Gp59 protein of bacteriophage T4 promotes DNA replication by loading the replicative helicase, Gp41, onto replication forks and recombination intermediates. Gp59 also blocks DNA synthesis by Gp43 polymerase until Gp41 is loaded, ensuring that synthesis is tightly coupled to unwinding. The distinct polymerase blocking and helicase loading activities of Gp59 likely involve different binding interactions with DNA and protein partners. Here, we investigate how interactions of Gp59 with DNA and Gp32, the T4 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein, are related to these activities. A previously characterized mutant, Gp59-I87A, exhibits markedly reduced affinity for ssDNA and pseudo-fork DNA substrates. We demonstrate that on Gp32-covered ssDNA, the DNA binding defect of Gp59-I87A is not detrimental to helicase loading and translocation. In contrast, on pseudo-fork DNA the I87A mutation is detrimental to helicase loading and unwinding in the presence or absence of Gp32. Other results indicate that Gp32 binding to lagging strand ssDNA relieves the blockage of Gp43 polymerase activity by Gp59, whereas the inhibition of Gp43 exonuclease activity is maintained. Our findings suggest that Gp59-Gp32 and Gp59-DNA interactions perform separate but complementary roles in T4 DNA metabolism; Gp59-Gp32 interactions are needed to load Gp41 onto D-loops, and other nucleoprotein structures containing clusters of Gp32. Gp59-DNA interactions are needed to load Gp41 onto nascent or collapsed replication forks lacking clusters of Gp32 and to coordinate bidirectional replication from T4 origins. The dual functionalities of Gp59 allow it to promote the initiation or re-start of DNA replication from a wide variety of recombination and replication intermediates. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D052061
22448247	20120327	Depleting components of the THO complex causes increased telomere length by reducing the expression of the telomere-associated protein Rif1p.	Telomere length is regulated mostly by proteins directly associated with telomeres. However, genome-wide analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants has revealed that deletion of Hpr1p, a component of the THO complex, also affects telomere length. The THO complex comprises four protein subunits, namely, Tho2p, Hpr1p, Mft1p, and Thp2p. These subunits interplay between transcription elongation and co-transcriptional assembly of export-competent mRNPs. Here we found that the deletion of tho2 or hpr1 caused telomere lengthening by ?50-100 bps, whereas that of mft1 or thp2 did not affect telomere length. Since the THO complex functions in transcription elongation, we analyzed the expression of telomere-associated proteins in mutants depleted of complex components. We found that both the mRNA and protein levels of RIF1 were decreased in tho2 and hpr1 cells. RIF1 encodes a 1917-amino acid polypeptide that is involved in regulating telomere length and the formation of telomeric heterochromatin. Hpr1p and Tho2p appeared to affect telomeres through Rif1p, as increased Rif1p levels suppressed the telomere lengthening in tho2 and hpr1 cells. Moreover, yeast cells carrying rif1 tho2 or rif1 hpr1 double mutations showed telomere lengths and telomere silencing effects similar to those observed in the rif1 mutant. Thus, we conclude that mutations of components of the THO complex affect telomere functions by reducing the expression of a telomere-associated protein, Rif1p. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
23968328	20130824	Acute myeloid leukemia in a 38-year-old hemodialyzed patient with von Hippel-Lindau disease.	Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL disease) is a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome caused by mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene. The gene product, pVHL, regulates the level of proteins that play a central role in protecting cells against hypoxia. Clinical hallmarks of von Hippel-Lindau disease are the development of central nervous system hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, neuroendocrine tumors and endolymphatic sac tumors.In this article the case of a 38-year old hemodialyzed patient who became ill with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) three years after being diagnosed with von Hippel-Lindau disease is presented.After cytostatic treatment the patient went into complete hematologic remission but there was still residual disease at the genetic level. After consolidation therapy patient developed bone marrow aplasia and severe pneumonia. Despite intensive treatment the patient died from acute respiratory failure.In this paper we present for the first time a case of von Hippel-Lindau disease associated with acute myeloid leukemia. No evidence of relationship between VHL disease and blood cancers has been demonstrated so far. Despite the fact that there is an increased risk of cancer development in hemodialyzed patients, cancer is a relatively rare cause of death in the dialysed population, and the most common malignancies are genitourinary cancers. It seems likely that development of acute myeloid leukemia in patient with VHL disease can be related to epigenetic alterations of the VHL gene, but further studies are needed.

26902884	20160224	Isolation and characterization of a novel type of rotavirus species A in sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps).	To estimate the risk of interspecies transmission of rotavirus species A (RVA) from exotic pets to other mammalian species, the prevalence of RVA in sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps) was investigated. RVAs were detected in 10 of 44 sugar gliders by reverse transcription (RT)-semi-nested PCR. These viruses were classified as G27P[3] and G27P[36] genotypes, with G27 and P[36] being new genotypes as assigned by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group. To characterize sugar glider RVA in detail, one strain, RVA/SugarGlider-tc/JPN/SG385/2012/G27P[36] (SG385-tc), was isolated. All of the genes of the strain were classified as new genotypes (G27-P[36]-I19-R10-C10-M9-A20-N11-T13-E17-H12). The enterotoxin domain in NSP4, which is important for the induction of diarrhoea, was conserved between SG385-tc and previously reported mammalian strains, suggesting the potential of sugar glider RVA to cause diarrhoea in mammalian species. In fact, seven out of nine suckling mice inoculated orally with 3.9???104 f.f.u. of strain SG385-tc had diarrhoea and the 50?% diarrhoea-inducing dose (DD50) of strain SG385-tc in suckling mice was 1.2???104 f.f.u. Our findings suggest that sugar glider RVA is infective to and possibly pathogenic in other mammalian species. 	J._Gen._Virol.	D016428 D013485
24780207	20140501	Prognostic value of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in a general population.	New techniques of Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) enable the measurement of myocardial velocities and provide information about left ventricular (LV) diastolic function. Recent studies explored the prognostic role of TDI-derived indexes. However, these studies considered only total mortality and did not provide information on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Therefore, we investigated in continuous and categorical analyses whether Doppler diastolic indexes contained any prognostic information over and beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors in a general population. We measured early and late diastolic peak velocities of mitral inflow (E and A) by conventional Doppler, and the mitral annular velocities (e' and a') by TDI in 793 participants (mean age 50.9 years). We calculated multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for conventional and TDI Doppler indexes, while accounting for family cluster and cardiovascular risk factors. Median follow-up was 4.8 years (5th to 95th percentile, 3.0 to 5.4). With adjustments applied for covariables, e' velocity was a significant predictor of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular (n=59; P=0.004) and cardiac events (n=40; P=0.001). TDI e' yielded a net reclassification improvement of 54.2% for cardiovascular and 64.0% for cardiac events. Hazard ratios of all cardiovascular (2.21; P=0.042) and cardiac (4.50; P=0.002) events were significantly elevated in participants with increased LV filling pressure compared with subjects with normal diastolic function. TDI e' velocity is a significant predictor of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events in a general population. Furthermore, we observed an increase in all cardiovascular events in the diastolic dysfunction group characterized by elevated LV filling pressure. 	J_Am_Heart_Assoc	D016428 D013485
24433482	20140118	Neuregulin-1 attenuates mortality associated with experimental cerebral malaria.	Cerebral Malaria (CM) is a diffuse encephalopathy caused by Plasmodium falciparum infection. Despite availability of antimalarial drugs, CM-associated mortality remains high at approximately 30% and a subset of survivors develop neurological and cognitive disabilities. While antimalarials are effective at clearing Plasmodium parasites they do little to protect against CM pathophysiology and parasite-induced brain inflammation that leads to seizures, coma and long-term neurological sequelae in CM patients. Thus, there is urgent need to explore therapeutics that can reduce or prevent CM pathogenesis and associated brain inflammation to improve survival. Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) is a neurotrophic growth factor shown to protect against brain injury associated with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and neurotoxin exposure. However, this drug has not been tested against CM-associated brain injury. Since CM-associated brain injuries and AIS share similar pathophysiological features, we hypothesized that NRG-1 will reduce or prevent neuroinflammation and brain damage as well as improve survival in mice with late-stage experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). We tested the effects of NRG-1 on ECM-associated brain inflammation and mortality in P. berghei ANKA (PbA)-infected mice and compared to artemether (ARM) treatment; an antimalarial currently used in various combination therapies against malaria. Treatment with ARM (25?mg/kg/day) effectively cleared parasites and reduced mortality in PbA-infected mice by 82%. Remarkably, NRG-1 therapy (1.25?ng/kg/day) significantly improved survival against ECM by 73% despite increase in parasite burden within NRG-1-treated mice. Additionally, NRG-1 therapy reduced systemic and brain pro-inflammatory factors TNFalpha, IL-6, IL-1alpha and CXCL10 and enhanced anti-inflammatory factors, IL-5 and IL-13 while decreasing leukocyte accumulation in brain microvessels. This study suggests that NRG-1 attenuates ECM-associated brain inflammation and injuries and may represent a novel supportive therapy for the management of CM.

26149185	20150708	Comparative analysis of autoantibodies targeting peptidylarginine deiminase type 4, mutated citrullinated vimentin and cyclic citrullinated peptides in rheumatoid arthritis: associations with cytokine profiles, clinical and genetic features.	Antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCP) are widely used for diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We performed a comparative analysis of antibodies targeting the citrullinating enzyme peptidylarginine deiminase type 4 (anti-PAD4) and mutated citrullinated vimentin (anti-MCV) with anti-CCP autoantibodies in RA patients and examined their relationships with clinical parameters, cytokine profiles and the PADI4 gene. Autoantibodies were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in sera of 170 RA patients and 103 controls. Cytokine profiles were measured using a multiplex system. PADI4 polymorphisms (89 G &gt; A, 90 T &gt; C and 92 G &gt; C) were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Anti-PAD4, anti-MCV and anti-CCP autoantibodies were detected in 24, 61 and 74% of RA patients, respectively. Positive correlations were observed between anti-PAD4 and disease duration; anti-CCP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR); anti-MCV and ESR and C-reactive protein. Anti-MCV antibodies were associated with high disease activity score 28 (DAS-28) in early RA. Concentrations of T helper type 1 (Th1) [tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-?, interleukin (IL)-12, IL-2, IL-1?], Th2 (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13) and Th17 (IL-17) cytokines were higher in RA than in controls. Th2 and, to a lesser extent, Th1-related cytokines, showed positive correlations with anti-MCV and anti-CCP. The GTG haplotype in PADI4 was associated with anti-CCP and anti-MCV, but not anti-PAD4 antibodies. In conclusion, anti-PAD4 antibodies are detected mainly in established RA, which is in contrast to the early detection of antibodies against citrullinated peptide/proteins (ACPAs). Among autoantibodies, anti-MCV appear to perform better as markers of disease activity. Furthermore, anti-CCP and anti-MCV are associated genetically with the citrullinating enzyme PAD4 and are related strongly to Th1 and Th2 cytokines, suggesting a feed-forward loop between cytokines and ACPA production.

22133519	20111203	Visual detection of gene mutations based on isothermal strand-displacement polymerase reaction and lateral flow strip.	Here, we describe a simple and sensitive approach for visual detection of gene mutations based on isothermal strand-displacement polymerase reactions (ISDPR) and lateral flow strip (LFS). The concept was first demonstrated by detecting the R156H-mutant gene of keratin 10 in Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (EHK). In the presence of biotin-modified hairpin DNA and digoxin-modified primer, the R156H-mutant DNA triggered the ISDPR to produce numerous digoxin- and biotin-attached duplex DNA products. The product was detected on the LFS through dual immunoreactions (anti-digoxin antibody on the gold nanoparticle (Au-NP) and digoxin on the duplex, anti-biotin antibody on the LFS test zone and biotin on the duplex). The accumulation of Au-NPs produced the characteristic red band, enabling visual detection of the mutant gene without instrumentation. After systematic optimization of the ISDPR experimental conditions and the parameters of the assay, the current approach was capable of detecting as low as 1-fM R156H-mutant DNA within 75 min without instrumentation. Differentiation of R156H- and R156C-mutant DNA on the R156 mutation site was realized by using fluorescein- and biotin-modified hairpin probes in the ISDPR process. The approach thus provides a simple, sensitive, and low-cost tool for the detection of gene mutations. 	Biosens_Bioelectron	D016428 D052061 D013485
24520254	20140213	Screening of differentially expressed genes associated with non-union skeletal fractures and analysis with a DNA microarray.	The purpose of this study was to identify the feature genes that are associated with non-union skeletal fractures using samples of normal union and non-union skeletal fracture microarray data. The gene expression profile GSE494 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and included 12 samples based on three different platforms (GPL92, GPL93 and GPL8300). Each of the platforms had four sets of expression data, two from normal union skeletal fracture samples and two from non-union skeletal fracture samples. The differentially expressed genes within the three platforms of expression data were identified using packages in R language and the differentially expressed genes common to the three platforms were selected. The selected common differentially expressed genes were further analyzed using bioinformatic methods. The software HitPredict was used to search interactions of the common differentially expressed genes and then FuncAssociate was used to conduct a functional analysis of the genes in the interaction network. Further, the associated pathways were identified using the software WebGestalt. Under the three different platforms, GPL92, GPL93 and GPL8300, the numbers of differentially expressed genes identified were 531, 418 and 914, respectively. The common gene CLU and its interacting genes were most significantly associated with the regulation of sterol transport and the osteoclast differentiation pathway. Upregulation of the gene CLU was identified by comparing data for normal union and non-union skeletal fracture samples. According to the function of CLU and its interacting genes, it was concluded that they inhibit the normal healing process following a fracture, and result in non-union skeletal fractures through the regulation of sterol transport and the pathways of differentiation in osteoclasts.

24015331	20130910	Role of microRNAs in lung development and pulmonary diseases.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNA which exert post-transcriptional gene regulation activity by targeting messenger RNAs. miRNAs have been found to be involved in various fundamental biological processes and deregulation of miRNAs is known to result in pathological conditions. In this review, we provide an overview of recent discoveries on the role played by this class of molecules in lung development and in pulmonary diseases, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary artery hypertension. Considering the relevant role of these miRNAs under physiological and pathological conditions, they represent new clinical targets as well as diagnostic and prognostic tools. Therefore, this review pays special attention to recent advances and possible future directions for the use of miRNAs for clinical applications. 	Pulm_Circ	D016428 D016454
14525990	20031004	Role of charged residues in coupling ligand binding and channel activation in the extracellular domain of the glycine receptor.	The glycine receptor is a member of the ligand-gated ion channel receptor superfamily that mediates fast synaptic transmission in the brainstem and spinal cord. Following ligand binding, the receptor undergoes a conformational change that is conveyed to the transmembrane regions of the receptor resulting in the opening of the channel pore. Using the acetylcholine-binding protein structure as a template, we modeled the extracellular domain of the glycine receptor alpha1-subunit and identified the location of charged residues within loops 2 and 7 (the conserved Cys-loop). These loops have been postulated to interact with the M2-M3 linker region between the transmembrane domains 2 and 3 as part of the receptor activation mechanism. Charged residues were substituted with cysteine, resulting in a shift in the concentration-response curves to the right in each case. Covalent modification with 2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl methanethiosulfonate was demonstrated only for K143C, which was more accessible in the open state than the closed state, and resulted in a shift in the EC50 toward wild-type values. Charge reversal mutations (E53K, D57K, and D148K) also impaired channel activation, as inferred from increases in EC50 values and the conversion of taurine from an agonist to an antagonist in E53K and D57K. Thus, each of the residues Glu-53, Asp-57, Lys-143, and Asp-148 are implicated in channel gating. However, the double reverse charge mutations E53K:K276E, D57K:K276E, and D148K:K276E did not restore glycine receptor function. These results indicate that loops 2 and 7 in the extracellular domain play an important role in the mechanism of activation of the glycine receptor although not by a direct electrostatic mechanism.

9891992	19990119	Active site mutants of human herpesvirus-6 proteinase.	Amino acid residues thought to comprise the catalytic triad of HHV-6 proteinase were changed by site-directed mutagenesis in the precursor form of the proteinase. By monitoring the ability of each mutant proteinase precursor to undergo autoprocessing, Ser116, His46 and His135 were identified as catalytically crucial. An attempt was made to mimic the catalytic triad arrangement of archetypal serine proteinases by replacement of the second histidine, His135, by an Asp. Instead of increasing the autoprocessing ability of the His135Asp mutant HHV-6 proteinase precursor, this mutation had a detrimental effect since the precursor persisted predominantly in its unprocessed form.

24571444	20140228	Role of GAD2 and HTR1B genes in early-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder: results from transmission disequilibrium study.	One of the leading biological models of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is the frontal-striatal-thalamic model. This study undertakes an extensive exploration of the variability in genes related to the regulation of the frontal-striatal-thalamic system in a sample of early-onset OCD trios. To this end, we genotyped 266 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 35 genes in 84 OCD probands and their parents. Finally, 75 complete trios were included in the analysis. Twenty SNPs were overtransmitted from parents to early-onset OCD probands and presented nominal pointwise P &lt; 0.05 values. Three of these polymorphisms achieved P &lt; 2 ? 10(-4), the significant P-value after Bonferroni corrections: rs8190748 and rs992990 localized in GAD2 and rs2000292 in HTR1B. When we stratified our sample according to gender, different trends were observed between males and females. In males, SNP rs2000292 (HTR1B) showed the lowest P-value (P = 0.0006), whereas the SNPs in GAD2 were only marginally significant (P = 0.01). In contrast, in females HTR1B polymorphisms were not significant, whereas rs8190748 (GAD2) showed the lowest P-value (P = 0.0006). These results are in agreement with several lines of evidence that indicate a role for the serotonin and ?-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) pathways in the risk of early-onset OCD and with the gender differences in OCD pathophysiology reported elsewhere. However, our results need to be replicated in studies with larger cohorts in order to confirm these associations. 	Genes_Brain_Behav.	D016428 D013485
19826453	20091015	Methionine synthase A2756G polymorphism and cancer risk: a meta-analysis.	Polymorphisms in methionine synthase (MTR) gene may be involved in carcinogenesis by affecting DNA methylation. However, association studies on MTR A2756G polymorphism in cancers have reported conflicting results. Therefore we performed a meta-analysis to better assess the associations. A total of 24 896 cancer patients and 33 862 controls from 52 articles for MTR A2756G were investigated. Overall, individuals carrying MTR 2756GG genotype had a subtly reduced cancer risk under a recessive genetic model (odds ratio (OR), 0.92; P=0.053; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.84-1.00; I(2)=0.0%; P(heterogeneity)=0.61). In the subgroup analyses by ethnicity, 2756GG was associated with a significantly reduced cancer risk in European populations (OR, 0.83; P=0.001; 95% CI, 0.74-0.93; I(2)=0.0%; P(heterogeneity)=0.99). However, in Asian populations, a significantly elevated association between 2756GG genotype and cancer risk was observed (OR, 1.33; P=0.012; 95% CI, 1.06-1.65; I(2)=0.0%; P(heterogeneity)=0.50). In studies stratified by tumor site, there was a significantly reduced risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (OR, 0.54; P=0.049; 95% CI, 0.29-1.00; I(2)=10.7%; P(heterogeneity)=0.33) and colorectal cancer (OR, 0.63; P=0.004; 95% CI, 0.47-0.87; I(2)=0.0%; P(heterogeneity)=0.73) in European populations. Our study indicates that MTR A2756G polymorphism is a candidate gene polymorphism for cancer susceptibility regardless of environmental factors. Large-scale, well-designed, and population-based studies are required to further investigate gene-gene and gene-environment interactions on MTR A2756G polymorphism and tissue-specific cancer risk in an ethnicity-specific population.

27355212	20160630	Multiplex APLP System for High-Resolution Haplogrouping of Extremely Degraded East-Asian Mitochondrial DNAs.	Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) serves as a powerful tool for exploring matrilineal phylogeographic ancestry, as well as for analyzing highly degraded samples, because of its polymorphic nature and high copy numbers per cell. The recent advent of complete mitochondrial genome sequencing has led to improved techniques for phylogenetic analyses based on mtDNA, and many multiplex genotyping methods have been developed for the hierarchical analysis of phylogenetically important mutations. However, few high-resolution multiplex genotyping systems for analyzing East-Asian mtDNA can be applied to extremely degraded samples. Here, we present a multiplex system for analyzing mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms (mtSNPs), which relies on a novel amplified product-length polymorphisms (APLP) method that uses inosine-flapped primers and is specifically designed for the detailed haplogrouping of extremely degraded East-Asian mtDNAs. We used fourteen 6-plex polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) and subsequent electrophoresis to examine 81 haplogroup-defining SNPs and 3 insertion/deletion sites, and we were able to securely assign the studied mtDNAs to relevant haplogroups. Our system requires only 1?10-13 g (100 fg) of crude DNA to obtain a full profile. Owing to its small amplicon size (&lt;110 bp), this new APLP system was successfully applied to extremely degraded samples for which direct sequencing of hypervariable segments using mini-primer sets was unsuccessful, and proved to be more robust than conventional APLP analysis. Thus, our new APLP system is effective for retrieving reliable data from extremely degraded East-Asian mtDNAs. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428
22587442	20120517	Tubal ligation, hysterectomy and ovarian cancer: A meta-analysis.	The purpose of this meta-analysis was to determine the strength of the association between gynecologic surgeries, tubal ligation and hysterectomy, and ovarian cancer. We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases for all English-language articles dated between 1969 through March 2011 using the keywords &quot;ovarian cancer&quot; and &quot;tubal ligation&quot; or &quot;tubal sterilization&quot; or &quot;hysterectomy.&quot; We identified 30 studies on tubal ligation and 24 studies on hysterectomy that provided relative risks for ovarian cancer and a p-value or 95% confidence interval (CI) to include in the meta-analysis. Summary RRs and 95% CIs were calculated using a random-effects model. The summary RR for women with vs. without tubal ligation was 0.70 (95%CI: 0.64, 0.75). Similarly, the summary RR for women with vs. without hysterectomy was 0.74 (95%CI: 0.65, 0.84). Simple hysterectomy and hysterectomy with unilateral oophorectomy were associated with a similar decrease in risk (summery RR?=?0.62, 95%CI: 0.49-0.79 and 0.60, 95%CI: 0.47-0.78, respectively). In secondary analyses, the association between tubal ligation and ovarian cancer risk was stronger for endometrioid tumors (summary RR?=?0.45, 95%CI: 0.33, 0.61) compared to serous tumors. Observational epidemiologic evidence strongly supports that tubal ligation and hysterectomy are associated with a decrease in the risk of ovarian cancer, by approximately 26-30%. Additional research is needed to determine whether the association between tubal ligation and hysterectomy on ovarian cancer risk differs by individual, surgical, and tumor characteristics.

23935073	20130813	A specific N-terminal extension of the 8 kDa domain is required for DNA end-bridging by human Pol? and Pol?.	Human DNA polymerases mu (Pol?) and lambda (Pol?) are X family members involved in the repair of double-strand breaks in DNA during non-homologous end joining. Crucial abilities of these enzymes include bridging of the two 3' single-stranded overhangs and trans-polymerization using one 3' end as primer and the other as template, to minimize sequence loss. In this context, we have studied the importance of a previously uncharacterised sequence ('brooch'), located at the N-terminal boundary of the Pol?-like polymerase core, and formed by Tyr(141), Ala(142), Cys(143), Gln(144) and Arg(145) in Pol?, and by Trp(239), Val(240), Cys(241), Ala(242) and Gln(243) in Pol?. The brooch is potentially implicated in the maintenance of a closed conformation throughout the catalytic cycle, and our studies indicate that it could be a target of Cdk phosphorylation in Pol?. The brooch is irrelevant for 1 nt gap filling, but of specific importance during end joining: single mutations in the conserved residues reduced the formation of two ended synapses and strongly diminished the ability of Pol? and polymerase lambda to perform non-homologous end joining reactions in vitro.

25137531	20140820	EPR, ENDOR, and electronic structure studies of the Jahn-Teller distortion in an Fe(V) nitride.	The recently synthesized and isolated low-coordinate Fe(V) nitride complex has numerous implications as a model for high-oxidation states in biological and industrial systems. The trigonal [PhB((t)BuIm)3Fe(V)?N](+) (where (PhB((t)BuIm)3(-) = phenyltris(3-tert-butylimidazol-2-ylidene)), (1) low-spin d(3) (S = 1/2) coordination compound is subject to a Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion of its doubly degenerate (2)E ground state. The electronic structure of this complex is analyzed by a combination of extended versions of the formal two-orbital pseudo Jahn-Teller (PJT) treatment and of quantum chemical computations of the PJT effect. The formal treatment is extended to incorporate mixing of the two e orbital doublets (30%) that results from a lowering of the idealized molecular symmetry from D3h to C3v through strong &quot;doming&quot; of the Fe-C3 core. Correspondingly we introduce novel DFT/CASSCF computational methods in the computation of electronic structure, which reveal a quadratic JT distortion and significant e-e mixing, thus reaching a new level of synergism between computational and formal treatments. Hyperfine and quadrupole tensors are obtained by pulsed 35 GHz ENDOR measurements for the (14/15)N-nitride and the (11)B axial ligands, and spectra are obtained from the imidazole-2-ylidene (13)C atoms that are not bound to Fe. Analysis of the nitride ENDOR tensors surprisingly reveals an essentially spherical nitride trianion bound to Fe, with negative spin density and minimal charge density anisotropy. The four-coordinate (11)B, as expected, exhibits negligible bonding to Fe. A detailed analysis of the frontier orbitals provided by the electronic structure calculations provides insight into the reactivity of 1: JT-induced symmetry lowering provides an orbital selection mechanism for proton or H atom transfer reactivity.

16329996	20051207	Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B cleaves properdin and inhibits complement-mediated opsonophagocytosis.	Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SPE B), a cysteine protease, is an important virulence factor in group A streptococcal (GAS) infection. The reduction of phagocytic activity by SPE B may help prevent bacteria from being ingested. In this study, we investigated the mechanism SPE B uses to enable bacteria to resist opsonophagocytosis. Using Western blotting and an affinity column immobilized with SPE B, we found that both SPE B and C192S, an SPE B mutant lacking protease activity, bound to serum properdin, and that SPE B, but not C192S, degraded serum properdin. Further study showed that SPE B-treated, but not C192S-treated, serum blocked the alternative complement pathway. Reconstitution of properdin into SPE B-treated serum unblocked the alternative pathway. GAS opsonized with SPE B-treated serum was more resistant to neutrophil killing than GAS opsonized with C192S-treated or normal serum. These results suggest that a novel SPE B mechanism, one which degrades serum properdin, enables GAS to resist opsonophagocytosis. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.	D016428 D013485

The title compound, C(16)H(8)N(2)?C(6)H(4)S(4), crystallizes with the fluorene derivative placed in a general position and two half tetra-thia-fulvalene (TTF) mol-ecules, each completed to a whole mol-ecule through an inversion center. The fluorene ring system is virtually planar (r.m.s. deviation from the mean plane = 0.027??) and the dicyano group is twisted from the fluorene plane by only 3.85?(12)?. The TTF mol-ecules are also planar, and their central C=C bond lengths [1.351?(8) and 1.324?(7)??] compare well with the same bond length in neutral TTF (ca 1.35??). These features indicate that no charge transfer occurs between mol-ecules in the crystal; the compound should thus be considered a cocrystal rather than an organic complex. This is confirmed by the crystal structure, in which no significant stacking inter-actions are observed between mol-ecules. 	Acta_Crystallogr_Sect_E_Struct_Rep_Online	D016428
25852864	20150409	Low serum sodium is associated with protein energy wasting and increased interdialytic weight gain in haemodialysis patients.	Low serum sodium (Na) has been associated with decreased body mass index and increased cardiovascular mortality in haemodialysis (HD) patients. We examined the relationship between serum Na and selected nutritional parameters of protein energy wasting that are not affected from the hydration status in a cohort of HD patients. Triceps skinfold thickness (TSF), mid-arm circumference (MAC), mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC), handgrip strength (HGS) and subjective global assessment (SGA) were assessed in maintenance HD patients using standard techniques. MAMC was calculated with the formula MAMC (cm) = MAC (cm) -3.142 ? TSF cm. Pre-dialysis serum Na values from routine monthly laboratory measurements were averaged for the last 6 months prior to the nutritional assessment. Altogether 172 patients with anthropometric data were included in the final analysis. Mean age was 66 ? 14, females 62 (36%) and diabetics 48 (28.9%). Patients with pre-dialysis serum Na below the mean value (136.2 mEq/L) had lower MAMC, HGS, SGA scores and albumin levels (23.50 ? 3.16 cm versus 24.58 ? 3.71 cm, P = 0.048; 21.7 ? 13.6 kg versus 28.0 ? 12.4 kg, P = 0.030; 5.1 ? 1.2 versus 5.7 ? 1.0, P = 0.012 and 31.65 ? 4.73 mg/L versus 32.25 ? 3.91 mg/L, P = 0.022, respectively) and higher interdialytic weight gains. Pre-dialysis serum Na correlated positively with MAMC, handgrip and SGA (Pearson's correlation r = 0.165, P = 0.031, r = 0.237, P = 0.022 and r = 0.195, P = 0.011, respectively). This study demonstrates that low serum sodium is associated with protein energy wasting and increased interdialytic weight gain in HD patients. 	Clin_Kidney_J	D016428
20031928	20091225	Variation in IGHMBP2 is not associated with IgA nephropathy in independent studies of UK Caucasian and Chinese Han patients.	IgA nephropathy is a major cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. Its aetiology is poorly understood but there is good evidence for a major genetic component, although to date, no gene has been conclusively identified. We describe a new UK multicentre DNA collection assembled to investigate this. A Japanese genome-wide analysis recently reported that common genetic variation in immunoglobulin mu-binding protein 2 (IGHMBP2) was associated with IgA nephropathy. We sought to replicate this using the new UK collection, and through an independent parallel analysis of a Han Chinese population. In the UK collection, haplotype-tagging (tag) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes were analysed in a case-control study (349 cases, 605 controls) and family-based analysis (162 complete and 23 partially complete family trios), which was performed using the transmission disequilibrium test. In parallel, 663 cases of IgA nephropathy and 663 controls from a Chinese population were analysed: coding and flanking regions of the gene were re-sequenced in a subset, and SNP and haplotype association analysis was performed in the whole collection using the identified tagSNPs and all the coding and exonic flanking SNPs. Case-control studies in UK and Chinese populations, and family-based tests in the UK population provided no evidence for association between variation in IGHMBP2 and IgA nephropathy. The A allele of SNP G34448A was not present in the UK collection. It was present but not associated with the disease in the Chinese population. Variation in IGHMBP2 does not confer significant susceptibility to IgA nephropathy in UK Caucasian or Chinese Han populations. 	Nephrol._Dial._Transplant.	D016428 D013485
25210497	20140912	Implication of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 in 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid-induced angiogenesis.	14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (14,15-EET) is implicated in regulating physiological functions of endothelial cells (ECs), yet the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects in ECs are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated whether transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor type 1 (TRPV1) is involved in 14,15-EET-mediated Ca(2+) influx, nitric oxide (NO) production and angiogenesis. In human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs), 14,15-EET time-dependently increased the intracellular level of Ca(2+). Removal of extracellular Ca(2+), pharmacological inhibition or genetic disruption of TRPV1 abrogated 14,15-EET-mediated increase of intracellular Ca(2+) level in HMECs or TRPV1-transfected HEK293 cells. Furthermore, removal of extracellular Ca(2+) or pharmacological inhibition of TRPV1 decreased 14,15-EET-induced NO production. 14,15-EET-mediated tube formation was abolished by TRPV1 pharmacological inhibition. In an animal experiment, 14,15-EET-induced angiogenesis was diminished by inhibition of TRPV1 and in TRPV1-deficient mice. TRPV1 may play a crucial role in 14,15-EET-induced Ca(2+) influx, NO production and angiogenesis. 	Int._J._Biol._Sci.	D016428 D013485
26283179	20150819	OLA1 regulates protein synthesis and integrated stress response by inhibiting eIF2 ternary complex formation.	Translation is a fundamental cellular process, and its dysregulation can contribute to human diseases such as cancer. During translation initiation the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) forms a ternary complex (TC) with GTP and the initiator methionyl-tRNA (tRNAi), mediating ribosomal recruitment of tRNAi. Limiting TC availability is a central mechanism for triggering the integrated stress response (ISR), which suppresses global translation in response to various cellular stresses, but induces specific proteins such as ATF4. This study shows that OLA1, a member of the ancient Obg family of GTPases, is an eIF2-regulatory protein that inhibits protein synthesis and promotes ISR by binding eIF2, hydrolyzing GTP, and interfering with TC formation. OLA1 thus represents a novel mechanism of translational control affecting de novo TC formation, different from the traditional model in which phosphorylation of eIF2? blocks the regeneration of TC. Depletion of OLA1 caused a hypoactive ISR and greater survival in stressed cells. In vivo, OLA1-knockdown rendered cancer cells deficient in ISR and the downstream proapoptotic effector, CHOP, promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Our work suggests that OLA1 is a novel translational GTPase and plays a suppressive role in translation and cell survival, as well as cancer growth and progression. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D052061 D013485
12887265	20030731	Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.	Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF) is a prodrug of tenofovir, a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor. In two large, well designed, placebo-controlled clinical trials, tenofovir DF 300 mg/day resulted in significant reductions in HIV-1 RNA from baseline compared with placebo at 24 weeks in antiretroviral-experienced patients with HIV infection. Patients in both treatment groups continued to receive existing stable antiretroviral therapy. In an extension phase of one trial, these reductions in viral load were maintained after 96 weeks of treatment with tenofovir DF. Preliminary data from a large, 3-year comparative trial suggest the clinical efficacy of tenofovir DF in combination with baseline antiretroviral therapy is similar to that of stavudine in antiretroviral-naive patients with HIV infection. Virological substudies showed that viral suppression was maintained in patients who developed new reverse transcriptase mutations during tenofovir DF therapy (in combination with existing stable antiretroviral drugs) for up to 48 weeks. Isolates of HIV infrequently developed the K65R mutation during 96 weeks of tenofovir DF therapy. Tenofovir DF is generally well tolerated. The most commonly observed adverse events seen with tenofovir DF (in combination with other antiretroviral drugs) were predominantly of a gastrointestinal nature. 	Drugs	D003160 D016428 D016454
25079510	20140801	Structure-guided functional characterization of enediyne self-sacrifice resistance proteins, CalU16 and CalU19.	Calicheamicin ?1I (1) is an enediyne antitumor compound produced by Micromonospora echinospora spp. calichensis, and its biosynthetic gene cluster has been previously reported. Despite extensive analysis and biochemical study, several genes in the biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 remain functionally unassigned. Using a structural genomics approach and biochemical characterization, two proteins encoded by genes from the 1 biosynthetic gene cluster assigned as &quot;unknowns&quot;, CalU16 and CalU19, were characterized. Structure analysis revealed that they possess the STeroidogenic Acute Regulatory protein related lipid Transfer (START) domain known mainly to bind and transport lipids and previously identified as the structural signature of the enediyne self-resistance protein CalC. Subsequent study revealed calU16 and calU19 to confer resistance to 1, and reminiscent of the prototype CalC, both CalU16 and CalU19 were cleaved by 1 in vitro. Through site-directed mutagenesis and mass spectrometry, we identified the site of cleavage in each protein and characterized their function in conferring resistance against 1. This report emphasizes the importance of structural genomics as a powerful tool for the functional annotation of unknown proteins. 	ACS_Chem._Biol.	D016428 D052061 D013486
24651674	20140322	Contribution of environment and genetics to pancreatic cancer susceptibility.	Several risk factors have been identified as potential contributors to pancreatic cancer development, including environmental and lifestyle factors, such as smoking, drinking and diet, and medical conditions such as diabetes and pancreatitis, all of which generate oxidative stress and DNA damage. Oxidative stress status can be modified by environmental factors and also by an individual's unique genetic makeup. Here we examined the contribution of environment and genetics to an individual's level of oxidative stress, DNA damage and susceptibility to pancreatic cancer in a pilot study using three groups of subjects: a newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer group, a healthy genetically-unrelated control group living with the case subject, and a healthy genetically-related control group which does not reside with the subject. Oxidative stress and DNA damage was evaluated by measuring total antioxidant capacity, direct and oxidative DNA damage by Comet assay, and malondialdehyde levels. Direct DNA damage was significantly elevated in pancreatic cancer patients (age and sex adjusted mean ? standard error: 1.00 ? 0.05) versus both healthy unrelated and related controls (0.70 ? 0.06, p&lt;0.001 and 0.82 ? 0.07, p = 0.046, respectively). Analysis of 22 selected SNPs in oxidative stress and DNA damage genes revealed that CYP2A6 L160H was associated with pancreatic cancer. In addition, DNA damage was found to be associated with TNFA -308G&gt;A and ERCC4 R415Q polymorphisms. These results suggest that measurement of DNA damage, as well as select SNPs, may provide an important screening tool to identify individuals at risk for development of pancreatic cancer.

22575724	20120512	Association between interleukin-6 gene -174 G/C polymorphism and the risk of coronary heart disease: a meta-analysis of 20 studies including 9619 cases and 10,919 controls.	Interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene -174 G/C polymorphism has been reported to be associated with coronary heart disease (CHD), but the results remain inconclusive. The present meta-analysis was therefore designed to clarify these controversies. This meta-analysis was performed by searching PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases. A total of 20 studies including 9619 CHD cases and 10,919 controls were combined showing no evidence of association between IL-6 gene -174 G/C polymorphism and CHD risk (for C/C+C/G vs. G/G: OR=1.10, 95% CI=0.99-1.22, p=0.07; for C/C vs. C/G+G/G: OR=1.08, 95% CI=0.93-1.24, p=0.33; for C/C vs. G/G: OR=1.16, 95% CI=0.97-1.39, p=0.11; for C allele vs. G allele: OR=1.10, 95% CI=1.00-1.21, p=0.06). Moreover, we also did not find significant association between IL-6 gene -174 G/C polymorphism and myocardial infarction (MI) risk. However, in the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant association was found among Asians (for C/C+C/G vs. G/G: OR=1.35, 95% CI=1.05-1.63, p=0.02). In summary, the present meta-analysis suggests that IL-6 gene -174 G/C polymorphism is associated with increased CHD risk among Asians. However, due to the small subjects included in the subgroup analysis of Asians, the results should be interpreted with caution. 	Gene	D016428
24368893	20131226	Distinct effects of IPSU and suvorexant on mouse sleep architecture.	Dual orexin receptor (OXR) antagonists (DORAs) such as almorexant, SB-649868, suvorexant (MK-4305), and filorexant (MK-6096), have shown promise for the treatment of insomnias and sleep disorders. Whether antagonism of both OX1R and OX2R is necessary for sleep induction has been a matter of some debate. Experiments using knockout mice suggest that it may be sufficient to antagonize only OX2R. The recent identification of an orally bioavailable, brain penetrant OX2R preferring antagonist 2-((1H-Indol-3-yl)methyl)-9-(4-methoxypyrimidin-2-yl)-2,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecan-1-one (IPSU) has allowed us to test whether selective antagonism of OX2R may also be a viable strategy for induction of sleep. We previously demonstrated that IPSU and suvorexant increase sleep when dosed during the mouse active phase (lights off); IPSU inducing sleep primarily by increasing NREM sleep, suvorexant primarily by increasing REM sleep. Here, our goal was to determine whether suvorexant and IPSU affect sleep architecture independently of overall sleep induction. We therefore tested suvorexant (25 mg/kg) and IPSU (50 mg/kg) in mice during the inactive phase (lights on) when sleep is naturally more prevalent and when orexin levels are normally low. Whereas IPSU was devoid of effects on the time spent in NREM or REM, suvorexant substantially disturbed the sleep architecture by selectively increasing REM during the first 4 h after dosing. At the doses tested, suvorexant significantly decreased wake only during the first hour and IPSU did not affect wake time. These data suggest that OX2R preferring antagonists may have a reduced tendency for perturbing NREM/REM architecture in comparison with DORAs. Whether this effect will prove to be a general feature of OX2R antagonists vs. DORAs remains to be seen. 	Front_Neurosci	D016428
26477939	20151020	Unveiling transient protein-protein interactions that modulate inhibition of alpha-synuclein aggregation by beta-synuclein, a pre-synaptic protein that co-localizes with alpha-synuclein.	Pathology in Parkinson's disease is linked to self-association of ?-Synuclein (?S) into pathogenic oligomeric species and highly ordered amyloid fibrils. Developing effective therapeutic strategies against this debilitating disease is critical and ?S, a pre-synaptic protein that co-localizes with ?S, can act as an inhibitor of ?S assembly. Despite the potential importance of ?S as an inhibitor of ?S, the nature, location and specificity of the molecular interactions between these two proteins is unknown. Here we use NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement experiments, to demonstrate that ?S interacts directly with ?S in a transient dimer complex with high specificity and weak affinity. Inhibition of ?S by ?S arises from transient ?S/?S heterodimer species that exist primarily in head- to- tail configurations while ?S aggregation arises from a more heterogeneous and weaker range of transient interactions that include both head-to-head and head-to-tail configurations. Our results highlight that intrinsically disordered proteins can interact directly with one another at low affinity and that the transient interactions that drive inhibition versus aggregation are distinct by virtue of their plasticity and specificity.

4019311	19850501	Studies on the biosynthesis of carbapenem antibiotics. III. Enzymological characterization of the L-amino acid acylase activity of A933 acylase.	A933 acylase, which is involved in exchange of the pantothenyl substituent of OA-6129 carbapenems with acetyl CoA, was characterized as an L-amino acid acylase with a molecular weight of 100,000 (+/- 8,000) and a pI value of 5.1. The highest L-amino acid acylase activity of A933 acylase was observed at 37 degrees C and pH 7 approximately 7.5 for N-chloroacetyl-L-phenylalanine. Unlike other amino acid acylases, A933 acylase was severely inhibited by cobalt ions and p-chloromercuribenzoate. The acylase also showed peptidase activity with some di- and tripeptides. A protein fraction with A933 L-amino acid acylase activity from blocked mutant 1501 lacked OA-6129A-depantothenylating activity. 	J._Antibiot.	D016428
24382981	20140103	Applications of Bayesian gene selection and classification with mixtures of generalized singular g-priors.	Recent advancement in microarray technologies has led to a collection of an enormous number of genetic markers in disease association studies, and yet scientists are interested in selecting a smaller set of genes to explore the relation between genes and disease. Current approaches either adopt a single marker test which ignores the possible interaction among genes or consider a multistage procedure that reduces the large size of genes before evaluation of the association. Among the latter, Bayesian analysis can further accommodate the correlation between genes through the specification of a multivariate prior distribution and estimate the probabilities of association through latent variables. The covariance matrix, however, depends on an unknown parameter. In this research, we suggested a reference hyperprior distribution for such uncertainty, outlined the implementation of its computation, and illustrated this fully Bayesian approach with a colon and leukemia cancer study. Comparison with other existing methods was also conducted. The classification accuracy of our proposed model is higher with a smaller set of selected genes. The results not only replicated findings in several earlier studies, but also provided the strength of association with posterior probabilities. 	Comput_Math_Methods_Med	D016428 D013485
25486196	20141209	A cancer-associated mutation inactivates a region of the high-mobility group protein HMG20b essential for cytokinesis.	Defects in the completion of cell division by cytokinesis have long been proposed to foster carcinogenesis by engendering chromosome instability, but few tumor suppressor mechanisms controlling this process have so far been identified. Here, we identify a carboxyl (C)-terminal region of the high-mobility group protein HMG20b that is essential for cytokinesis, and report that it is inactivated by a cancer-associated mutation. We find that a C-terminal region of HMG20b spanning residues 173-317 is necessary and sufficient not only for its localization to cytokinetic structures, but also for its interaction with the tumor suppressor BRCA2, implicated in the abscission step of cytokinesis. Indeed, expression of this C-terminal HMG20b region suffices to restore cytokinesis in HMG20b-depleted cells. The non-conservative substitution of HMG20b residue Ala247 with Pro, reported in human lung cancer, disrupts these activities of HMG20b, impairing cytokinesis in a trans-dominant manner. Our findings provide fresh insight into the mechanism by which the HMG20b-BRCA2 complex controls mitotic cell division, and implicate heterozygous HMG20b mutations affecting cytokinesis regulation in the genesis of human cancers.

24717680	20140411	Occult HBV infection: a faceless enemy in liver cancer development.	The hepatitis B virus (HBV) represents a worldwide public health problem; the virus is present in one third of the global population. However, this rate may in fact be higher due to occult hepatitis B virus infection (OBI). This condition is characterized by the presence of the viral genome in the liver of individuals sero-negative for the virus surface antigen (HBsAg). The causes of the absence of HBsAg in serum are unknown, however, mutations have been identified that produce variants not recognized by current immunoassays. Epigenetic and immunological host mechanisms also appear to be involved in HBsAg suppression. Current evidence suggests that OBI maintains its carcinogenic potential, favoring the progression of fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver. In common with open HBV infection, OBI can contribute to the establishment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Epidemiological data regarding the global prevalence of OBI vary due to the use of detection methods of different sensitivity and specificity. In Latin America, which is considered an area of low prevalence for HBV, diagnostic screening methods using gene amplification tests for confirmation of OBI are not conducted. This prevents determination of the actual prevalence of OBI, highlighting the need for the implementation of cutting edge technology in epidemiological surveillance systems. 	Viruses	D016428 D016454

27012632	20160326	The polyphenol Oleuropein aglycone hinders the growth of toxic transthyretin amyloid assemblies.	Transthyretin (TTR) is involved in a subset of familial or sporadic amyloid diseases including senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA), familial amyloid polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy (FAP/FAC) for which no effective therapy has been found yet. These conditions are characterized by extracellular deposits primarily found in the heart parenchyma and in peripheral nerves whose main component are amyloid fibrils, presently considered the main culprits of cell sufferance. The latter are polymeric assemblies grown from misfolded TTR, either wt or carrying one out of many identified mutations. The recent introduction in the clinical practice of synthetic TTR-stabilizing molecules that reduce protein aggregation provides the rationale to search natural effective molecules able to interfere with TTR amyloid aggregation by hindering the appearance of toxic species or by favoring the growth of harmless aggregates. Here we carried out an in depth biophysical and morphological study on the molecular features of the aggregation of wt- and L55P-TTR involved in SSA or FAP/FAC, respectively, and on the interference with fibril aggregation, stability and toxicity to cardiac HL-1 cells to demonstrate the ability of Oleuropein aglycone (OleA), the main phenolic component of the extra virgin olive oil. We describe the molecular basis of such interference and the resulting reduction of TTR amyloid aggregate cytotoxicity. Our data offer the possibility to validate and optimize the use of OleA or its molecular scaffold to rationally design promising drugs against TTR-related pathologies that could enter a clinical experimental phase.

20363297	20100406	The parabrachial nucleus is a critical link in the transmission of short latency nociceptive information to midbrain dopaminergic neurons.	Many dopaminergic neurons exhibit a short-latency response to noxious stimuli, the source of which is unknown. Here we report that the nociceptive-recipient parabrachial nucleus appears to be a critical link in the transmission of pain related information to dopaminergic neurons. Injections of retrograde tracer into the substantia nigra pars compacta of the rat labelled neurons in both the lateral and medial parts of the parabrachial nucleus, and intra-parabrachial injections of anterograde tracers revealed robust projections to the pars compacta and ventral tegmental area. Axonal boutons were seen in close association with tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (presumed dopaminergic) and negative elements in these regions. Simultaneous extracellular recordings were made from parabrachial and dopaminergic neurons in the anaesthetized rat, during the application of noxious footshock. Parabrachial neurons exhibited a short-latency, short duration excitation to footshock while dopaminergic neurons exhibited a short-latency inhibition. Response latencies of dopaminergic neurons were reliably longer than those of parabrachial neurons. Intra-parabrachial injections of the local anaesthetic lidocaine or the GABA(A) receptor antagonist muscimol reduced tonic parabrachial activity and the amplitude (and in the case of lidocaine, duration) of the phasic response to footshock. Suppression of parabrachial activity with lidocaine reduced the baseline firing rate of dopaminergic neurons, while both lidocaine and muscimol reduced the amplitude of the phasic inhibitory response to footshock, in the case of lidocaine sometimes abolishing it altogether. Considered together, these results suggest that the parabrachial nucleus is an important source of short-latency nociceptive input to the dopaminergic neurons. 	Neuroscience	D016428 D013485

27688941	20161001	Long-term acclimatization to high-altitude hypoxia modifies interhemispheric functional and structural connectivity in the adult brain.	Structural and functional networks can be reorganized to adjust to environmental pressures and physiologic changes in the adult brain, but such processes remain unclear in prolonged adaptation to high-altitude (HA) hypoxia. This study aimed to characterize the interhemispheric functionally and structurally coupled modifications in the brains of adult HA immigrants. We performed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 16 adults who had immigrated to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (2300-4400?m) for 2?years and in 16 age-matched sea-level (SL) controls. A recently validated approach of voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) was employed to examine the interhemispheric resting-state functional connectivity. Areas showing changed VMHC in HA immigrants were selected as regions of interest for follow-up DTI tractography analysis. The fiber parameters of fractional anisotropy and fiber length were obtained. Cognitive and physiological assessments were made and correlated with the resulting image metrics. Compared with SL controls, VMHC in the bilateral visual cortex was significantly increased in HA immigrants. The mean VMHC value extracted within the visual cortex was positively correlated with hemoglobin concentration. Moreover, the path length of the commissural fibers connecting homotopic visual areas was increased in HA immigrants, covarying positively with VMHC. These observations are the first to demonstrate interhemispheric functional and structural connectivity resilience in the adult brain after prolonged HA acclimatization independent of inherited and developmental effects, and the coupled modifications in the bilateral visual cortex indicate important neural compensatory mechanisms underlying visual dysfunction in physiologically well-acclimatized HA immigrants. The study of human central adaptation to extreme environments promotes the understanding of our brain's capacity for survival. 	Brain_Behav	D016428
20200947	20100305	Osteocalcin gene polymorphisms influence concentration of serum osteocalcin and enhance fracture identification.	Osteoporosis is a major health problem affecting more than 75 million people throughout Europe, the United States, and Japan. Epidemiologic studies have determined that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. We have investigated the association between polymorphisms at the osteocalcin locus and variables linked to bone health. Osteocalcin provides a link between bone and energy metabolism, hence its potential importance as an osteoporosis candidate gene. In this study, we included a total of 996 women (all aged 75 years) from the Osteoporosis Prospective Risk Assessment (OPRA) cohort. We sequenced the osteocalcin gene along with flanking regions to search for novel coding polymorphisms. We also analyzed four polymorphisms selected from within and flanking regions of the osteocalcin gene to study their association with serum total osteocalcin levels (S-TotalOC), total-body (TB) bone mineral density (BMD), fracture, TB fat mass, and body mass index (BMI). The promoter polymorphism rs1800247 was significantly associated with S-TotalOC (p = .012) after controlling for BMI and TB BMD. The polymorphism rs1543297 was significantly associated with prospectively occurring fractures (p = .008). In a model taking into account rs1543297 and rs1800247, along with TB BMD, BMI, smoking, and S-TotalOC, the polymorphisms together were able to identify an additional 6% of women who sustained a fracture (p = .02). We found no association between the polymorphisms and TB BMD, BMI, or TB fat mass. In conclusion, polymorphisms in and around the osteocalcin locus are significantly associated with S-TotalOC and fracture. Genotyping at the osteocalcin locus could add valuable information in the identification of women at risk of osteoporosis. 	J._Bone_Miner._Res.	D016428 D013485
25311268	20141015	The anti-inflammatory peptide stearyl-norleucine-VIP delays disease onset and extends survival in a rat model of inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) has potent immune modulatory actions that may influence the course of neurodegenerative disorders associated with chronic inflammation. Here, we show the therapeutic benefits of a modified peptide agonist stearyl-norleucine-VIP (SNV) in a transgenic rat model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (mutated superoxide dismutase 1, hSOD1(G93A)). When administered by systemic every-other-day intraperitoneal injections during a period of 80 days before disease, SNV delayed the onset of motor dysfunction by no less than three weeks, while survival was extended by nearly two months. SNV-treated rats showed reduced astro- and microgliosis in the lumbar ventral spinal cord and a significant degree of motor neuron preservation. Throughout the treatment, SNV promoted the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 as well as neurotrophic factors commonly considered as beneficial in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis management (glial derived neuroptrophic factor, insulin like growth factor, brain derived neurotrophic factor). The peptide nearly totally suppressed the expression of tumor necrosis factor-? and repressed the production of the pro-inflammatory mediators interleukin-1?, nitric oxide and of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B. Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-? likely accounted for the observed down-regulation of nuclear factor kappa B that modulates the transcription of genes specifically involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sod1 and the glutamate transporter slc1a2). In line with this, levels of human superoxide dismutase 1 mRNA and protein were decreased by SNV treatment, while the expression and activity of the glutamate transporter-1 was promoted. Considering the large diversity of influences of this peptide on both clinical features of the disease and associated biochemical markers, we propose that SNV or related peptides may constitute promising candidates for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis treatment.

20816989	20100907	Carboxyl pK(a) values and acid denaturation of BBL.	The protein BBL undergoes structural transitions and acid denaturation between pH 1.2 and 8.0. Using NMR spectroscopy, we measured the pK(a) values of all the carboxylic residues in this pH range. We employed (13)C direct-detection two-dimensional IPAP (in-phase antiphase) CACO NMR spectroscopy to monitor the ionization state of different carboxylic groups and demonstrated its advantages over other NMR techniques in measuring pK(a) values of carboxylic residues. The two residues Glu161 and Asp162 had significantly lowered pK(a) values, showing that these residues are involved in a network of stabilizing electrostatic interactions, as is His166. The other carboxylates had unperturbed values. The pH dependence of the free energy of denaturation was described quantitatively by the ionizations of those three residues of perturbed pK(a), and, using thermodynamic cycles, we could calculate their pK(a)s in the native and denatured states as well as the equilibrium constants for denaturation of the different protonation states. We also measured (13)C(?) chemical shifts of individual residues as a function of pH. These shifts sense structural transitions rather than ionizations, and they titrated with pH consistent with the change in equilibrium constant for denaturation. Kinetic measurements of the folding of BBL E161Q indicated that, at pH 7, the stabilizing interactions with Glu161 are formed mainly in the transition state. We also found that local interactions still exist in the acid-denatured state of BBL, which attenuate somewhat the flexibility of the acid-denatured state. 	J._Mol._Biol.	D016428 D013485
18424453	20080422	Interaction between a novel TGFB1 haplotype and CFTR genotype is associated with improved lung function in cystic fibrosis.	Cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common lethal single gene disorder in Caucasians, is due to mutations in the CFTR gene. Twin and sibling analysis indicates that modifier genes, rather than allelic variation in CFTR, are responsible for most of the variability in severity of lung disease, the major cause of mortality in CF patients. We used a family-based approach to test for association between lung function and two functional SNPs (rs1800469, '-509' and rs1982073, 'codon 10') in the 5' region of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFB1), a putative CF modifier gene. Quantitative transmission disequilibrium testing of 472 CF patient-parent-parent trios revealed that both TGFB1 SNPs showed significant transmission distortion when patients were stratified by CFTR genotype. Although lung function and nutritional status are correlated in CF patients, there was no evidence of association between the TGFB1 SNPs and variation in nutritional status. Additional tagging SNPs (rs8179181, rs2278422, rs8110090, rs4803455 and rs1982072) that capture most of the diversity in TGFB1 were also typed but none showed association with variation in lung function. However, a haplotype composed of the -509 C and codon 10 T alleles along with the C allele of the 3' SNP rs8179181 was highly associated with increased lung function in patients grouped by CFTR genotype. These results demonstrate that TGFB1 is a modifier of CF lung disease and reveal a previously unrecognized beneficial effect of TGFB1 variants upon the pulmonary phenotype. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.

24167553	20131030	Functional analysis of deep intronic SNP rs13438494 in intron 24 of PCLO gene.	The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs13438494 in intron 24 of PCLO was significantly associated with bipolar disorder in a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies. In this study, we performed functional minigene analysis and bioinformatics prediction of splicing regulatory sequences to characterize the deep intronic SNP rs13438494. We constructed minigenes with A and C alleles containing exon 24, intron 24, and exon 25 of PCLO to assess the genetic effect of rs13438494 on splicing. We found that the C allele of rs13438494 reduces the splicing efficiency of the PCLO minigene. In addition, prediction analysis of enhancer/silencer motifs using the Human Splice Finder web tool indicated that rs13438494 induces the abrogation or creation of such binding sites. Our results indicate that rs13438494 alters splicing efficiency by creating or disrupting a splicing motif, which functions by binding of splicing regulatory proteins, and may ultimately result in bipolar disorder in affected people.

17318783	20070224	Schisandrol A from Schisandra chinensis reverses P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance by affecting Pgp-substrate complexes.	Recent studies have shown that dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans may reverse P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance (Pgp-MDR) in cancer cells; however, the mechanism of action remains unknown. Through screening of herbs, we found that schisandrol A (SCH) isolated from Fructus Schisandrae (the dried fruit of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill.) sensitized Pgp-MDR HepG2-DR cells by interfering with the function of Pgp-substrate complexes. In Pgp-MDR cells, SCH enhanced the cytotoxicity of cancer drugs that are Pgp substrates and restored vinblastine-induced G2/M arrest without lowering Pgp expression. SCH increased cellular retention of Pgp substrates such as rhodamine 123. In Pgp-overexpressing membrane preparations, SCH stimulated basal Pgp-ATPase thus showing some substrate-like function. However, SCH was not a competitive inhibitor for verapamil or progesterone and decreased their Km. In the presence of substrates, SCH decreased the reactivity between Pgp and the monoclonal antibody UIC-2 which is normally increased with active substrate-Pgp complexes. The labeling of active Pgp transport sites by [125I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin was partially blocked by SCH. SCH did not affect the activity of the mutant Pgp F983A suggesting that SCH acted differently than the thioxanthene type of Pgp allosteric inhibitors. Our results suggest that SCH acts by affecting the normal formation and functioning of the Pgp-substrate complexes. 	Planta_Med.	D016428 D052061
15876153	20050507	BRAF mutations are uncommon in papillary thyroid cancer of young patients.	Mortality is low for young patients (younger than 21 years) with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), and different mutations might contribute to this. Previous studies detected ret/PTC rearrangements more frequently in PTC from children than adults, and recent reports describe a high incidence of BRAF T1796A transversion in adult PTC. However, BRAF mutations have not been adequately studied in PTC from young patients. We amplified and sequenced segments of the BRAF gene spanning the T1796A transversion site in 14 PTC from patients 10-21 years of age (mean, 17.5 +/- 3.5 years). The PTC (7 = class 1; 5 = class 2; 1 = class 3) ranged from 0.7-2.9 cm in diameter (mean, 1.4 +/- 0.75 cm). None of them (0/14) contained BRAF T1796A and none recurred (mean follow-up, 66 +/- 40 months). This incidence of BRAF T1796A is significantly less than that reported for adult PTC (270/699, 38.6%, p = 0.0015) in several series. None of our PTC (0/10) contained ras mutations, but 7/12 (58%) contained ret/PTC rearrangements. We conclude that BRAF mutations are less common in PTC from young patients, and ret/PTC rearrangements were the most common mutation found in these childhood PTC. 	Thyroid	D016428 D013486
26945816	20160307	Brief Report: Peripheral Osteolysis in Adults Linked to ASAH1 (Acid Ceramidase) Mutations: A New Presentation of Farber's Disease.	To establish a diagnosis and provide counseling and treatment for 3 adult patients from one family presenting with peripheral osteolysis. Following clinical and radiographic assessment, exome sequencing, targeted gene resequencing, and determination of enzyme activity in cultured fibroblasts were performed. The proband (age 40 years) had a history of episodic fever and pain in childhood that subsided around puberty. He and 2 of his older sisters (ages 58 and 60 years, respectively) showed adult-onset progressive shortening of fingers and toes with redundancy of the overlying skin. Radiographs showed severe osteolysis of the distal radius and ulna, carpal bones, metacarpal bones, and phalanges. Sequencing of the known genes for recessively inherited osteolysis, MMP2 and MMP14, failed to show pathogenic mutations. Exome sequencing revealed compound heterozygosity for mutations c.505T&gt;C (p.Trp169Arg) and c.760A&gt;G (p.Arg254Gly) in ASAH1, the gene coding for acid ceramidase. Sanger sequencing confirmed correct segregation in the family, and enzyme activity in fibroblast cultures from the patients was reduced to ?8% of that in controls, confirming a diagnosis of Farber's disease. Our findings indicate that hypomorphic mutations in ASAH1 may result in an osteoarticular phenotype with a juvenile phase resembling rheumatoid arthritis that evolves to osteolysis as the final stage in the absence of neurologic signs. This observation delineates a novel type of recessively inherited peripheral osteolysis and illustrates the long-term skeletal manifestations of acid ceramidase deficiency (Farber's disease) in what appear to be the oldest affected individuals known so far.

23467456	20130308	XRCC1 Polymorphisms and Pancreatic Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.	To assess the association between X-ray repair cross-complementating group 1 (XRCC1) polymorphisms and pancreatic cancer. We searched MEDLINE, Web of Science and HuGE Navigator at June 2010, and then quantitatively summarized associations of the XRCC1 polymorphisms with pancreatic cancer risk using meta-analysis. Four studies with 1343 cases and 2302 controls were included. Our analysis found: at codon 194, the Trp allele did not decrease pancreatic cancer risk (Arg/Arg versus Trp/Trp: OR=0.97; 95% CI: 0.48-1.96; P=0.97; Arg/Arg versus Arg/Trp: OR=0.89; 95% CI: 0.70-1.13; P=0.55; Arg/Trp versus Trp/Trp: OR=1.06; 95% CI: 0.52-2.16; P=0.90); at codon 280, only a study showed a nonsignificant association between single nucleotide polymorphism with pancreatic cancer risk; at codon 399, the Gln allele also showed no signi?cant effect on pancreatic cancer compared to Arg allele (Arg/Arg versus Gln/Gln: OR=0.94; 95% CI: 0.74-1.18; Arg/Arg versus Arg/Gln: OR=0.97; 95% CI: 0.83-1.13; Arg/Gln versus Gln/Gln: OR=0.97; 95% CI: 0.77-1.22). The shape of the funnel plot and the Egger's test did not detect any publication bias. There is no evidence that XRCC1 polymorphisms (Arg194Trp, Arg280His, and Arg399Gln) are associated with pancreatic cancer risk. 	Chin._J._Cancer_Res.	D016428
15920103	20050528	Targeted disruption of transcriptional regulatory function of p53 by a novel efficient method for introducing a decoy oligonucleotide into nuclei.	Decoy oligonucleotides have been used for functional sequestering of transcription factors. Efficient introduction into cells is a prerequisite for the oligonucleotides to exert their blocking function. Lipofection is the most widely used technique for that purpose because of its convenience and relatively high efficiency. However, the transduction efficiency of lipofection largely depends on cell types and experimental conditions and the introduced nucleotides are not specifically directed to nuclei where they exert their major function. In the present study, we designed a new system for transporting oligonucleotides into cell nuclei. The vehicle is composed of glutathione-S-transferase, 7 arginine residues, the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 and a nuclear localization signal, which are linked with flexible glycine stretches. The p53-responsive element linked to the GAL4 upstream activating sequence was efficiently transferred by the vehicle protein into nuclei of primary cultures of neuronal cells, embryonic stem cells and various human normal cells. Transcriptional activation of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and Bax by p53 on exposure to cisplatin was completely blocked by introducing the p53 decoy oligonucleotide. Thus, the system developed in the present study can be a convenient and powerful tool for specifically disrupting the function of DNA-binding proteins in culture. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D013485
26508020	20151029	Potential involvement of NET polymorphism in serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor response in panic disorder.	This is a pilot study assessing the impact of polymorphisms of serotonin transporter (5-HTT; 5-HTTLPR (S/L)) and norepinephrine transporter (NET; rs2242446 (T/C)) genes on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) response in Korean panic disorder (PD) patients. PD patients were treated with SSRI (n?=?18) or SNRI (n?=?6) for 4 weeks. Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) was rated to evaluate the treatment response. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare PDSS scores before and after medication (SSRI or SNRI) as well as to compare those according to genotypes. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare those between the two groups (SSRI or SNRI). Both SSRI and SNRI treatments for 4 weeks significantly reduced PDSS scores. We assessed the impact of rs2242446 on this effect of SSRI and SNRI. The scores were significantly decreased after 4 weeks in the SSRI-treated group regardless of genotypes of rs2242446, whereas they were significantly decreased in the SNRI-treated group with only non-C carrier (TT) of rs2242446. On 5-HTTLPR we could not analyse because 22 patients had SS genotype. These results suggest that NET polymorphism may affect the SNRI response in Korean PD patients.

18983675	20081106	Induction of multiple pleiotropic drug resistance genes in yeast engineered to produce an increased level of anti-malarial drug precursor, artemisinic acid.	Due to the global occurrence of multi-drug-resistant malarial parasites (Plasmodium falciparum), the anti-malarial drug most effective against malaria is artemisinin, a natural product (sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide) extracted from sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua). However, artemisinin is in short supply and unaffordable to most malaria patients. Artemisinin can be semi-synthesized from its precursor artemisinic acid, which can be synthesized from simple sugars using microorganisms genetically engineered with genes from A. annua. In order to develop an industrially competent yeast strain, detailed analyses of microbial physiology and development of gene expression strategies are required. Three plant genes coding for amorphadiene synthase, amorphadiene oxidase (AMO or CYP71AV1), and cytochrome P450 reductase, which in concert divert carbon flux from farnesyl diphosphate to artemisinic acid, were expressed from a single plasmid. The artemisinic acid production in the engineered yeast reached 250 microg mL(-1) in shake-flask cultures and 1 g L(-1) in bio-reactors with the use of Leu2d selection marker and appropriate medium formulation. When plasmid stability was measured, the yeast strain synthesizing amorphadiene alone maintained the plasmid in 84% of the cells, whereas the yeast strain synthesizing artemisinic acid showed poor plasmid stability. Inactivation of AMO by a point-mutation restored the high plasmid stability, indicating that the low plasmid stability is not caused by production of the AMO protein but by artemisinic acid synthesis or accumulation. Semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR and quantitative real time-PCR consistently showed that pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) genes, belonging to the family of ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter, were massively induced in the yeast strain producing artemisinic acid, relative to the yeast strain producing the hydrocarbon amorphadiene alone. Global transcriptional analysis by yeast microarray further demonstrated that the induction of drug-resistant genes such as ABC transporters and major facilitator superfamily (MSF) genes is the primary cellular stress-response; in addition, oxidative and osmotic stress responses were observed in the engineered yeast. The data presented here suggest that the engineered yeast producing artemisinic acid suffers oxidative and drug-associated stresses. The use of plant-derived transporters and optimizing AMO activity may improve the yield of artemisinic acid production in the engineered yeast. 	BMC_Biotechnol.	D016428 D013485

9639573	19980626	cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase HSPDE4D3 mutants which mimic activation and changes in rolipram inhibition triggered by protein kinase A phosphorylation of Ser-54: generation of a molecular model.	Ser-13 and Ser-54 were shown to provide the sole sites for the protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of the human cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoform HSPDE4D3. The ability of PKA to phosphorylate and activate HSPDE4D3 was mimicked by replacing Ser-54 with either of the negatively charged amino acids, aspartate or glutamate, within the consensus motif of RRES54. The PDE4 selective inhibitor rolipram ?4-[3-(cyclopentoxy)-4-methoxyphenyl]-2-pyrrolidone? inhibited both PKA-phosphorylated HSPDE4D3 and the Ser-54--&gt;Asp mutant, with an IC50 value that was approximately 8-fold lower than that seen for the non-PKA-phosphorylated enzyme. Lower IC50 values for inhibition by rolipram were seen for a wide range of non-activated residue 54 mutants, except for those which had side-chains able to serve as hydrogen-bond donors, namely the Ser-54--&gt;Thr, Ser-54--&gt;Tyr and Ser-54--&gt;Cys mutants. The Glu-53--&gt;Ala mutant exhibited an activity comparable with that of the PKA phosphorylated native enzyme and the Ser-54--&gt;Asp mutant but, in contrast to the native enzyme, was insensitive to activation by PKA, despite being more rapidly phosphorylated by this protein kinase. The activated Glu-53--&gt;Ala mutant exhibited a sensitivity to inhibition by rolipram which was unchanged from that of the native enzyme. The double mutant, Arg-51--&gt;Ala/Arg-52--&gt;Ala, showed no change in either enzyme activity or rolipram inhibition from the native enzyme and was incapable of providing a substrate for PKA phosphorylation at Ser-54. No difference in inhibition by dipyridamole was seen for the native enzyme and the Ser-54--&gt;Asp and Ser-54--&gt;Ala mutants. A model is proposed which envisages that phosphorylation by PKA triggers at least two distinct conformational changes in HSPDE4D3; one of these gives rise to enzyme activation and another enhances sensitivity to inhibition by rolipram. Activation of HSPDE4D3 by PKA-mediated phosphorylation is suggested to involve disruption of an ion-pair interaction involving the negatively charged Glu-53. The increase in susceptibility to inhibition by rolipram upon PKA-mediated phosphorylation is suggested to involve the disruption of a hydrogen-bond involving the side-chain hydroxy group of Ser-54.

12787669	20030606	Catalytic mechanism of DNA-(cytosine-C5)-methyltransferases revisited: covalent intermediate formation is not essential for methyl group transfer by the murine Dnmt3a enzyme.	Co-transfections of reporter plasmids and plasmids encoding the catalytic domain of the murine Dnmt3a DNA methyltransferase lead to inhibition of reporter gene expression. As Dnmt3a mutants with C--&gt;A and E--&gt;A exchanges in the conserved PCQ and ENV motifs in the catalytic center of the enzyme also cause repression, we checked for their catalytic activity in vitro. Surprisingly, the activity of the cysteine variant and of the corresponding full-length Dnmt3a variant is only two to sixfold reduced with respect to wild-type Dnmt3a. In contrast, enzyme variants carrying E--&gt;A, E--&gt;D or E--&gt;Q exchanges of the ENV glutamate are catalytically almost inactive, demonstrating that this residue has a central function in catalysis. Since the glutamic acid residue contacts the flipped base, its main function could be to hold the target base at a position that supports methyl group transfer. Whereas wild-type Dnmt3a and the ENV variants form covalent complexes with 5-fluorocytidine modified DNA, the PCN variant does not. Therefore, covalent complex formation is not essential in the reaction mechanism of Dnmt3a. We propose that correct positioning of the flipped base and the cofactor and binding to the transition state of methyl group transfer are the most important roles of the Dnmt3a enzyme in the catalytic cycle of methyl group transfer.

22659414	20120605	A molecular dynamics investigation on the crizotinib resistance mechanism of C1156Y mutation in ALK.	Crizotinib is an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor that has recently been approved in the US for the treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Despite its outstanding safety and efficacy, several resistant mutations against crizotinib have been detected in the treatment of NSCLC. However, in contrast to the widely accepted mechanism of steric hindrance by mutations at the active site, the mechanism by which the C1156Y non-active site mutation confers resistance against crizotinib remains unclear. In the present study, the resistance mechanism of C1156Y in ALK was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. The results suggest that despite the non-active site mutation, C1156Y causes the dislocation of crizotinib as well as the indirect conformational changes in the binding cavity, which results in a marked decrease in the van der Waals and electrostatic interactions between crizotinib and ALK. The obtained results provide a detailed explanation of the resistance caused by C1156Y and may give a vital clue for the design of drugs to combat crizotinib resistance.

22299590	20120204	Mutation analysis of the CFTR gene in 225 children: identification of five novel severe and seven reported severe mutations.	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited disorder in Caucasian populations, with more than 1400 cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutations. The type of mutations and their distributions varies widely between different countries and/or ethnic groups. We characterized the mutations in the CFTR gene by single-strand conformation polymorphism followed by sequencing in CF patients. Twelve mutations were found in 79/225 (35.1%) patients. The most frequent mutations were F508 deletion (31.1%), p.R1162? (2.2%), p.M1T (0.8%), and S559N (0.8%). Five novel severe mutations (p.R80N11fs*11, p.R75G, p.Y577?, p.Y808Yfs*10, and p.I331?) and three reported mutations (p.C343?, p.Ile1000?, p.M469V) were detected. The protocol for identification of mutations in cases of CF in developing countries would have to include a different set of mutations than those reported from western countries.

22210891	20120103	Crystal structure of human polynucleotide phosphorylase: insights into its domain function in RNA binding and degradation.	Human polynucleotide phosphorylase (hPNPase) is a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease that degrades specific mRNA and miRNA, and imports RNA into mitochondria, and thus regulates diverse physiological processes, including cellular senescence and homeostasis. However, the RNA-processing mechanism by hPNPase, particularly how RNA is bound via its various domains, remains obscure. Here, we report the crystal structure of an S1 domain-truncated hPNPase at a resolution of 2.1??. The trimeric hPNPase has a hexameric ring-like structure formed by six RNase PH domains, capped with a trimeric KH pore. Our biochemical and mutagenesis studies suggest that the S1 domain is not critical for RNA binding, and conversely, that the conserved GXXG motif in the KH domain directly participates in RNA binding in hPNPase. Our studies thus provide structural and functional insights into hPNPase, which uses a KH pore to trap a long RNA 3' tail that is further delivered into an RNase PH channel for the degradation process. Structural RNA with short 3' tails are, on the other hand, transported but not digested by hPNPase. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D013485
25848976	20150408	Association of Common Genetic Polymorphisms with Melanoma Patient IL-12p40 Blood Levels, Risk, and Outcomes.	Recent investigation has identified association of IL-12p40 blood levels with melanoma recurrence and patient survival. No studies have investigated associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with melanoma patient IL-12p40 blood levels or their potential contributions to melanoma susceptibility or patient outcome. In the current study, 818,237 SNPs were available for 1,804 melanoma cases and 1,026 controls. IL-12p40 blood levels were assessed among 573 cases (discovery), 249 cases (case validation), and 299 controls (control validation). SNPs were evaluated for association with log[IL-12p40] levels in the discovery data set and replicated in two validation data sets, and significant SNPs were assessed for association with melanoma susceptibility and patient outcomes. The most significant SNP associated with log[IL-12p40] was in the IL-12B gene region (rs6897260, combined P=9.26 ? 10(-38)); this single variant explained 13.1% of variability in log[IL-12p40]. The most significant SNP in EBF1 was rs6895454 (combined P=2.24 ? 10(-9)). A marker in IL12B was associated with melanoma susceptibility (rs3213119, multivariate P=0.0499; OR=1.50, 95% CI 1.00-2.24), whereas a marker in EBF1 was associated with melanoma-specific survival in advanced-stage patients (rs10515789, multivariate P=0.02; HR=1.93, 95% CI 1.11-3.35). Both EBF1 and IL12B strongly regulate IL-12p40 blood levels, and IL-12p40 polymorphisms may contribute to melanoma susceptibility and influence patient outcome. 	J._Invest._Dermatol.

16615810	20060418	Conformations of higher gangliosides and their binding with cholera toxin - investigation by molecular modeling, molecular mechanics, and molecular dynamics.	Molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics studies are performed to investigate the conformational preference of cell surface higher gangliosides (GT1A and GT1B) and their interaction with Cholera Toxin. The water mediated hydrogen bonding network exists between sugar residues in gangliosides. An integrated molecular modeling, molecular mechanics, and molecular dynamics calculation of cholera toxin complexed with GT1A and GT1B reveal that, the active site of cholera toxin can accommodate these higher gangliosides. Direct and water mediated hydrogen bonding interactions stabilize these binding modes and play an essential role in defining the order of specificity for different higher ganglioside towards cholera toxin. This study identifies that the binding site of cholera toxin is shallow and can accommodate a maximum of two NeuNAc residues. The NeuNAc binding site of cholera toxin may be crucial for the design of inhibitors that can prevent the infection of cholera. 	J._Biomol._Struct._Dyn.	D016428
16613739	20060415	Kinetics and activity of arylsulfatase A in leukocytes derived from patients with cerebral palsy.	Activity and kinetics of arylsulfatase A (ASA, EC 3.1.6.8) were analyzed in leukocyte homogenates derived from patients suffering from cerebral palsy. Lower ASA activity was found in the patients' leukocytes than in controls, as determined by spectrophotometry using chromogenic substrate p-nitrocatechol sulfate (p-NCS). Kinetic parameters, K(m) and v(max), for leukocyte ASA were determined from the dependence of initial reaction velocities on the p-NCS concentrations. A slight difference in K(m) values was found for leukocyte enzyme in cerebral palsy (0.26 mmol L(-1)) compared to the control (0.21 mmol L(-1)), whereas v(max) value for leukocyte ASA in disease reached only 58% of the control value. In addition, the presence of the most common mutations associated with ASA pseudo-deficiency (N350S, 1524+95 A&gt;G) and metachromatic leukodystrophy (P426L) was detected in all investigated patients. Changes in activity and kinetic parameters of leukocyte ASA in cerebral palsy are most probably related to the decrease of enzyme concentration; the detected mutations might at least partially contribute to the observed changes.

27087054	20160419	Impact of FokI (rs10735810) and BsmI (rs1544410) on Treatment of Chronic HCV Patients With Genotype 4.	Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a huge problem both globally and at the level of the individual patient. Our aim is to detect the influence of vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms (BsmI and Fok1) and vitamin D level in HCV patients under treatment with interferon. Blood samples were taken from 103 HCV patients all of them are genotype 4. They were divided into responders (n = 63) and nonresponders (n = 40) according to their response to interferon treatment. Also 120 subjects with matched age and sex were enrolled as controls. All subjects were subjected to history taking, general examination, liver function tests, hepatitis markers, HCV quantitation by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA extraction from whole blood, PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for genotyping, and quantitation of vitamin D level by ELISA. There were significant differences between responders and nonresponders in the mean values of vitamin D (P = 0.001) as well as the prevalence of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) BsmI (Bb) (P = 0.02). Meanwhile, no significant differences in Fok1 genotype between responders and nonresponders to interferon therapy of HCV patients in all genotypes [FF, Ff, ff) (P = 0.34, 0.091, and 0.43), respectively. BsmI and vitamin D level in chronic liver disease patients are predictors of response to combination therapy of HCV. 	J._Clin._Lab._Anal.	D016428
1778436	19911115	Degradation by Streptomyces viridosporus T7A of plant material grown under elevated CO2 conditions.	The biodegradability of plant material derived from wheat grown under different concentrations of atmospheric CO2 was investigated using the lignocarbohydrate solubilising actinomycete, Streptomyces viridosporus. Growth of S. viridosporus and solubilisation of lignocarbohydrate were highest when wheat grown at ambient CO2 concentrations (350 ppm) was used as C-source. Growth of S. viridosporus and solubilisation were reduced when the plant material was derived from wheat grown at 645 ppm CO2. The results suggest that modifications in plant structure occur when wheat is grown under conditions of elevated atmospheric CO2 which make it more resistant to microbial digestion.

1373334	19920415	Expressed full-length von Willebrand factor containing missense mutations linked to type IIB von Willebrand disease shows enhanced binding to platelets.	von Willebrand disease (vWD) variant type IIB is an inherited bleeding disorder resulting from the spontaneous binding of defective von Willebrand factor (vWF) to platelets in vivo. To identify the molecular basis for type IIB vWD, we used reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction to examine the nucleotide sequence of the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib-binding domain encoded by the vWF messenger RNA in an affected family, and in an unrelated affected individual. We identified two different missense mutations linked with expression of type IIB vWD. These mutations, which lead to Pro574----Leu and Val553----Met substitutions, respectively, were each introduced into the full-length vWF expression vector pvW198, and both wild-type (wt) and mutant vWF were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Binding assays showed that both mutant proteins showed significant non-ristocetin-dependent spontaneous binding to platelets, and that complete binding was induced by low concentrations of ristocetin that failed to induce platelet binding by wt vWF. The vWF/platelet interaction was inhibited by the anti-vWF monoclonal antibody (MoAb) AvW3, and the anti-GPIb MoAb AP1, which both block vWF binding to platelets. These results show that the identified missense mutations are the likely basis for the expression of type IIB vWD in these affected individuals. 	Blood	D002363 D016428 D013485 D013487
18234278	20080201	Prostatic adenocarcinoma in colorectal biopsy: clinical and pathologic features.	Locally advanced prostate carcinoma (PCa) can involve adjacent colorectal tissue. In such cases, accurate assignment of primary source may prove difficult. Given the difference in treatment and prognosis between PCa and colorectal carcinoma (CRCa), an accurate diagnosis is crucial. Surgical pathology files were searched for all cases with a diagnosis of PCa on colorectal biopsy between 1987 and 2006. Histologic and clinical data were available in 23 of the 30 found cases. The diagnosis of PCa was made for the first time at the time of the colorectal presentation in 4 men. Three of the 4 underwent colectomy. Among the remaining 19 men with a previously documented diagnosis of PCa, the overall clinical and endoscopic impression still favored a second primary CRCa in 12 patients. The latter was due in part to the chronologically distant prior PCa diagnosis (mean, 6.9 years; range, 2-18 years). None of the colorectal biopsies demonstrated carcinoma in situ or dysplastic colonic mucosa. PCa architecture in the colonic biopsies was that of Gleason score of 9 to 10 in 20 cases and Gleason score of 8 in the remaining 3. Cribriform or microacinar architecture typical of PCa was seen in 6 cases. Immunostains were positive for prostate-specific antigen, P501S (prostein), prostate-specific membrane antigen, and prostate-specific acid phosphatase, in 16 of 20, 9 of 11, 10 of 11, and 10 of 20 cases, respectively. Three cases lacked immunohistochemical evidence of prostatic differentiation. Caudal-type homebox transcription factor 2 (CDX2) and beta-catenin were negative in all tested cases (0/11 for both). Although relatively rare, initial presentation of PCa as a rectal lesion may lead to an erroneous clinical and or histologic impression of CRCa. Because history of prostate cancer is often remote, clinical findings may be misleading. Pathologists should consider the possibility of prostatic origin in poorly differentiated carcinoma encountered on colorectal biopsy when features such as lack of an in situ component, extrinsic pattern of involvement, microacinar or solid architecture, and/or prominent nucleoli, are noted, especially in the absence of nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic activity. Immunohistochemical studies could help establish the diagnosis. 	Hum._Pathol.	D016428
26666919	20151216	Comparison of Verona Integron-Borne Metallo-?-Lactamase (VIM) Variants Reveals Differences in Stability and Inhibition Profiles.	Metallo-?-lactamases (MBLs) are of increasing clinical significance; the development of clinically useful MBL inhibitors is challenged by the rapid evolution of variant MBLs. The Verona integron-borne metallo-?-lactamase (VIM) enzymes are among the most widely distributed MBLs, with &gt;40 VIM variants having been reported. We report on the crystallographic analysis of VIM-5 and comparison of biochemical and biophysical properties of VIM-1, VIM-2, VIM-4, VIM-5, and VIM-38. Recombinant VIM variants were produced and purified, and their secondary structure and thermal stabilities were investigated by circular dichroism analyses. Steady-state kinetic analyses with a representative panel of ?-lactam substrates were carried out to compare the catalytic efficiencies of the VIM variants. Furthermore, a set of metalloenzyme inhibitors were screened to compare their effects on the different VIM variants. The results reveal only small variations in the kinetic parameters of the VIM variants but substantial differences in their thermal stabilities and inhibition profiles. Overall, these results support the proposal that protein stability may be a factor in MBL evolution and highlight the importance of screening MBL variants during inhibitor development programs.

27403804	20160713	Rosette-Disrupting Effect of an Anti-Plasmodial Compound for the Potential Treatment of Plasmodium falciparum Malaria Complications.	The spread of artemisinin-resistant parasites could lead to higher incidence of patients with malaria complications. However, there are no current treatments that directly dislodge sequestered parasites from the microvasculature. We show that four common antiplasmodial drugs do not disperse rosettes (erythrocyte clusters formed by malaria parasites) and therefore develop a cell-based high-throughput assay to identify potential rosette-disrupting compounds. A pilot screen of 2693 compounds identified Malaria Box compound MMV006764 as a potential candidate. Although it reduced rosetting by a modest 20%, MMV006764 was validated to be similarly effective against both blood group O and A rosettes of three laboratory parasite lines. Coupled with its antiplasmodial activity and drug-likeness, MMV006764 represents the first small-molecule compound that disrupts rosetting and could potentially be used in a resource-limited setting to treat patients deteriorating rapidly from malaria complications. Such dual-action drugs that simultaneously restore microcirculation and reduce parasite load could significantly reduce malaria morbidity and mortality. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
25122067	20140815	The CDK4/6 inhibitor LY2835219 overcomes vemurafenib resistance resulting from MAPK reactivation and cyclin D1 upregulation.	B-RAF selective inhibitors, including vemurafenib, were recently developed as effective therapies for melanoma patients with B-RAF V600E mutation. However, most patients treated with vemurafenib eventually develop resistance largely due to reactivation of MAPK signaling. Inhibitors of MAPK signaling, including MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib, failed to show significant clinical benefit in patients with acquired resistance to vemurafenib. Here, we describe that cell lines with acquired resistance to vemurafenib show reactivation of MAPK signaling and upregulation of cyclin D1 and are sensitive to inhibition of LY2835219, a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6. LY2835219 was demonstrated to inhibit growth of melanoma A375 tumor xenografts and delay tumor recurrence in combination with vemurafenib. Furthermore, we developed an in vivo vemurafenib-resistant model by continuous administration of vemurafenib in A375 xenografts. Consistently, we found that MAPK is reactivated and cyclin D1 is elevated in vemurafenib-resistant tumors, as well as in the resistant cell lines derived from these tumors. Importantly, LY2835219 exhibited tumor growth regression in a vemurafenib-resistant model. Mechanistic analysis revealed that LY2835219 induced apoptotic cell death in a concentration-dependent manner in vemurafenib-resistant cells whereas it primarily mediated cell-cycle G1 arrest in the parental cells. Similarly, RNAi-mediated knockdown of cyclin D1 induced significantly higher rate of apoptosis in the resistant cells than in parental cells, suggesting that elevated cyclin D1 activity is important for the survival of vemurafenib-resistant cells. Altogether, we propose that targeting cyclin D1-CDK4/6 signaling by LY2835219 is an effective strategy to overcome MAPK-mediated resistance to B-RAF inhibitors in B-RAF V600E melanoma.

12848342	20030710	Putative functions of nucleoside diphosphate kinase in plants and fungi.	The putative functions of NDP (nucleoside diaphosphate) kinases from various organisms focusing to fungi and plants are described. The biochemical reactions catalyzed by NDP kinase are as follows. (i) Phosphotransferring activity from mainly ATP to cognate NDPs generating nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). (ii) Autophosphorylation activity from ATP and GTP. (iii) Protein kinase (phosphotransferring) activity phosphorylating such as myelin basic protein. NDP kinase could function to provide NTPs as a housekeeping enzyme. However, recent works proved possible functions of the NDP kinases in the processes of signal transduction in various organisms, as described below. 1) By use of the extracts of the mycelia of a filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa blue-light irradiation could increase the phosphorylation of a 15-kDa protein, which was purified and identified to be NDP kinase (NDK-1). By use of the etiolated seedlings of Pisum sativum cv Alaska and Oryza sativa red-light irradiation of intact plants increased the phosphorylation of NDP kinase. However, successive irradiation by red-far-red reversed the reaction, indicating that phytochrome-mediated light signals are transduced to the phosphorylation of NDP kinase. 2) NDP kinase localizing in mitochondria is encoded by nuclear genome and different from those localized in cytoplasm. NDP kinase in mitochondria formed a complex with succinyl CoA synthetase. 3) In Spinicia oleraceae two different NDP kinases were detected in the chloroplast, and in Pisum sativum two forms of NDP kinase originated from single species of mRNA could be detected in the choloroplast. However, the function of NDP kinases in the choloroplast is not yet known. 4) In Neurospora crassa a Pro72His mutation in NDP kinase (ndk-1Pro72His) deficient in the autophosphorylation and protein kinase activity resulted in lacking the light-induced polarity of perithecia. In wild-type directional light irradiation parallel to the solid medium resulted in the formation of the perithecial beak at the top of perithecia, which was designated as &quot;light-induced polarity of perithecia.&quot; In wild-type in darkness the beak was formed at random places on perithecia, and in ndkPro72His mutant the perithecial beak was formed at random places even under directional light illumination. The introduction of genomic DNA and cDNA for ndk-1 demonstrated that the wild-type DNAs suppressed the mutant phenotype. With all these results except for the demonstration in Neurospora, most of the phenomena are elusive and should be solved in the molecular levels concerning with NDP kinases. 	J._Bioenerg._Biomembr.

16504169	20060301	Genetic variation in the myeloperoxidase gene and cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis.	There is evidence that multiple sclerosis (MS) may associated with cognitive impairment in 25 to 40% of cases. The gene encoding myeloperoxidase (MPO) is involved in molecular pathways leading to beta-amyloid deposition. We investigated a functional biallelic (G/A) polymorphism in the promoter region (-463) of the MPO gene in 465 patients affected by MS, divided into 204 cognitively normal and 261 impaired. We did not find significant differences in allele or genotype distributions between impaired and preserved MS patients. Our findings suggest that MPO polymorphism is not a risk factor for cognitive impairment in MS. 	J_Negat_Results_Biomed	D016428
24874575	20140531	PADI4 acts as a coactivator of Tal1 by counteracting repressive histone arginine methylation.	The transcription factor Tal1 is a critical activator or repressor of gene expression in hematopoiesis and leukaemia. The mechanism by which Tal1 differentially influences transcription of distinct genes is not fully understood. Here we show that Tal1 interacts with the peptidylarginine deiminase IV (PADI4). We demonstrate that PADI4 can act as an epigenetic coactivator through influencing H3R2me2a. At the Tal1/PADI4 target gene IL6ST the repressive H3R2me2a mark triggered by PRMT6 is counteracted by PADI4, which augments the active H3K4me3 mark and thus increases IL6ST expression. In contrast, at the CTCF promoter PADI4 acts as a repressor. We propose that the influence of PADI4 on IL6ST transcription plays a role in the control of IL6ST expression during lineage differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. These results open the possibility to pharmacologically influence Tal1 in leukaemia. 	Nat_Commun	D016428 D013485

16716203	20060524	Investigation of A218C tryptophan hydroxylase polymorphism: association with familial suicide behavior and proband's suicide attempt characteristics.	According to WHO, suicide accounts for about 1,000,000 deaths worldwide every year. In view of these dramatic data, several studies have tried to identify possible biological mechanisms and markers of suicide. Genes encoding for proteins involved in the serotonergic transmission are major candidates in association studies of suicidal behavior. The gene that codes for tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of serotonin, is one of these candidates. Two polymorphisms in intron 7 of this gene (A218C and A779C) have been described, but their role in suicidal behavior remains uncertain. TPH A218C polymorphism was analyzed in a sample of 248 psychiatric patients and 63 healthy controls. In addition, at least one close relative member was interviewed to assess family suicidal behavior history. Our research confirmed that a positive history of suicide attempts in a family member is associated with the chance of an individual to attempt suicide. Furthermore, we demonstrated that familial suicide attempts are more lethal and frequently more violent. We were not able to find significant differences of the TPH genotype frequencies between patients and controls. The TPH A218C genotypes were not associated with a history of suicide attempt and the lethality of the most lethal lifetime suicide attempt and suicide attempt method. The authors conclude that the A218C polymorphism of the TPH gene may not be a susceptibility factor for suicidal behavior in this group of psychiatric patients but confirm that a family suicidal behavior history increases the proband's suicide attempt risk.

20195531	20100303	Geographic structuring of the Plasmodium falciparum sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (PfSERCA) gene diversity.	Artemisinin, a thapsigargin-like sesquiterpene has been shown to inhibit the Plasmodium falciparum sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase PfSERCA. To collect baseline pfserca sequence information before field deployment of Artemisinin-based Combination therapies that may select mutant parasites, we conducted a sequence analysis of 100 isolates from multiple sites in Africa, Asia and South America. Coding sequence diversity was large, with 29 mutated codons, including 32 SNPs (average of one SNP/115 bp), of which 19 were novel mutations. Most SNP detected in this study were clustered within a region in the cytosolic head of the protein. The PfSERCA functional domains were very well conserved, with non synonymous mutations located outside the functional domains, except for the S769N mutation associated in French Guiana with elevated IC(50) for artemether. The S769N mutation is located close to the hinge of the headpiece, which in other species modulates calcium affinity and in consequence efficacy of inhibitors, possibly linking calcium homeostasis to drug resistance. Genetic diversity was highest in Senegal, Brazil and French Guiana, and few mutations were identified in Asia. Population genetic analysis was conducted for a partial fragment of the gene encompassing nucleotide coordinates 87-2862 (unambiguous sequence available for 96 isolates). This supported a geographic clustering, with a separation between Old and New World samples and one dominant ancestral haplotype. Genetic drift alone cannot explain the observed polymorphism, suggesting that other evolutionary mechanisms are operating. One possible contributor could be the frequency of haemoglobinopathies that are associated with calcium dysregulation in the erythrocyte. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
12679463	20030408	Effect of the Pro12Ala polymorphism in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma2 gene on the expression of PPARgamma target genes in adipose tissue of massively obese subjects.	The aim was to study the effect of the Pro12Ala polymorphism of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma2 gene on the expression of PPARgamma target genes in adipose tissue. Adipose tissue samples were collected from 30 massively obese subjects (10 men and 20 women) from omental, sc abdominal, and femoral depots. The mRNA expression of PPARgamma1, PPARgamma2, lipoprotein lipase, p85alpha phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and uncoupling protein 2 were quantified by reverse transcription-competitive PCR. The genotypes of Pro12Ala polymorphism were determined by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. The frequency of the Ala12 allele was 13.3% (8 Pro12Ala and 22 Pro12Pro). There were no differences in body weight, fat mass, and fasting serum leptin between the genotypes. The mRNA expression of p85alpha phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was significantly lower in the omental fat of the Pro12Ala carriers than the Pro12Pro carriers (P &lt; 0.01). It also appeared that PPARgamma2 expression was higher in men with Ala12 allele (P &lt; 0.01). Interestingly, particularly in women, the expression of both PPARgamma splice variants was lower in omental than sc fat independently of the genotype (P &lt; 0.05-0.01). The common Pro12Ala polymorphism of the PPARgamma2 gene has minor influence on mRNA expression of PPARgamma target genes in adipose tissue of obese subjects. Expression of both PPARgamma splice variants is dependent on fat depot: omental fat shows lower mRNA levels, compared with sc fat depots. 	J._Clin._Endocrinol._Metab.	D003160 D016428 D013485
27385332	20160708	Comparative assessment of fluorescent proteins for in vivo imaging in an animal model system.	Fluorescent protein tags are fundamental tools used to visualize gene products and analyze their dynamics in vivo. Recent advances in genome editing have expedited the precise insertion of fluorescent protein tags into the genomes of diverse organisms. These advances expand the potential of in vivo imaging experiments and facilitate experimentation with new, bright, photostable fluorescent proteins. Most quantitative comparisons of the brightness and photostability of different fluorescent proteins have been made in vitro, removed from biological variables that govern their performance in cells or organisms. To address the gap, we quantitatively assessed fluorescent protein properties in vivo in an animal model system. We generated transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans strains expressing green, yellow, or red fluorescent proteins in embryos and imaged embryos expressing different fluorescent proteins under the same conditions for direct comparison. We found that mNeonGreen was not as bright in vivo as predicted based on in vitro data but is a better tag than GFP for specific kinds of experiments, and we report on optimal red fluorescent proteins. These results identify ideal fluorescent proteins for imaging in vivo in C. elegans embryos and suggest good candidate fluorescent proteins to test in other animal model systems for in vivo imaging experiments.

24101894	20131009	How do astrocytes shape synaptic transmission? Insights from electrophysiology.	A major breakthrough in neuroscience has been the realization in the last decades that the dogmatic view of astroglial cells as being merely fostering and buffering elements of the nervous system is simplistic. A wealth of investigations now shows that astrocytes actually participate in the control of synaptic transmission in an active manner. This was first hinted by the intimate contacts glial processes make with neurons, particularly at the synaptic level, and evidenced using electrophysiological and calcium imaging techniques. Calcium imaging has provided critical evidence demonstrating that astrocytic regulation of synaptic efficacy is not a passive phenomenon. However, given that cellular activation is not only represented by calcium signaling, it is also crucial to assess concomitant mechanisms. We and others have used electrophysiological techniques to simultaneously record neuronal and astrocytic activity, thus enabling the study of multiple ionic currents and in depth investigation of neuro-glial dialogues. In the current review, we focus on the input such approach has provided in the understanding of astrocyte-neuron interactions underlying control of synaptic efficacy.

9322529	19971010	Diterpenoids from germander, an herbal medicine, induce apoptosis in isolated rat hepatocytes.	Germander was withdrawn from the market after its use for weight control caused an epidemic of hepatitis. Its toxicity was shown to be caused by diterpenoids and their cytochrome P4503A-mediated metabolic activation into electrophilic metabolites that deplete cellular thiols. The aim of the present study was to determine the mechanisms of cell death. Isolated rat hepatocytes were incubated for 2 hours with germander diterpenoids (100 micrograms/mL). Diterpenoids decreased cell glutathione, increased cytosolic [Ca2+], activated Ca(2+)-dependent tissue transglutaminase forming a cross-linked protein scaffold, and caused internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and the ultrastructural features of apoptosis. Cell death was prevented by decreasing metabolic activation (with troleandomycin), preventing depletion of glutathione (with cystine), blocking activation of Ca(2+)-modulated enzymes (with calmidazolium), or inhibiting internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (with aurintricarboxylic acid). Apoptosis was increased and diterpenoids caused overexpression of p53 and interleukin 1 beta-converting enzyme in rats treated with dexamethasone (cytochrome P4503A inducer). Apoptosis was also increased by a diet deficient in sulfur amino acids. The germander furano diterpenoids cause apoptosis within 2 hours in isolated rat hepatocytes. Electrophilic metabolites may stimulate apoptosis by decreasing thiols, increasing [Ca2+], and activating Ca(2+)-dependent transglutaminase and endonucleases. 	Gastroenterology	D016428 D013485
11194186	20010224	Serologic heterogeneity of HLA-A24 correlates with allelic types in the Korean population.	HLA-A24 is the second most frequently expressed HLA-A type in Koreans (GF 22.8%). Four different serologic reaction patterns were observed in Korean A24 positive samples using a commercial serologic typing kit. To clarify the nature of serologic heterogeneity, thirteen A24 positive DNA samples representing the four different serologic reaction patterns were subjected to DNA sequencing analysis of the amplified HLA-A genes from each sample. Four A*24 alleles (A*2402101, A*2403, A*2408, and A*2421) were associated with the four unique serologic reaction patterns. During this study, a novel allele, A*2421, was characterized. The new sequence is similar to A*2402101, differing at codon 127 (AAA--&gt;AAC; K--&gt;N). By comparing putative amino acid sequences and serologic reaction patterns of A*24 allelic products identified in this study, several crucial sites for A24- and A9-specific antibody binding were predicted: 127K for A24 antibody binding, and 62E-65G and 166D-167G for A9 antibody binding. This information will be helpful for accurately assigning HLA-A24 types by serology and for predicting serologic types of new alleles. 	J._Korean_Med._Sci.	D016428 D013485
25781336	20150318	Ocular signs correlate well with disease severity and genotype in Fabry disease.	Ocular signs in Fabry disease have generally been regarded to be primarily of diagnostic value. We explored whether ocular findings, alone or in particular in combination with the ?-galactosidase A gene mutation, have predictive value for disease severity. Data from the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS), a large, global database sponsored by Shire, were selected for adult patients who had undergone ophthalmological examination. Three ocular signs were assessed: cornea verticillata, tortuous conjunctival and/or retinal vessels, and cataract. Fabry disease severity was measured using FOS Mainz Severity Score Index and modifications thereof. Ophthalmological data were available for 1203 (699 female, 504 male) adult patients with eye findings characteristic of Fabry disease in 55.1%. Cornea verticillata had a similar distribution in women (51.1%) and men (50.8%), whereas tortuous vessels and Fabry cataract were somewhat more frequent in men than in women. Patients with cornea verticillata, selected as the principal ocular sign for this study, had more severe disease (median score, 20.0) versus those without ocular signs (11.0; P&lt;0.001). This finding could be confirmed by applying age adjusted severity scores. Moreover, the prevalence of cornea verticillata was significantly higher in patients with null (male, 76.9%; female, 64.5%) and missense (male, 79.2%; female, 67.4%) mutations versus mild missense (male, 17.1%; female, 23.1%) and the p.N215S (male, 15.0%; female, 15.6%) mutations (P&lt;0.01). Our analyses show a correlation between the prevalence of ocular changes in Fabry disease and disease severity. Consequently, information on ocular findings and ?-galactosidase A gene mutation may help assess the risk for more severe Fabry disease. These observed findings are of notable clinical importance, as Fabry disease is characterized by high clinical course variability and only weak genotype-phenotype correlation at the individual patient level. Further confirmatory studies are needed. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485

19256756	20090305	Association between the 1793G&gt; A MTHFR polymorphism and sporadic colorectal cancer in Iran.	It has been proposed that folate and polymorphisms of the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), which regulates influx of folate for methylation reactions for DNA synthesis and repair, are involved in colorectal cancer. This study was designed to determine the influence of a genetic variant (MTHFR G1793A) and folate on colon cancer in Iran. We analyzed 227 cases and 239 normal unmatched controls using pyrosequencing. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to evaluate associations of the MTHFR gene polymorphism with colorectal cancer risk. A significantly reduced risk of recurrence was observed in patients heterozygous for the MTHFR G1793A polymorphism (OR: 0.17; 95% CI, 0.05-0.52). The frequency of GG, GA and AA genotypes of MTHFR among the colorectal cancer patients were 98%, 2% and 0% respectively, while the frequencies among controls were 90%, 10% and 0%, respectively. Furthermore, a significant reduction in recurrence risk was seen in MTHFR G1793A heterozygotes limited to those who received folate supplements. Our study is compatible with previous findings concerning a reverse association between the MTHFR 1793G&gt; A genotype with cancers in different populations. 	Asian_Pac._J._Cancer_Prev.

19164213	20090124	Impact of Fc{gamma}RIIa-Fc{gamma}RIIIa polymorphisms and KRAS mutations on the clinical outcome of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab plus irinotecan.	The antiepidermal growth factor receptor antibody cetuximab shows activity in irinotecan-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), mainly in wild-type KRAS tumors. Cetuximab may also exert antitumor effects through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in which antibody Fc portion interacts with Fc receptors (FcgammaRs) expressed by immune cells. ADCC is influenced by FcgammaRIIa-H131R and FcgammaRIIIa-V158F polymorphisms that are clinically relevant in follicular lymphoma and metastatic breast cancer treated with rituximab and trastuzumab, respectively. We investigated the association of FcgammaR polymorphisms and KRAS mutation with the outcome of irinotecan-refractory mCRC patients treated with cetuximab plus irinotecan. Tumor and normal tissues from 69 patients were screened for KRAS mutations using a sensitive multiplex assay and genotyped for FcgammaRIIa and FcgammaRIIIa polymorphisms by direct sequencing and multiplex allele-specific polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The results were correlated with response and progression-free survival (PFS). KRAS mutations were associated with lower response rate (4% v 27% in nonmutated patients; P = .021) and shorter PFS (3.0 v 5.3 months; P = .021). Patients with FcgammaRIIa-131H/H and/or FcgammaIIIa-158V/V genotypes had longer PFS than 131R and 158F carriers (5.5 v 3.0 months; P = .005). The difference remained significant for mutated-KRAS patients. By multivariate analysis, KRAS mutation and FcgammaR combined status were independent risk factors for PFS. Combined FcgammaRIIa/FcgammaRIIIa polymorphisms are prognostic factors for disease progression in mCRC patients treated with cetuximab plus irinotecan. As these polymorphisms are also clinically relevant in mutated-KRAS mCRC, an important role of ADCC in cetuximab efficacy is presumed. 	J._Clin._Oncol.	D016428 D016448
24152508	20131025	Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis associated with maternally inherited diabetes and deafness: clinical pathological analysis.	Maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD), which is caused by an A to G substitution at position 3243 (m.3243A&gt;G) in the transfer ribonucleic acid leucine gene, is characterized by diabetes and hearing loss. Patients with MIDD frequently have renal disease, which may precede the diagnosis of either diabetes or deafness or may be the sole manifestation of the m.3243A&gt;G mutation. Recently, progressive renal failure was reported in adults, and a number of childhood cases of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) of MIDD have been reported. However, little is known about the glomerular lesions in FSGS in MIDD. In the present study, we reported two cases of FSGS associated with MIDD and studied the clinical features of the proband and her mother. 	Indian_J_Pathol_Microbiol	D002363 D016428 D013485

21848006	20110819	Linkage analysis and a novel COL4A5 mutation in a large Turkish family with Alport syndrome.	Alport syndrome (AS) is a renal disease that is characterized by proteinuria and progressive renal failure, and often accompanied by sensorineural hearing loss and ocular changes. Mutations in the genes encoding for three members of the type IV collagen protein family have been found to be the cause of the disease. We describe a large Turkish family with X-linked AS. We performed linkage analysis in this family and sequencing to identify the mutation in the proband whose disease was confirmed by renal biopsy. After genomic DNAs extracted, linkage to the COL4A5 locus was examined using the 2B6 and 2B20, DXS1106, DXS1105 and COL4A5 markers. In addition, COL4A5 gene sequence analysis was performed in the proband. Genetic linkage analysis demonstrated co-segregation of the disease. Haplotype analysis showed that the same haplotype was carried by all affected males and obligatory carrier females. Mutation analysis of the proband has revealed a novel nonsense mutation (c.1135C&gt;T; Gln379X) in exon 19 of the COL4A5 gene which may lead to a more severe phenotype in affected family members carrying this mutation. According to GenBank data base, this mutation has not been reported previously. Genetic testing identified a previously undescribed COL4A5 mutation as the cause of the disease. 	Genet._Couns.

21788450	20110727	Nuclear localization of ?-tubulin affects E2F transcriptional activity and S-phase progression.	We show that the centrosome- and microtubule-regulating protein ?-tubulin interacts with E2 promoter binding factors (E2Fs) to modulate E2F transcriptional activity and thereby control cell cycle progression. ?-Tubulin contains a C-terminal signal that results in its translocation to the nucleus during late G(1) to early S phase. ?-Tubulin mutants showed that the C terminus interacts with the transcription factor E2F1 and that the E2F1-?-tubulin complex is formed during the G(1)/S transition, when E2F1 is transcriptionally active. Furthermore, E2F transcriptional activity is altered by reduced expression of ?-tubulin or by complex formation between ?-tubulin and E2F1, E2F2, or E2F3, but not E2F6. In addition, the ?-tubulin C terminus encodes a DNA-binding domain that interacts with E2F-regulated promoters, resulting in ?-tubulin-mediated transient activation of E2Fs. Thus, we report a novel mechanism regulating the activity of E2Fs, which can help explain how these proteins affect cell cycle progression in mammalian cells. 	FASEB_J.	D016428 D013485
20697107	20100811	Dominant-negative effects of a novel mutation in the filamin myopathy.	Filamin myopathy is associated with mutations in the filamin C gene (FLNC) and is a myofibrillar myopathy characterized by focal myofibrillar destruction and cytoplasmic aggregates containing several Z-disk-related proteins. This study investigated 6 Japanese patients with dominantly inherited myofibrillar myopathy manifested by adult-onset, slow and progressive muscle weakness and atrophy in the distal extremities. The abundantly expressed proteins in the affected muscles were identified as filamin C by nano liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A genetic analysis of FLNC identified a heterozygous c.8107delG mutation that was localized to the dimerization domain of filamin C. A biochemical crosslinking analysis of bacterially expressed recombinant wild-type and mutant filamin C fragments demonstrated that the mutant monomer disturbed the proper dimerization of the wild-type filamin dimer, resulting in formation of a heterotrimer with the wild-type filamin dimer. The expression study in C2C12 myoblasts showed that the mutant filamin fragments formed cytoplasmic aggregates with endogenous wild-type filamin C. This study provides evidence for the dominant-negative effects of the FLNC mutation. These effects may be mutation-specific and likely result in the variation in the clinical phenotypes seen in patients with filamin myopathy. 	Neurology	D003160 D016428 D016441
7623777	19950701	Biphasic binding of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate to human thymidylate synthase.	Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a homodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the reductive methylation of dUMP by N5,N10-methylene-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid, to form dTMP. Inhibition of TS by the dUMP analog 5-fluoro-dUMP (FdUMP) occurs through the formation of a covalent ternary complex containing the nucleotide analog, N5,N10-methylene-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid, and the enzyme; this complex is termed the inhibitory ternary complex (ITC). In the present report, the kinetics of FdUMP binding into an ITC with purified preparations of human TS were examined. Rapid chemical-quench techniques, as well as steady state binding methods, showed that the enzyme contains two distinct FdUMP binding sites with different affinities for the nucleotide analog. Binding to the first, or high affinity, site was rapid and reached a maximum stoichiometry of 1.0 mol of FdUMP/mol of dimer; binding to the second, or low affinity, site was much slower and reached a stoichiometry of 1.7 mol of FdUMP/mol of dimer. Rate constants for FdUMP binding to and dissociation from the ITC (kon and koff, respectively) were determined, as were equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd). A naturally occurring mutant form of TS, which contains a tyrosine to histidine substitution at residue 33 and renders cells relatively resistant to fluoropyrimidines, exhibited a lower affinity for FdUMP specifically at the second binding site, with little or no change at the first. Hill coefficients were &lt; 1.0, with the His-33 enzyme having a significantly lower coefficient than the wild-type enzyme. The results, in total, indicate that the two FdUMP binding sites on the TS dimer are nonequivalent. We suggest that such nonequivalence may be due to negative cooperativity, where nucleotide binding to the first subunit elicits a conformational change that results in reduced affinity for ligand at the second subunit. This negative cooperativity may be stronger for the His-33 mutant. Thus, the relative fluoropyrimidine resistance conferred by the His-33 substitution may be due to enhanced negative cooperative effects on FdUMP binding into the ITC, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the pyrimidine analog as an inhibitor of thymidylate biosynthesis.

19933798	20091126	Mechanism of entecavir resistance of hepatitis B virus with viral breakthrough as determined by long-term clinical assessment and molecular docking simulation.	The mechanism by which entecavir resistance (ETVr) substitutions of hepatitis B virus (HBV) can induce breakthrough (BT) during ETV therapy is largely unknown. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 49 lamivudine (LVD)-refractory patients and 59 na?ve patients with chronic hepatitis B. BT was observed in 26.8% of the LVD-refractory group during weeks 60 to 144 of ETV therapy. A line probe assay revealed ETVr substitutions only in the LVD-refractory group, i.e., in 4.9% of patients at baseline, increasing to 14.6%, 24.4%, and 44.8% at weeks 48, 96, and 144, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, HBV DNA levels, and LVD resistance (LVDr) (L180M and M204V, but not M204I) indicated that T184 substitutions and S202G (not S202C) were a significant factor for BT (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 141.12, and 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.94 to 2,870.20; OR, 201.25, and 95% CI, 11.22 to 3608.65, respectively). Modeling of HBV reverse transcriptase (RT) by docking simulation indicated that a combination of LVDr and ETVr (T184L or S202G) was characterized by a change in the direction of the D205 residue and steric conflict in the binding pocket of ETV triphosphate (ETV-TP), by significantly longer minimal distances (2.2 A and 2.1 A), and by higher potential energy (-117 and -99.8 Kcal/mol) for ETV-TP compared with the wild type (1.3 A; -178 Kcal/mol) and LVDr substitutions (1.5 A; -141 Kcal/mol). Our data suggest that the low binding affinity of ETV-TP for the HBV RT, involving conformational change of the binding pocket of HBV RT by L180M, M204V plus T184L, and S202G, could induce BT.

24836576	20140520	Whole-exome sequencing and clinical interpretation of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples to guide precision cancer medicine.	Translating whole-exome sequencing (WES) for prospective clinical use may have an impact on the care of patients with cancer; however, multiple innovations are necessary for clinical implementation. These include rapid and robust WES of DNA derived from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue, analytical output similar to data from frozen samples and clinical interpretation of WES data for prospective use. Here, we describe a prospective clinical WES platform for archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples. The platform employs computational methods for effective clinical analysis and interpretation of WES data. When applied retrospectively to 511 exomes, the interpretative framework revealed a 'long tail' of somatic alterations in clinically important genes. Prospective application of this approach identified clinically relevant alterations in 15 out of 16 patients. In one patient, previously undetected findings guided clinical trial enrollment, leading to an objective clinical response. Overall, this methodology may inform the widespread implementation of precision cancer medicine. 	Nat._Med.	D016428 D052061 D013485 D013486

17594478	20070628	ATM activation accompanies histone H2AX phosphorylation in A549 cells upon exposure to tobacco smoke.	In response to DNA damage or structural alterations of chromatin, histone H2AX may be phosphorylated on Ser139 by phosphoinositide 3-kinase related protein kinases (PIKKs) such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ATM-and Rad-3 related (ATR) kinase, or by DNA dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs). When DNA damage primarily involves formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), H2AX is preferentially phosphorylated by ATM rather than by the other PIKKs. We have recently reported that brief exposure of human pulmonary adenocarcinoma A549 cells or normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) to cigarette smoke (CS) induced phosphorylation of H2AX. We report here that H2AX phosphorylation in A549 cells induced by CS was accompanied by activation of ATM, as revealed by ATM phosphorylation on Ser1981 (ATM-S1981P) detected immunocytochemically and by Western blotting. No cell cycle-phase specific differences in kinetics of ATM activation and H2AX phosphorylation were observed. When cells were exposed to CS from cigarettes with different tobacco and filter combinations, the expression levels of ATM-S1981P correlated well with the increase in expression of phosphorylated H2AX (gammaH2AX) (R = 0.89). In addition, we note that while CS-induced gammaH2AX expression was localized within discrete foci, the activated ATM was distributed throughout the nucleoplasm. These data implicate ATM as the PIKK that phosphorylates H2AX in response to DNA damage caused by CS. Based on current understanding of ATM activation, expression and localization, these data would suggest that, in addition to inducing potentially carcinogenic DSB lesions, CS may also trigger other types of DNA lesions and cause chromatin alterations. As checkpoint kinase (Chk) 1, Chk2 and the p53 tumor suppressor gene are known to be phosphorylated by ATM, the present data indicate that exposure to CS may lead to their phosphorylation, with the downstream consequences related to the halt in cell cycle progression and increased propensity to undergo apoptosis. Defining the nature and temporal sequence of molecular events that are disrupted by CS through activation and eventual dysregulation of normal defense mechanisms such as ATM and its downstream effectors may allow a more precise understanding of how CS promotes cancer development.

21680501	20110618	A recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus bearing a lethal mutation in the glycoprotein gene uncovers a second site suppressor that restores fusion.	Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a prototype of the Rhabdoviridae family, contains a single surface glycoprotein (G) that is responsible for attachment to cells and mediates membrane fusion. Working with the Indiana serotype of VSV, we employed a reverse genetic approach to produce fully authentic recombinant viral particles bearing lethal mutations in the G gene. By altering the hydrophobicity of the two fusion loops within G, we produced a panel of mutants, W72A, Y73A, Y116A, and A117F, that were nonfusogenic. Propagation of viruses bearing those lethal mutations in G completely depended on complementation by expression of the glycoprotein from the heterologous New Jersey serotype of VSV. The nonfusogenic G proteins oligomerize and are transported normally to the cell surface but fail to mediate acid pH-triggered membrane fusion. The nonfusogenic G proteins also interfered with the ability of wild-type G to mediate fusion, either by formation of mixed trimers or by inhibition of trimer function during fusion. Passage of one recombinant virus, A117F, identified a second site suppressor of the fusion block, E76K. When analyzed in the absence of the A117F substitution, E76K rendered G more sensitive to acid pH-triggered fusion, suggesting that this compensatory mutation is destabilizing. Our work provides a set of authentic recombinant VSV particles bearing lethal mutations in G, confirms that the hydrophobic fusion loops of VSV G protein are critical for membrane fusion, and underscores the importance of the sequence elements surrounding the hydrophobic tips of the fusion loops in driving fusion. This study has implications for understanding dominant targets for inhibition of G-mediated fusion. Moreover, the recombinant viral particles generated here will likely be useful in dissecting the mechanism of G-catalyzed fusion as well as study steps of viral assembly. 	J._Virol.

26254224	20150809	COP1 enhances ubiquitin-mediated degradation of p27Kip1 to promote cancer cell growth.	p27 is a critical CDK inhibitor involved in cell cycle regulation, and its stability is critical for cell proliferation. Constitutive photomorphogenic 1 (COP1) is a RING-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in regulating important target proteins for cell growth, but its biological activity in cell cycle progression is not well characterized. Here, we report that p27Kip1 levels are accumulated in G1 phase, with concurrent reduction of COP1 levels. Mechanistic studies show that COP1 directly interacts with p27 through a VP motif on p27 and functions as an E3 ligase of p27 to accelerate the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of p27. Also, COP1-p27 axis deregulation is involved in tumorigenesis. These findings define a new mechanism for posttranslational regulation of p27 and provide insight into the characteristics of COP1-overexpressing cancers. 	Oncotarget	D016428 D052061 D013486
21719701	20110702	Identification of a negative regulatory region for the exchange activity and characterization of T332I mutant of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 10 (ARHGEF10).	The T332I mutation in Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 10 (ARHGEF10) was previously found in persons with slowed nerve conduction velocities and thin myelination of peripheral nerves. However, the molecular and cellular basis of the T332I mutant is not understood. Here, we show that ARHGEF10 has a negative regulatory region in the N terminus, in which residue 332 is located, and the T332I mutant is constitutively active. An N-terminal truncated ARHGEF10 mutant, ARHGEF10 ?N (lacking amino acids 1-332), induced cell contraction that was inhibited by a Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 and had higher GEF activity for RhoA than the wild type. The T332I mutant also showed the phenotype similar to the N-terminal truncated mutant. These data suggest that the ARHGEF10 T332I mutation-associated phenotype observed in the peripheral nerves is due to activated GEF activity of the ARHGEF10 T332I mutant. 	J._Biol._Chem.

27607899	20160909	Association between LEKR1-CCNL1 and IGSF21-KLHDC7A gene polymorphisms and diabetic retinopathy of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Chinese Han population.	Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common microvascular complications of diabetes. The present study aimed to identify a possible connection between gene polymorphisms and the risk of developing DR. A total of 319 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were selected. All patients underwent a complete eye examination. Based on this, the patients with T2DM were divided into two subgroups: 175 patients with retinopathy (DR) and 144 patients without retinopathy (NDR). We calculated the genotype frequencies of case and control subjects using the chi-squares test. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression adjusted for age and sex. The finding by analysis is that the mean of duration of diabetes, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), glomerular filtration rate and C-peptide were significantly different between DR and NDR. We found significant differences in cystatin-C concentrations with LEKR1-CCNL1 rs13064954 and NOS3 rs3918227 of different genotypes. Significant differences in serum TG levels were seen among the three genotypes of MTHFR rs1537516. Subjects carried the T allele of IGSF21-KLHDC7A rs3007729 had higher serum LDL concentrations (p?=?0.015). In the allele model, LEKR1-CCNL1 rs13064954 decreased the risk of DR (OR =0.57, 95% CI?=?0.34-0.96, p?=?0.032). Under the dominant model, the IGSF21-KLHDC7A rs3007729 CT-TT genotype increased the risk of DR (OR =1.84, 95% CI?=?1.14-2.99, p?=?0.013). Our results suggest that LEKR1-CCNL1 and IGSF21-KLHDC7A influence the development of DR. 	J_Gene_Med	D016428
24586564	20140304	Prognostic relevance of urinary bladder cancer susceptibility loci.	In the last few years, susceptibility loci have been identified for urinary bladder cancer (UBC) through candidate-gene and genome-wide association studies. Prognostic relevance of most of these loci is yet unknown. In this study, we used data of the Nijmegen Bladder Cancer Study (NBCS) to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the prognostic relevance of all confirmed UBC susceptibility loci. Detailed clinical data concerning diagnosis, stage, treatment, and disease course of a population-based series of 1,602 UBC patients were collected retrospectively based on a medical file survey. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox proportional hazard regression were performed, and log-rank tests calculated, to evaluate the association between 12 confirmed UBC susceptibility variants and recurrence and progression in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patients. Among muscle-invasive or metastatic bladder cancer (MIBC) patients, association of these variants with overall survival was tested. Subgroup analyses by tumor aggressiveness and smoking status were performed in NMIBC patients. In the overall NMIBC group (n = 1,269), a statistically significant association between rs9642880 at 8q24 and risk of progression was observed (GT vs. TT: HR = 1.08 (95% CI: 0.76-1.54), GG vs. TT: HR = 1.81 (95% CI: 1.23-2.66), P for trend = 2.6 ? 10(-3)). In subgroup analyses, several other variants showed suggestive, though non-significant, prognostic relevance for recurrence and progression in NMIBC and survival in MIBC. This study provides suggestive evidence that genetic loci involved in UBC etiology may influence disease prognosis. Elucidation of the causal variant(s) could further our understanding of the mechanism of disease, could point to new therapeutic targets, and might aid in improvement of prognostic tools.

10652291	20000201	Collagen XVII is destabilized by a glycine substitution mutation in the cell adhesion domain Col15.	Collagen XVII is a hemidesmosomal transmembrane molecule important for epithelial adhesion in the skin. It exists in two forms, as a full-length protein and as a soluble ectodomain that is shed from the keratinocyte surface by furin-mediated proteolysis. To obtain information on the conformation and the functions of this unusual collagen, its largest collagenous domain, Col15, was expressed in a eukaryotic episomal expression system and purified by DEAE and fast protein liquid- Mono S chromatography. The protein was triple-helical (T(m) of 26.5 degrees C) when produced in cultures containing ascorbic acid. When the vitamin supply was limited, the 4-hydroxyproline content was reduced from 74 to 9%, which, in turn, resulted in a drastic reduction of the stability of the triple helix. The glycine substitution mutation G627V associated with junctional epidermolysis bullosa, a human blistering skin disease, also had a striking effect on thermal stability of rCol15 causing partial unfolding already at 4 degrees C. Col15 promoted cell adhesion of epithelial and fibroblastic cell lines with a beta1 integrin-mediated mechanism. In concert with this, in acquired autoimmune blistering skin diseases, circulating IgG and IgA autoantibodies were found to target rCol15r. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
17634088	20070720	Comparison of interactions between beta-hairpin decapeptides and SDS/DPC micelles from experimental and simulation data.	We applied a combined experimental and computational approach to ascertain how peptides interact with host and microbial membrane surrogates, in order to validate simulation methodology we hope will enable the development of insights applicable to the design of novel antimicrobial peptides. We studied the interactions of two truncated versions of the potent, but cytotoxic, antimicrobial octadecapeptide protegrin-1, PC-72 [LCYCRRRFCVC] and PC-73 [CYCRRRFCVC]. We used a combination of FTIR, fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to examine the peptides' interactions with sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles. The relative amounts of secondary structure determined by FTIR agreed with those from the simulations. Fluorescence spectroscopy, deuterium exchange experiments and the simulations all indicate that neither peptide embeds itself deeply into the micelle core. Although molecular simulations placed both peptides at the micelle-water interface, further examination revealed differences in how certain residues interacted with the micelle core. We demonstrate here the accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations methods through comparison with experiments, and have used the simulation results to enhance the understanding of how these two peptides interact with the two types of micelles. We find agreement between simulation and experimental results in the final structure of the peptides and in the peptides final conformation with respect to the micelle. Looking in depth at the peptide interactions, we find differences in the interactions between the two peptides from the simulation data; Leu-1 on PC-72 interacts strongly with the SDS micelle, though the interaction is not persistent--the residue withdraws and inserts into the micelle throughout the simulation.

17150836	20061208	Mutagenic properties of oxidized GTP and ATP in in vitro transcription-reverse transcription.	Oxidation of RNA precursors may disturb genetic information by mispair formations. In this study, effects of oxidized ribonucleoside triphosphates on in vitro transcription catalyzed by T7 RNA polymerase were examined. 8-Hydroxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate (8-OH-GTP) and 2-hydroxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate (2-OH-ATP) reduced amount of RNA. In addition, mRNA was converted to cDNA by reverse transcriptase, and the cDNA was then amplified by PCR. The PCR product was subsequently cloned into plasmid DNA and sequence of DNA was analyzed for each bacterial colony. The two oxidized ribonucleotides induced mutations in cDNA, suggesting disturbance of genetic information during transcription and/or reverse transcription. 8-OH-GTP induced T--&gt;G plus T--&gt;C mutations and 2-OH-ATP caused T--&gt;C mutations. These results indicate that formation of these oxidized RNA precursors in cells affects transcription quantitatively and qualitatively. In addition, they are potential antiviral drugs that cause mutations in genomic RNA. 	Nucleic_Acids_Symp_Ser_(Oxf)	D016428
12100448	20020709	Association of a missense mutation of the laminin alpha2 gene with tuberculoid type of leprosy in Indonesian patients.	Leprosy, an infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae, has a specific tropism for the myelinating Schwann cells of peripheral nerves. Recently, the G domain of laminin alpha2 has been shown to be a mediator for M. leprae to bind to alpha-dystroglycan in Schwann cells. In order to analyse the association of leprosy with the mediator, three genetic polymorphisms encoding the G domain of the laminin alpha2 chain were analysed by direct sequencing in 53 leprosy patients and 58 healthy contact individuals from Indonesia. There was no significant difference in the incidence of the polymorphisms between patients and non-patients. Remarkably, it was found that a missense mutation (T7809C) substituting valine with alanine (V2587A) was found to be more frequent in the tuberculoid type than in the lepromatous type leprosy. It is supposed that this missense mutation is one of the determinant factors in the early onset of peripheral nerve damage in Indonesian tuberculoid leprosy patients. 	Trop._Med._Int._Health	D016428
15941966	20050609	Association of genetic polymorphisms with serum estrogens measured multiple times during a 2-year period in premenopausal women.	There is evidence that circulating estrogens are associated with breast cancer risk. In this study of premenopausal women, we explored the association of polymorphisms in genes in the estrogen synthesis and metabolism pathways with serum and urinary levels of estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) and with the urinary ratio of 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OHE1)/16alpha-hydroxyestrone (16alpha-OHE1). This analysis included 220 women, who were participants in a 2-year randomized soy intervention. Blood specimens were collected in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle an average of 4.4 times over 2 years. Overnight urinary specimens were collected on the same cycle day, only at baseline. Levels of E1, E2, 2-OHE1, and 16alpha-OHE1 were measured by enzyme immunoassays. The DNA samples were analyzed by PCR/RFLP for the COMT Val158Met, CYP1A1*2A, CYP1A1*2B, CYP1A2*1F, CYP1B1 Val432Leu, and CYP17 T27C polymorphisms. We applied mixed models to investigate the relations between genotypes and repeated serum hormone measurements and generalized linear models to assess associations between genotypes and urinary estrogen metabolites. The CYP1A2 C allele was significantly associated with lower serum E2 levels; in CC genotype carriers, serum E2 levels were 26.3% lower than in homo- and heterozygous common allele carriers combined (P = 0.01). CYP1A2*1F also affected the urinary 2-OHE1/16alpha-OHE1 ratio; carriers of the variant C allele had a markedly lower ratio than individuals with the AA genotype (1.37 versus 1.76; P = 0.002). These data suggest that CYP1A2*1F is associated with lower circulating levels of E2, and that it may be a susceptibility locus for breast cancer. 	Cancer_Epidemiol._Biomarkers_Prev.

In order to identify amino acids involved in binding the co-substrate glutathione to the human glutathione S-transferase (GST) pi enzyme, we assembled three criteria to implicate amino acids whose role in binding and catalysis could be tested. Presence of a residue in the highly conserved exon 4 of the GST gene, positional conservation of a residue in 12 glutathione S-transferase amino acid sequences, and results from published chemical modification studies were used to implicate 14 residues. A bacterial expression vector (pUC120 pi), which enabled abundant production (2-26% of soluble Escherichia coli protein) of wild-type or mutant GST pi, was constructed, and, following nonconservative substitution mutation of the 14 implicated residues, five mutants (R13S, D57K, Q64R, I68Y, L72F) showed a greater than 95% decrease in specific activity. A quantitative assay was developed which rapidly measured the ability of wild-type or mutant glutathione S-transferase to bind to glutathione-agarose. Using this assay, each of the five loss of function mutants showed a greater than 20-fold decrease in binding glutathione, an observation consistent with a recent crystal structure analysis showing that several of these residues help to form the glutathione-binding cleft.

24269793	20131126	RNA structure disrupting G320-T transversion within the short fragment of the 5' untranslated region prevents rescue of infectious foot-and-mouth disease virus.	A full-length cDNA clone of an Indian foot-and-mouth disease virus strain, Asia 1 IND 491/1997 was assembled downstream of the T7 promoter in the pBluescript II SK (+) vector by sequential ligation of four PCR-generated subgenomic fragments. RNA transcribed from that construct were transfected into BHK-21 and LFBK cells to rescue infectious virus. The in vitro growth kinetics, plaque morphology, infectivity titer, antigenic profile and virulence characteristics in unweaned mice infected with the recombinant virus were comparable to those infected with the parental virus. However, repeated attempts to recover viable virus from the RNA transcripts with a G320-T point mutation introduced in the short fragment of the 5' untranslated region failed. The possible destabilizing effect of such a mutation on the predicted long stem-loop structure at the 5'-end of the genome and its implications for viral genome replication are discussed.

27556182	20160825	Dux4 controls migration of mesenchymal stem cells through the Cxcr4-Sdf1 axis.	We performed transcriptome profiling of human immortalized myoblasts (MB) transiently expressing double homeobox transcription factor 4 (DUX4) and double homeobox transcription factor 4 centromeric (DUX4c) and identified 114 and 70 genes differentially expressed in DUX4- and DUX4c-transfected myoblasts, respectively. A significant number of differentially expressed genes were involved in inflammation, cellular migration and chemotaxis suggesting a role for DUX4 and DUX4c in these processes. DUX4 but not DUX4c overexpression resulted in upregulation of the CXCR4 (C-X-C motif Receptor 4) and CXCL12 (C-X-C motif ligand 12 also known as SDF1) expression in human immortalized myoblasts. In a Transwell cell migration assay, human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were migrating more efficiently towards human immortalized myoblasts overexpressing DUX4 as compared to controls; the migration efficiency of DUX4-transfected BMSCs was also increased. DUX4c overexpression in myoblasts or in BMSCs had no impact on the rate of BMSC migration. Antibodies against SDF1 and CXCR4 blocked the positive effect of DUX4 overexpression on BMSC migration. We propose that DUX4 controls the cellular migration of mesenchymal stem cells through the CXCR4 receptor. 	Oncotarget	D016428
24348813	20131219	Analysis of the anticancer activity of curcuminoids, thiotryptophan and 4-phenoxyphenol derivatives.	Curcumin, a non-nutritive yellow pigment derived from the rhizome ofCurcuma longa(turmeric), is considered to be an established nutraceutical with anticancer activity. Turmeric contains three principal components, curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin, of which curcumin is most abundant and potent. The concurrence of a high consumption of turmeric and a low incidence of prostate cancer in Asian countries may suggest a role for curcumin in chemoprevention. Curcumin has been identified to exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anticarcinogenic properties. Since the compound does not exhibit side effects, curcumin has been designated for several clinical trials as a treatment for human cancers. The pro-apototic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory characteristics of curcumin are implicated in its anticancer activity, yet the mechanism of action of curcumin remains unknown. To achieve an effective pharmacological outcome, curcumin must reach and sustain appropriate levels at the site of action. However, the main disadvantage of curcumin is its high metabolic instability and poor aqueous solubility that limits its systemic bioavailability. To overcome this difficulty, the present study tested the anticancer activity of new curcumin-like compounds (E21cH and Q012095H). Also, the use of new medicaments requires an understanding of their pharmacokinetic profiles and targets. Thus, molecular modeling methods were used to identify the targets of curcumin and curcumin-like compounds compared with other anticancer drugs (Q012138 and Q012169AT), which were used as the controls. The present study identified several enzymes that are targeted by curcumin, aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10), serine/threonine-protein kinase, protein kinase C, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), cyclooxygenase and epidermal growth factor receptor, which were tested as targets for these anticancer chemicals. All the examined small compounds demonstrated anticancer activity in thein vitroexperiments and may impact cancer cells by acting on AKR1B10, MMP-9 and their targets. 	Oncol_Lett	D016428
22685539	20120612	Insecticide resistance mechanisms in the green peach aphid Myzus persicae (Hemiptera: Aphididae) II: Costs and benefits.	Among herbivorous insects that have exploited agro-ecosystems, the peach-potato aphid, Myzus persicae, is recognized as one of the most important agricultural pests worldwide. Uses over 400 plant species and has evolved different insecticides resistance mechanisms. As M. persicae feeds upon a huge diversity of hosts, it has been exposed to a wide variety of plant allelochemicals, which probably have promoted a wide range of detoxification systems. In this work we (i) evaluated whether insecticide resistance mutations (IRM) in M. persicae can give an advantage in terms of reproductive fitness when aphids face two hosts, pepper (Capsicum annuum) a suitable host and radish (Raphanus sativus) the unfavorable host and (ii) examined the transcriptional expression of six genes that are known to be up-regulated in response to insecticides. Our results show a significant interaction between host and IRM on the intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)). Susceptible genotypes (not carrying insensitivity mutations) had a higher r(m) on pepper, and the transcriptional levels of five genes increased on radish. The r(m) relationship was reversed on the unfavorable host; genotypes with multiple IRM exhibited higher r(m), without altering the transcriptional levels of the studied genes. Genotypes with one IRM kept a similar r(m) on both hosts, but they increased the transcriptional levels of two genes. Although we have studied only nine genotypes, overall our results are in agreement with the general idea that allelochemical detoxification systems could constitute a pre-adaptation for the development of insecticide resistance. Genotypes carrying IRM exhibited a higher r(m) than susceptible genotypes on radish, the more unfavorable host. Susceptible genotypes should be able to tolerate the defended host by up-regulating some metabolic genes that are also responding to insecticides. Hence, our results suggest that the trade-off among resistance mechanisms might be quite complex, with a multiplicity of costs and benefits depending on the environment.

22405927	20120313	Analysis of JAG1 gene variant in Chinese patients with Alagille syndrome.	Alagille syndrome (AGS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by bile duct paucity. It can be caused by variations in the JAG1 gene encoding a protein of Notch ligand and by variations in the NOTCH2 gene encoding a Notch receptor. In this study we identified 15 different JAG1 gene variations in 17 Chinese patients, nine of which were novel alterations including c.766G &gt; T, c.819delC, c.826delT, c.3099_3100delCA, c.1323_1326delCTGG, c.1771_1775delGTGCGinsT, c.1868delG, c. 2791_2792insA and c.866delG. These alterations were located in the extracellular domain of JAG1, in particular in the DSL and EGF-like repeat domain. All the specific variations in five inheritance cases investigated were de novo. Furthermore, no sequence variation of NOTCH2 was detected in JAG1 alteration negative patients. 	Gene	D016428 D013485
19904021	20091112	Frequency of common CYP3A5 gene variants in healthy Polish newborn infants.	Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases catalyze the metabolism of approximately 40-60% of widely used drugs with a A6986G CYP3A5 polymorphism determining expresser (A6986, *1) and reduced- expresser (*3) variants with modified drug metabolism activity. In this report, the allele frequency of CYP3A5 *1 and *3 (A6986 or G6986, respectively) was analyzed by the PCR-RFLP technique in a cohort of 200 Polish newborns from the West Pomeranian region. Of the studied group, 1% (n = 2/200) proved homozygous for the CYP3A5*1 allele, 89% (n = 178/200) for the *3 allele, and 10% (n = 20/200) were heterozygous for *1/*3. Similar frequencies were found in other Caucasian European populations. This study provides basic genetic data related to the metabolism of drugs, with a narrow therapeutic window in a Polish population. 	Pharmacol_Rep	D016428
10100088	19990401	M235T angiotensinogen gene polymorphism and cardiovascular renal risk.	In this meta-analysis, we attempted to derive pooled estimates for the putative associations between various cardiovascular-renal disorders and the M235T polymorphism of the angiotensinogen gene. Case-control studies were combined, using the Mantel and Haenszel approach. Joint P values for continuous variables were calculated by Stouffer's method. Continuous measurements reported in different units were expressed on a percentage scale using the intrastudy mean of the MM genotype as denominator. The computerized database used for this analysis included 69 reports with an overall sample size of 27,906 subjects. Overall, possession of the T allele was associated with an increased risk of hypertension. In comparison with the MM reference group (number of studies, n = 32), the excess risk was 31% (P = 0.001) in TT homozygotes and 11% (P = 0.03) in TM heterozygotes. The sensitivity analysis showed that this association was present only in whites (T allelic frequency, f = 42.2%), but not in blacks (f = 77.0%) or Asians (f = 78.0%). Atherosclerotic complications (n = 12), renal microvascular disorders (n = 13), cardiomyopathy (n = 2) or diabetic retinopathy (n = 3) were not correlated with the M235T polymorphism. Publication bias was observed for hypertension, but not for coronary heart disease, including myocardial infarction, and for microvascular nephropathy. Furthermore, in comparison with the MM control group, the circulating angiotensinogen levels (n = 8) were raised by 11 and 7% (P = 0.01) in TT and TM subjects, respectively. In contrast, plasma levels of the angiotensin I converting enzyme (n = 4) and body mass index (n = 15) were not associated with the T allele. The T allele encoding angiotensinogen is not associated with atherosclerotic or microvascular complications, but in Caucasians behaves as a marker for hypertension. This association, which may have been inflated by publication bias, does not necessarily imply causality. 	J._Hypertens.	D003160 D016428 D017418 D013485
16256386	20051101	Phenylketonuria mutations in Northern China.	Mutation spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) in Northern China is described with a discussion on genotype-phenotype correlation. By using PCR/SSCP and DNA sequencing, all exons of PAH gene in the 185 unrelated patients with PKU from Northern China were studied. A total of 70 different mutations, including 42 missense, 12 splice, 7 nonsense, 5 deletion, 3 insertion, and 1 silence/splice mutations, were detected in 349/370 mutant alleles (94.3%). Deletion, insertion, and frameshift mutations were found for the first time in China PKU patients. The mutations R243Q, EX6-96A&gt;G, R111X, Y356X, and R413P were the prevalent mutations with relative frequencies of 22.2, 11.1, 8.7, 6.5, and 6.5%, respectively. Fifteen novel mutations were identified in this study: I38fsX19, IVS4+3G&gt;C, Y154H, R157K, R157I, T200fsX6, Q267H, Q267E, F302fsX39, G346R, S349A, L367L, R400K, IVS12+4A&gt;G, and IVS12+6T&gt;A. Each of them occurs at very low frequency (0.3-1.1%). The mutation spectrum of PKU in Chinese is similar to other Asian populations but significantly different from European populations. Altogether, 70 different mutations are found in 109 genotypes distributed among 185 PKU patients. As shown by the analysis, the predicted residual activity found in the majority of PKU individuals match their in vivo phenotypes, though evidence is also found for both phenotypic inconsistencies among subjects with similar genotypes and discordance between the in vitro and in vivo effects of some mutant alleles. The study enables us to construct a national database in China serving as a valuable tool for genetic counseling and prognostic evaluation of future cases of PKU. 	Mol._Genet._Metab.	D016428 D013485
19770842	20090923	An inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 single-nucleotide polymorphism impairs the effect of mycophenolic acid.	Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a selective inhibitor of inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), the rate-limiting enzyme of de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides. The isoenzyme IMPDH2 predominates in activated lymphocytes, and its inhibition by MPA is part of standard immunosuppressive regimens. Yet, there are significant unexplained differences in efficacy and tolerability among patients. The objective of this study was to analyze whether frequent variants in the IMPDH2 gene lead to changes in IMPDH activity and to differences in responsiveness to MPA therapy. All 14 exons and intron-exon boundary regions of IMPDH2 were sequenced from genomic DNA probes from 100 healthy individuals. Two novel exonic single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in 1% and one intronic polymorphism (rs11706052) in 19% of the study population. Lymphocyte IMPDH activity and proliferation under three MPA concentrations (2.5, 10 and 25 micromol l(-1)) were compared in rs11706052 carriers and wild-type individuals. The presence of rs11706052 polymorphism reduced the antiproliferative effect of MPA on lymphocytes by approximately 50% compared with the IMPDH2 wild-type form at therapeutic relevant concentrations of 10 micromol l(-1) and 25 micromol l(-1). We conclude that a poorer response to MPA therapy can be explained in some individuals by the presence of the rs11706052 polymorphism. 	Pharmacogenomics_J.	D016428
7665593	19950915	Requirement of tyrosine residues 333 and 338 of the growth hormone (GH) receptor for selected GH-stimulated function.	We have examined the involvement of tyrosine residues 333 and 338 of the growth hormone (GH) receptor in the cellular response to GH. Stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell clones expressing a receptor with tyrosine residues at position 333 and 338 of the receptor substituted for phenylalanine (CHO-GHR1-638 Y333F, Y338F) were generated by cDNA transfection. Compared with the wild type receptor the Y333F,Y338F mutant possessed normal high affinity ligand binding, hormone internalization, and ligand-induced receptor down-regulation. GH activation of mitogen-associated protein kinase was also similar in CHO clones expressing similar wild type and Y333F,Y338F receptor number. However, two GH-regulated cellular events (lipogenesis, and protein synthesis) were deficient in the tyrosine substituted receptor. In contrast, transcriptional regulation by GH (as evidenced by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cDNA expression driven by the GH-responsive region of the SPI 2.1 gene) was not affected by Y333F,Y338F substitution. Thus we provide the first experimental evidence that specific tyrosine residues of the GH receptor are required for selected cellular responses to GH. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D003160 D016428 D013485
23541540	20130402	Whole-genome sequencing to identify transmission of Mycobacterium abscessus between patients with cystic fibrosis: a retrospective cohort study.	Increasing numbers of individuals with cystic fibrosis are becoming infected with the multidrug-resistant non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) Mycobacterium abscessus, which causes progressive lung damage and is extremely challenging to treat. How this organism is acquired is not currently known, but there is growing concern that person-to-person transmission could occur. We aimed to define the mechanisms of acquisition of M abscessus in individuals with cystic fibrosis. Whole genome sequencing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were done on 168 consecutive isolates of M abscessus from 31 patients attending an adult cystic fibrosis centre in the UK between 2007 and 2011. In parallel, we undertook detailed environmental testing for NTM and defined potential opportunities for transmission between patients both in and out of hospital using epidemiological data and social network analysis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two clustered outbreaks of near-identical isolates of the M abscessus subspecies massiliense (from 11 patients), differing by less than ten base pairs. This variation represents less diversity than that seen within isolates from a single individual, strongly indicating between-patient transmission. All patients within these clusters had numerous opportunities for within-hospital transmission from other individuals, while comprehensive environmental sampling, initiated during the outbreak, failed to detect any potential point source of NTM infection. The clusters of M abscessus subspecies massiliense showed evidence of transmission of mutations acquired during infection of an individual to other patients. Thus, isolates with constitutive resistance to amikacin and clarithromycin were isolated from several individuals never previously exposed to long-term macrolides or aminoglycosides, further indicating cross-infection. Whole genome sequencing has revealed frequent transmission of multidrug resistant NTM between patients with cystic fibrosis despite conventional cross-infection measures. Although the exact transmission route is yet to be established, our epidemiological analysis suggests that it could be indirect.

28811722	20170817	A polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) test to detect the common mutation (35delG) in the connexin-26 gene.	To develop a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based test for the detection of a common frame-shift mutation (35delG) in the connexin-26 (GJB2) gene, and to investigate the status of this mutation in Oman. A PCR test, based on site-directed mutagenesis, was developed for the 35delG mutation. A mutagenesis primer generated an EcoN I site in a short (87 bp) DNA fragment amplified from the connexin-26 gene. The EcoN I site is generated only if the 35delG mutation is present. Thus, a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the amplified DNA fragment with EcoN I allowed us to detect the 35delG mutation in the connexin 26 gene. After validating the test using quality control DNA samples, which contained the 35delG mutation in either homozygous or heterozygous form, 120 healthy subjects and 35 unrelated Omani patients with nosyndromic autosomal recessive deafness (NARD), were screened for 35delG mutation. The mutation was not present in any individual tested. We have been able to develop a new PCR-RFLP test for detecting the 35delG common mutation in the connexin 26 gene. Our preliminary results from application of this test on a limited number of Omani patients indicate that the 35delG mutation may not be associated with NARD in Oman. 	J_Sci_Res_Med_Sci	D016428

21702489	20110628	Kinetics of the self reaction of cyclohexyl radicals.	The kinetics of the self-reaction of cyclohexyl radicals was studied by laser photolysis/photoionization mass spectroscopy. Overall rate constants were obtained in direct real-time experiments in the temperature region 303-520 K and at bath gas (helium with up to 5% of radical precursors) densities (3.00-12.0) ? 10(16) molecules cm(-3). Cyclohexyl radicals were produced by a combination of the 193 nm photolysis of oxalyl chloride ((CClO)(2)) with the subsequent fast reaction of Cl atoms with cyclohexane, and their initial concentrations were determined from real-time profiles of HCl. The observed overall c-C(6)H(11) + c-C(6)H(11) rate constants demonstrate negative temperature dependence, which can be described by the following expressions: k(1) = 4.8 ? 10(-12) exp(+542 K/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), with estimated uncertainty of 16% over the 303-520 K temperature range. The fraction of disproportionation equal to 41 ? 7% was determined at 305 K; analysis of earlier experimental determinations of the disproportionation-to-recombination branching ratio leads to recommending this room-temperature value for other temperatures. The corresponding temperature dependences of the recombination (1a, bicyclohexyl product) and the disproportionation (1b, cyclohexene and cyclohexane products) channels are k(1a) = 2.8 ? 10(-12) exp(+542 K/T) and k(1b) = 2.0 ? 10(-12) exp(+542 K/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), with estimated uncertainties of 20% and 29%, respectively.

27530298	20160818	Differential 3-bromopyruvate inhibition of cytosolic and mitochondrial human serine hydroxymethyltransferase isoforms, key enzymes in cancer metabolic reprogramming.	The cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT1 and SHMT2, respectively) are well-recognized targets of cancer research, since their activity is critical for purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis and because of their prominent role in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells. Here we show that 3-bromopyruvate (3BP), a potent novel anti-tumour agent believed to function primarily by blocking energy metabolism, differentially inactivates human SHMT1 and SHMT2. SHMT1 is completely inhibited by 3BP, whereas SHMT2 retains a significant fraction of activity. Site directed mutagenesis experiments on SHMT1 demonstrate that selective inhibition relies on the presence of a cysteine residue at the active site of SHMT1 (Cys204) that is absent in SHMT2. Our results show that 3BP binds to SHMT1 active site, forming an enzyme-3BP complex, before reacting with Cys204. The physiological substrate l-serine is still able to bind at the active site of the inhibited enzyme, although catalysis does not occur. Modelling studies suggest that alkylation of Cys204 prevents a productive binding of l-serine, hampering interaction between substrate and Arg402. Conversely, the partial inactivation of SHMT2 takes place without the formation of a 3BP-enzyme complex. The introduction of a cysteine residue in the active site of SHMT2 by site directed mutagenesis (A206C mutation), at a location corresponding to that of Cys204 in SHMT1, yields an enzyme that forms a 3BP-enzyme complex and is completely inactivated. This work sets the basis for the development of selective SHMT1 inhibitors that target Cys204, starting from the structure and reactivity of 3BP. 	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D013485
26019984	20150529	Impact of TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1 and SETBP1 mutations on survival of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.	Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myeloid neoplasm classified in the myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) category. Molecular abnormalities are reported in about 90?% of patients with CMML. ASXL1 and SETBP1 mutations, but not TET2 or SFRS2 mutations are reported to be associated with prognosis. We studied frequency of TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1 and SETBP1 mutations in 145 patients with CMML using Sanger sequencing, and determined the prognostic factors for OS. We also identified the predictive value of ASXL1 mutations (frameshift and nonsense mutations) through comparing the Mayo Prognostic Model with the Mayo Molecular Model. Forty-seven (32?%) had a mutation in TET2, 42 (29?%), a mutation in SRSF2, 65 (45?%), a mutation (nonsense and frame-shift) in ASXL1 and 26 (18?%), a mutation in SETBP1. Significant variables in multivariable analysis of survival included ASXL1 (HR?=?1.99 [1.20-3.28]; P?=?0.007), hemoglobin &lt;100?g/L (HR?=?2.42 [1.40-4.19]; P?=?0.002) and blood immature myeloid cells (IMCs) (HR?=?2.08 [1.25-3.46]; P?=?0.005). When our patients were analyzed using the Mayo Prognostic Model median OS were not reached, 26?months and 15?months (P?=?0.014). An analysis using the Mayo Molecular Model identified 4 cohorts with median OS of not reached, 70?months, 26?months and 11?months (P?&lt;?0.001). Data fitting using our patients suggest the Molecular Mayo Model has significantly higher survival predictive power compared with Mayo Prognostic Model (P?&lt;?0.001, -2 log-likelihood ratios of 538.070 and 552.260). There were high frequencies of mutations in TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1 and SETBP1 in patients with CMML. With the addition of ASXL1 frameshift and nonsense mutations, the Mayo Molecular Model fitted better than Mayo Prognostic Model of our patients. 	Exp_Hematol_Oncol	D016428
22532702	20120426	Intermediate phenotype analysis of patients, unaffected siblings, and healthy controls identifies VMAT2 as a candidate gene for psychotic disorder and neurocognition.	Psychotic disorders are associated with neurocognitive alterations that aggregate in unaffected family members, suggesting that genetic vulnerability to psychotic disorder impacts neurocognition. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether selected schizophrenia candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with (1) neurocognitive functioning across populations at different genetic risk for psychosis (2) and psychotic disorder. The association between 152 SNPs in 43 candidate genes and a composite measure of neurocognitive functioning was examined in 718 patients with psychotic disorder. Follow-up analyses were carried out in 750 unaffected siblings and 389 healthy comparison subjects. In the patients, 13 associations between SNPs and cognitive functioning were significant at P &lt; .05, situated in DRD1, DRD3, SLC6A3, BDNF, FGF2, SLC18A2, FKBP5, and DNMT3B. Follow-up of these SNPs revealed a significant and directionally similar association for SLC18A2 (alternatively VMAT2) rs363227 in siblings (B = -0.13, P = .04) and a trend association in control subjects (B = -0.10, P = .12). This association was accompanied by a significantly increased risk for psychotic disorder associated with the T allele (linear OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.10-2.07, P = .01), which was reduced when covarying for cognitive performance (OR = 1.29, 95% CI 0.92-1.81, P = .14), suggesting mediation. Genetic variation in VMAT2 may be linked to alterations in cognitive functioning underlying psychotic disorder, possibly through altered transport of monoamines into synaptic vesicles.

18382475	20080403	Identification of a founder mutation in TPM3 in nemaline myopathy patients of Turkish origin.	To date, six genes are known to cause nemaline (rod) myopathy (NM), a rare congenital neuromuscular disorder. In an attempt to find a seventh gene, we performed linkage and subsequent sequence analyses in 12 Turkish families with recessive NM. We found homozygosity in two of the families at 1q12-21.2, a region encompassing the gamma-tropomyosin gene (TPM3) encoding slow skeletal muscle alpha-tropomyosin, a known NM gene. Sequencing revealed homozygous deletion of the first nucleotide of the last exon, c.913delA of TPM3 in both families. The mutation removes the last nucleotide before the stop codon, causing a frameshift and readthrough across the termination signal. The encoded alphaTm(slow) protein is predicted to be 73 amino acids longer than normal, and the extension to the protein is hypothesised to be unable to form a coiled coil. The resulting tropomyosin protein may therefore be non-functional. The affected children in both families were homozygous for the mutation, while the healthy parents were mutation carriers. Both of the patients in Family 1 had the severe form of NM, and also an unusual chest deformity. The affected children in Family 2 had the intermediate form of NM. Muscle biopsies showed type 1 (slow) fibres to be markedly smaller than type 2 (fast) fibres. Previously, there had been five reports, only, of NM caused by mutations in TPM3. The mutation reported here is the first deletion to be identified in TPM3, and it is likely to be a founder mutation in the Turkish population. 	Eur._J._Hum._Genet.	D002363 D016428 D052061 D013485
18834346	20081007	Manganese superoxide dismutase gene polymorphism, MnSOD plasma levels and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer.	We aimed to confirm any relation between the manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) polymorphism and risk of ovarian carcinoma as well as to demonstrate any relation between the MnSOD mitochondrial signal sequence polymorphism and plasma MnSOD enzyme levels in women with ovarian carcinoma and healthy subjects. In a population-based case - control study, we compared 55 cases with ovarian carcinoma and 51 controls regarding the occurrence of the C/T (alanine/valine, A/V) substitution at the -9 position in the mitochondrial signal sequence of the MnSOD gene. Polymerase chain reaction, restriction fragment length polymorphism and Nu-Sieve agarose gel electrophoresis were utilized to perform genotyping. Additionally, MnSOD plasma levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methodology. There were no statistically significant elevated risks associated with V or A alleles. No statistically significant association between the alleles and plasma MnSOD levels were found. Overall plasma MnSOD levels were found to be significantly higher in the patient group. Although in this study, patients with ovarian carcinoma had significantly higher plasma MnSOD levels than the control group (P&lt;0.001), no influence of the allelic distribution on plasma MnSOD levels could be detected in either group. Our results are in disagreement with earlier findings that there was an association between the A allele and increased risk for ovarian carcinoma. Thus, an extended study for a possible association between the MnSOD diallelic polymorphism and risk of ovarian cancer may be warranted. 	J._Obstet._Gynaecol._Res.	D016428 D013485
26354767	20150911	Dependence of Human Colorectal Cells Lacking the FBW7 Tumor Suppressor on the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint.	FBW7 (F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7), also known as FBXW7 or hCDC4, is a tumor suppressor gene mutated in a broad spectrum of cancer cell types. As a component of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase, FBW7 is responsible for specifically recognizing phosphorylated substrates, many important for tumor progression, and targeting them for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Although the role of FBW7 as a tumor suppressor is well established, less well studied is how FBW7-mutated cancer cells might be targeted for selective killing. To explore this further, we undertook a genome-wide RNAi screen using WT and FBW7 knockout colorectal cell lines and identified the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) protein BUBR1, as a candidate synthetic lethal target. We show here that asynchronous FBW7 knockout cells have increased levels of mitotic APC/C substrates and are sensitive to knockdown of not just BUBR1 but BUB1 and MPS1, other known SAC components, suggesting a dependence of these cells on the mitotic checkpoint. Consistent with this dependence, knockdown of BUBR1 in cells lacking FBW7 results in significant cell aneuploidy and increases in p53 levels. The FBW7 substrate cyclin E was necessary for the genetic interaction with BUBR1. In contrast, the establishment of this dependence on the SAC requires the deregulation of multiple substrates of FBW7. Our work suggests that FBW7 knockout cells are vulnerable in their dependence on the mitotic checkpoint and that this may be a good potential target to exploit in FBW7-mutated cancer cells.

25789623	20150320	Association of TLR5 gene polymorphisms in ulcerative colitis patients of north India and their role in cytokine homeostasis.	In health, TLR signaling protects the intestinal epithelial barrier and in disease, aberrant TLR signaling stimulates diverse inflammatory responses. Association of TLR polymorphisms is ethnicity dependent but how they impact the complex pathogenesis of IBD is not clearly defined. So we propose to study the status of polymorphisms in TLR family of genes and their effect on cytokines level in UC patients. The genotypes of the six loci TLR1-R80T, TLR2-R753Q, TLR3-S258G, TLR5-R392X, TLR5-N592S and TLR6-S249P were determined in 350 controls and 328 UC patients by PCR-RFLP and sequencing. Cytokine levels were measured by ELISA in blood plasma samples. Data were analyzed statistically by SPSS software. TLR5 variants R392X and N592S showed significant association (p = 0.007, 0.021) with UC patients but TLR 1, 2, 3, 6 variants did not show any association. Unlike other studies carried out in different ethnic groups, TLR 6 (S249P) SNP was universally present in our population irrespective of disease. Genotype-phenotype correlation analysis revealed that the patients having combination of multiple SNPs both in TLR5 and TLR4 gene suffered from severe disease condition and diagnosed at an early age. The level of TNF? (p = 0.004), IL-6 (p = 0.0001) and IFN? (p = 0.006) significantly increased in patients as compared to controls having wild genotypes for the studied SNPs. However, there was decreased level of TNF? (p = 0.014), IL-6 (p = 0.028) and IFN? (p = 0.001) in patients carrying TLR5-R392X variant as compared to wild type patients. Patients carrying two simultaneous SNPs D299G in TLR4 gene and N592S in TLR5 gene showed significant decrease in the levels of TNF? (p = 0.011) and IFN? (p = 0.016). Polymorphisms in TLR 5 genes were significantly associated with the UC in North Indian population. The cytokine level was significantly modulated in patients with different genotypes of TLR4 and TLR5 SNPs. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485

24348637	20131219	Substitution rtq267h of hepatitis B virus increases the weight of replication and Lamivudine resistance.	Nucleus(t)ide analogs (NAs), containing Lamivudine (LMV), adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), endeavor (ETV), telbivudine (LdT), and tenofovir (TDF) are widely used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), but long term anti-Hepatitis B virus (HBV) therapy with NAs may give rise to the emergence of drug-resistant viral mutants. This study aimed to find and identify some new resistance mutations of HBV from the patients accepted anti-HBV therapy. The reverse transcriptase (RT) coding region of HBV was PCR-amplified using HBV DNA extracted from patients' blood samples and sequenced. Nineteen substitution mutations were detected. Among them, rtQ267H was often observed in patients receiving LMV administration. This LMV therapy-related mutation was introduced into HBV replication-competent plasmids. The in vitro susceptibility of both wild-type (WT) and mutant-type (MT) HBV to NAs was analyzed by Southern blot, and/or quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The rtQ267H substitution enhanced HBV replication not merely in single-site mutation, but also in multisite mutations. The in vitro susceptibility analysis showed that the existence of rtQ267H in WT and LMV-resistant (LMVr) HBV were responsible for the reduced susceptibility to LMV to varying degrees, and enhanced HBV replication capacity. However, HBV harbored this substitution retained normal susceptibility to ADV, LdT, ETV, and TDF. The result suggested that rtQ267H is a potential adaptive mutation of HBV to LMV. 	Hepat_Mon	D016428
26467378	20151016	The association of paraoxonase 1 gene L55M polymorphism with the extent and severity of coronary artery disease in the Turkish population and its dependence on gender.	Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common, complex, and progressive disorder characterized by the accumulation of lipids and fibrous elements in the arteries. It is one of the leading causes of death in industrialized nations. Oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the arterial wall plays an important role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Paraoxonase1 (PON1) is involved in lipid metabolism and is believed to protect LDL oxidation. In our study, we aimed to clarify the relationship between PON1 gene L55M polymorphism and the extent and severity of CAD. In total, 114 patients (54 males, mean age: 56.7 ? 12.0 years; 60 females, mean age: 55.7 ? 13.2 years) with stable angina or angina equivalent symptoms were enrolled in this prospective study. Cardiological evaluation was performed with electrocardiogram and transthoracic echocardiogram. The presence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and smoking status were ascertained. The patients were grouped according to their Gensini scores and gender. Genetic analysis of the PON1 gene L55M polymorphism was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. We determined that the LL genotype was more prevalent in patients with Gensini score higher than or equal to 20 (p=0.026) and that this correlated with severe atherosclerotic coronary artery lesions in both gender groups, reaching a statistical significance in the female subjects (p=0.038). It was thought that the PON1 gene L55M polymorphism plays a significant role in CAD progression, especially in females. 	Anatol_J_Cardiol	D016428 D013485
21264249	20110126	Multicolor combinatorial probe coding for real-time PCR.	The target volume of multiplex real-time PCR assays is limited by the number of fluorescent dyes available and the number of fluorescence acquisition channels present in the PCR instrument. We hereby explored a probe labeling strategy that significantly increased the target volume of real-time PCR detection in one reaction. The labeling paradigm, termed &quot;Multicolor Combinatorial Probe Coding&quot; (MCPC), uses a limited number (n) of differently colored fluorophores in various combinations to label each probe, enabling one of 2(n)-1 genetic targets to be detected in one reaction. The proof-of-principle of MCPC was validated by identification of one of each possible 15 human papillomavirus types, which is the maximum target number theoretically detectable by MCPC with a 4-color channel instrument, in one reaction. MCPC was then improved from a one-primer-pair setting to a multiple-primer-pair format through Homo-Tag Assisted Non-Dimer (HAND) system to allow multiple primer pairs to be included in one reaction. This improvement was demonstrated via identification of one of the possible 10 foodborne pathogen candidates with 10 pairs of primers included in one reaction, which had limit of detection equivalent to the uniplex PCR. MCPC was further explored in detecting combined genotypes of five ?-globin gene mutations where multiple targets were co-amplified. MCPC strategy could expand the scope of real-time PCR assays in applications which are unachievable by current labeling strategy. 	PLoS_ONE	D023362 D016428 D013485
25622042	20150127	Optical coherence tomography identifies lower labial salivary gland surface density in cystic fibrosis.	The labial minor salivary glands (LSGs) are easily accessible mucus-secreting structures of the alimentary tract that may provide new information on the basis of gastrointestinal complications of cystic fibrosis (CF). It was shown that they are destructed in the course of cystic fibrosis. We employed wide-field, micrometer resolution in vivo optical coherence tomography to assess the surface density of LSGs in 18 patients with CF and 18 healthy subjects. The median LSGs' surface densities in CF patients, and in the control group were 4.32 glands/cm2 and 6.58 glands/cm2, respectively (p = 0.006; Mann-Whitney U test). A lower LSG surface density is a previously unrecognized CF-related pathology of the alimentary tract. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
21179472	20101224	Histone deacetylase inhibitors downregulate checkpoint kinase 1 expression to induce cell death in non-small cell lung cancer cells.	Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) are promising anticancer drugs; however, the molecular mechanisms leading to HDACi-induced cell death have not been well understood and no clear mechanism of resistance has been elucidated to explain limited efficacy of HDACis in clinical trials. Here, we show that protein levels of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), which has a major role in G(2) cell cycle checkpoint regulation, was markedly reduced at the protein and transcriptional levels in lung cancer cells treated with pan-and selective HDACis LBH589, scriptaid, valproic acid, apicidin, and MS-275. In HDACi treated cells Chk1 function was impaired as determined by decreased inhibitory phosphorylation of cdc25c and its downstream target cdc2 and increased expression of cdc25A and phosphorylated histone H3, a marker of mitotic entry. In time course experiments, Chk1 downregulation occurred after HDACi treatment, preceding apoptosis. Ectopic expression of Chk1 overcame HDACi-induced cell death, and pretreating cells with the cdc2 inhibitor purvalanol A blocked entry into mitosis and prevented cell death by HDACis. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of Chk1 showed strong synergistic effect with LBH589 in lung cancer cells. These results define a pathway through which Chk1 inhibition can mediate HDACi-induced mitotic entry and cell death and suggest that Chk1 could be an early pharmacodynamic marker to assess HDACi efficacy in clinical samples.

26362309	20150913	Neprilysin Confers Genetic Susceptibility to Alzheimer's Disease in Han Chinese.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, with increasing incidence all over the world. Amyloid-? (A?) was considered to be the original cause to AD, and many reported pathogenic or risk genes for AD were located in the A? generation and degradation pathways. Neprilysin (NEP), insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) are the most important A?-degrading proteases. Accumulating genetic evidence suggested that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of these genes confer susceptibility to AD in Caucasian populations. In this study, we screened eight SNPs within these three A?-degrading protease genes in 1475 individuals of two independent Han Chinese case-control cohorts. SNP rs1816558 of NEP was found to be significantly associated with AD after adjustment for ?4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE?4) and the Bonferroni correction. The remaining variants were not associated with risk of AD in Han Chinese sample set. Further data mining revealed that messenger RNA (mRNA) level of NEP substantially increased during the development of AD and was positively correlated with APP expression. The combined results indicated that NEP confers genetic susceptibility to AD in Han Chinese populations. 	Mol._Neurobiol.	D016428 D017418 D013485
10369771	19990617	Identification of a discrete intermediate in the assembly/disassembly of physalis mottle tymovirus through mutational analysis.	Assembly intermediates of icosahedral viruses are usually transient and are difficult to identify. In the present investigation, site-specific and deletion mutants of the coat protein gene of physalis mottle tymovirus (PhMV) were used to delineate the role of specific amino acid residues in the assembly of the virus and to identify intermediates in this process. N-terminal 30, 34, 35 and 39 amino acid deletion and single C-terminal (N188) deletion mutant proteins of PhMV were expressed in Escherichia coli. Site-specific mutants H69A, C75A, W96A, D144N, D144N-T151A, K143E and N188A were also constructed and expressed. The mutant protein lacking 30 amino acid residues from the N terminus self-assembled to T=3 particles in vivo while deletions of 34, 35 and 39 amino acid residues resulted in the mutant proteins that were insoluble. Interestingly, the coat protein (pR PhCP) expressed using pRSET B vector with an additional 41 amino acid residues at the N terminus also assembled into T=3 particles that were more compact and had a smaller diameter. These results demonstrate that the amino-terminal segment is flexible and either the deletion or addition of amino acid residues at the N terminus does not affect T=3 capsid assembly. In contrast, the deletion of even a single residue from the C terminus (PhN188Delta1) resulted in capsids that were unstable. These capsids disassembled to a discrete intermediate with a sedimentation coefficent of 19.4 S. However, the replacement of C-terminal asparagine 188 by alanine led to the formation of stable capsids. The C75A and D144N mutant proteins also assembled into capsids that were as stable as the pR PhCP, suggesting that C75 and D144 are not crucial for the T=3 capsid assembly. pR PhW96A and pR PhD144N-T151A mutant proteins failed to form capsids and were present as heterogeneous aggregates. Interestingly, the pR PhK143E mutant protein behaved in a manner similar to the C-terminal deletion protein in forming unstable capsids. The intermediate with an s value of 19.4 S was the major assembly product of pR PhH69A mutant protein and could correspond to a 30mer. It is possible that the assembly or disassembly is arrested at a similar stage in pR PhN188Delta1, pR PhH69A and pR PhK143E mutant proteins. 	J._Mol._Biol.	D016428 D013485
24863735	20140528	Generation of aminoterminally truncated, stable types of bioactive bovine and porcine fibroblast growth factor 4 in Escherichia coli.	Fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) is a crucial growth factor for the development of mammalian embryos. We previously produced hexahistidine-tagged, bovine and porcine FGF4 (Pro(32) to Leu(206) ) proteins without a secretory signal peptide at the aminoterminus in Escherichia coli. Here, we found that these were unstable; site-specific cleavage between Ser(54) and Leu(55) in both FGF4 derivatives was identified. In order to generate stable FGF4 derivatives and to investigate their biological activities, aminoterminally truncated and hexahistidine-tagged bovine and porcine FGF4 (Leu(55) to Leu(206) ) proteins, termed HisbFGF4L and HispFGF4L, respectively, were produced in E. coli. These FGF4 derivatives were sufficiently stable and exerted mitogenic activities in fibroblasts. Treatment with the FGF4 derivatives promoted the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which are crucial kinases in the FGF signaling pathway. In the presence of PD173074, an FGF receptor inhibitor, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was inhibited and resulted in abolition of the growth-promoting activity of FGF4 derivatives. Taken together, we demonstrate that HisbFGF4L and HispFGF4L are capable of promoting the proliferation of bovine- and porcine-derived cells, respectively, via an authentic FGF signaling pathway. These FGF4 derivatives may be applicable for dissecting the roles of FGF4 during embryogenesis in cattle and pigs. 	Biotechnol._Appl._Biochem.	D016428 D013485
20438806	20100505	Association analysis of GRIN1 and GRIN2B polymorphisms and Parkinson's disease in a hospital-based case-control study.	Hyperactivation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) leads to neuronal excitotoxicity and is suggested to play a role in many brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. However, the association between polymorphisms in the genes that code for NMDAR subunits, N-methyl-d-aspartate 1 and 2B (GRIN1 and GRIN2B) and Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. In a hospital-based case-control study of PD, DNA samples were collected from 101 PD patients and 205 healthy controls. Genotyping assays were used to screen for polymorphisms in the GRIN1 (rs2301364 T&gt;C, rs28489906 T&gt;C, and rs4880213 T&gt;C) and GRIN2B (C366G, C2664T, and rs1805476 T&gt;G) genes, and logistic regression analysis was then used to assess the association between these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and PD susceptibility. None of the 6 SNPs were significantly associated with PD risk on their own. However, in conjunction with putative low-risk genotypes for the GRIN1 gene, the GRIN2BC366G variant was significantly associated with reduced PD risk compared with the homozygous genotype 366CC (OR=0.38, 95%CI=0.17-0.93, P=0.033). A synergistic effect on risk reduction was observed in subjects who carried multiple polymorphisms of GRIN1 and the GRIN2BC366G polymorphism (OR=0.78, 95%CI=0.59-1.02, P(trend)=0.073). Our results suggest that polymorphisms in the GRIN1 and GRIN2B genes may serve as potential biomarkers for a reduced risk of PD among the Chinese population in Taiwan. 	Neurosci._Lett.

23853666	20130716	Clinical Applications of Omics Technologies on ZHENG Differentiation Research in Traditional Chinese Medicine.	Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) ZHENG is the basic concept of TCM theory. The effectiveness of TCM treatment depends on the accuracy of ZHENG differentiation. ZHENG differentiation, using the &quot;four diagnostic methods,&quot; has the drawbacks of subjectivity and variability. Following development of omics technologies, which study the functional activities of human body from a system-wide perspective, it has been more and more applied in study of objectivity differentiating TCM ZHENG and understanding its biological mechanisms. This paper reviewed the literatures of clinical TCM ZHENG differentiation researches, underlying omics technologies, and indicated the increased trends of related articles with four kinds of omics technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, and the correlations between ZHENG differentiation and findings in omics studies. Moreover, the paper summarized the typical omics application in common studied diseases and TCM ZHENGs and discussed the main problems and countermeasure of ZHENG differentiation researches. The work here may provide a reference for further research of TCM ZHENG differentiation using omics technologies. 	Evid_Based_Complement_Alternat_Med	D016428
25136926	20140820	Nitrite and hydroxylamine as nitrogenase substrates: mechanistic implications for the pathway of N? reduction.	Investigations of reduction of nitrite (NO2(-)) to ammonia (NH3) by nitrogenase indicate a limiting stoichiometry, NO2(-) + 6e(-) + 12ATP + 7H(+) ? NH3 + 2H2O + 12ADP + 12Pi. Two intermediates freeze-trapped during NO2(-) turnover by nitrogenase variants and investigated by Q-band ENDOR/ESEEM are identical to states, denoted H and I, formed on the pathway of N2 reduction. The proposed NO2(-) reduction intermediate hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is a nitrogenase substrate for which the H and I reduction intermediates also can be trapped. Viewing N2 and NO2(-) reductions in light of their common reduction intermediates and of NO2(-) reduction by multiheme cytochrome c nitrite reductase (ccNIR) leads us to propose that NO2(-) reduction by nitrogenase begins with the generation of NO2H bound to a state in which the active-site FeMo-co (M) has accumulated two [e(-)/H(+)] (E2), stored as a (bridging) hydride and proton. Proton transfer to NO2H and H2O loss leaves M-[NO(+)]; transfer of the E2 hydride to the [NO(+)] directly to form HNO bound to FeMo-co is one of two alternative means for avoiding formation of a terminal M-[NO] thermodynamic &quot;sink&quot;. The N2 and NO2(-) reduction pathways converge upon reduction of NH2NH2 and NH2OH bound states to form state H with [-NH2] bound to M. Final reduction converts H to I, with NH3 bound to M. The results presented here, combined with the parallels with ccNIR, support a N2 fixation mechanism in which liberation of the first NH3 occurs upon delivery of five [e(-)/H(+)] to N2, but a total of seven [e(-)/H(+)] to FeMo-co when obligate H2 evolution is considered, and not earlier in the reduction process.

27280445	20160610	Molecular and Morpho-Agronomical Characterization of Root Architecture at Seedling and Reproductive Stages for Drought Tolerance in Wheat.	Water availability is a major limiting factor for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production in rain-fed agricultural systems worldwide. Root architecture is important for water and nutrition acquisition for all crops, including wheat. A set of 158 diverse wheat genotypes of Australian (72) and Indian (86) origin were studied for morpho-agronomical traits in field under irrigated and drought stress conditions during 2010-11 and 2011-12.Out of these 31 Indian wheat genotypes comprising 28 hexaploid (Triticum aestivum L.) and 3 tetraploid (T. durum) were characterized for root traits at reproductive stage in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes. Roots of drought tolerant genotypes grew upto137cm (C306) as compared to sensitive one of 63cm with a mean value of 94.8cm. Root architecture traits of four drought tolerant (C306, HW2004, HD2888 and NI5439) and drought sensitive (HD2877, HD2012, HD2851 and MACS2496) genotypes were also observed at 6 and 9 days old seedling stage. The genotypes did not show any significant variation for root traits except for longer coleoptiles and shoot and higher absorptive surface area in drought tolerant genotypes. The visible evaluation of root images using WinRhizo Tron root scanner of drought tolerant genotype HW2004 indicated compact root system with longer depth while drought sensitive genotype HD2877 exhibited higher horizontal root spread and less depth at reproductive stage. Thirty SSR markers were used to study genetic variation which ranged from 0.12 to 0.77 with an average value of 0.57. The genotypes were categorized into three subgroups as highly tolerant, sensitive, moderately sensitive and tolerant as intermediate group based on UPGMA cluster, STRUCTURE and principal coordinate analyses. The genotypic clustering was positively correlated to grouping based on root and morpho-agronomical traits. The genetic variability identified in current study demonstrated these traits can be used to improve drought tolerance and association mapping. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428
27277422	20160610	A novel DNMT1 mutation associated with early onset hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy, cataplexy, cerebellar atrophy, scleroderma, endocrinopathy, and common variable immune deficiency.	DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is an enzyme which has a role in methylation of DNA, gene regulation, and chromatin stability. Missense mutations in the DNMT1 gene have been previously associated with two neurological syndromes: hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1 with dementia and deafness (HSAN1E) and autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and narcolepsy (ADCA-DN). We report a case showing overlap of both of these syndromes plus associated clinical features of common variable immune deficiency, scleroderma, and endocrinopathy that could also be mutation associated. Our patient was found to be heterozygous for a previously unreported frameshift mutation, c.1635_1637delCAA p.(Asn545del) in the DNMT1 gene exon 20. This case displays both the first frameshift mutation described in the literature which is associated with a phenotype with a high degree of overlap between HSAN1E and ADCA-DN and early age of onset (c. 8 years). Our case is also of interest as the patient displays a number of new non-neurological features, which could also be DNMT1 mutation related. 	J._Peripher._Nerv._Syst.	D002363
15640114	20050111	Study on SNP of melanocyte stimulating hormone receptor gene in several Chinese indigenous sheep breeds using DHPLC.	Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of melanocyte stimulating hormone receptor (MSHR) gene was studied by sequencing and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) in Mongolian sheep, Kazakstan sheep, Tan sheep and Tibetan sheep. The results showed that there is a mutation at position 317 (T317C) within the length of 415bp and the DHPLC is a high-throughput and simple method for screening this mutation. The heterozygote (TC) with shoulder peak could be detected quickly at the first time of DHPLC, and two homozygotes (TT or CC) could be discriminated easily through two times of DHPLC when each homozygous DNA was mixed with a known homozygous reference sample at the second time of DHPLC. All of the populations for this site are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The results also indicated that Mongolian sheep and Kazakstan sheep had close relationship, Tibetan sheep and Tan sheep had close relationship. The relationship among breeds was consistent with that of microsatellite DNA. 	Yi_Chuan	D016428 D013485
24824546	20140515	Factors associated with weight gain in people with type 2 diabetes starting on insulin.	Moderate weight gain is usual after starting insulin therapy. The identification and quantification of factors associated with weight gain may help target strategies for avoidance of weight gain. The noninterventional CREDIT (Cardiovascular Risk Evaluation in people with type 2 Diabetes on Insulin Therapy) study included data from people with type 2 diabetes starting any insulin in 314 centers, in 12 countries. From a number of predefined candidate explanatory variables, analyses identified factors associated with weight gain 1 year after starting insulin treatment, after adjusting for investigational site as a random factor. A multivariable backward regression analysis selected a subset of these factors associated with weight gain. We studied the 2,179 people with data for body weight change at 1 year and for potential predictive factors. The mean weight gain was 1.78 kg, and 24% gained ?5.0 kg. Baseline factors associated with weight gain were BMI, A1C, insulin regimen, insulin dose, other glucose-lowering therapies, and hypertension; at 1 year, additional factors were A1C, insulin regimen, insulin dose, and use of other glucose-lowering therapies. In multivariable analysis, weight gain at 1 year was associated with a higher A1C at baseline, a higher insulin dose at baseline and at 1 year, and a lower baseline BMI. By the time insulin was started, a high baseline A1C and insulin dose requirements were independently associated with greater weight gain, as was lower baseline BMI. Insulin regimen per se was not a predictive factor. 	Diabetes_Care	D016430 D016428 D016448 D013485
7695296	19950101	Single amino acid replacements at positions altered in naturally occurring extended-spectrum TEM beta-lactamases.	By directed mutagenesis, we constructed a set of seven TEM-1 derivatives containing single replacements in each one of the amino acids substituted in naturally occurring extended-spectrum TEM beta-lactamases. The exact contribution of each mutation to the resistance phenotype was determined. In addition, mutant enzyme production and stabilities were studied. Five of seven mutations determined to some extent variations in cephalosporin and/or monobactam activity. Dramatic changes in the hydrolysis of ceftazidime and aztreonam occurred when a serine was at position 164. Changes at positions 104, 238, and 240 showed more leaky variation in activity towards cephalosporins and aztreonam. Replacements at positions 237 and 265 caused no variation in susceptibility to cephalosporins. Interestingly, the change from Gln to Lys at position 39 found in TEM-2, classically considered a neutral change, slightly but consistently increased the MIC of ceftazidime and aztreonam. The in vitro construction of mutations appearing in naturally occurring TEM-beta-lactamases, studied in the same genetic context, may help to understand the evolution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.

26648256	20151210	Signal transduction in light-oxygen-voltage receptors lacking the adduct-forming cysteine residue.	Light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) receptors sense blue light through the photochemical generation of a covalent adduct between a flavin-nucleotide chromophore and a strictly conserved cysteine residue. Here we show that, after cysteine removal, the circadian-clock LOV-protein Vivid still undergoes light-induced dimerization and signalling because of flavin photoreduction to the neutral semiquinone (NSQ). Similarly, photoreduction of the engineered LOV histidine kinase YF1 to the NSQ modulates activity and downstream effects on gene expression. Signal transduction in both proteins hence hinges on flavin protonation, which is common to both the cysteinyl adduct and the NSQ. This general mechanism is also conserved by natural cysteine-less, LOV-like regulators that respond to chemical or photoreduction of their flavin cofactors. As LOV proteins can react to light even when devoid of the adduct-forming cysteine, modern LOV photoreceptors may have arisen from ancestral redox-active flavoproteins. The ability to tune LOV reactivity through photoreduction may have important implications for LOV mechanism and optogenetic applications. 	Nat_Commun	D016428 D052061 D013485
14642631	20031204	Selection of a hepatitis B virus strain resistant to adefovir in a liver transplantation patient.	In contrast to lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) therapy is associated with delayed and infrequent selection of drug resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV). A 52 year-old man was treated with lamivudine for an HBV recurrence on his liver graft. A viral breakthrough was observed and the patient received ADV. Serum HBV DNA decreased rapidly and lamivudine was discontinued while ADV monotherapy was maintained. Serum HBV DNA levels remained suppressed until a second breakthrough was observed. Lamivudine was then reintroduced together with ADV, and serum HBV DNA became undetectable by polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analyses of the HBV polymerase gene revealed a sequential selection of lamivudine resistance mutations L180M+M204V, followed by a reversion to wild-type, and subsequently the selection of a novel adefovir resistance mutation N236T. Phenotypic analyses in cell culture assays demonstrated that the HBV isolates at the time of ADV breakthrough had reduced susceptibility to ADV. This mutant remained sensitive to lamivudine, entecavir and emtricitabine in vitro. We describe the first case of sequential selection of lamivudine and adefovir resistant strains of HBV in a liver transplantation patient. The selection of the N236T polymerase mutant was associated with resistance to ADV but remained sensitive to lamivudine in vitro and in vivo. 	J._Hepatol.	D002363 D016428 D013485
24089628	20131004	Quinolinic acid: an endogenous neurotoxin with multiple targets.	Quinolinic acid (QUIN), a neuroactive metabolite of the kynurenine pathway, is normally presented in nanomolar concentrations in human brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and is often implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of human neurological diseases. QUIN is an agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, and it has a high in vivo potency as an excitotoxin. In fact, although QUIN has an uptake system, its neuronal degradation enzyme is rapidly saturated, and the rest of extracellular QUIN can continue stimulating the NMDA receptor. However, its toxicity cannot be fully explained by its activation of NMDA receptors it is likely that additional mechanisms may also be involved. In this review we describe some of the most relevant targets of QUIN neurotoxicity which involves presynaptic receptors, energetic dysfunction, oxidative stress, transcription factors, cytoskeletal disruption, behavior alterations, and cell death.

24968701	20140628	CYP19 gene variant confers susceptibility to endometriosis-associated infertility in Chinese women.	An aromatase encoded by the CYP19 gene catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of estrogens, which is related to endometriosis development. To assess the association of CYP19 gene polymorphisms with the risks of endometriosis, chocolate cysts and endometriosis-related infertility, a case-control study was conducted in Chinese Han women by recruiting 225 healthy control females, 146 patients with endometriosis, 94 endometriosis women with chocolate cyst and 65 women with infertility resulting from endometriosis, as diagnosed by both pathological and laparoscopic findings. Individual genotypes at rs2236722:T&gt;C, rs700518:A&gt;G, rs10046:T&gt;C and [TTTA]n polymorphisms were identified. Allelic and genotypic frequencies were compared between the control group and case groups by chi-square analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were determined by logistic regression analysis to predict the association of CYP19 gene polymorphisms with the risk of endometriosis, the related chocolate cysts and infertility. The genotype distributions of the tested CYP19 gene polymorphisms were not significantly different between the healthy control group and the endometriosis/endometriosis with the chocolate cyst group. However, the CYP19 rs700518AA genotype was significantly associated with an increased risk of endometriosis-related infertility (55.4% in the infertility group vs 25.3% in the control group, P&lt;0.001; OR (95% CI): 3.66 (2.06-6.50)) under the recessive form of the A allele. Therefore, we concluded that in Chinese Han females CYP19 gene polymorphisms are not associated with susceptibility to endometriosis or chocolate cysts, whereas CYP19 rs700518AA genotype confers genetic susceptibility to endometriosis-related infertility.

24454911	20140124	Analysis of novel NEFL mRNA targeting microRNAs in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease characterized by progressive motor neuron degeneration and neurofilament aggregate formation. Spinal motor neurons in ALS also show a selective suppression in the levels of low molecular weight neurofilament (NEFL) mRNA. We have been interested in investigating the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in NEFL transcript stability. MiRNAs are small, 20-25 nucleotide, non-coding RNAs that act as post-transcriptional gene regulators by targeting the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of mRNA resulting in mRNA decay or translational silencing. In this study, we characterized putative novel miRNAs from a small RNA library derived from control and sporadic ALS (sALS) spinal cords. We detected 80 putative novel miRNAs, 24 of which have miRNA response elements (MREs) within the NEFL mRNA 3'UTR. From this group, we determined by real-time PCR that 10 miRNAs were differentially expressed in sALS compared to controls. Functional analysis by reporter gene assay and relative quantitative RT-PCR showed that two novel miRNAs, miR-b1336 and miR-b2403, were downregulated in ALS spinal cord and that both stabilize NEFL mRNA. We confirmed the direct effect of these latter miRNAs using anit-miR-b1336 and anti-miR-b2403. These results demonstrate that the expression of two miRNAs (miRNAs miR-b1336 and miR-b2403) whose effect is to stabilize NEFL mRNA are down regulated in ALS, the net effect of which is predicted to contribute directly to the loss of NEFL steady state mRNA which is pathognomic of spinal motor neurons in ALS.

24810590	20140510	A novel TetR-regulating peptide turns off rtTA-mediated activation of gene expression.	Conditional regulation of gene expression is a powerful and indispensable method for analyzing gene function. The &quot;Tet-On&quot; system is a tool widely used for that purpose. Here, the transregulator rtTA mediates expression of a gene of interest after addition of the small molecule effector doxycycline. Although very effective in rapidly turning on gene expression, the system is hampered by the long half-life of doxycycline which makes shutting down gene expression rapidly very difficult to achieve. We isolated an rtTA-binding peptide by in vivo selection that acts as a doxycycline antagonist and leads to rapid and efficient shut down of rtTA-mediated reporter gene expression in a human cell line. This peptide represents the basis for novel effector molecules which complement the &quot;Tet-system&quot; by enabling the investigator to rapidly turn gene expression not just on at will, but now also off.

8543015	19951211	Mg2+ activation of Escherichia coli inorganic pyrophosphatase.	Further refinement of X-ray data on Escherichia coli inorganic pyrophosphatase [Oganessyan et al. (1994) FEBS Lett. 348, 301-304] to 2.2 A reveals a system of noncovalent interactions involving Tyr55 and Tyr141 in the active site. The pKa for one of the eight Tyr residues in wild-type pyrophosphatase is as low as 9.1 and further decreases to 8.1 upon Mg2+ binding, generating characteristic changes in the absorption spectrum. These effects are lost in a Y55F but not in a Y141F variant. It is suggested that the lower-affinity site for Mg2+ in the enzyme is formed by Tyr55 and Asp70, which are in close proximity in the apo-enzyme structure. 	FEBS_Lett.	D016428 D013485
23383309	20130206	Allergies and risk of head and neck cancer: an original study plus meta-analysis.	Although the relationship between allergy and cancer has been investigated extensively, the role of allergy in head and neck cancer (HNC) appears less consistent. It is not clear whether allergies can independently influence the risk of HNC in the presence of known strong environmental risk factors, including consumption of alcohol, betel quid, and cigarette. THE CURRENT PAPER REPORTS RESULTS FROM: 1) an original hospital-based case-control study, which included 252 incident cases of HNC and 236 controls frequency-matched to cases on sex and age; and 2) a meta-analysis combining the results of the current case-control study and 13 previously published studies (9 cohort studies with 727,569 subjects and 550 HNC outcomes and 5 case-control studies with 4,017 HNC cases and 10,928 controls). In the original case-control study, we observed a strong inverse association between allergies and HNC [odds ratio?=?0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.27-0.62]. The meta-analysis also indicated a statistically significant inverse association between HNC and allergies [meta-relative risk (RR)?=?0.76, 95% CI: 0.63-0.91], particularly strong for allergic rhinitis (meta-RR?=?0.55, 95% CI: 0.40-0.76). In addition, the inverse association between allergies and HNC was observed only among men (meta-RR?=?0.67, 95% CI: 0.54-0.84) but not among women (meta-RR?=?0.98, 95% CI: 0.81-1.18). These findings suggest that immunity plays an influential role in the risk of HNC. Future studies investigating immune biomarkers, including cytokine profiles and genetic polymorphisms, are warranted to further delineate the relationship between allergies and HNC. Understanding the relationship between allergies and HNC may help devise effective strategies to reduce and treat HNC. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D017418 D013485
18485498	20080520	Delta24(25)-sterol methenyltransferase: intracellular localization and azasterol sensitivity in Leishmania major promastigotes overexpressing the enzyme.	Trypanosomatids contain predominantly ergostane-based sterols, which differ from cholesterol, the main sterol in mammalian cells, in the presence of a methyl group in the 24 position. The methylation is initiated by S-adenosyl-L-methionine:Delta(24 (25))-sterol methenyltransferase, an enzyme present in protozoa, but absent in mammals. The importance of this enzyme is underscored by its potential as a drug target in the treatment of the leishmaniases. Here, we report studies concerning the intracellular distribution of sterol methenyltransferase in Leishmania major promastigotes and overexpressing cells using a specific antibody raised against highly purified recombinant protein. It was found by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy studies that in L. major wild-type cells sterol methenyltransferase was primarily associated to the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition to this location, the protein was incorporated into translucent vesicles presumably of the endocytic pathway. We also found in this study that cells overproducing the enzyme do not have increased resistance to the sterol methenyltransferase inhibitor 22, 26 azasterol. 	Mol._Biochem._Parasitol.

22119597	20111129	Somatic alterations in mitochondrial DNA produce changes in cell growth and metabolism supporting a tumorigenic phenotype.	There have been many reports of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations associated with human malignancies. We have observed allelic instability in UV-induced cutaneous tumors at the mt-Tr locus encoding the mitochondrial tRNA for arginine. We examined the effects of somatic alterations at this locus by modeling the change in a uniform nuclear background by generating cybrids harboring allelic variation at mt-Tr. We utilized the naturally occurring mtDNA variation at mt-Tr within the BALB/cJ (BALB) and C57BL/6J (B6) strains of Mus musculus to transfer their mitochondria into a mouse ?(0) cell line that lacked its own mtDNA. The BALB haplotype containing the mt-Tr 9821insA allele produced significant changes in cellular respiration (resulting in lowered ATP production), but increased rates of cellular proliferation in cybrid cells. Furthermore, the mtDNA genotype associated with UV-induced tumors endowed the cybrid cells with a phenotype of resistance to UV-induced apoptosis and enhanced migration and invasion capabilities. These studies support a role for mtDNA changes in cancer. 	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D052061 D013485
12359457	20021003	Ornithine decarboxylase encoded by chlorella virus PBCV-1.	Sequence analysis of the 330-kb genome of chlorella virus PBCV-1 revealed an open reading frame, A207R, which encodes a protein with 37-41% amino acid identity to ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) from many eukaryotic organisms. The a207r gene was cloned and the protein was expressed as a His-A207R fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein catalyzes pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent decarboxylation of ornithine to putrescine, the first step in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway. The enzyme has a pH optimum of 9.0 and a temperature optimum of 42 degrees C, and it requires dithiothreitol for maximal activity. The enzyme has a K(m) for ornithine of 0.78 mM and a specific activity of 100 micromol/min/mg protein. PBCV-1 ODC is quite sensitive to the competitive inhibitor L-arginine and the irreversible inhibitor difluoromethylarginine but it is less sensitive to the irreversible inhibitor difluoromethylornithine. The a207r gene is expressed both early and late in PBCV-1 infection and is highly conserved among the chlorella viruses. The 42-kDa PBCV-1 ODC (372 amino acids) is the smallest ODC in the databases and, to our knowledge, is the first virus-encoded ODC. 	Virology	D016428 D013485 D013487
27280288	20160610	Insights into Sexual Precocity of Female Oriental River Prawn Macrobrachium nipponense through Transcriptome Analysis.	The oriental river prawn (Macrobrachium nipponense) is the most prevalent aquaculture species in China. The sexual precocity in this species has received considerable attention in recent years because more and more individuals matured at a small size, which devalues the commercial production. In this study, we developed deep-coverage transcriptomic sequencing data for the ovaries of sexually precocious and normal sexually mature M. nipponense using next-generation RNA sequencing technology and attempted to provide the first insight into the molecular regulatory mechanism of sexual precocity in this species. A total of 63,336 unigenes were produced from the ovarian cDNA libraries of sexually precocious and normal sexually mature M. nipponense using Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Through BLASTX searches against the NR, STRING, Pfam, Swissprot and KEGG databases, 15,134 unigenes were annotated, accounting for 23.89% of the total unigenes. 5,195 and 3,227 matched unigenes were categorized by GO and COG analysis respectively. 15,908 unigenes were consequently mapped into 332 KEGG pathways, and many reproduction-related pathways and genes were identified. Moreover, 26,008 SSRs were identified from 18,133 unigenes. 80,529 and 80,516 SNPs were yielded from ovarian libraries of sexually precocious and normal sexually mature prawn, respectively, and 29,851 potential SNPs between these two groups were also predicted. After comparing the ovarian libraries of sexually precocious and normal sexually mature prawn, 549 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 9 key DEGs that may be related to sexual precocity of M. nipponense were identified. 20 DEGs were selected for validation by quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) and 19 DEGs show consistent expression between QPCR and RNAseq-based differential expression analysis datasets. This is the first report on the large-scale RNA sequencing of ovaries of sexually precocious and normal sexually mature M. nipponense. The annotated transcriptome data will provide fundamental support for future research into the reproduction biology of M. nipponense. The large number of candidate SNPs and SSRs detected in this study could be used as genetic markers for population genetics and functional genomics in this species. More importantly, many DEGs, especially nine key DEGs between sexually precocious and normal sexually mature prawns were identified, which will dramatically improve understanding of molecular regulatory mechanism of sexual precocity of this species.

26915939	20160227	Breast cancer in high-risk Afrikaner families: Is BRCA founder mutation testing sufficient?	Germline pathogenic mutations in cancer susceptibility genes result in inherited cancer syndromes. In the Afrikaner population of South Africa (SA), three founder mutations in the BRCA genes that lead to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOCS) have been identified. To investigate the uptake and type of molecular testing performed on patients for HBOCS, to determine the prevalence of the three Afrikaner founder BRCA mutations as well as non-founder BRCA mutations in the study population, and to analyse the utility of two mutation prediction models (Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA) and Manchester scoring method) in assisting with the decision for the most cost-effective testing option. A retrospective file review was performed on counsellees of self-reported Afrikaner ancestry from Johannesburg, SA (2001 - 2014), with a personal or family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Demographic and family history information was recorded and Manchester and BOADICEA scores were calculated for each patient. Of 86 unrelated counsellees whose files were reviewed, 54 (62.8%) underwent BRCA genetic testing; 18 (33.3%) tested positive for a mutation, and 14 of these (77.8%) for an Afrikaner founder mutation. Twelve counsellees had the BRCA2 c.7934delG mutation. Four non-founder mutations were identified. BOADICEA scores were significantly higher in counsellees who tested positive for a mutation than in those who tested negative. Founder mutation testing should be performed as a first-line option. BOADICEA is very useful in identifying counsellees at high risk for a BRCA mutation and also assists with the decision to pursue further testing following a negative founder mutation result. These findings assist in guiding an informed genetic counselling service for at-risk individuals with an Afrikaner background. 	S._Afr._Med._J.	D016428
17553586	20070608	Characterization of a eukaryotic type serine/threonine kinase in Spodoptera litura nucleopolyhedrovirus-I (SpltNPV-I).	An open reading frame (ORF) of 819nt coding for a predicted protein of 272 amino acids was identified in the genome of Spodoptera litura nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpltNPV-I). Sequence derived amino acid sequence analysis of this ORF suggested it to be a eukaryotic type protein kinase having conserved I-XI subdomains of Hanks kinase. In addition to kinase catalytic domains, this hypothetical protein had two bromodomains which could play regulatory roles in transcription. The ORF was expressed as approximately 31 kDa apoprotein in E. coli and approximately 33 kDa glycoprotein in Sf9 cells, and was called SpltNPV-I pk1 or pk1. The protein was localized in the nuclei of infected cells of the SpltNPV-I permissive cell line, NIV-HA-197. The recombinant protein had autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation activities in presence of Mn(2+) or Mg(2+), and these activities were inhibited by staurosporine. Mutation of Lys-50 to Met but not Lys-44 to Gln abolished pk1 kinase activity. Kinetics of pk1 showed that the rate of phosphorylation of SpltNPV-I pk1&gt;MBP&gt;histone H1, and both MBP and histone H1 had the K(m)s of 3muM. Analysis of phosphorylated protein showed the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues, but not tyrosine. All these results suggested that identified SpltNPV-I ORF codes for a serine/threonine kinase. 	Virus_Res.	D016428 D013485
21142918	20101215	ABCC8 polymorphism (Ser1369Ala): influence on severe hypoglycemia due to sulfonylureas.	Sulfonylureas are categorized according to their binding sites of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel (K(ATP) channel) complex in pancreatic ?-cells. The binding sites are classified as A, B and A + B site (both A and B sites), respectively. The Ser1369Ala variant in the sulfonylurea receptor gene ABCC8 which encodes a subunit of the K(ATP) channel complex has been demonstrated to be associated with the hypoglycemic effect of gliclazide, which binds to the A site. However, the hypoglycemic effect of the Ser1369Ala variant on treatment with A + B binding site sulfonylureas, such as glimepiride or glibenclamide, is still uncertain. In a case-control study, 32 patients with Type 2 diabetes admitted to hospital with severe hypoglycemia and 125 consecutive Type 2 diabetic outpatients without severe hypoglycemia were enrolled. We determined the genotypes of the ABCC8 polymorphism (Ser1369Ala) in the patients with or without severe hypoglycemia. All of the patients were taking glimepiride or glibenclamide. In the patients treated with glimepiride or glibenclamide, we found no significant differences in the distribution of the Ser1369Ala genotype between patients with or without severe hypoglycemia (p = 0.26). Moreover, the Ala1369 minor allele tended to be less frequent in the hypoglycemic group (31 vs 43%; OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 0.92-2.96; p = 0.09). Our findings suggest that the Ser1369Ala variant is not a major predictive factor of severe hypoglycemia due to glimepiride or glibenclamide, both of which bind to the A + B site. It is likely that severe hypoglycemia due to A + B binding site sulfonylureas will be mediated by other factors, and not the Ala1369 minor allele. 	Pharmacogenomics	D016428

25850295	20150409	[Association of polymorphisms in toll-like receptor genes with atopic dermatitis in the Republic of Bashkortostan].	Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent chronic inflammatory skin disease developing as a result of the interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Considerable role in allergic diseases development is played by polymorphisms of genes of pattern-recognition receptors (PRR) which are capable of recognizing conservative standard molecular structures (patterns) unique for large pathogen groups. In this study polymorphic variants of PRR genes--Toll-like receptors (TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR9, TLR10), NOD-like receptors (NOD1, NOD2), lipopolysaccharide receptor CD14 gene, and C11orf30 and LRRC32 genes, located in 11q13.5 region, have been investigated in AD patients and control subjects from the Republic of Bashkortostan. An association of TLR1 (rs5743571 and rs5743604), TLR6 (rs5743794) and TLR10 (rs11466617) with AD was found. Our results confirm an important role of the innate immune system in the pathogenesis of AD and the significance of polymorphisms within the Toll-like receptor 2 subfamily genes in AD development.

16103918	20050817	Susceptibility to neurodegeneration in a glaucoma is modified by Bax gene dosage.	In glaucoma, harmful intraocular pressure often contributes to retinal ganglion cell death. It is not clear, however, if intraocular pressure directly insults the retinal ganglion cell axon, the soma, or both. The pathways that mediate pressure-induced retinal ganglion cell death are poorly defined, and no molecules are known to be required. DBA/2J mice deficient in the proapoptotic molecule BCL2-associated X protein (BAX) were used to investigate the roles of BAX-mediated cell death pathways in glaucoma. Both Bax+/- and Bax-/- mice were protected from retinal ganglion cell death. In contrast, axonal degeneration was not prevented in either Bax+/- or Bax-/- mice. While BAX deficiency did not prevent axonal degeneration, it did slow axonal loss. Additionally, we compared the effects of BAX deficiency on the glaucoma to its effects on retinal ganglion cell death due to two insults that are proposed to participate in glaucoma. As in the glaucoma, BAX deficiency protected retinal ganglion cells after axon injury by optic nerve crush. However, it did not protect retinal ganglion cells from N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxicity. BAX is required for retinal ganglion cell death in an inherited glaucoma; however, it is not required for retinal ganglion cell axon degeneration. This indicates that distinct somal and axonal degeneration pathways are active in this glaucoma. Finally, our data support a role for optic nerve injury but not for NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity in this glaucoma. These findings indicate a need to understand axon-specific degeneration pathways in glaucoma, and they suggest that distinct somal and axonal degeneration pathways may need to be targeted to save vision.

17696515	20070819	Potent new antiviral compound shows similar inhibition and structural interactions with drug resistant mutants and wild type HIV-1 protease.	The potent new antiviral inhibitor GRL-98065 (1) of HIV-1 protease (PR) has been studied with PR variants containing the single mutations D30N, I50V, V82A, and I84V that provide resistance to the major clinical inhibitors. Compound 1 had inhibition constants of 17-fold, 8-fold, 3-fold, and 3-fold, respectively, for PR(D30N), PR(I50V), PR(V82A), and PR(I84V) relative to wild type PR. The chemically related darunavir had similar relative inhibition, except for PR(D30N), where inhibitor 1 was approximately 3-fold less potent. The high resolution (1.11-1.60 Angstrom) crystal structures of PR mutant complexes with inhibitor 1 showed small changes relative to the wild type enzyme. PR(D30N) and PR(V82A) showed compensating interactions with inhibitor 1 relative to those of PR, while reduced hydrophobic contacts were observed with PR(I50V) and PR(I84V). Importantly, inhibitor 1 complexes showed fewer changes relative to wild type enzyme than reported for darunavir complexes. Therefore, inhibitor 1 is a valuable addition to the antiviral inhibitors with high potency against resistant strains of HIV. 	J._Med._Chem.	D016428 D052061 D013485 D013486

Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy-related multisystem disorder characterised by elevation of blood pressure and proteinuria, in which oxidative stress may play an important role. Blood pressure is partly controlled by O(-)(2) production by NADPH/NADH oxidase and recently it was shown that a C242T substitution in the p22phox gene was associated with coronary artery disease, in which elevated blood pressure and oxidative stress are also important pathophysiologic features. Therefore we studied the prevalence of the C242T polymorphism in the NADPH/NADH oxidase gene in women with pre-eclampsia and/or haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome as compared with women with a normotensive pregnancy. DNA from control women (n = 78), women with pre-eclampsia (n = 40), HELLP syndrome (n = 9) or women with HELLP complicated by pregnancy-induced hypertension or pre-eclampsia (n = 46) were tested for the presence of the C242T polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment-length polymorphism. The prevalence of the homozygous CC-genotype was similar in the patient groups compared with controls. The allele frequency of the T-allele was 31% in both control and patient groups. In conclusion the C242T polymorphism in the p22phox subunit of the NADPH/NADH oxidase gene is not associated with pre-eclampsia. Therefore, oxidative stress generated by NADPH/NADH oxidase probably does not play a role in the development of pre-eclampsia. 	J_Hum_Hypertens	D016428 D013485
3795505	19861101	[Pulmonary malignant lymphoma--a case report].	A case of pulmonary malignant lymphoma is reported. A 65-year-old woman had no complaint. But chest roentgenography and CT revealed an infiltrating shadow with marked airbronchogram in the left S3. TBLB revealed marked subepithelial lymphocytic infiltration of the bronchial wall. Because the shadow had gradually enlarged, malignancy was suspected and lobectomy was performed. The resected specimen showed a 60 X 56 X 30 mm greyish-yellow, medullary tumor with intrapulmonary metastasis. Microscopically, well-differentiated small lymphocytic tumor cells severely infiltrated the pulmonary parenchyma, pleura and bronchial cartilage. There was no lymph node metastasis or extrapulmonary involvement. Immunohistochemical study proved the monoclonality of the K chain. She was treated with chemotherapy postoperatively.

12494183	20021221	[NOS3 gene polymorphism and left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with essential hypertension].	One hundred nine patients with essential hypertension were studied (50 male and 59 female, mean age - 62,6-/+1,08 years). Seventy six patients had left ventricular hypertrophy measured by echocardiography. NOS3 polymorphisms (Glu298Asp and ecNOS4a/4b) were studied by PCR. In patients without left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) genotypes frequencies of NOS3 (Glu298Asp) were: Glu/Glu - 34.4%; Glu/Asp - 62,5%; Asp/Asp - 3,1%. In patients with LVH - Glu/Glu - 55.3%; Glu/Asp - 40.8%; Asp/Asp - 3.9%; p=0,117. Percent of Glu/Glu genotype was significantly higher in LVH group (p=0,047). Genotypes frequencies of ecNOS4a/4b were: in patients without LVH - 4b/4b - 37,5%; 4a/4b - 62,5%; 4a/4a - 0; in patients with LVH - 4b/4b - 21.1%; 4a/4b - 76.3%; 4a/4a - 2,6%;. p=0,151. Patients with 4a allele had higher Amax than 4b/4b patients (76,3+2,11 m/s and 67,9+4,72 m/s; p=0,040). Therefore, we show associations between Glu allele of NOS3 (Glu298Asp) and left ventricular hypertrophy and between 4a allele (ecNOS4a/4b) and diastolic dysfunction in patients with essential hypertension.

27547787	20160823	in situ</i>Hybridization/Immunohistochemistry (ISH/IH) on Free-floating Vibratome Tissue Sections.	 In situ hybridization and immunostaining are common techniques for localizing gene expression, the mRNA and protein respectively, within tissues. Both techniques can be applied to tissue sections to achieve similar goals, but in some cases, it is necessary to use them together. For example, complement C1q is a secreted protein complex that can target the innate immune response during inflammation. Complement has been found to be elevated early and before severe neurodegeneration in several disease models. Thus, complement may serve as an important marker for disease progression and may contribute to the pathology under certain conditions. Since complement is a secreted complex, immunostaining for C1q does not necessarily reveal where compliment is produced.In situhybridization for complement components, C1q a, b, or c mRNA, is ideal to mark complement producing cells in tissue.In situhybridization can be coupled with cell-type-specific immunostaining for accurate identification of the cell types involved. Protein localization and mRNA localization together can reveal details as to the relationship between complement producing and complement target cells within disease tissues. Here we outline the steps for combinedin situhybridization and immunostaining on the same tissue section. The protocol outlined here has been designed for detection of complement C1q in neurons and microglia in the mouse brain. Provided here are two approaches for combined ISH/IH. In the 1st example,in situhybridization of C1q mRNA is performed together with fluorescent detection of Purkinje neuron cell bodies using Calbindin-D28K antibody. In the 2nd example, C1q mRNA in situ is performed together with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) detection of microglia using CD68 antibody. Please note that modifications to the protocol may be needed for the use of distinct probes and antibodies, as well as alternate tissue-processing methods that are not specified herein. For appropriate examples of procedure results, please see images published in Lopezet al.(2012). 	Bio_Protoc	D016428
11866018	20020228	Identification of a new cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator mutation in a severely affected patient.	By using a combination of multiplex polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific labelled probes, the oligo-ligation assay is designed to detect known cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator mutations. This study shows that this assay may also be useful to detect new mutations. The second child of a family of Bosnic origin showed all the symptoms of intestinal and pulmonary manifestations of cystic fibrosis. No signal could be obtained for the allele-specific probe 1898+1G&gt;A. This could be explained by a nearby localized sequence change that prevented polymerase chain reaction primers or oligonucleotide probes from binding to the target sequence. Indeed, sequence analysis revealed a new 1894G&gt;T exchange (Glu587Stop). Both parents and the healthy brother carried this mutation. Thus, the index patient was homozygous for 1894G&gt;T, which was inherited from both parents. 	Eur._Respir._J.	D002363 D016428
23815566	20130703	Cis-2-dodecenoic acid quorum sensing system modulates N-acyl homoserine lactone production through RpfR and cyclic di-GMP turnover in Burkholderia cenocepacia.	Burkholderia cenocepacia employs both N-Acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) and cis-2-dodecenoic acid (BDSF) quorum sensing (QS) systems in regulation of bacterial virulence. It was shown recently that disruption of BDSF synthase RpfFBc caused a reduction of AHL signal production in B. cenocepacia. However, how BDSF system influences AHL system is still not clear. We show here that BDSF system controls AHL system through a novel signaling mechanism. Null mutation of either the BDSF synthase, RpfFBc, or the BDSF receptor, RpfR, caused a substantial down-regulation of AHL signal production in B. cenocepacia strain H111. Genetic and biochemical analyses showed that BDSF system controls AHL signal production through the transcriptional regulation of the AHL synthase gene cepI by modulating the intracellular level of second messenger cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP). Furthermore, we show that BDSF and AHL systems have a cumulative role in the regulation of various biological functions, including swarming motility, biofilm formation and virulence factor production, and exogenous addition of either BDSF or AHL signal molecules could only partially rescue the changed phenotypes of the double deletion mutant defective in BDSF and AHL signal production. These results, together with our previous findings, thus depict a molecular mechanism with which BDSF regulates AHL signal production and bacterial virulence through modulating the phosphodiesterase activity of its receptor RpfR to influence the intracellular level of c-di-GMP.

23533775	20130328	Harnessing DNA synthesis to develop rapid responses to emerging and pandemic pathogens.	Given the interconnected nature of our world today, emerging pathogens and pandemic outbreaks are an ever-growing threat to the health and economic stability of the global community. This is evident by the recent 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, the SARS outbreak, as well as the ever-present threat of global bioterrorism. Fortunately, the biomedical community has been able to rapidly generate sequence data so these pathogens can be readily identified. To date, however, the utilization of this sequence data to rapidly produce relevant experimental results or actionable treatments is lagging in spite of obtained sequence data. Thus, a pathogenic threat that has emerged and/or developed into a pandemic can be rapidly identified; however, translating this identification into a targeted therapeutic or treatment that is rapidly available has not yet materialized. This commentary suggests that the growing technology of DNA synthesis should be fully implemented as a means to rapidly generate in vivo data and possibly actionable therapeutics soon after sequence data becomes available.

25878036	20150417	Splice-shifting oligonucleotide (SSO) mediated blocking of an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) created by the prevalent c.903+469T&gt;C MTRR mutation corrects splicing and restores enzyme activity in patient cells.	The prevalent c.903+469T&gt;C mutation in MTRR causes the cblE type of homocystinuria by strengthening an SRSF1 binding site in an ESE leading to activation of a pseudoexon. We hypothesized that other splicing regulatory elements (SREs) are also critical for MTRR pseudoexon inclusion. We demonstrate that the MTRR pseudoexon is on the verge of being recognized and is therefore vulnerable to several point mutations that disrupt a fine-tuned balance between the different SREs. Normally, pseudoexon inclusion is suppressed by a hnRNP A1 binding exonic splicing silencer (ESS). When the c.903+469T&gt;C mutation is present two ESEs abrogate the activity of the ESS and promote pseudoexon inclusion. Blocking the 3'splice site or the ESEs by SSOs is effective in restoring normal splicing of minigenes and endogenous MTRR transcripts in patient cells. By employing an SSO complementary to both ESEs, we were able to rescue MTRR enzymatic activity in patient cells to approximately 50% of that in controls. We show that several point mutations, individually, can activate a pseudoexon, illustrating that this mechanism can occur more frequently than previously expected. Moreover, we demonstrate that SSO blocking of critical ESEs is a promising strategy to treat the increasing number of activated pseudoexons. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D013485
17239335	20070124	Mucolipidosis IV: report of a case with ocular restricted phenotype caused by leaky splice mutation.	To confirm and define a molecular basis for a case of mucolipidosis type IV (ML IV) with an extremely atypical phenotype pattern. Observational case report of a patient with ML IV with disease progression restricted to ocular symptoms. Complete ophthalmologic and neurologic examination. Ultrastructural examination of white blood cells, skin, conjunctiva, and corneal epithelium. The MCOLN1 gene was sequenced from cDNA and the proportion of splicing variants were assessed by quantitative allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. Absence of any neurological abnormalities. Retinal pathologic features were the main cause of visual disability: low visual acuity and cloudy corneas since 2 years of age, progressive decrease in visual acuity since the age of 9 years. Ultrastructural examination showed storage lysosomes filled with either concentric membranes or lucent precipitate in corneal and conjunctive epithelia and in vascular endothelium. Cultured fibroblasts were free of any autofluorescence. Sequencing of the MCOLN1 gene identified compound heterozygosity for D362Y and A--&gt;T transition leading to the creation of a novel donor splicing site and a 4-bp deletion from exon 13 at the mRNA level. Both normal and pathologic splice forms were detected in skin fibroblasts and leukocytes, with the normal form being more abundant. The case of this patient with ML IV is unique and is characterized by a curious lack of generalized symptoms. In this patient, the disorder was limited to the eyes and appeared without the usual psychomotor deterioration. The resulting phenotype is the mildest seen to date. 	Am._J._Ophthalmol.

19592625	20090714	Potential of albiglutide, a long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist, in type 2 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial exploring weekly, biweekly, and monthly dosing.	To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of incremental doses of albiglutide, a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, administered with three dosing schedules in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with diet and exercise or metformin monotherapy. In this randomized multicenter double-blind parallel-group study, 356 type 2 diabetic subjects with similar mean baseline characteristics (age 54 years, diabetes duration 4.9 years, BMI 32.1 kg/m(2), A1C 8.0%) received subcutaneous placebo or albiglutide (weekly [4, 15, or 30 mg], biweekly [15, 30, or 50 mg], or monthly [50 or 100 mg]) or exenatide twice daily as an open-label active reference (per labeling in metformin subjects only) over 16 weeks followed by an 11-week washout period. The main outcome measure was change from baseline A1C of albiglutide groups versus placebo at week 16. Dose-dependent reductions in A1C were observed within all albiglutide schedules. Mean A1C was similarly reduced from baseline by albiglutide 30 mg weekly, 50 mg biweekly (every 2 weeks), and 100 mg monthly (-0.87, -0.79, and -0.87%, respectively) versus placebo (-0.17%, P &lt; 0.004) and exenatide (-0.54%). Weight loss (-1.1 to -1.7 kg) was observed with these three albiglutide doses with no significant between-group effects. The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events in subjects receiving albiglutide 30 mg weekly was less than that observed for the highest biweekly and monthly doses of albiglutide or exenatide. Weekly albiglutide administration significantly improved glycemic control and elicited weight loss in type 2 diabetic patients, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile.

11035037	20001018	Mutations in the TATA-binding protein, affecting transcriptional activation, show synthetic lethality with the TAF145 gene lacking the TAF N-terminal domain in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	The general transcription factor TFIID, which is composed of the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and a set of TBP-associated factors (TAFs), is crucial for both basal and regulated transcription by RNA polymerase II. The N-terminal small segment of yeast TAF145 (yTAF145) binds to TBP and thereby inhibits TBP function. To understand the physiological role of this inhibitory domain, which is designated as TAND (TAF N-terminal domain), we screened mutations, synthetically lethal with the TAF145 gene lacking TAND (taf145 Delta TAND), in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by exploiting a red/white colony-sectoring assay. Our screen yielded several recessive nsl (Delta TAND synthetic lethal) mutations, two of which, nsl1-1 and nsl1-2, define the same complementation group. The NSL1 gene was found to be identical to the SPT15 gene encoding TBP. Interestingly, both temperature-sensitive nsl1/spt15 alleles, which harbor the single amino acid substitutions, S118L and P65S, respectively, were defective in transcriptional activation in vivo. Several other previously characterized activation-deficient spt15 alleles also displayed synthetic lethal interactions with taf145 Delta TAND, indicating that TAND and TBP carry an overlapping but as yet unidentified function that is specifically required for transcriptional regulation.

24343202	20131218	Terahertz conductivity of topological surface states in Bi?.?Sb?.?Te?.?Se?.?.	Topological insulators are electronic materials with an insulating bulk and conducting surface. However, due to free carriers in the bulk, the properties of the metallic surface are difficult to detect and characterize in most topological insulator materials. Recently, a new topological insulator Bi?.?Sb?.?Te?.?Se?.? (BSTS) was found, showing high bulk resistivities of 1-10??.cm and greater contrast between the bulk and surface resistivities compared to other Bi-based topological insulators. Using Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS), we present complex conductivity of BSTS single crystals, disentangling the surface and bulk contributions. We find that the Drude spectral weight is 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than in other Bi-based topological insulators, and similar to that of Bi?Se? thin films, suggesting a significant contribution of the topological surface states to the conductivity of the BSTS sample. Moreover, an impurity band is present about 30 meV below the Fermi level, and the surface and bulk carrier densities agree with those obtained from transport data. Furthermore, from the surface Drude contribution, we obtain a ~98% transmission through one surface layer--this is consistent with the transmission through single-layer or bilayer graphene, which shares a common Dirac-cone feature in the band structure.

10970734	20000906	Structures of thermolabile mutants of human glutathione transferase P1-1.	An N-capping box motif (Ser/Thr-Xaa-Xaa-Asp) is strictly conserved at the beginning of helix alpha6 in the core of virtually all glutathione transferases (GST) and GST-related proteins. It has been demonstrated that this local motif is important in determining the alpha-helical propensity of the isolated alpha6-peptide and plays a crucial role in the folding and stability of GSTs. Its removal by site-directed mutagenesis generated temperature-sensitive folding mutants unable to refold at physiological temperature (37 degrees C). In the present work, variants of human GSTP1-1 (S150A and D153A), in which the capping residues have been substituted by alanine, have been generated and purified for structural analysis. Thus, for the first time, temperature-sensitive folding mutants of an enzyme, expressed at a permissive temperature, have been crystallized and their three-dimensional structures determined by X-ray crystallography. The crystal structures of human pi class GST temperature-sensitive mutants provide a basis for understanding the structural origin of the dramatic effects observed on the overall stability of the enzyme at higher temperatures upon single substitution of a capping residue.

23024650	20121002	The role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors in colorectal cancer.	Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. Dietary fat intake is a major risk factor for colorectal cancer. Some nuclear hormone receptors play an important role in regulating nutrient metabolism and energy homeostasis. Among these receptors, special attention has been focused on the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) in colorectal cancer, because PPARs are involved in regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. PPARs are ligand-activated intracellular transcription factors. The PPAR subfamily consists of three subtypes encoded by distinct genes named PPAR?, PPAR?/?, and PPAR?. PPAR? is the most extensively studied subtype of PPARs. Even though many investigators have studied the expression and clinical implications of PPARs in colorectal cancer, there are still many controversies about the role of PPARs in colorectal cancer. In this paper, the recent progresses in understanding the role of PPARs in colorectal cancer are summarized. 	PPAR_Res	D016428
23696843	20130523	Redox-controlled proton gating in bovine cytochrome c oxidase.	Cytochrome c oxidase is the terminal enzyme in the electron transfer chain of essentially all organisms that utilize oxygen to generate energy. It reduces oxygen to water and harnesses the energy to pump protons across the mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes and the plasma membrane in prokaryotes. The mechanism by which proton pumping is coupled to the oxygen reduction reaction remains unresolved, owing to the difficulty of visualizing proton movement within the massive membrane-associated protein matrix. Here, with a novel hydrogen/deuterium exchange resonance Raman spectroscopy method, we have identified two critical elements of the proton pump: a proton loading site near the propionate groups of heme a, which is capable of transiently storing protons uploaded from the negative-side of the membrane prior to their release into the positive side of the membrane and a conformational gate that controls proton translocation in response to the change in the redox state of heme a. These findings form the basis for a postulated molecular model describing a detailed mechanism by which unidirectional proton translocation is coupled to electron transfer from heme a to heme a 3, associated with the oxygen chemistry occurring in the heme a 3 site, during enzymatic turnover.

9288320	19970101	p53 mutations in human head and neck cancer cell lines.	The p53 tumour suppressor gene is commonly mutated in human cancers. We performed a molecular analysis of the frequency and spectrum of p53 gene mutations in 40 cell lines (23 from oral cavity tumours and 17 from larynx tumours) derived from 33 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Using PCR, SSCP, and sequence analysis, we detected the mutated p53 gene in 26 patients (79%); in 23 patients (70%) the wild-type allele of the p53 gene was deleted. Four patients had 2 p53 gene mutations each, and thus the total number of p53 mutations observed was 30. Seven patients had 2 cell lines each, established from the primary and recurrent/metastatic tumour, and the status of the p53 gene (mutant or normal) was identical in both cell lines. Forty percent of the mutations were transitions, 33% transversions, and 27% deletions, insertions and other more complicated changes. In oral cavity tumours the predominant mutation type was G:C--&gt;A:T transition at a CpG site (50% of mutations), and in larynx tumours the predominant type was G:C--&gt;T:A transversion (50% of mutations). These suggest endogenous and exogenous factors in tumour etiology. The G:C--&gt;T:A transversions in larynx tumours are probably associated with mutagenic components in the cigarette smoke, but the causative factor in G:C--&gt;A:T transitions (apparent oxidative damage) remains to be identified.

22826151	20120725	Phosphorylation of CRMP2 is involved in proper bifurcation of the apical dendrite of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.	The neural circuit in the hippocampus is important for higher brain functions. Dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons mainly receive input from the axons of CA3 pyramidal neurons in this neural circuit. A CA1 pyramidal neuron has a single apical dendrite and multiple basal dendrites. In wild-type mice, most of CA1 pyramidal neurons extend a single trunk, or alternatively, the apical dendrite bifurcates into two daughter trunks at the stratum radiatum layer. We previously reported the proximal bifurcation phenotype in Sema3A-/-, p35-/-, and CRMP4-/- mice. Cdk5/p35 phosphorylates CRMP2 at Ser522, and inhibition of this phosphorylation suppressed Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse. In this study, we analyzed the bifurcation points of the apical dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in CRMP2KI/KI mice in which the Cdk5/p35-phosphorylation site Ser522 was mutated into an Ala residue. The proximal bifurcation phenotype was not observed in CRMP2KI/KI mice; however, severe proximal bifurcation of apical dendrites was found in CRMP2KI/KI;CRMP4-/- mice. Cultured hippocampal neurons from CRMP2KI/KI and CRMP2KI/KI;CRMP4-/- embryos showed an increased number of dendritic branching points compared to those from wild-type embryos. Sema3A increased the number of branching points and the total length of dendrites in wild-type hippocampal neurons, but these effects of Sema3A for dendrites were not observed in CRMP2KI/KI and CRMP2KI/KI;CRMP4-/-hippocampal neurons. Binding of CRMP2 to tubulin increased in both CRMP2KI/KI and CRMP2KI/KI:CRMP4-/- brain lysates. These results suggest that CRMP2 and CRMP4 synergistically regulate dendritic development, and CRMP2 phosphorylation is critical for proper bifurcation of apical dendrite of CA1 pyramidal neurons.

27435453	20160721	Associations of vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D receptor (Cdx-2, Fok I, Bsm I and Taq I) polymorphisms with the risk of primary open-angle glaucoma.	Vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms are known to be significantly associated with high myopia. Whether this genetic variant may impact primary open-angle glaucoma is largely unknown. This study investigated whether vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms are altered in primary open-angle glaucoma subjects carrying the risk allele, and whether vitamin D deficiency is an important factor in the development of glaucoma. Seventy-three POAG patients and 71 age-matched controls from the Han population were enrolled. Serum levels of 1a, 25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 were measured by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. Vitamin D receptor polymorphisms (Cdx-2, Fok I, Bsm I and Taq I) were analyzed using real-time polymerase-chain reaction high resolution melting analysis. Serum levels of 1a, 25-Dihydroxyvitamin in primary open-angle glaucoma patients were lower than in age-matched controls. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference in the allelic frequencies of the BsmI and TaqI genotypes between primary open-angle glaucoma patients and age-matched controls, while other polymorphisms did not show any significant differences. Vitamin D deficiency and the presence of the BsmI 'B' allele and the TaqI 't' allele are relevant risk factors in the development of glaucoma. Clinical Trials.gov: NCT02539745 . The study was registered retrospectively on August 3rd, 2015. The first participant was enrolled on July 4th, 2013. 	BMC_Ophthalmol	D016428
19338775	20090403	Study of modifiers factors associated to mitochondrial mutations in individuals with hearing impairment.	Hearing impairment is the most prevalent sensorial deficit in the general population. Congenital deafness occurs in about 1 in 1000 live births, of which approximately 50% has hereditary cause in development countries. Non-syndromic deafness can be caused by mutations in both nuclear and mitochondrial genes. Mutations in mtDNA have been associated with aminoglycoside-induced and non-syndromic deafness in many families worldwide. However, the nuclear background influences the phenotypic expression of these pathogenic mutations. Indeed, it has been proposed that nuclear modifier genes modulate the phenotypic manifestation of the mitochondrial A1555G mutation in the MTRNR1 gene. The both putative nuclear modifiers genes TRMU and MTO1 encoding a highly conserved mitochondrial related to tRNA modification. It has been hypothesizes that human TRMU and also MTO1 nuclear genes may modulate the phenotypic manifestation of deafness-associated mitochondrial mutations. The aim of this work was to elucidate the contribution of mitochondrial mutations, nuclear modifier genes mutations and aminoglycoside exposure in the deafness phenotype. Our findings suggest that the genetic background of individuals may play an important role in the pathogenesis of deafness-associated with mitochondrial mutation and aminoglycoside-induced.

26886562	20160218	A functional variant in the coding region of CAMTA2 is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy by affecting the activation of Nkx2.5-dependent transcription.	The calmodulin-binding transcription activator 2 (CAMTA2) promotes transcription of genes involved in cardiac hypertrophy through its interaction with Nkx2.5 and is an indispensable transcription coactivator for cardiac hypertrophy. We hypothesized that variants in the coding region of CAMTA2 would affect its function and confer a risk of cardiac hypertrophy. The effects of the variant rs238234 on the activity of the atrial natriuretic factor promoter and on the cardiomyocytes hypertrophy were assessed in the H9C2 cell line and primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, respectively. Furthermore, the association of this variant with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was tested in hypertensive patients with and without hypertrophy (N?=?325 and 697), and this analysis was replicated in an independent population of 987 hypertensive patients without hypertrophy and 463 hypertensive patients with hypertrophy. We found that the G allele of rs238234 activated the atrial natriuretic factor promoter more strongly than the C allele. The cell size of cardiomyocytes was larger in the presence of the Ad-CAMTA2 G allele, and the G allele was associated with significantly increased susceptibility to LVH in hypertensive [odds ratio (OR), 1.29; P?=?0.009]. In the discovery cohort, after adjusting for age and sex, the GG genotype was significantly associated with increased LVH risk (OR, 1.75; P?=?0.015). There was little attenuation of the ORs (1.62; P?&lt;?0.05) when adjusting for BMI, heart rate, blood pressure, smoking, and drinking and further adjusting all covariates including lipid levels and other major risk factors. However, the GC genotype did not show any association with LVH using three regressive models. Replication in the second study yielded similar results. Our results provide evidence that the rs238234 GG genotype in the coding region of CAMTA2 may increase the risk of LVH by affecting the activation of Nkx2.5-dependent transcription. 	J._Hypertens.

25925851	20150501	Does BDNF Val66Met Polymorphism Confer Risk for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder?	Evidence has indicated that BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) Val66Met genetic variant could be linked to the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, clinical observations studying the BDNF polymorphism and the risk of PTSD yielded contradictory results. In this meta-analysis we evaluated the association between BDNF Val66Met and PTSD risk. Systematic searches in online databases retrieved 6 relevant publications. Different inherited models were utilized to perform the pooled analysis. Subgroup analyses and sensitive analyses based on Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test results were also carried out. Our study did not found a significant overall effect of BDNF Val66Met on the susceptibility to PTSD under various genetic models. In contrast, subgroup analyses suggested that the stress status of the control group, but not ethnicity, may influence the relationship of BDNF Val66Met with PTSD risk. After the exclusion of a study that was not in HWE, our conclusions remained unchanged during the influence analyses. This meta-analysis suggested no genetic association of BDNF Val66Met with vulnerability to PTSD. Further research studies are warranted to clarify the impact of BDNF variants on the occurrence of PTSD. 	Neuropsychobiology	D016428 D017418

Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) are associated with increased risk for cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia. SORCS1 encodes a protein-sorting molecule genetically linked to both T2D and AD. The association of SORCS1 with both AD and T2D is sexually dimorphic in humans, with both disease associations showing more robust effects in females. Based on published evidence that manipulation of the mouse genome combining multiple genes related to cerebral amyloidosis, to T2D, or both, might provide novel mouse models with exacerbated amyloid and/or diabetes phenotypes, we assessed memory, glucose homeostasis, and brain biochemistry and pathology in male and female wild-type, Sorcs1 -/-, APP/PSEN1, and Sorcs1 -/- X APP/PSEN1 mice. Male mice with either the APP/PSEN1 or Sorcs1 -/- genotype displayed earlier onset and persistent impairment in both learning behavior and glucose homeostasis. Unlike prior examples in the literature, the behavioral and metabolic abnormalities in male mice were not significantly exacerbated when the two disease model mice (Sorcs1 -/- models T2D; APP/PSEN1 models AD) were crossed. However, female Sorcs1 -/- X APP/PSEN1 mice exhibited worse metabolic dysfunction than Sorcs1 -/- knockout mice and worse memory than wild-type mice. The deletion of Sorcs1 from APP/PSEN1 mutant mice led to no obvious changes in brain levels of total or oligomeric amyloid-beta (A?) peptide. In general, unexpectedly, there was a trend for gene targeting of Sorcs1-/- to partially mitigate, not exacerbate, the metabolic and amyloid pathologies. These results indicate that crossing AD model mice and T2D model mice may not always cause exacerbation of both the amyloidosis phenotype and the metabolic phenotype and highlight the unexpected pitfalls of creating mixed models of disease.

26744914	20160109	A unique mosaic Turner syndrome patient with androgen receptor gene derived marker chromosome.	Patients with Turner syndrome are generally characterized by having short stature with no secondary sexual characteristics. Some abnormalities, such as webbed neck, renal malformations (&gt;50%) and cardiac defects (10%) are less common. The intelligence of these patients is considered normal. Non-mosaic monosomy X is observed in approximately 45% of postnatal patients with Turner syndrome and the rest of the patients have structural abnormalities or mosaicism involving 46,X,i(Xq), 45,X/46,XX, 45,X and other variants. The phenotype of 45,X/46,X,+mar individuals varies by the genetic continent and degree of the mosaicism. The gene content of the marker chromosome is the most important when correlating the phenotype with the genotype. Here we present an 11-year-old female who was referred for evaluation of her short stature and learning disabilities. Conventional cytogenetic investigation showed a mosaic 45,X/46,X,+mar karyotype. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that the marker chromosome originated from the X chromosome within the androgen receptor (AR) and X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) genes. Therefore, it is possible that aberrant activation of the marker chromosome, compromising the AR and XIST genes, may modify the Turner syndrome phenotype. 	Syst_Biol_Reprod_Med	D002363 D016428

7509564	19940301	Genetic analysis of Hispanic individuals with cystic fibrosis.	We have performed molecular genetic analyses of Hispanic individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) in the southwestern United States. Of 129 CF chromosomes analyzed, only 46% (59/129) carry delta F508. The G542X mutation was found on 5% (7/129) of CF chromosomes. The 3849 + 10kbC--&gt;T mutation, detected primarily in Ashkenazi Jews, was present on 2% (3/129). R1162X and R334W, mutations identified in Spain and Italy, each occurred on 1.6% (2/129) of CF chromosomes. W1282X and R553X were each detected once. G551D and N1303K were not found. Overall, screening for 22 or more mutations resulted in detection of only 58% of CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene mutations among Hispanic individuals. Analysis of KM19/XV2c haplotypes revealed an unusual distribution. Although the majority of delta F508 mutations are on chromosomes of B haplotypes, the other CF mutations are on A and C haplotypes at higher-than-expected frequencies. These genetic analyses demonstrate significant differences between Hispanic individuals with CF and those of the general North American population. Assessment of carrier/affected risk in Hispanic CF individuals cannot, therefore, be based on the mutation frequencies found through studies of the general population but must be adjusted to better reflect the genetic makeup of this ethnic group. Further studies are necessary to identify the causative mutation(s) in this population and to better delineate genotype/phenotype correlations. These will enable counselors to provide more accurate genetic counseling. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485 D013487
26616738	20151201	Conjunctival fibrosis and the innate barriers to Chlamydia trachomatis intracellular infection: a genome wide association study.	Chlamydia trachomatis causes both trachoma and sexually transmitted infections. These diseases have similar pathology and potentially similar genetic predisposing factors. We aimed to identify polymorphisms and pathways associated with pathological sequelae of ocular Chlamydia trachomatis infections in The Gambia. We report a discovery phase genome-wide association study (GWAS) of scarring trachoma (1090 cases, 1531 controls) that identified 27 SNPs with strong, but not genome-wide significant, association with disease (5???10(-6)?&gt;?P?&gt;?5???10(-8)). The most strongly associated SNP (rs111513399, P?=?5.38???10(-7)) fell within a gene (PREX2) with homology to factors known to facilitate chlamydial entry to the host cell. Pathway analysis of GWAS data was significantly enriched for mitotic cell cycle processes (P?=?0.001), the immune response (P?=?0.00001) and for multiple cell surface receptor signalling pathways. New analyses of published transcriptome data sets from Gambia, Tanzania and Ethiopia also revealed that the same cell cycle and immune response pathways were enriched at the transcriptional level in various disease states. Although unconfirmed, the data suggest that genetic associations with chlamydial scarring disease may be focussed on processes relating to the immune response, the host cell cycle and cell surface receptor signalling.

26331730	20150903	The dual and opposite role of the TM6SF2-rs58542926 variant in protecting against cardiovascular disease and conferring risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver: A meta-analysis.	The aim of this work was to estimate the strength of the effect of the TM6SF2 E167K (rs58542926 C/T) variant on blood lipid traits and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) across different populations. We performed a systematic review by a meta-analysis; literature searches identified 10 studies. The rs58542926 exerts a significant role in modulating lipid traits, including total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and NAFLD. However, this influence on lipids and NAFLD is opposite between genotypes in the dominant model of inheritance. Pooled estimates of random effects in 101,326 individuals showed that carriers of the minor T allele (EK+KK individuals), compared with subjects homozygous for the ancestral C allele (EE genotype), are protected from cardiovascular disease (CVD), showing lower levels of TC, LDL-C, and TG; the differences in mean ? standard error (mg/dL) are -8.38 ? 1.56, -3.7 ? 0.9, and -9.4 ? 2.1, respectively. The rs58542926 variant was not associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a large sample (n = 91,937). In contrast, carriers of the T allele showed a moderate effect on the risk of NAFLD (odds ratio: 2.13; 95% confidence interval: 1.36-3.30; P = 0.0009; n = 3273) and approximately ?2.2% higher lipid fat content when compared with homozygous EE (n = 3,413). The rs58542926 appears to be an important modifier of blood lipid traits in different populations. As a challenge for personalized medicine, the C-allele, which has an overall frequency as high as 93%, is associated with higher blood lipids, whereas the T allele confers risk for NAFLD; in turn, CVD and NAFLD are strongly related outcomes. Although the variant confers protection against CVD at the expense of an increased risk of NAFLD, it does not explain the link between these two complex diseases. 	Hepatology	D016428 D017418 D013485
11877419	20020306	Ultraviolet light inhibits translation through activation of the unfolded protein response kinase PERK in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.	Exposure to ultraviolet light can cause inflammation, premature skin aging, and cancer. UV irradiation alters the expression of multiple genes that encode functions to repair DNA damage, arrest cell growth, and induce apoptosis. In addition, UV irradiation inhibits protein synthesis, although the mechanism is not known. In this report, we show that UV irradiation induces phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 on the alpha-subunit (eIF2alpha) and inhibits protein synthesis in a dosage- and time-dependent manner. The UV-induced phosphorylation of eIF2alpha was prevented by the overexpression of a non-phosphorylatable mutant of eIF2alpha (S51A). PERK is an eIF2alpha protein kinase localized to the endoplasmic reticulum that is activated by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression of trans-dominant-negative mutants of PERK also prevented eIF2alpha phosphorylation upon UV treatment and protected from the associated translation attenuation. The luminal domain of dominant-negative mutant PERK formed heterodimers with endogenous PERK to inhibit the PERK signaling pathway. In contrast, eIF2alpha phosphorylation was not inhibited by overexpression of a trans-dominant-negative mutant kinase, PKR, supporting the theory that UV-induced eIF2alpha phosphorylation is specifically mediated by PERK. These results support a novel mechanism by which UV irradiation regulates translation via an endoplasmic reticulum-stress signaling pathway. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013487
27902388	20161201	The exploration of risk factors of concurrent bacteraemia in patients critically ill with severe dengue.	We investigated the clinical features of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with concomitant severe dengue infection and bacteraemia to identify risk factors for this comorbidity. The records of all ICU dengue patients admitted during the period of 31 July-30 November 2015 were reviewed. Patients with 'concurrent bacteremia' (positive bacterial blood culture within 72?h of ICU admission) were identified. ICU admission was required for 142 patients, of which 22 (15.5?%) had concurrent bacteraemia. Species of the genus Streptococcus was the most common pathogens, followed by Escherichia coli then species of the genus Staphylococcus. Patients with a severe dengue infection and bacteraemia had higher APACHE II and TISS scores, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and leukocyte counts, positive fluid balances, longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs), higher lactate levels and more kidney failure, but controls (severe dengue patients without bacteraemia) had higher Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, higher albumin levels and more abdominal pain (all P&lt;0.05). Patients with bacteraemia had a higher mortality rate than did ontrols (40.9 vs 18.3?%; P=0.018). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that bacteraemia was significantly positively associated with the following independent predictors: higher CRP levels [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.026; 95?% confidence interval (CI): 1.008-1.044; P=0.005], and longer APTTs (aOR: 1.034; 95 CI: 1.004-1.065; P=0.027). Concurrent bacteraemia is not uncommon in severe dengue patients in the ICU, and it is associated with high mortality. Higher CRP levels and longer APTTs were two independent risk factors associated with bacteraemia. 	J._Med._Microbiol.	D016428
20299822	20100320	Investigations into the binding affinities of different human 5-HT4 receptor splice variants.	This study examined whether the drug-receptor-binding sites of 5 selected human 5-HT(4) receptor splice variants [h5-HT4(a), h5-HT4(b), h5-HT4(c), h5-HT4(d) and h5-HT4(g)] display preferential affinities towards agonists. The agonists selected on the basis of chemical diversity and clinical relevance were: 5-HT4 benzamides, renzapride, zacopride and prucalopride; the benzimidazolones, DAU 6236 and BIMU 1; the aromatic ketone, RS67333, and the indole carbazimidamide tegaserod. The rank order of affinities ranging across the splice variants was: tegaserod (pKi: 7.38-7.91) &gt; or = Y-36912 (pKi: 7.03-7.85) = BIMU 1 (pKi: 6.92-7.78) &gt; or = DAU 6236 (pKi: 6.79-7.99) &gt; or = 5-HT (pKi: 5.82-7.29) &gt; or = 5-MeOT (pKi: 5.64-6.83) &gt; or = renzapride (pKi: 4.85-5.56). We obtained affinity values for the 5-HT4(b), (d) and (g) variants for RS67333 (pKi: 7:48-8.29), prucalopride (pKi: 6.86-7.37) and zacopride (pKi: 5.88-7.0). These results indicate that the ligands interact with the same conserved site in each splice variant. Some splice variants have a higher affinity for certain agonists and the direction of selectivity followed a common trend of lowest affinity at the (d) variant. However, this trend was not evident in functional experiments. Our findings suggest that it may be possible to design splice variant selective ligands, which may be of relevance for experimental drugs but may be difficult to develop clinically.

17675353	20070807	Modeling the Alzheimer Abeta17-42 fibril architecture: tight intermolecular sheet-sheet association and intramolecular hydrated cavities.	We investigate Abeta(17-42) protofibril structures in solution using molecular dynamics simulations. Recently, NMR and computations modeled the Abeta protofibril as a longitudinal stack of U-shaped molecules, creating an in-parallel beta-sheet and loop spine. Here we study the molecular architecture of the fibril formed by spine-spine association. We model in-register intermolecular beta-sheet-beta-sheet associations and study the consequences of Alzheimer's mutations (E22G, E22Q, E22K, and M35A) on the organization. We assess the structural stability and association force of Abeta oligomers with different sheet-sheet interfaces. Double-layered oligomers associating through the C-terminal-C-terminal interface are energetically more favorable than those with the N-terminal-N-terminal interface, although both interfaces exhibit high structural stability. The C-terminal-C-terminal interface is essentially stabilized by hydrophobic and van der Waals (shape complementarity via M35-M35 contacts) intermolecular interactions, whereas the N-terminal-N-terminal interface is stabilized by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Hence, shape complementarity, or the &quot;steric zipper&quot; motif plays an important role in amyloid formation. On the other hand, the intramolecular Abeta beta-strand-loop-beta-strand U-shaped motif creates a hydrophobic cavity with a diameter of 6-7 A, allowing water molecules and ions to conduct through. The hydrated hydrophobic cavities may allow optimization of the sheet association and constitute a typical feature of fibrils, in addition to the tight sheet-sheet association. Thus, we propose that Abeta fiber architecture consists of alternating layers of tight packing and hydrated cavities running along the fibrillar axis, which might be possibly detected by high-resolution imaging.

23623011	20130430	Beyond LDL-C lowering: distinct molecular sphingolipids are good indicators of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) deficiency.	Inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has been proposed to be a potential new therapeutic target for treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. However, little is known about the effects of PCSK9 inhibition on the lipidome. We performed molecular lipidomic analyses of plasma samples obtained from PCSK9-deficient mice, and serum of human carriers of a loss-of-function variant in the PCSK9 gene (R46L). In both mouse and man, PCSK9 deficiency caused a decrease in several cholesteryl esters (CE) and short fatty acid chain containing sphingolipid species such as CE 16:0, glucosyl/galactosylceramide (Glc/GalCer) d18:1/16:0, and lactosylceramide (LacCer) d18:1/16:0. In mice, the changes in lipid concentrations were most prominent when animals were given regular chow diet. In man, a number of molecular lipid species was shown to decrease significantly even when LDL-cholesterol was non-significantly reduced by 10% only. Western diet attenuated the lipid lowering potency of PCSK9 deficiency in mice. Plasma molecular lipid species may be utilized for characterizing novel compounds inhibiting PCSK9 and as sensitive efficacy markers of the PCSK9 inhibition. 	Atherosclerosis	D016428 D013485
17069699	20061031	[Mutations of tumor suppressor gene PTEN mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma and its implications in tumor proliferation and apoptosis].	To study mutations of tumor suppressor gene PTEN in human hepatocellular carcinomas and its effects on the proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HHCC. (1) PCR-SSCP and sequence analysis were used to detect the mutations of the 5th and 8th exon of PTEN in 42 cases of human primary hepatocellular carcinoma. (2) Eukaryotic expression vectors of the wild-type (pEGFP-wt-PTEN) and the mutant type (pEGFP-PTEN, G129R) of PTEN were constructed. Lipofectamine 2000 mediated gene transfection was used to transfect hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HHCC, in which the PTEN protein is not expressed. Culture medium containing G418 was used to select stable transfectants. MTT colorimetry was used to analyze the proliferation ability of selected cell lines. Naive HHCC cells and HHCC cells transfected with empty vector (pEGFP-C1) served as controls. (3) TNF-alpha was used to induce apoptosis of selected cell clones. (1) Point mutation involving the 5th exon of PTEN was detected in 4 of 42 primary hepatocellular carcinomas. (2) Compared with the control groups, the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells was significantly inhibited by the transfection of wild-type PTEN gene, while the transfection with mutant PTEN construct did not significantly change the proliferation. (3) The apoptosis indices of cells transfected with the wild-type and the mutant PTEN genes were 13.8% and 8.1% respectively. Compared with the control, the apoptosis index of HHCC cell transfected by the wild type PTEN was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences between HHCC cells transfected with mutated PTEN gene and the control (P &gt; 0.05). The expression of internal 473-phosphorylated Akt of HHCC was weak, but was enhanced when the cells treated with TNF-alpha. However, it was down regulated by the wild type PTEN. (1) First time report that PTEN mutations can be found in 9.5% human primary hepatocellular carcinomas. (2) The expression of the wild-type PTEN can suppress the proliferation of HHCC cells, and such suppression was lost when PTEN gene was mutated. (3) PTEN inhibition of the proliferation and the enhancement of apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells is likely related to a down-regulation of the TNF-alpha induced activation of protein kinase Akt pathway.

26586794	20151121	The presence of the intron 3 16 bp duplication polymorphism of p53 (rs17878362) in breast cancer is associated with a low ?40p53:p53 ratio and better outcome.	Breast cancer is the most common female cancer, but it has relatively low rates of p53 mutations, suggesting other mechanisms are responsible for p53 inactivation. We have shown that the p53 isoform, ?40p53, is highly expressed in breast cancer, where it may contribute to p53 inactivation. ?40p53 can be produced by alternative splicing of p53 in intron 2 and this is regulated by the formation of G-quadruplex structures in p53 intron 3, from which the nucleotides forming these structures overlap with a common polymorphism, rs17878362. rs17878362 alters p53 splicing to decrease fully spliced p53 messenger RNA (mRNA) in vitro following ionizing radiation and this in turn alters ?40p53:p53. Hence, the presence of rs17878362 may be important in regulating ?40p53:p53 in breast cancer. This study aimed to determine if rs17878362 was associated with altered ?40p53 and p53 expression and outcome in breast cancer. We sequenced p53 in breast tumours from 139 patients and compared this with ?40p53 and p53 mRNA expression. We found that the ratio of ?40p53:p53 was significantly lower in tumours homozygous for the polymorphic A2 allele compared with those who were wild-type (A1/A1). Furthermore, there was a lower proportion of breast cancers carrying the A2 allele from patients who subsequently developed metastasis compared with those that did not. Finally, we show that patients whose tumours carried the polymorphic A2 allele had significantly better disease-free survival. These results show that rs17878362 is associated with a low ?40p53:p53 ratio in breast cancer and that this is associated with better outcome. 	Carcinogenesis	D016428 D013485
18003935	20071116	Transformation of hematopoietic cells and activation of JAK2-V617F by IL-27R, a component of a heterodimeric type I cytokine receptor.	From a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we have identified IL-27Ra (also known as TCCR and WSX1) as a gene whose expression can induce the transformation of hematopoietic cells. IL-27Ra (IL-27R) is a type I cytokine receptor that functions as the ligand binding component of the receptor for IL-27 and functions with the glycoprotein 130 (gp130) coreceptor to induce signal transduction in response to IL-27. We show that IL-27R is expressed on the cell surface of the leukemic cells of AML patients. 32D myeloid cells transformed by IL-27R contain elevated levels of activated forms of various signaling proteins, including JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, and ERK1/2. Inhibition of JAK family proteins induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in these cells, suggesting the transforming properties of IL-27R depend on the activity of JAK family members. IL-27R also transforms BaF3 cells to cytokine independence. Because BaF3 cells lack expression of gp130, this finding suggests that IL-27R-mediated transformation of hematopoietic cells is gp130-independent. Finally, we show that IL-27R can functionally replace a homodimeric type I cytokine receptor in the activation of JAK2-V617F, a critical JAK2 mutation in various myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs). Our data demonstrate that IL-27R possesses hematopoietic cell-transforming properties and suggest that, analogous to homodimeric type I cytokine receptors, single-chain components of heterodimeric receptors can also enhance the activation of JAK2-V617F. Therefore, such receptors may play unappreciated roles in MPDs. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 D052061 D013485
324520	19770516	The translocation of Ca2+ across phospholipid bilayers induced by a synthetic neutral Ca2+ -ionophore.	The effect of a neutral synthetic Ca2+ -ligand, which induces selective Ca2+ transport in electrodialysis experiments in bulk membranes, on the Ca2+ permeability of phospholipid bilayers has been investigated. The ligand is able to promote the transport of Ca2+ across synthetic phospholipid bilayers and can therefore be classified as a Ca2+ -ionophore. Its activity is enhanced by the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). The efficiency of the neutral carrier-mediated Ca2+ transport is rather low as compared with that of the charged Ca2+ -ionophore X537A. The Ca2+ selectivity of the nuetral ionophore is decreased by its incorporation in the low dielectric ambient of the phospholipid bilayer. 	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428
16751543	20060606	Nitrification in a biofilm at low pH values: role of in situ microenvironments and acid tolerance.	The sensitivity of nitrifying bacteria to acidic conditions is a well-known phenomenon and generally attributed to the lack and/or toxicity of substrates (NH3 and HNO2) with decreasing pHs. In contrast, we observed strong nitrification at a pH around 4 in biofilms grown on chalk particles and investigated the following hypotheses: the presence of less acidic microenvironments and/or the existence of acid-tolerant nitrifiers. Microelectrode measurements (in situ and under various experimental conditions) showed no evidence of a neutral microenvironment, either within the highly active biofilm colonizing the chalk surface or within a control biofilm grown on a nonbuffering (i.e., sintered glass) surface under acidic pH. A 16S rRNA approach (clone libraries and fluorescence in situ hybridizations) did not reveal uncommon nitrifying (potentially acid-tolerant) strains. Instead, we found a strongly acidic microenvironment, evidence for a clear adaptation to the low pH in situ, and the presence of nitrifying populations related to subgroups with low Km s for ammonia (Nitrosopira spp., Nitrosomonas oligotropha, and Nitrospira spp.). Acid-consuming (chalk dissolution) and acid-producing (ammonia oxidation) processes are equilibrated on a low-pH steady state that is controlled by mass transfer limitation through the biofilm. Strong affinity to ammonia and possibly the expression of additional functions, e.g., ammonium transporters, are adaptations that allow nitrifiers to cope with acidic conditions in biofilms and other habitats.

21605412	20110525	Genes in the terminal regions of orthopoxvirus genomes experience adaptive molecular evolution.	Orthopoxviruses are dsDNA viruses with large genomes, some encoding over 200 genes. Genes essential for viral replication are located in the center of the linear genome and genes encoding host response modifiers and other host interacting proteins are located in the terminal regions. The central portion of the genome is highly conserved, both in gene content and sequence, while the terminal regions are more diverse. In this study, we investigated the role of adaptive molecular evolution in poxvirus genes and the selective pressures that act on the different regions of the genome. The relative fixation rates of synonymous and non-synonymous mutations (the d(N)/d(S) ratio) are an indicator of the mechanism of evolution of sequences, and can be used to identify purifying, neutral, or diversifying selection acting on a gene. Like highly conserved residues, amino acids under diversifying selection may be functionally important. Many genes experiencing diversifying selection are involved in host-pathogen interactions, such as antigen-antibody interactions, or the &quot;host-pathogen arms race.&quot; We analyzed 175 gene families from orthopoxviruses for evidence of diversifying selection. 79 genes were identified as experiencing diversifying selection, 25 with high confidence. Many of these genes are located in the terminal regions of the genome and function to modify the host response to infection or are virion-associated, indicating a greater role for diversifying selection in host-interacting genes. Of the 79 genes, 20 are of unknown function, and implicating diversifying selection as an important mechanism in their evolution may help characterize their function or identify important functional residues. We conclude that diversifying selection is an important mechanism of orthopoxvirus evolution. Diversifying selection in poxviruses may be the result of interaction with host defense mechanisms.

10494756	19990924	Risk factors associated with postpartum ovarian vein thrombosis.	Thrombosis of the ovarian vein is a remarkable process occuring within a few days of labor in 1:500-1:2000 women. Its presentation is characterized by fever, abdominal pain and occasionally by a palpable abdominal mass that in earlier years sometimes lead to explorative laparotomy. With the advent of modern imaging techniques the diagnosis can be made relatively easily. The pathogenesis has been attributed to an infectious process expanding from the uterus to the right ovarian vein and stasis. A predisposition towards thrombosis has not been so far explored. In this study we retrospectively analysed the clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of 22 patients with objective documentation of post partum ovarian vein thrombosis (POVT) and assessed potential risk factors. In 11 of the 22 patients (50%) inherited prothrombotic risk factors were detected as follows: 4 were heterozygous for factor V G1691A, 2 had protein S deficiency, one had protein S deficiency and was heterozygous for factor V G1691A, and 4 were homozygous for MTHFR C677T. Eight of the 11 patients who bore a prothrombotic predisposition underwent cesarean section. Taken together, the data suggest that POVT may result from the combined effect of an infection, cesarean section and a prothrombotic tendency. 	Thromb._Haemost.	D016428
28032721	20161230	The Role of Genetic Polymorphisms in Nrf2 and P73 in Egyptian Women with Breast Cancer	Background: Breast cancer is the commonest cancer in Egyptian females. Nrf2 is involved in oxidative stress while P73 functions in response to DNA damage. This study aimed to assess the role of Nrf2 promoter and P73 G4C14 to A4T14 SNPs in breast cancer in Egypt. Patients: Eighty-five female patients with breast tumours (41 malignant, 44 benign) were included. Nrf2 (rs6721961) and p73 (G4A) SNPs were determined by PCR- CTPP assay. Results: Genotype frequencies of the Nrf2 promoter SNP were 34.2% and 37.9% for AA in benign and malignant groups respectively, and 43.9% and 40.5% for CC and, 21.9 % and 21.6% for CA. Genotype frequencies for the P73 G4A SNP were 52.9% and 44.7% for GA in benign and malignant groups respectively, and 47.1% and 55.3% for GG. Discussion: Nrf2 genotypes in pre - and post-menopausal patients, showed significantly different distributions in the 2 patient groups, the AA genotype being significantly more common in pre-menopausal patients. The P73 G4A SNP showed no relation to age of disease onset. Conclusion: The Nrf2 (rs6721961) AA genotype might be related to early breast cancer onset. In contrast the P73 G4A polymorphism showed no relation to either disease risk or age at presentation. 	Asian_Pac._J._Cancer_Prev.	D016428
25180701	20140903	Improved cell-free RNA and protein synthesis system.	Cell-free RNA and protein synthesis (CFPS) is becoming increasingly used for protein production as yields increase and costs decrease. Advances in reconstituted CFPS systems such as the Protein synthesis Using Recombinant Elements (PURE) system offer new opportunities to tailor the reactions for specialized applications including in vitro protein evolution, protein microarrays, isotopic labeling, and incorporating unnatural amino acids. In this study, using firefly luciferase synthesis as a reporter system, we improved PURE system productivity up to 5 fold by adding or adjusting a variety of factors that affect transcription and translation, including Elongation factors (EF-Ts, EF-Tu, EF-G, and EF4), ribosome recycling factor (RRF), release factors (RF1, RF2, RF3), chaperones (GroEL/ES), BSA and tRNAs. The work provides a more efficient defined in vitro transcription and translation system and a deeper understanding of the factors that limit the whole system efficiency.

25787277	20150320	Phosphorylation controls the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of influenza A virus nucleoprotein.	The nucleoprotein (NP) is a major component of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex. During the replication of influenza virus, the vRNP complex undergoes nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, during which NP serves as one of the determinants. To date, many phosphorylation sites on NP have been identified, but the biological functions of many of these phosphorylation sites remain unknown. In the present study, the functions of the phosphorylation sites S9, Y10, and Y296 were characterized. These residues are highly conserved, and their phosphorylation was essential for virus growth in cell culture and in a mouse model by regulating the activity of the viral polymerase and the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of NP. The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of S9 and Y10 controlled nuclear import of NP by affecting the binding affinity between NP and different isoforms of importin-?. In addition, the phosphorylation of Y296 caused nuclear retention of NP by reducing the interaction between NP and CRM1. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of NP during the early stage of virus infection was ablated when Y296 was mutated to F. However, at later stages of infection, it was weakened by the Y10F mutation. Taken together, the present data indicate that the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of NP control the shuttling of NP between the nucleus and the cytoplasm during virus replication. It is well known that phosphorylation regulates the functions of viral proteins and the life cycle of influenza A virus. As NP is the most abundant protein in the vRNP complex of influenza A virus, several phosphorylation sites on this protein have been identified. However, the functions of these phosphorylation sites were unknown. The present study demonstrates that the phosphorylation status of these sites on NP can mediate its nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, which drives the trafficking of vRNP complexes in infected cells. The present data suggest that the phosphorylated residues of NP are multistep controllers of the virus life cycle and new targets for the design of anti-influenza drugs. 	J._Virol.	D016428 D013485
22737475	20120628	The Association between Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease and the Human ABCA1 and APOE Gene Polymorphisms in Iranian Population.	Apolipoprotein E (APOE), which its ?4 allele has been reported as a risk factor in late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), is the main cholesterol carrier in the brain. ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) gene on chromosome 9, which has been known by genome-wide AD linkage study, has an important role in cellular cholesterol efflux. This study determines the association between sporadic AD and the human ABCA1 and APOE gene polymorphisms in Iranian population. 154 AD cases and 162 control subjects from Iranian population were genotyped for APOE genotypes and ABCA1 polymorphism (R219K). The frequency of ?2?3 genotype was higher in control subjects comparing AD patients but was not significant (13% versus 5.8%) and ?3?4 genotype frequency was significantly higher in AD cases comparing with control subjects. APOE-?2 allele frequency in cases was lower than control subjects but this difference was not significant (4.5% versus 8%). Individuals carrying ?4 allele, developed AD 6.5 times more than non-carriers (OR=6.52, 95%CI=2.63-16.17). There was no significant association between ABCA1 polymorphism and AD. Unlike other studies, R219K polymorphism was not dependent on gender and APOE-?4 allele and there was no association between APOE and ABCA1 in AD patients compared to controls.

25242937	20140923	Carum copticum and Thymus vulgaris oils inhibit virulence in Trichophyton rubrum and Aspergillus spp.	Emergence of drug-resistant strains has demanded for alternative means of combating fungal infections. Oils of Carum copticum and Thymus vulgaris have long been used in ethnomedicine for ailments of various fungal infections. Since their activity has not been reported in particular against drug-resistant fungi, this study was aimed to evaluate the effects of oils of C. copticum and T. vulgaris on the growth and virulence of drug-resistant strains of Aspergillus spp. and Trichophyton rubrum. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed thymol constituting 44.71% and 22.82% of T. vulgaris and C. copticum, respectively. Inhibition of mycelial growth by essential oils was recorded in the order of thymol &gt; T. vulgaris &gt; C. copticum against the tested strains. RBC lysis assay showed no tested oils to be toxic even up to concentration two folds higher than their respective MFCs. Thymol exhibited highest synergy in combination with fluconazole against Aspergillus fumigatus MTCC2550 (FICI value 0.187) and T. rubrum IOA9 (0.156) as determined by checkerboard method. Thymol and T. vulgaris essential oil were equally effective against both the macro and arthroconidia growth (MIC 72 ?g/mL). A &gt; 80% reduction in elastase activity was recorded for A. fumigatus MTCC2550 by C. copticum, T. vulgaris oils and thymol. The effectiveness of these oils against arthroconidia and synergistic interaction of thymol and T. vulgaris with fluconazole can be exploited to potentiate the antifungal effects of fluconazole against drug-resistant strains of T. rubrum and Aspergillus spp. 	Braz._J._Microbiol.

26691986	20151223	Mutations in CTNNA1 cause butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy and perturbed retinal pigment epithelium integrity.	Butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy is an eye disease characterized by lesions in the macula that can resemble the wings of a butterfly. Here we report the identification of heterozygous missense mutations in the CTNNA1 gene (encoding ?-catenin 1) in three families with butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy. In addition, we identified a Ctnna1 missense mutation in a chemically induced mouse mutant, tvrm5. Parallel clinical phenotypes were observed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of individuals with butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy and in tvrm5 mice, including pigmentary abnormalities, focal thickening and elevated lesions, and decreased light-activated responses. Morphological studies in tvrm5 mice demonstrated increased cell shedding and the presence of large multinucleated RPE cells, suggesting defects in intercellular adhesion and cytokinesis. This study identifies CTNNA1 gene variants as a cause of macular dystrophy, indicates that CTNNA1 is involved in maintaining RPE integrity and suggests that other components that participate in intercellular adhesion may be implicated in macular disease.

25130572	20140819	An automated system using spatial oversampling for optical mapping in murine atria. Development and validation with monophasic and transmembrane action potentials.	We developed and validated a new optical mapping system for quantification of electrical activation and repolarisation in murine atria. The system makes use of a novel 2nd generation complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera with deliberate oversampling to allow both assessment of electrical activation with high spatial and temporal resolution (128??2048 pixels) and reliable assessment of atrial murine repolarisation using post-processing of signals. Optical recordings were taken from isolated, superfused and electrically stimulated murine left atria. The system reliably describes activation sequences, identifies areas of functional block, and allows quantification of conduction velocities and vectors. Furthermore, the system records murine atrial action potentials with comparable duration to both monophasic and transmembrane action potentials in murine atria. 	Prog._Biophys._Mol._Biol.

18450598	20080503	Association of LOXL1 gene polymorphisms with pseudoexfoliation in the Japanese.	The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1048661, rs3825942, and rs2165241 within the LOXL1 gene were recently found to confer risk of pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (XFG) through pseudoexfoliation syndrome (XFS) in Caucasians. The purpose of this study was to test this association in Japanese subjects with XFS/XFG. Japanese subjects with clinically diagnosed XFS/XFG and normal control subjects were recruited. Genomic DNA was extracted and the three SNPs of the LOXL1 gene were genotyped by bidirectional sequencing. The association of individual SNPs with XFG/XFS was evaluated by using chi(2) and the Fisher exact test. Two hundred nine Japanese patients (106 XFG and 103 XFS) and 172 control subjects were studied. Strong associations were observed for all three SNPs of LOXL1 for XFS (odds ratio [OR] = 13.56, P = 3.39 x 10(-28) for allele T of rs1048661; OR = 10.71, P = 1.49 x 10(-7) for allele G of rs3825942; and OR = 4.55, P = 5.33 x 10(-4) for allele C of rs2165241) and XFG (OR = 25.21, P = 1.44 x 10(-34) for allele T of rs1048661; OR = 11.02, P = 1.40 x 10(-7) for allele G of rs3825942; and OR = 11.89, P = 4.76 x 10(-6) for allele C of rs2165241). The risk-associated alleles of rs1048661 and rs2165241 differed between the Japanese and Caucasians, whereas allele G of rs3825942 was associated with disease in both populations. Conditional analysis indicated that rs3825942 was not independent but correlated highly with rs1048661. The at-risk haplotype T-G-C was present at an approximately two times higher rate (94.7% vs. 50.6%, P = 4.22 x 10(-43)) in cases than in control subjects and conferred a 2.9-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.357-3.464) increased likelihood of XFS. Polymorphisms in the LOXL1 gene confer risk to XFS/XFG in the Japanese, but there are different risk-associated alleles and haplotypes in the Japanese. 	Invest._Ophthalmol._Vis._Sci.	D016428 D013485
26137584	20150703	Unraveling the Activation Mechanism of Taspase1 which Controls the Oncogenic AF4-MLL Fusion Protein.	We have recently demonstrated that Taspase1-mediated cleavage of the AF4-MLL oncoprotein results in the formation of a stable multiprotein complex which forms the key event for the onset of acute proB leukemia in mice. Therefore, Taspase1 represents a conditional oncoprotein in the context of t(4;11) leukemia. In this report, we used site-directed mutagenesis to unravel the molecular events by which Taspase1 becomes sequentially activated. Monomeric pro-enzymes form dimers which are autocatalytically processed into the enzymatically active form of Taspase1 (????). The active enzyme cleaves only very few target proteins, e.g., MLL, MLL4 and TFIIA at their corresponding consensus cleavage sites (CSTasp1) as well as AF4-MLL in the case of leukemogenic translocation. This knowledge was translated into the design of a dominant-negative mutant of Taspase1 (dnTASP1). As expected, simultaneous expression of the leukemogenic AF4-MLL and dnTASP1 causes the disappearance of the leukemogenic oncoprotein, because the uncleaved AF4-MLL protein (328?kDa) is subject to proteasomal degradation, while the cleaved AF4-MLL forms a stable oncogenic multi-protein complex with a very long half-life. Moreover, coexpression of dnTASP1 with a BFP-CSTasp1-GFP FRET biosensor effectively inhibits cleavage. The impact of our findings on future drug development and potential treatment options for t(4;11) leukemia will be discussed. 	EBioMedicine	D016428
21818358	20110806	Predicting inactive conformations of protein kinases using active structures: conformational selection of type-II inhibitors.	Protein kinases have been found to possess two characteristic conformations in their activation-loops: the active DFG-in conformation and the inactive DFG-out conformation. Recently, it has been very interesting to develop type-II inhibitors which target the DFG-out conformation and are more specific than the type-I inhibitors binding to the active DFG-in conformation. However, solving crystal structures of kinases with the DFG-out conformation remains a challenge, and this seriously hampers the application of the structure-based approaches in development of novel type-II inhibitors. To overcome this limitation, here we present a computational approach for predicting the DFG-out inactive conformation using the DFG-in active structures, and develop related conformational selection protocols for the uses of the predicted DFG-out models in the binding pose prediction and virtual screening of type-II ligands. With the DFG-out models, we predicted the binding poses for known type-II inhibitors, and the results were found in good agreement with the X-ray crystal structures. We also tested the abilities of the DFG-out models to recognize their specific type-II inhibitors by screening a database of small molecules. The AUC (area under curve) results indicated that the predicted DFG-out models were selective toward their specific type-II inhibitors. Therefore, the computational approach and protocols presented in this study are very promising for the structure-based design and screening of novel type-II kinase inhibitors.

19349540	20090408	Comprehensive pharmacogenetic analysis of irinotecan neutropenia and pharmacokinetics.	We aim to identify genetic variation, in addition to the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism, that can explain the variability in irinotecan (CPT-11) pharmacokinetics and neutropenia in cancer patients. Pharmacokinetic, genetic, and clinical data were obtained from 85 advanced cancer patients treated with single-agent CPT-11 every 3 weeks at doses of 300 mg/m(2) (n = 20) and 350 mg/m(2) (n = 65). Forty-two common variants were genotyped in 12 candidate genes of the CPT-11 pathway using several methodologies. Univariate and multivariate models of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir and pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated. Almost 50% of the variation in ANC nadir is explained by UGT1A1*93, ABCC1 IVS11 -48C&gt;T, SLCO1B1*1b, ANC baseline levels, sex, and race (P &lt; .0001). More than 40% of the variation in CPT-11 area under the curve (AUC) is explained by ABCC2 -24C&gt;T, SLCO1B1*5, HNF1A 79A&gt;C, age, and CPT-11 dose (P &lt; .0001). Almost 30% of the variability in SN-38 (the active metabolite of CPT-11) AUC is explained by ABCC1 1684T&gt;C, ABCB1 IVS9 -44A&gt;G, and UGT1A1*93 (P = .004). Other models explained 17%, 23%, and 27% of the variation in APC (a metabolite of CPT-11), SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G), and SN-38G/SN-38 AUCs, respectively. When tested in univariate models, pretreatment total bilirubin was able to modify the existing associations between genotypes and phenotypes. On the basis of this exploratory analysis, common polymorphisms in genes encoding for ABC and SLC transporters may have a significant impact on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CPT-11. Confirmatory studies are required. 	J._Clin._Oncol.	D016428 D052061
21706148	20110628	Modes of A? toxicity in Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is reaching epidemic proportions, yet a cure is not yet available. While the genetic causes of the rare familial inherited forms of AD are understood, the causes of the sporadic forms of the disease are not. Histopathologically, these two forms of AD are indistinguishable: they are characterized by amyloid-? (A?) peptide-containing amyloid plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles. In this review we compare AD to frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a subset of which is characterized by tau deposition in the absence of overt plaques. A host of transgenic animal AD models have been established through the expression of human proteins with pathogenic mutations previously identified in familial AD and FTD. Determining how these mutant proteins cause disease in vivo should contribute to an understanding of the causes of the more frequent sporadic forms. We discuss the insight transgenic animal models have provided into A? and tau toxicity, also with regards to mitochondrial function and the crucial role tau plays in mediating A? toxicity. We also discuss the role of miRNAs in mediating the toxic effects of the A? peptide. 	Cell._Mol._Life_Sci.	D016428 D013485 D016454
22558216	20120505	Electromagnetic treatment to old Alzheimer's mice reverses ?-amyloid deposition, modifies cerebral blood flow, and provides selected cognitive benefit.	Few studies have investigated physiologic and cognitive effects of &quot;long-term&quot; electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure in humans or animals. Our recent studies have provided initial insight into the long-term impact of adulthood EMF exposure (GSM, pulsed/modulated, 918 MHz, 0.25-1.05 W/kg) by showing 6+ months of daily EMF treatment protects against or reverses cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's transgenic (Tg) mice, while even having cognitive benefit to normal mice. Mechanistically, EMF-induced cognitive benefits involve suppression of brain ?-amyloid (A?) aggregation/deposition in Tg mice and brain mitochondrial enhancement in both Tg and normal mice. The present study extends this work by showing that daily EMF treatment given to very old (21-27 month) Tg mice over a 2-month period reverses their very advanced brain A? aggregation/deposition. These very old Tg mice and their normal littermates together showed an increase in general memory function in the Y-maze task, although not in more complex tasks. Measurement of both body and brain temperature at intervals during the 2-month EMF treatment, as well as in a separate group of Tg mice during a 12-day treatment period, revealed no appreciable increases in brain temperature (and no/slight increases in body temperature) during EMF &quot;ON&quot; periods. Thus, the neuropathologic/cognitive benefits of EMF treatment occur without brain hyperthermia. Finally, regional cerebral blood flow in cerebral cortex was determined to be reduced in both Tg and normal mice after 2 months of EMF treatment, most probably through cerebrovascular constriction induced by freed/disaggregated A? (Tg mice) and slight body hyperthermia during &quot;ON&quot; periods. These results demonstrate that long-term EMF treatment can provide general cognitive benefit to very old Alzheimer's Tg mice and normal mice, as well as reversal of advanced A? neuropathology in Tg mice without brain heating. Results further underscore the potential for EMF treatment against AD. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061 D013485
21893585	20110907	Identification of novel proteins associated with yeast snR30 small nucleolar RNA.	H/ACA small nucleolar RNPs (snoRNPs) that guide pseudouridylation reactions are comprised of one small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and four common proteins (Cbf5, Gar1, Nhp2 and Nop10). Unlike other H/ACA snoRNPs, snR30 is essential for the early processing reactions that lead to the production of 18S ribosomal RNA in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To determine whether snR30 RNP contains specific proteins that contribute to its unique functional properties, we devised an affinity purification strategy using TAP-tagged Gar1 and an RNA aptamer inserted in snR30 snoRNA to selectively purify the RNP. Northern blotting and pCp labeling experiments showed that S1-tagged snR30 snoRNA can be selectively purified with streptavidin beads. Protein analysis revealed that aptamer-tagged snR30 RNA was associated with the four H/ACA proteins and a number of additional proteins: Nop6, ribosomal proteins S9 and S18 and histones H2B and H4. Using antibodies raised against Nop6 we show that endogenous Nop6 localizes to the nucleolus and that it cosediments with snR30 snoRNA in sucrose density gradients. We demonstrate through primer extension experiments that snR30 snoRNA is required for cleavages at site A0, A1 and A2, and that the absence of Nop6 decreases the efficiency of cleavage at site A2. Finally, electron microscopy analyses of chromatin spreads from cells depleted of snR30 snoRNA show that it is required for SSU processome assembly. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D013485 D013486
17721624	20070828	Association of specific haplotypes of GAS6 gene with stroke.	The product of the growth arrest-specific gene 6 (GAS6), a ligand for tyrosine kinase receptors, is a vitamin K-dependent protein, structurally related to anticoagulant protein S. Gas6-deficient mice are protected against thrombosis, demonstrating the importance of this protein in the cardiovascular system. In a preliminary study on GAS6 polymorphisms and atherothrombotic disease we found an association between the AA genotype of the c.834 + 7G &gt; A GAS6 polymorphism and stroke. In order to further explore this association by considering GAS6 haplotypes and the main stroke subtypes, 457 patients with ischemic stroke, 199 with hemorrhagic stroke and 150 asymptomatic controls were genotyped for eight GAS6 polymorphisms and other genetic markers in the same genome region. Association was measured by logistic regression analysis. The THESIAS program was used to measure linkage disequilibrium and haplotype frequencies. In univariate analysis, the GAS6 c.834 + 7AA genotype was found associated with decreased risk for stroke (OR: 0.59; 95%CI: 0.37-0.93). After adjustment for vascular risk factors, association was maintained when stroke subtypes affecting the microvasculature such as lacunar stroke and deep haemorrhage, were grouped together (OR: 0.44; 95%CI: 0.21-0.90). Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed that association was even stronger when the c.834 + 7A allele was present in a specific haplotype (CACA) of four GAS6 polymorphisms. From these results we conclude that the A allele of the GAS6 c.834 + 7G &gt; A polymorphism and more specifically, the CACA haplotype, is less prevalent in patients with stroke, suggesting a protective role for stroke of this haplotype.

21189332	20101230	CYP2G2, pseudogenized in human, is expressed in nasal mucosa of cynomolgus monkey and encodes a functional drug-metabolizing enzyme.	CYP2G2P is pseudogenized in humans because of two nonsense mutations (c.76C&gt;T in exon 1 and c.382C&gt;T in exon 3) in the putative coding region of the gene sequence, whereas mouse, rat, and rabbit CYP2Gs are expressed and functional in nasal mucosa. In this study, we assessed the intactness of CYP2G in a cynomolgus monkey, a macaque species important for drug metabolism studies because of its evolutionary closeness to human. On the basis of a gene sequence (highly identical to human CYP2G2P) found in the macaque genome, CYP2G2 cDNA was successfully isolated from cynomolgus monkey nasal mucosa. CYP2G2 cDNA, containing an open reading frame of 494 amino acids, was shown to share high sequence identity (nearly 95%) with the putative coding region of human CYP2G2P. Cynomolgus monkey CYP2G2 shared the highest sequence identity (59-61%) with CYP2A23, CYP2A24, and CYP2A26 among cynomolgus monkey cytochromes P450. Cynomolgus monkey CYP2G2 mRNA was predominantly expressed in the nasal mucosa, where CYP2G2 protein expression was also detected. Metabolic assays indicated that cynomolgus monkey CYP2G2 metabolized coumarin, similar to cynomolgus monkey CYP2A23, CYP2A24, and CYP2A26. Moreover, among 39 cynomolgus monkeys and 11 rhesus monkeys examined in this study, only 2 cynomolgus monkeys and 1 rhesus monkey were heterozygous for c.76C&gt;T. No animals carried c.382C&gt;T. These results suggest that cynomolgus monkey CYP2G2 is a functional drug-metabolizing enzyme in nasal mucosa. 	Drug_Metab._Dispos.	D016428
15789135	20050325	SOD1 mutations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Results from a multicenter Italian study.	Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), the most common form among motoneuron diseases, is characterized by a progressive neurodegenerative process involving motor neurons in the motor cortex, brain stem and spinal cord. Sporadic (SALS) accounts for the majority of patients but in about 10% of ALS cases the disease is inherited (FALS), usually as an autosomal dominant trait. In the present study we show the results of a referred based multicenter study on the distribution of SOD1 gene mutations in the largest cohort of Italian ALS patients described so far. Two hundred and sixty-four patients (39 FALS and 225 SALS) of Italian origin were studied. In 7 out of 39 FALS patients we found the following SOD1 gene mutations: i) a new G12R missense mutation in exon 1, found in a patient with a slowly progressive disease course; ii) the G41S mutation, in four unrelated patients with rapidly progressive course complicated with cognitive decline in two of them; iii) the L114F mutation, in a patient with a slowly progressive phenotype; iv) the D90A mutation, in a heterozygous patient with atypical phenotype. In addition, in one SALS patient a previously reported synonymous variant S59S was identified. In 17 (3 FALS and 14 SALS) out of 264 patients (6.4 %) the polymorphism A--&gt;C at position 34 of intron 3 (IVS3: + 34 A--&gt;C) was found, and in one FALS patient a novel variant IVS3 + 62 T--&gt;C was identified. The frequency of SOD1 gene mutations (17.9 %) in FALS cases was comparable with that found in other surveys with a similar sample size of ALS cases. No SOD1 gene mutations have been identified in SALS cases. Within FALS cases, The most frequent mutation was the G41S identified in four FALS. 	J._Neurol.	D003160 D016428 D016448
23641193	20130504	Adult hippocampal neurogenesis reduces memory interference in humans: opposing effects of aerobic exercise and depression.	Since the remarkable discovery of adult neurogenesis in the mammalian hippocampus, considerable effort has been devoted to unraveling the functional significance of these new neurons. Our group has proposed that a continual turnover of neurons in the DG could contribute to the development of event-unique memory traces that act to reduce interference between highly similar inputs. To test this theory, we implemented a recognition task containing some objects that were repeated across trials as well as some objects that were highly similar, but not identical, to ones previously observed. The similar objects, termed lures, overlap substantially with previously viewed stimuli, and thus, may require hippocampal neurogenesis in order to avoid catastrophic interference. Lifestyle factors such as aerobic exercise and stress have been shown to impact the local neurogenic microenvironment, leading to enhanced and reduced levels of DG neurogenesis, respectively. Accordingly, we hypothesized that healthy young adults who take part in a long-term aerobic exercise regime would demonstrate enhanced performance on the visual pattern separation task, specifically at correctly categorizing lures as &quot;similar.&quot; Indeed, those who experienced a proportionally large change in fitness demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in their ability to correctly identify lure stimuli as &quot;similar.&quot; Conversely, we expected that those who score high on depression scales, an indicator of chronic stress, would exhibit selective deficits at appropriately categorizing lures. As expected, those who scored high on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were significantly worse than those with relatively lower BDI scores at correctly identifying lures as &quot;similar,&quot; while performance on novel and repeated stimuli was identical. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that adult-born neurons in the DG contribute to the orthogonalization of incoming information. 	Front_Neurosci	D016428
8621645	19960419	Co-purification and direct interaction of Ras with caveolin, an integral membrane protein of caveolae microdomains. Detergent-free purification of caveolae microdomains.	Caveolae are plasma membrane specializations that have been implicated in signal transduction. Caveolin, a 21-24-kDa integral membrane protein, is a principal structural component of caveolae membranes in vivo. G protein alpha subunits are concentrated in purified preparations of caveolae membranes, and caveolin interacts directly with multiple G protein alpha subunits, including G(s), G(o), and G(i2). Mutational or pharmacologic activation of G alpha subunits prevents the interaction of caveolin with G proteins, indicating that inactive G alpha subunits preferentially interact with caveolin. Here, we show that caveolin interacts with another well characterized signal transducer, Ras. Using a detergent-free procedure for purification of caveolin-rich membrane domains and a polyhistidine tagged form of caveolin, we find that Ras and other classes of lipid-modified signaling molecules co-fractionate and co-elute with caveolin. The association of Ras with caveolin was further evaluated using two distinct in vitro binding assays. Wild-type H-Ras interacted with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-caveolin fusion proteins but not with GST alone. Using a battery of GST fusion proteins encoding distinct regions of caveolin, Ras binding activity was localized to a 41-amino acid membrane proximal region of the cytosolic N-terminal domain of caveolin. In addition, reconstituted caveolin-rich membranes (prepared with purified recombinant caveolin and purified lipids) interacted with a soluble form of wild-type H-Ras but failed to interact with mutationally activated soluble H-Ras (G12V). Thus, a single amino acid change (G12V) that constitutively activates Ras prevents or destabilizes this interaction. These results clearly indicate that (i) caveolin is sufficient to recruit soluble Ras onto lipid membranes and (ii) membrane-bound caveolin preferentially interacts with inactive Ras proteins. In direct support of these in vitro studies, we also show that recombinant overexpression of caveolin in intact cells is sufficient to functionally recruit a nonfarnesylated mutant of Ras (C186S) onto membranes, overcoming the normal requirement for lipid modification of Ras. Taken together, these observations suggest that caveolin may function as a scaffolding protein to localize or sequester certain caveolin-interacting proteins, such as wild-type Ras, within caveolin-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane.

21888685	20110906	Cardiovascular disease in systemic sclerosis--an emerging association?	Microvascular disease is a prominent feature of systemic sclerosis (SSc) and leads to Raynaud's phenomenon, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and scleroderma renal crisis. The presence of macrovascular disease is less well established, and, in particular, it is not known whether the prevalence of coronary heart disease in SSc is increased. Furthermore, in terms of cardiac involvement in SSc, there remains conjecture about the relative contributions of atherosclerotic macrovascular disease and myocardial microvascular disease. In this review, we summarize the literature describing cardiovascular disease in SSc, discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms common to SSc and atherosclerosis, and review the surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease which have been examined in SSc. Proposed mediators of the vasculopathy of SSc which have also been implicated in atherosclerosis include endothelial dysfunction, a reduced number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells, and an increased number of microparticles. Excess cardiovascular risk in SSc is suggested by increased arterial stiffness and carotid intima thickening and reduced flow-mediated dilatation. Cohort studies of adequate size are required to resolve whether this translates into an increased incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with SSc. 	Arthritis_Res._Ther.	D016428 D016454
26818796	20160129	Adenylylation of Tyr77 stabilizes Rab1b GTPase in an active state: A molecular dynamics simulation analysis.	The pathogenic pathway of Legionella pneumophila exploits the intercellular vesicle transport system via the posttranslational attachment of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to the Tyr77 sidechain of human Ras like GTPase Rab1b. The modification, termed adenylylation, is performed by the bacterial enzyme DrrA/SidM, however the effect on conformational properties of the molecular switch mechanism of Rab1b remained unresolved. In this study we find that the adenylylation of Tyr77 stabilizes the active Rab1b state by locking the switch in the active signaling conformation independent of bound GTP or GDP and that electrostatic interactions due to the additional negative charge in the switch region make significant contributions. The stacking interaction between adenine and Phe45 however, seems to have only minor influence on this stabilisation. The results may also have implications for the mechanistic understanding of conformational switching in other signaling proteins. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D013485

23401650	20130213	Genetic polymorphisms associated with endothelial function in nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.	To examine the relationship between nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) and genetic polymorphisms of enzymes influencing endothelial function. The subjects were 34 patients with NAION (mean age, 62.4 years old; 59% male) and 102 controls (mean age, 63.8 years old; 66% male). Genetic polymorphisms were investigated in three candidate genes associated with endothelial function: endothelin-1 (ET-1), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). The genotype distributions in the patients with NAION were compared with those in the controls. There were no significant differences in the genotype distributions of the ACE I/D and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms between the NAION and control groups (p=0.261 and p=0.354, respectively), whereas the genotype distribution of the G/T (Lys198Asn) polymorphism of the ET-1 gene varied significantly between the groups (p=0.009). After adjusting for covariates, individuals with the TT genotype of the Lys198Asn polymorphism were more likely to develop NAION compared with those with the GG genotype (odds ratio=4.43, 95% confidence interval 1.33-14.73, p=0.015). We found an increased prevalence of a G/T polymorphism of the ET-1 gene in patients with NAION. Our data suggest that this polymorphism may be an important risk factor in developing NAION in the Japanese population. 	Mol._Vis.	D016428
17804902	20070907	First Turkish case of Bernard-Soulier syndrome associated with GPIX N45S.	Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) is a rare bleeding disorder characterized by giant platelets, thrombocytopenia, and a prolonged bleeding time. It is caused by homozygous defects in the glycoprotein (GP) Ib/IX/V complex, which is the receptor for the von Willebrand factor. We examined a Turkish patient with suspected BSS to identify a molecular basis. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that platelet GPIb alpha and GPIX expression was markedly reduced and DNA sequence analysis showed a homozygous N45S missense mutation in the GPIX gene. Haplotype analysis revealed that the family had the same disease haplotype associated with the GPIX N45S commonly found in Northern European BSS. This is the first non-Caucasian Turkish BSS case due to GPIX N45S and is likely the result of a recurrent mutational event. 	Acta_Haematol.	D002363 D016428 D013485
24091739	20131005	Pressurised hot water extraction in continuous flow mode for thermolabile compounds: extraction of polyphenols in red onions.	Extraction and analysis of labile compounds in complex sample matrices, such as plants, is often a big analytical challenge. In this work, the use of a &quot;green and clean&quot; pressurised hot water extraction (PHWE) approach performed in continuous flow mode is explored. Experimental data for extraction and degradation kinetics of selected compounds were utilised to develop a continuous flow extraction (CFE) method targeting thermolabile polyphenols in red onions, with detection by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-diode array detection (DAD)-mass spectrometry (MS). Water containing ethanol and formic acid was used as extraction solvent. Method performance was focused on extraction yield with minimal analyte degradation. By adjusting the flow rate of the extraction solvent, degradation effects were minimised, and complete extraction could be achieved within 60?min. The CFE extraction yields of the polyphenols investigated were 80-90?% of the theoretically calculated quantitative yields and were significantly higher than the yields obtained by conventional methanol extraction and static batch extraction (70-79 and 58-67?% of the theoretical yields, respectively). The precision of the developed method was lower than 8?% expressed as relative standard deviation. 	Anal_Bioanal_Chem	D016428 D013485
25969820	20150514	Association of glutathione S-transferase (GSTM1 and GSTT1) genes with chronic myeloid leukemia.	Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), as most of cancers results from a complex interaction between genetic or non genetic factors. Exposures to xenobiotics endogenous or exogenous associated with a reduced individual ability in detoxifying activity, constitutes a risk of developing cancer. It is known that polymorphism of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) genes affects the detoxification of xenobiotics. Thus, we conducted a case-control study in which 92 patients (Mean age???SD, 40.62???12.7?years) with CML and 93 healthy unrelated controls (Mean age???SD, 41.38???13.4?years) have participated. GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes were determined by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Logistic regression was used to assess the possible link between GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes and CML as well as between combined genotypes and CML. GSTM1 null genotype frequency was slightly higher in patients than control (48.9% vs. 40.9%) but, it was not associated with CML (OR 95% CI, 1.4, 0.78-2.48; p?=?0.271). Moreover, GSTT1 null genotype frequency showed a similar trend between patients and control (17.4% vs. 9.7%; OR 95% CI, 1.97, 0.82-4.71; p?=?0.13). Surprisingly, GSTT1 null genotype was significantly associated with the risk of CML in males (OR 95% CI, 5, 1.25-20.1; p?=?0.023). The combined GSTM1 present/GSTT1 null genotype was found to have a limited effect against the risk of CML (OR 95% CI, 0.3, 0.08-0.99; p?=?0.049). Our findings have shown that GSTT1 null genotype might be a risk factor of CML in males. While, GSTT1 present genotype might be considered as protective against CML. However, further studies with a large sample size are needed to confirm our findings. 	Springerplus	D016428
18927125	20081018	IFIH1 polymorphisms are significantly associated with type 1 diabetes and IFIH1 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.	Genome-wide association (GWA) studies revealed a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D). In an attempt to confirm some of these candidate associations, we genotyped 2046 Caucasian patients and 2417 normal controls from the United States for SNPs in five genomic regions. While no evidence was obtained for four genomic regions (rs2929366/NM_144715 on chromosome 3, rs9127/Q7Z4C4 on chromosome 5, rs1445898/CAPSL on chromosome 5 and rs2302188/NM_033543 on chromosome 19), we provide strong evidence for association between T1D and multiple SNPs in the IFIH1 linkage disequilibrium (LD) block on chromosome 2q. Among the 10 SNPs genotyped for the 2q region, four SNPs located within the IFIH1 gene or at the 5' region of IFIH1 showed significant association with T1D in the Georgia population [odds ratio (OR) = 1.7-1.9] with the best P-value found at SNP rs1990760 (P = 8 x 10(-8) and OR = 1.9). Several SNPs outside of the IFIH1 gene also showed significant but weaker associations. Furthermore, IFIH1 gene expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells are significantly correlated with IFIH1 genotypes, and higher IFIH1 levels are found in individuals with the susceptible genotypes (P = 0.005). Thus, both genetic association and gene expression data suggest that IFIH1 is the most plausible candidate gene implicated in T1D in this LD block. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013485
26968756	20160313	Illumina error profiles: resolving fine-scale variation in metagenomic sequencing data.	Illumina's sequencing platforms are currently the most utilised sequencing systems worldwide. The technology has rapidly evolved over recent years and provides high throughput at low costs with increasing read-lengths and true paired-end reads. However, data from any sequencing technology contains noise and our understanding of the peculiarities and sequencing errors encountered in Illumina data has lagged behind this rapid development. We conducted a systematic investigation of errors and biases in Illumina data based on the largest collection of in vitro metagenomic data sets to date. We evaluated the Genome Analyzer II, HiSeq and MiSeq and tested state-of-the-art low input library preparation methods. Analysing in vitro metagenomic sequencing data allowed us to determine biases directly associated with the actual sequencing process. The position- and nucleotide-specific analysis revealed a substantial bias related to motifs (3mers preceding errors) ending in &quot;GG&quot;. On average the top three motifs were linked to 16 % of all substitution errors. Furthermore, a preferential incorporation of ddGTPs was recorded. We hypothesise that all of these biases are related to the engineered polymerase and ddNTPs which are intrinsic to any sequencing-by-synthesis method. We show that quality-score-based error removal strategies can on average remove 69 % of the substitution errors - however, the motif-bias remains. Single-nucleotide polymorphism changes in bacterial genomes can cause significant changes in phenotype, including antibiotic resistance and virulence, detecting them within metagenomes is therefore vital. Current error removal techniques are not designed to target the peculiarities encountered in Illumina sequencing data and other sequencing-by-synthesis methods, causing biases to persist and potentially affect any conclusions drawn from the data. In order to develop effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches we need to be able to identify systematic sequencing errors and distinguish these errors from true genetic variation.

9770487	19981015	A DNA damage and stress inducible G protein-coupled receptor blocks cells in G2/M.	Cell cycle progression is monitored by highly coordinated checkpoint machinery, which is activated to induce cell cycle arrest until defects like DNA damage are corrected. We have isolated an anti-proliferative cell cycle regulator named G2A (for G2 accumulation), which is predominantly expressed in immature T and B lymphocyte progenitors and is a member of the seven membrane-spanning G protein-coupled receptor family. G2A overexpression attenuates the transformation potential of BCR-ABL and other oncogenes, and leads to accumulation of cells at G2/M independently of p53 and c-Abl. G2A can be induced in lymphocytes and to a lesser extent in nonlymphocyte cell lines or tissues by multiple stimuli including different classes of DNA-damaging agents and serves as a response to damage and cellular stimulation which functions to slow cell cycle progression.

22194948	20111224	Selection-independent generation of gene knockout mouse embryonic stem cells using zinc-finger nucleases.	Gene knockout in murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) has been an invaluable tool to study gene function in vitro or to generate animal models with altered phenotypes. Gene targeting using standard techniques, however, is rather inefficient and typically does not exceed frequencies of 10(-6). In consequence, the usage of complex positive/negative selection strategies to isolate targeted clones has been necessary. Here, we present a rapid single-step approach to generate a gene knockout in mouse ESCs using engineered zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs). Upon transient expression of ZFNs, the target gene is cleaved by the designer nucleases and then repaired by non-homologous end-joining, an error-prone DNA repair process that introduces insertions/deletions at the break site and therefore leads to functional null mutations. To explore and quantify the potential of ZFNs to generate a gene knockout in pluripotent stem cells, we generated a mouse ESC line containing an X-chromosomally integrated EGFP marker gene. Applying optimized conditions, the EGFP locus was disrupted in up to 8% of ESCs after transfection of the ZFN expression vectors, thus obviating the need of selection markers to identify targeted cells, which may impede or complicate downstream applications. Both activity and ZFN-associated cytotoxicity was dependent on vector dose and the architecture of the nuclease domain. Importantly, teratoma formation assays of selected ESC clones confirmed that ZFN-treated ESCs maintained pluripotency. In conclusion, the described ZFN-based approach represents a fast strategy for generating gene knockouts in ESCs in a selection-independent fashion that should be easily transferrable to other pluripotent stem cells.

17626635	20070714	Overexpressed TP73 induces apoptosis in medulloblastoma.	Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood. Children who relapse usually die of their disease, which reflects resistance to radiation and/or chemotherapy. Improvements in outcome require a better understanding of the molecular basis of medulloblastoma growth and treatment response. TP73 is a member of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene family that has been found to be overexpressed in a variety of tumors and mediates apoptotic responses to genotoxic stress. In this study, we assessed expression of TP73 RNA species in patient tumor specimens and in medulloblastoma cell lines, and manipulated expression of full-length TAp73 and amino-terminal truncated DeltaNp73 to assess their effects on growth. We analyzed medulloblastoma samples from thirty-four pediatric patients and the established medulloblastoma cell lines, Daoy and D283MED, for expression of TP73 RNA including the full-length transcript and the 5'-terminal variants that encode the DeltaNp73 isoform, as well as TP53 RNA using quantitative real time-RTPCR. Protein expression of TAp73 and DeltaNp73 was quantitated with immunoblotting methods. Clinical outcome was analyzed based on TP73 RNA and p53 protein expression. To determine effects of overexpression or knock-down of TAp73 and DeltaNp73 on cell cycle and apoptosis, we analyzed transiently transfected medulloblastoma cell lines with flow cytometric and TUNEL methods. Patient medulloblastoma samples and cell lines expressed full-length and 5'-terminal variant TP73 RNA species in 100-fold excess compared to non-neoplastic brain controls. Western immunoblot analysis confirmed their elevated levels of TAp73 and amino-terminal truncated DeltaNp73 proteins. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed trends toward favorable overall and progression-free survival of patients whose tumors display TAp73 RNA overexpression. Overexpression of TAp73 or DeltaNp73 induced apoptosis under basal growth conditions in vitro and sensitized them to cell death in response to chemotherapeutic agents. These results indicate that primary medulloblastomas express significant levels of TP73 isoforms, and suggest that they can modulate the survival and genotoxic responsiveness of medulloblastomas cells.

27446933	20160723	Clinical Genetic Testing for the Cardiomyopathies and Arrhythmias: A Systematic Framework for Establishing Clinical Validity and Addressing Genotypic and Phenotypic Heterogeneity.	Advances in DNA sequencing have made large, diagnostic gene panels affordable and efficient. Broad adoption of such panels has begun to deliver on the promises of personalized medicine, but has also brought new challenges such as the presence of unexpected results, or results of uncertain clinical significance. Genetic analysis of inherited cardiac conditions is particularly challenging due to the extensive genetic heterogeneity underlying cardiac phenotypes, and the overlapping, variable, and incompletely penetrant nature of their clinical presentations. The design of effective diagnostic tests and the effective use of the results depend on a clear understanding of the relationship between each gene and each considered condition. To address these issues, we developed simple, systematic approaches to three fundamental challenges: (1)?evaluating the strength of the evidence suggesting that a particular condition is caused by pathogenic variants in a particular gene, (2) evaluating whether unusual genotype/phenotype observations represent a plausible expansion of clinical phenotype associated with a gene, and (3) establishing a molecular diagnostic strategy to capture overlapping clinical presentations. These approaches focus on the systematic evaluation of the pathogenicity of variants identified in clinically affected individuals, and the natural history of disease in those individuals. Here, we applied these approaches to the evaluation of more than 100 genes reported to be associated with inherited cardiomyopathies and arrhythmias including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia or cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, short QT syndrome, Brugada, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and to a set of related syndromes such as Noonan Syndrome and Fabry disease. These approaches provide a framework for delivering meaningful and accurate genetic test results to individuals with hereditary cardiac conditions. 	Front_Cardiovasc_Med	D016428

27819323	20161108	Donor and recipient genetic variants in NLRP3 associate with early acute rejection following kidney transplantation.	NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3) is a member of the inflammasome family and is of special interest in renal disease. Experimental studies have shown that Nlrp3 plays a significant role in the induction of renal damage and dysfunction in acute and chronic renal injury. However, the role of NLRP3 in human renal disease is completely unknown. From a retrospective cohort study, we determined in 1271 matching donor and recipient samples if several NLRP3 single nucelotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with primary non-function (PNF), delayed graft function (DGF), biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) and death-censored graft and patient survival. NLRP3 gain-of-function SNP (rs35829419) in donors was associated with an increased risk of BPAR while NLRP3 loss-of-function SNP (rs6672995) in the recipient was associated with a decreased risk of BPAR in the first year following renal transplantation (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.38-2.64, P?&lt;?0.001 and HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.97, P?=?0.03 resp.). NLRP3 SNPs in both donor and recipient were not associated with PNF, DGF, graft survival or patient survival. We conclude that genetic variants in the NLRP3 gene affect the risk of acute rejection following kidney transplantation. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
27330833	20160623	A Case of Homocystinuria Misdiagnosed as Moyamoya Disease: A Case Report.	Homocystinuria is a hereditary disease caused by a defect in the enzymes involved in metabolizing methionine. Homocystinuria can influence many systems and may be mistaken for other diseases, including Moyamoya disease. Here, we report the case of a 10-year-old male patient with a diagnosis of Moyamoya disease who had been monitored for that for an extended period. The patient's diagnosis was changed to homocystinuria as a result of lens subluxation and cataract findings. A 10-year-old male patient presented with vomiting, headache, lethargy, muscular weakness, and eye redness. The patient was mentally retarded, his right pupil was hyperemic, and he had muscle weakness on his left side. In addition, his blood pressure was high. The patient's history included a diagnosis of Moyamoya. A neck and cranial computed tomography (CT) angiography showed no flow bilaterally past the bifurcation of the carotid artery. The patient's bilateral internal carotid arteries were determined to be occluded. It was considered that his eye findings could be compatible with a metabolic disease. On metabolic screening, the patient's homocysteine level was very high. In addition, a heterozygous A1298C mutation was identified in MTHFR. Therefore, the patient was started on a diet free from homocysteine and methionine. In addition, his treatment regimen included vitamins B12 and B6. With these treatments, the patient's complications regressed. In cases of unusual vascular lesions, metabolic diseases must be considered. In homocystinuria, early diagnosis and treatment are important. Blood homocysteine levels can be returned to normal, and some complications can be prevented. 	Iran_Red_Crescent_Med_J	D016428
23718911	20130531	Mining genes involved in the stratification of Paris polyphylla seeds using high-throughput embryo transcriptome sequencing.	Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis is an important medicinal plant. Seed dormancy is one of the main factors restricting artificial cultivation. The molecular mechanisms of seed dormancy remain unclear, and little genomic or transcriptome data are available for this plant. In this study, massive parallel pyrosequencing on the Roche 454-GS FLX Titanium platform was used to generate a substantial sequence dataset for the P. polyphylla embryo. 369,496 high quality reads were obtained, ranging from 50 to 1146 bp, with a mean of 219 bp. These reads were assembled into 47,768 unigenes, which included 16,069 contigs and 31,699 singletons. Using BLASTX searches of public databases, 15,757 (32.3%) unique transcripts were identified. Gene Ontology and Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins annotations revealed that these transcripts were broadly representative of the P. polyphylla embryo transcriptome. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes assigned 5961 of the unique sequences to specific metabolic pathways. Relative expression levels analysis showed that eleven phytohormone-related genes and five other genes have different expression patterns in the embryo and endosperm in the seed stratification process. Gene annotation and quantitative RT-PCR expression analysis identified 464 transcripts that may be involved in phytohormone catabolism and biosynthesis, hormone signal, seed dormancy, seed maturation, cell wall growth and circadian rhythms. In particular, the relative expression analysis of sixteen genes (CYP707A, NCED, GA20ox2, GA20ox3, ABI2, PP2C, ARP3, ARP7, IAAH, IAAS, BRRK, DRM, ELF1, ELF2, SFR6, and SUS) in embryo and endosperm and at two temperatures indicated that these related genes may be candidates for clarifying the molecular basis of seed dormancy in P. polyphlla var. yunnanensis.

19812382	20091009	Genetic variation in CXCR4 and risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	A genome-wide linkage scan has provided evidence for a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) susceptibility locus at 2q21 to which the chemokine receptor CXCR4 gene maps. Recent data provide some evidence for common variation in CXCR4 according to the polymorphic variant rs2228014 defining CLL risk. To examine the role of genetic variation in CXCR4 on CLL risk, we screened 188 familial CLL cases and 213 controls for germline mutations in the coding regions of CXCR4 and genotyped rs2228014 in 1058 CLL cases and 1807 controls. No association between rs2228014 and risk of CLL was seen (P = .83). One truncating (W195X) and 2 missense mutations with possible functional consequences (V139I and G335S) were identified among 186 familial cases and 0 in 213 controls sequenced. Our analysis provides no evidence that common variation in CXCR4 defined by rs228014 influences the risk of CLL, but that functional coding mutations in CXCR4 may contribute to familial CLL.

20554760	20100618	Phosphatidic acid induces ligand-independent epidermal growth factor receptor endocytic traffic through PDE4 activation.	Endocytosis modulates EGFR function by compartmentalizing and attenuating or enhancing its ligand-induced signaling. Here we show that it can also control the cell surface versus intracellular distribution of empty/inactive EGFR. Our previous observation that PKA inhibitors induce EGFR internalization prompted us to test phosphatidic acid (PA) generated by phospholipase D (PLD) as an endogenous down-regulator of PKA activity, which activates rolipram-sensitive type 4 phosphodiesterases (PDE4) that degrade cAMP. We found that inhibition of PA hydrolysis by propranolol, in the absence of ligand, provokes internalization of inactive (neither tyrosine-phosphorylated nor ubiquitinated) EGFR, accompanied by a transient increase in PA levels and PDE4s activity. This EGFR internalization is mimicked by PA micelles and is strongly counteracted by PLD2 silencing, rolipram or forskolin treatment, and PKA overexpression. Accelerated EGFR endocytosis seems to be mediated by clathrin-dependent and -independent pathways, leading to receptor accumulation in juxtanuclear recycling endosomes, also due to a decreased recycling. Internalized EGFR can remain intracellular without degradation for several hours or return rapidly to the cell surface upon discontinuation of the stimulus. This novel regulatory mechanism of EGFR, also novel function of signaling PA, can transmodulate receptor accessibility in response to heterologous stimuli. 	Mol._Biol._Cell	D016428 D013485
21629843	20110602	Functional genomic and proteomic analysis reveals disruption of myelin-related genes and translation in a mouse model of early life neglect.	Early life neglect is an important public health problem which can lead to lasting psychological dysfunction. Good animal models are necessary to understand the mechanisms responsible for the behavioral and anatomical pathology that results. We recently described a novel model of early life neglect, maternal separation with early weaning (MSEW), that produces behavioral changes in the mouse that persist into adulthood. To begin to understand the mechanism by which MSEW leads to these changes we applied cDNA microarray, next-generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), label-free proteomics, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics, and methylation analysis to tissue samples obtained from medial prefrontal cortex to determine the molecular changes induced by MSEW that persist into adulthood. The results show that MSEW leads to dysregulation of markers of mature oligodendrocytes and genes involved in protein translation and other categories, an apparent downward biasing of translation, and methylation changes in the promoter regions of selected dysregulated genes. These findings are likely to prove useful in understanding the mechanism by which early life neglect affects brain structure, cognition, and behavior. 	Front_Psychiatry	D016428
2428514	19860901	Analysis of protective and cytotoxic immune responses in vivo against metabolically inactivated and untreated cells of a mutagenized tumor line (requirements for tumor immunogenicity).	The immunogenicity of a mutagenized subline (ESb-D) of the weakly immunogenic T-cell lymphoma L 5178 Y ESb has been characterized. The injection of 10(6) ESb-D cells ip did not establish lethal tumors in untreated DBA/2 mice but established tumors in sublethally irradiated mice. Injection of ESb-D cells into otherwise untreated DBA/2 mice established also a state of protective immunity against the subsequent injection of otherwise lethal doses of ESb tumor cells. Protection was only obtained after injection of intact but not UV-irradiated or mitomycin-C-treated ESb-D cells. A direct T-cell-mediated cytotoxic activity was also demonstrable in the spleen cells of DBA/2 mice after injection of ESb-D cells but not ESb cells. The cytotoxic activity was variant specific for ESb-D target cells, and it was induced only with intact but not UV-irradiated or mitomycin C-treated ESb-D cells. This suggested that the induction of protective and cytotoxic immunity may require the persistence of the antigen or unusually high antigen doses. The in vivo priming for a secondary in vitro cytotoxic response, in contrast, was achieved with intact and also with mitomycin C-treated ESb-D cells but again not with UV-irradiated ESb-D cells. This indicated that the metabolic activity was a minimal requirement for the in vivo immunogenicity of the ESb-D tumor line. The secondary cytotoxic activity was demonstrable on ESb-D and ESb target cells and could be restimulated in vitro about equally well with ESb-D and ESb cells. But the in vivo priming was again only obtained with ESb-D cells and not with ESb cells. These experiments thus demonstrated that the requirements for immunogenicity are more stringent in vivo than in vitro, and more stringent for the induction of direct cytotoxic and protective immunity in vivo than for the in vivo priming for secondary in vitro responses.

23111982	20121101	A strategy for the molecular diagnosis in hemophilia a in Chinese population.	Hemophilia A is an x-linked recessive inherited bleeding disorder. So far, more than 1,885 disease-causing mutations of factor VIII gene have been identified. Clinic confers a great challenge for the molecular diagnosis. We aim to make a better strategy for the molecular diagnosis in Hemophilia A. First, factor VIII intron 22 inversion and intron 1 inversion mutations were detected using Inversion-PCR and double-tube multiple PCRs. And then, non-inversion mutations were analyzed by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and/or direct sequencing. Novel mutations were further analyzed the conservation and 3D structures by a B domain deleted crystallographic model and bioinformatics. Finally, we can indirectly confirm the diagnosis by linkage analysis for the patients with the confusing diagnosis by the techniques mentioned above. Eleven patients with the factor VIII Inv 22 were found, and the remaining 16 patients were found with 11 different mutations, of which 3 was novel mutations affecting A1, B domains and splicing site. Moreover, the prenatal diagnosis was performed on 14 fetuses. Ten fetuses were successfully confirmed to be normal, 1 fetus to be a heterozygote with factor VIII c.3275-3276 ins A and 3 fetuses to be hemizygotes with factor VIII Inv 22 mutation.

19289107	20090318	Southeast Asian AE1 associated renal tubular acidosis: cation leak is a class effect.	Anion Exchanger 1 (AE1) is present in the erythrocyte and also in the alpha-intercalated cell; different mutations can cause either red cell disease or distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA). Recently, we described a cation leak property in four dRTA-causing AE1 mutants, three autosomal dominant (AD) European mutants, one autosomal recessive (AR) from Southeast Asia, G701D. G701D had a very large leak property and is unusually common in SE Asia. We hypothesized that this property might confer a survival advantage. We characterized three other AR dRTA-associated AE1 mutants found in SE Asia, S773P, Delta850 and A858D via transport experiments in AE1-expressing Xenopus oocytes. These three SE Asian mutants also had cation leaks of similar magnitude to that seen in G701D, a property that distinguishes them as a discrete group. The clustering of these cation-leaky AE1 mutations to malarious areas of SE Asia suggests that they may confer malaria resistance. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.	D016428 D013485
27456681	20160727	The importance of antioxidants which play the role in cellular response against oxidative/nitrosative stress: current state.	Remarkable interest has risen in the idea that oxidative/nitrosative stress is mediated in the etiology of numerous human diseases. Oxidative/Nitrosative stress is the result of an disequilibrium in oxidant/antioxidant which reveals from continuous increase of Reactive Oxygen and Reactive Nitrogen Species production. The aim of this review is to emphasize with current information the importance of antioxidants which play the role in cellular responce against oxidative/nitrosative stress, which would be helpful in enhancing the knowledge of any biochemist, pathophysiologist, or medical personnel regarding this important issue. Products of lipid peroxidation have commonly been used as biomarkers of oxidative/nitrosative stress damage. Lipid peroxidation generates a variety of relatively stable decomposition end products, mainly ?, ?-unsaturated reactive aldehydes, such as malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, 2-propenal (acrolein) and isoprostanes, which can be measured in plasma and urine as an indirect index of oxidative/nitrosative stress. Antioxidants are exogenous or endogenous molecules that mitigate any form of oxidative/nitrosative stress or its consequences. They may act from directly scavenging free radicals to increasing antioxidative defences. Antioxidant deficiencies can develop as a result of decreased antioxidant intake, synthesis of endogenous enzymes or increased antioxidant utilization. Antioxidant supplementation has become an increasingly popular practice to maintain optimal body function. However, antoxidants exhibit pro-oxidant activity depending on the specific set of conditions. Of particular importance are their dosage and redox conditions in the cell.

9643470	19980627	Recovery from the lethal effects of saxitoxin: a therapeutic window for 4-aminopyridine (4-AP).	We have shown that saxitoxin (STX) induced lethality can be reversed by 4-AP when it is administered at the time of respiratory arrest [Benton, B. J., Spriggs, D. L., Capacio, B. R. and Chang, F.-C. T. (1995) 4-Aminopyridine antagonizes the lethal effects of saxitoxin (STX) and tetrodotoxin (TTX). International Society of Toxicology, 5th Pan American Symposium on Animal, Plant and Microbial Toxins, Frederick, MD. July/August 1995, p. 217]. The purpose of this study was to determine whether 4-AP's efficacy could be enhanced further when administered at different times relative to STX intoxication. The animals used in this study were chronically instrumented for concurrent recordings of diaphragm electromyogram (DEMG), neck skeletal muscle electromyogram, Lead II electrocardiogram, and electrocorticogram (ECoG). There were five groups of unanesthetized guinea pigs. The first group served as 4-AP controls and received a 2 mg/kg i.m. dose of 4-AP. The four remaining groups were given a lethal dose of STX (5 microg/kg i.m.); the second group, STX controls, received no 4-AP; the third group, the 4-AP treatment group, received 4-AP immediately following cardiorespiratory collapse; the fourth group was the 4-AP/STX co-administration group and 4-AP was given concurrently with STX; and the fifth group was the 4-AP pretreatment group in which 4-AP was given 10 min before STX. At the point of STX-induced cardiorespiratory collapse, the guinea pigs were ventilated and given an i.p. injection of sodium bicarbonate. Results showed that 4-AP prevented cardiorespiratory collapse in 3/7 animals in the 4-AP pretreatment group. Also, 4-AP in conjunction with artificial ventilation and sodium bicarbonate accelerated recovery from STX-induced cardiorespiratory collapse in all the treatment groups compared to the STX controls.

21188132	20101229	Critical appraisal of temozolomide formulations in the treatment of primary brain tumors: patient considerations.	Chemotherapy is assuming an increasingly important role in the treatment of malignant gliomas, of which temozolomide (TMZ) is a key part. TMZ belongs to a class of second-generation imidazotetrazinone prodrugs that exhibit linear pharmacokinetics and do not require hepatic metabolism for activation to the active metabolite. New intravenous (iv) TMZ formulations have recently been approved based on studies of bioequivalence between iv and oral TMZ. The efficacy of TMZ was initially evaluated in patients with recurrent disease but phase II and III trials in newly diagnosed gliomas are available. The results of a large phase III trial that compared RT alone vs RT concomitant with oral TMZ created a new standard of adjuvant treatment. Efficacy data for iv TMZ on which its approval was based are those extrapolated from clinical trials with oral TMZ. No comparative data are available on the differences in tolerability and patient satisfaction between oral and iv formulations of TMZ, or for quality of life. New oral formulations could encourage the adherence of patients to treatment. Although patients presumably would prefer oral treatment, iv formulations may be an alternative in noncompliant patients or patients for whom good adherence could not be expected.

3384085	19880606	Identification of proteins of the 40 S ribosomal subunit involved in interaction with initiation factor eIF-2 in the quaternary initiation complex by means of monospecific antibodies.	Monospecific polyclonal antibodies against seven proteins of the 40 S subunit of rat liver ribosomes were used to identify ribosomal proteins involved in interaction with initiation factor eIF-2 in the quaternary initiation complex [eIF-2 X GMPPCP X [3H]Met-tRNAf X 40 S ribosomal subunit]. Dimeric immune complexes of 40 S subunits mediated by antibodies against ribosomal proteins S3a, S13/16, S19 and S24 were found to be unable to bind the ternary initiation complex [eIF-2 X GMPPCP X [3H]Met-tRNAf]. In contrast, 40 S dimers mediated by antibodies against proteins S2, S3 and S17 were found to bind the ternary complex. Therefore, from the ribosomal proteins tested, only proteins S3a, S13/16, S19 and S24 are concluded to be involved in eIF-2 binding to the 40 S subunit. 	FEBS_Lett.	D016428
21892197	20110906	Association of two polymorphisms within and near SOCS3 gene with obesity in three nationalities in Xinjiang province of China.	SOCS3 gene plays an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity in animal models, but the data from human studies are relatively limited. To address this issue, a genetic association analysis on nationalities with different genetic background living in the similar environmental conditions was performed. Two thousand seven hundred eleven subjects were randomly recruited from the Kazakh, Uygur and Han nationalities in Xinjiang of China. SNP polymorphisms rs4969168 and rs9892622 within or near the SOCS3 gene were genotyped using TaqMan-MGB? assay. Association study between the two polymorphisms and obesity-related traits (body mass index [BMI]; waist-to-hip ratio [WHR]; weight; height, waist, and hip measurements) was conducted. Significant association was found between rs4969168 and the obesity-related traits, including BMI (25.32 ? 3.49 kg/m(2) for AA, 24.60 ? 3.70 kg/m(2) for AG, 24.39 ? 3.42 kg/m(2) for GG, P=0.042), weight (65.58 ? 11.42 kg for AA, 63.50 ? 11.30 kg for AG, 62.00 ? 10.78 kg for GG, P=0.011) in the Han nationality, but not in the Kazakh or Uygur nationalities. Rs9892622 was significantly associated with BMI, WHR, and WAIST in the Uygur males. Rs9892622 was also associated with BMI in Kazakh males. Linear regression analysis verified the above findings. However, neither of the two polymorphisms was associated with obesity-related traits in the total population. The polymorphism rs4969168 within or near the SOCS3 gene has a significant effect in the Han nationality, while rs9892622 was associated with obesity in Uygur and Kazakh nationalities in Xinjiang of China.

19700676	20090825	Production of exopolysaccharides by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains of human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.	This work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the EPS-producing strains in milk. The strains belong to the species Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus vaginalis, Bifidobacterium animalis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. The molar mass distribution of EPS fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some EPS from bacteria of food origin. In general, we detected an association between the EPS size distribution and the EPS-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial EPS tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. The main monosaccharide components of the EPS under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the galactose ratio in our human bacterial EPS. All EPS-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. The lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the EPS-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. With respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, L. plantarum H2 and L. rhamnosus E41 and E43R were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the EPS-producing Streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive control. Therefore, these human EPS-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. This is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of EPS isolated from human intestinal microbiota. 	J._Dairy_Sci.	D016428 D013485
26296335	20150823	Frequency of transmitted drug resistance mutations among treatment-na?ve HIV-1-infected individuals at a tertiary care centre in South India.	Morbidity and mortality among HIV-1-infected individuals has been dramatically reduced by the implementation of combinational antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, the efficiency of these therapies is compromised due to HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRMs). We collected a total of 127 samples from ART-na?ve HIV-infected individuals and sequenced the pol gene and analysed for drug resistance mutations using the Calibrated Population Resistance (CPR) tool in the Stanford database. All the 127 clinical samples (100?%) were identified as HIV-1 subtype C. Based on the CPR tool, three strains (2.4?%) had TDRMs, and these were K101E, Y181C and G190A. Our findings correlated well with the WHO surveys conducted in Asia, including India, which consistently reported?&lt;5?% TDRM among the specific populations assessed. In countries like India, regular monitoring of TDRMs will provide better information for clinical practice improvement and policy making. 	Mol_Diagn_Ther	D016428 D013485
25583628	20150114	From ventriculomegaly to severe muscular atrophy: expansion of the clinical spectrum related to mutations in AIFM1.	The apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) functions as a FAD-dependent NADH oxidase in mitochondria. Upon apoptotic stimulation it is released from mitochondria and migrates to the nucleus where it induces chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. So far mutations in AIFM1, a X-chromosomal gene coding for AIF, have been described in three families with 11 affected males. We report here on a further patient thereby expanding the clinical and mutation spectrum. In addition, we review the known phenotypes related to AIFM1 mutations. The clinical course in the male patient described here was characterized by phases with rapid deterioration and long phases without obvious progression of disease. At age 2.5 years he developed hearing loss and severe ataxia and at age 10 years muscle wasting, swallowing difficulties, respiratory insufficiency and external opthamoplegia. By next generation sequencing of whole exome we identified a hemizygous missense mutation in the AIFM1 gene, c.727G&gt;T (p.Val243Leu) affecting a highly conserved residue in the FAD-binding domain. Summarizing what is known today, mutations in AIFM1 are associated with a progressive disorder with myopathy, ataxia and neuropathy. Severity varies greatly even within one family with onset of symptoms between birth and adolescence. 3 of 12 patients died before age 5 years while others were still able to walk during young adulthood. Less frequent symptoms were hearing loss, seizures and psychomotor regression. Results from clinical chemistry, brain imaging and muscle biopsy were unspecific and inconsistent.

19043117	20081202	Testis-specific linker histone H1t is multiply phosphorylated during spermatogenesis. Identification of phosphorylation sites.	During normal spermatogenesis, the testis-specific linker histone H1t appears at pachytene stage becomes phosphorylated in early spermatids and disappears in late spermatids. Using reversed-phase and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography, H1t from rat and mouse testes was isolated, subjected to enzymatic digestion, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. We observed different phosphorylated states of H1t (mono-, di-, and triphosphorylated) as well as the unphosphorylated protein. Tandem mass spectrometry and immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography experiments with MS/MS/MS and multistage activation were utilized to identify five phosphorylation sites on H1t from rats. Phosphorylation occurs on both serine and threonine residues, whereas only two of these sites were located on peptides containing the CDK consensus motif (S/T)PXZ. Rat H1t phosphorylation starts first by phosphorylation of the nonconsensus motif SPKS in the COOH-terminal domain, namely at Ser-140 and to a smaller degree at a further nonconsensus motif at Ser-186. This is followed by phosphorylation of Ser-177 and Thr-155, both located in CDK consensus motifs. A single phosphorylation site at Ser-8 in the NH2-terminal tail was also found. Mouse H1t lacks Ser-186 and is phosphorylated at up to four sites. In contrast to somatic linker histones, no strict order of increasing phosphorylation could be detected in H1t. Thus, it appears that not the order of up-phosphorylation but the number of the phosphate groups is necessary for regulated chromatin decondensation, thus facilitating the substitution of H1t by transition proteins and protamines.

2450131	19880315	Clonal analysis of the BALB/c secondary B cell repertoire specific for a self-antigen, cytochrome c.	mAb to rat cytochrome c (cyt c), totaling 556, were produced by individual clones of secondary B lymphocytes from nine groups of five BALB/c mice each in vitro using the splenic focus culture system. Inasmuch as rat and mouse cyt c are identical, these B cells can be considered specific for a self-antigen. The mAb were categorized into specificity groups based on their reactivities with a panel of seven cyts c that differ at two to six amino acid residues. The number of distinct specificities for the native protein was restricted to fewer than 20. Different groups of mice expressed the same specificities at comparable frequencies, including a single dominant one, and the total number of secondary cyt c-specific B cells was constant among groups of mice. This suggests that the acquisition of the secondary B cell specificity repertoire for this self-antigen is regulated. However, it is indeed possible that each specificity group may comprise a number of distinct mAb molecules that have arisen stochastically. Specificities expressed by as few as 1% of the total mAb were observed. Thus, it is likely that the identified specificities reflect the secondary B cell specificity repertoire for rat cyt c. The dominant specificity expressed by 50% of the mAb was characterized by elimination of antigen recognition as a result of replacement of aspartic acid by glutamic acid at position 62. Minor specificities expressed by 19% of the mAb were characterized by more subtle affects of an amino acid change at position 62 and/or an amino acid substitution from rat cyt c at position 60. Antibodies in other specificity groups reacted with epitopes in the region of residues 44 and 47. Whereas substitutions at positions 44, 47, 60, and 62 eliminated recognition by most of the mAb, changes at position 92 and at 103 also appeared to affect the binding of some mAb in the region around residues 60 and 62. The amino acid residues implicated in the recognition by murine mAb of murine cyt c have been shown previously to be involved in the epitopes of foreign mammalian cyt c. Therefore, self-tolerance cannot fully explain the restriction of the epitopes to these regions on foreign mammalian cyt c. 	J._Immunol.	D016428 D013487
20386917	20100414	TNF? gene polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris.	Inflammation plays an important role in acne pathogenesis, and pro-inflammatory cytokines are key factors in these events. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF?) is a central molecule coded by a gene that shows high level of genetic polymorphisms especially in its promoter region. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the TNF? gene have been shown to be associated with an increased risk to develop chronic inflammatory diseases. In order to find out if known TNF? regulatory SNPs (-1031T&gt;C, -857C&gt;T, -863C&gt;A, -308G&gt;A, -238G&gt;A) have a role in the development of the inflammatory reactions in acne vulgaris, we analyzed our genomic collection in a retrospective case-control study using the PCR-RFLP method, and we compared the resulting genotype and allele frequencies. There were no significant differences in the observed genotype or allele frequencies between the control and acne group in case of the -1031, -863, -238 SNPs; however, the TNF? -857 minor T allele was found to act as a protective factor in our study population in acne, and a higher occurrence of the minor -308 A allele in female acne patients was also noted. Genetic variants of the TNF? gene may affect the risk of acne vulgaris. Our results can help to elucidate the molecular events leading to acne development. 	Arch._Dermatol._Res.	D016428 D013485
15482202	20041016	Nevirapine in the treatment of HIV.	Nevirapine (Viramune, Boehringer Ingelheim Ltd) is the first marketed non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. As with any antiretroviral drug, nevirapine should always be used as part of a fully suppressive regimen. Clinical studies have shown that nevirapine-containing regimens may accomplish durable virological and immunological responses in approximately half of all antiretroviral-naive patients. It can also be successfully used as a component of salvage therapies and as a part of a strategy to simplify protease inhibitor-containing regimens. Nevirapine has a beneficial effect on the lipid profile in both treatment-naive and -experienced patients. Nevirapine also has an important role in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV. It is usually well-tolerated with rash and liver toxicity being the most frequently reported adverse events. Nevirapine interacts with cytochrome P450 enzymes both as a substrate and as an inducer. For this reason, therapeutic drug monitoring should be recommended whenever nevirapine is used with protease inhibitors, methadone (Methadose, Rosemont Pharmaceuticals Ltd), oral contraceptives, rifampicin (Rifadin, Aventis Pharma) and other potentially interacting drugs. Nevirapine-resistant mutations are common to the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor family and they include K103N, V106A, Y181C, Y188C and G190A. A better understanding of the nevirapine profile will certainly contribute to ensuring that its clinical application becomes more effective and beneficial.

25719249	20150227	Low expression of long noncoding RNA PANDAR predicts a poor prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer and affects cell apoptosis by regulating Bcl-2.	Recently, a novel class of transcripts, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), is involved in diseases including cancer. Here, we investigated the the role of lncRNA PANDAR in the progression of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). PANDAR, interacting with NF-YA, was generally downregulated in NSCLC tissues. In a cohort of 140 NSCLC patients, decreased PANDAR expression was negatively correlated with greater tumor size (P&lt;0.001) and advanced TNM stage (P=0.002). Moreover, PANDAR could serve as an independent predictor for overall survival in NSCLC (P=0.015). Further experiments demonstrated that PANDAR expression was induced by p53, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirmed that PANDAR was a direct transcriptional target of p53 in NSCLC cells. PANDAR overexpression significantly repressed the proliferation in vitro and in vivo. We also showed that PANDAR-mediated growth regulation is in part due to the transcriptional modulation of Bcl-2 by interacting with NF-YA, thus affecting NSCLC cell apoptosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report which showed the role of PANDAR in the progression of NSCLC. The p53/PANDAR/NF-YA/Bcl-2 interaction might serve as targets for NSCLC diagnosis and therapy.

22750793	20120704	Exploring optimization parameters to increase ssDNA recombineering in Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus reuteri.	Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) recombineering is a technology which is used to make subtle changes in the chromosome of several bacterial genera. Cells which express a single-stranded DNA binding protein (RecT or Bet) are transformed with an oligonucleotide which is incorporated via an annealing and replication-dependent mechanism. By in silico analysis we identified ssDNA binding protein homologs in the genus Lactobacillus and Lactococcus lactis. To assess whether we could further improve the recombineering efficiency in Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 we expressed several RecT homologs in this strain. RecT derived from Enterococcus faecalis CRMEN 19 yielded comparable efficiencies compared with a native RecT protein, but none of the other proteins further increased the recombineering efficiency. We successfully improved recombineering efficiency 10-fold in L. lactis by increasing oligonucleotide concentration combined with the use of oligonucleotides containing phosphorothioate-linkages (PTOs). Surprisingly, neither increased oligonucleotide concentration nor PTO linkages enhanced recombineering in L. reuteri 6475. To emphasize the utility of this technology in improving probiotic features we modified six bases in a transcriptional regulatory element region of the pdu-operon of L. reuteri 6475, yielding a 3-fold increase in the production of the antimicrobial compound reuterin. Directed genetic modification of lactic acid bacteria through ssDNA recombineering will simplify strain improvement in a way that, when mutating a single base, is genetically indistinguishable from strains obtained through directed evolution.

23555974	20130405	Genetic variants from lipid-related pathways and risk for incident myocardial infarction.	Circulating lipids levels, as well as several familial lipid metabolism disorders, are strongly associated with initiation and progression of atherosclerosis and incidence of myocardial infarction (MI). We hypothesized that genetic variants associated with circulating lipid levels would also be associated with MI incidence, and have tested this in three independent samples. Using age- and sex-adjusted additive genetic models, we analyzed 554 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 41 candidate gene regions proposed to be involved in lipid-related pathways potentially predisposing to incidence of MI in 2,602 participants of the Swedish Twin Register (STR; 57% women). All associations with nominal P&lt;0.01 were further investigated in the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM; N = 1,142). In the present study, we report associations of lipid-related SNPs with incident MI in two community-based longitudinal studies with in silico replication in a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies. Overall, there were 9 SNPs in STR with nominal P-value &lt;0.01 that were successfully genotyped in ULSAM. rs4149313 located in ABCA1 was associated with MI incidence in both longitudinal study samples with nominal significance (hazard ratio, 1.36 and 1.40; P-value, 0.004 and 0.015 in STR and ULSAM, respectively). In silico replication supported the association of rs4149313 with coronary artery disease in an independent meta-analysis including 173,975 individuals of European descent from the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium (odds ratio, 1.03; P-value, 0.048). rs4149313 is one of the few amino acid changing variants in ABCA1 known to associate with reduced cholesterol efflux. Our results are suggestive of a weak association between this variant and the development of atherosclerosis and MI. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061 D013485
25919378	20150429	Incorporation of Peptides Targeting EGFR and FGFR1 into the Adenoviral Fiber Knob Domain and Their Evaluation as Targeted Cancer Therapies.	Oncolytic virotherapies based on adenovirus 5 (Ad5) hold promise as adjunctive cancer therapies; however, their efficacy when delivered systemically is hampered by poor target cell specificity and preexisting anti-Ad5 immunity. Ovarian cancer represents a promising target for virotherapy, since the virus can be delivered locally into the peritoneal cavity. Both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) are overexpressed in the majority of human tumors, including ovarian cancer. To generate adenoviral vectors with improved tumor specificity, we generated a panel of Ad5 vectors with altered tropism for EGFR and FGFR, rather than the natural Ad5 receptor, hCAR. We have included mutations within AB loop of the viral fiber knob (KO1 mutation) to preclude interaction with hCAR, combined with insertions in the HI loop to incorporate peptides that bind either EGFR (peptide YHWYGYTPQNVI, GE11) or FGFR1 (peptides MQLPLAT, M*, and LSPPRYP, LS). Viruses were produced to high titers, and the integrity of the fiber protein was validated by Western blotting. The KO1 mutation efficiently ablated hCAR interactions, and significantly increased transduction was observed in hCAR(low)/EGFR(high) cell lines using Ad5.GE11, while transduction levels using Ad5.M* or Ad5.LS were not increased. In the presence of physiological concentrations of human blood clotting factor X (hFX), significantly increased levels of transduction via the hFX-mediated pathway were observed in cell lines, but not in primary tumor cells derived from epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) ascites samples. Ad5-mediated transduction of EOC cells was completely abolished by the presence of 2.5% serum from patients, while, surprisingly, incorporation of the GE11 peptide resulted in significant evasion of neutralization in the same samples. We thus speculate that incorporation of the YHWYGYTPQNVI dodecapeptide within the fiber knob domain may provide a novel means of circumventing preexisting Ad5 immunity that warrants further investigation.

9720818	19980828	Enzymatic activity of soluble phospholipase A2 does not affect the specific IgE, IgG4 and cytokine responses in bee sting allergy.	The soluble bee venom phospholipase A2 (PLA) represents the major allergen/antigen for allergic and hyperimmune individuals following bee sting. A number of studies implicate enzymes, and PLA in particular, as potent allergens. We have studied specific activation of T cells by enzymatically active and inactive mutants of PLA, and secretion of cytokines regulating IgE and IgG4 antibody formation. Recombinant (r) wild type PLA (rPLA-WT) and an enzymatically inactive rPLA (rPLA-H34Q) were produced in Escherichia coli. Eleven bee venom allergic patients and three hyperimmune, healthy individuals were included in the study. After specific stimulation of PBMC with the rPLA variants, proliferative response, IFNgamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 production, as well as total and PLA-specific IgE and IgG4 production, were analysed. Similar levels of specific B cell recognition, proliferative and cytokine responses were observed after stimulation with either enzymatically active or inactive rPLA. In addition, equal amounts of antigen-specific and total IgE and IgG4 antibodies were produced by stimulation with both forms of rPLA. The enzymatic activity of PLA does not influence the specific activation and cytokine production by T cells from bee venom-sensitized or hyperimmune individuals, or the IgE/IgG4 antibodies synthesis by B cells in vitro.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the most common human enzymopathy. To date more than 122 mutations in the G6PD gene have been discovered, among which 12 point mutations are found in the Chinese. The 2 most common mutations, G1388A and G1376T, account for more than 50% of mutations representing various regions and ethnic groups in China. Setting up a simple and accurate method for detecting these mutations is not only useful for studying the frequency of the G6PD genotypes, but also for finding new mutations. The purpose of this study was to find a simple, inexpensive and accurate method for detecting these common mutations. The amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) method was used in this study. Samples from 28 G6PD-deficient males were investigated. The natural and mismatched amplification and restriction enzyme digestion method was used as a standard method to evaluate the nature of the point mutations. Sixteen cases were found carrying the G1388A mutation and 12 the G1376T mutation. Fourteen cases of G1388A and 10 cases of G1376T were confirmed by ARMS. Four cases were not in concordance with the results obtained by the mismatched amplification-restriction enzyme digestion. These 4 cases were then judged by direct PCR sequencing at exon 12. The DNA sequencing data supported the results obtained by ARMS. Thus we concluded that the ARMS is a rapid, simple, inexpensive and accurate method for detecting the most common G6PD gene mutations among the Chinese. 	Hum._Hered.	D016428 D013485
20706531	20100814	Proteomic analysis of Pichind? virus infection identifies differential expression of prothymosin-alpha.	The arenaviruses include a number of important pathogens including Lassa virus and Junin virus. Presently, the only treatment is supportive care and the antiviral Ribavirin. In the event of an epidemic, patient triage may be required to more effectively manage resources; the development of prognostic biomarker signatures, correlating with disease severity, would allow rational triage. Using a pair of arenaviruses, which cause mild or severe disease, we analyzed extracts from infected cells using SELDI mass spectrometry to characterize potential biomarker profiles. EDGE analysis was used to analyze longitudinal expression differences. Extracts from infected guinea pigs revealed protein peaks which could discriminate between mild or severe infection, and between times post-infection. Tandem mass-spectrometry identified several peaks, including the transcriptional regulator prothymosin-alpha. Further investigation revealed differences in secretion of this peptide. These data show proof of concept that proteomic profiling of host markers could be used as prognostic markers of infectious disease. 	J._Biomed._Biotechnol.	D016428 D052061 D013486
24606430	20140311	Single nucleotide polymorphisms of DNA base-excision repair genes (APE1, OGG1 and XRCC1) associated with breast cancer risk in a Chinese population.	Altered DNA repair capacity can result in increased susceptibility to cancer. The base excision repair (BER) pathway effectively removes DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation and reactive oxidative species (ROS). In the current study, we analyzed the possible relation of polymorphisms in BER genes, including 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), and X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 protein (XRCC1), with breast cancer risk in Chinese Han women. This case-control study examined 194 patients with breast cancer and 245 cancer-free hospitalized control subjects. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of OGG1 (Ser326Cys), XRCC1 (Arg399Gln), and APE1 (Asp148Glu and -141T/G) were genotyped and analyzed for their association with breast cancer risk using multivariate logistic regression models. We found that XRCC1 Arg399Gln was significantly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Similarly, the XRCC1 Gln allele was significantly associated with an elevated risk in postmenopausal women and women with a high BMI (? 24 kg/m2). The OGG1 Cys allele provided a significant protective effect against developing cancer in women with a low BMI (&lt; 24 kg/m2). When analyzing the combined effects of these alleles on the risk of breast cancer, we found that individuals with ? 2 adverse genotypes (XRCC1 399Gln, APE1 148Asp, and OGG1 326Ser) were at a 2.18-fold increased risk of breast cancer (P = 0.027). In conclusion, our data indicate that Chinese women with the 399Gln allele of XRCC1 have an increased risk of breast cancer, and the combined effects of polymorphisms of BER genes may contribute to tumorigenesis.

23335386	20130122	Spliceosome mutations involving SRSF2, SF3B1, and U2AF35 in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: prevalence, clinical correlates, and prognostic relevance.	SRSF2, SF3B1, and U2AF35 (U2AF1) are the three most frequent genes involved with spliceosome mutations in myeloid malignancies. SF3B1 mutations are most frequent (~80%) in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ring sideroblasts (RS) but lack prognostic relevance. SRSF2 mutations are associated with shortened overall (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) in both MDS and myelofibrosis. In this study of 226 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), mutational frequencies were 40% for SRSF2 (all affecting P95), 6% for SF3B1 (primarily K700E) and 9% for U2AF35 (mostly S34F and Q157P/R). These mutations were mutually exclusive and 54% of the patients displayed at least one mutation. The three mutation groups were phenotypically similar, with the exception of higher RS% (P &lt; 0.0001) in patients with SF3B1 mutations. At a median follow-up of 15 months, 176 (78%) deaths and 32 (14%) leukemic transformations were documented. OS (median survivals of 17, 16, 17, and 20 months; P = 0.48) and LFS (leukemic transformation rates of 17, 13, 15, and 5%; P = 0.63) were similar among patients with none of the three mutations, SRSF2, SF3B1, or U2AF35 mutations, respectively. We conclude that SRSF2 is the most frequently mutated spliceosome gene in CMML but neither it nor SF3B1 or U2AF35 mutations are prognostically relevant. 	Am._J._Hematol.	D016428
20428242	20100430	Full genome characterisation of bluetongue virus serotype 6 from the Netherlands 2008 and comparison to other field and vaccine strains.	In mid September 2008, clinical signs of bluetongue (particularly coronitis) were observed in cows on three different farms in eastern Netherlands (Luttenberg, Heeten, and Barchem), two of which had been vaccinated with an inactivated BTV-8 vaccine (during May-June 2008). Bluetongue virus (BTV) infection was also detected on a fourth farm (Oldenzaal) in the same area while testing for export. BTV RNA was subsequently identified by real time RT-PCR targeting genome-segment (Seg-) 10, in blood samples from each farm. The virus was isolated from the Heeten sample (IAH &quot;dsRNA virus reference collection&quot; [dsRNA-VRC] isolate number NET2008/05) and typed as BTV-6 by RT-PCR targeting Seg-2. Sequencing confirmed the virus type, showing an identical Seg-2 sequence to that of the South African BTV-6 live-vaccine-strain. Although most of the other genome segments also showed very high levels of identity to the BTV-6 vaccine (99.7 to 100%), Seg-10 showed greatest identity (98.4%) to the BTV-2 vaccine (RSAvvv2/02), indicating that NET2008/05 had acquired a different Seg-10 by reassortment. Although Seg-7 from NET2008/05 was also most closely related to the BTV-6 vaccine (99.7/100% nt/aa identity), the Seg-7 sequence derived from the blood sample of the same animal (NET2008/06) was identical to that of the Netherlands BTV-8 (NET2006/04 and NET2007/01). This indicates that the blood contained two different Seg-7 sequences, one of which (from the BTV-6 vaccine) was selected during virus isolation in cell-culture. The predominance of the BTV-8 Seg-7 in the blood sample suggests that the virus was in the process of reassorting with the northern field strain of BTV-8. Two genome segments of the virus showed significant differences from the BTV-6 vaccine, indicating that they had been acquired by reassortment event with BTV-8, and another unknown parental-strain. However, the route by which BTV-6 and BTV-8 entered northern Europe was not established. 	PLoS_ONE	D003160 D016428 D013485
23685667	20130521	Three-dimensional radiochromic film dosimetry for volumetric modulated arc therapy using a spiral water phantom.	We validated 3D radiochromic film dosimetry for volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) using a newly developed spiral water phantom. The phantom consists of a main body and an insert box, each of which has an acrylic wall thickness of 3 mm and is filled with water. The insert box includes a spiral film box used for dose-distribution measurement, and a film holder for positioning a radiochromic film. The film holder has two parallel walls whose facing inner surfaces are equipped with spiral grooves in a mirrored configuration. The film is inserted into the spiral grooves by its side edges and runs along them to be positioned on a spiral plane. Dose calculation was performed by applying clinical VMAT plans to the spiral water phantom using a commercial Monte Carlo-based treatment-planning system, Monaco, whereas dose was measured by delivering the VMAT beams to the phantom. The calculated dose distributions were resampled on the spiral plane, and the dose distributions recorded on the film were scanned. Comparisons between the calculated and measured dose distributions yielded an average gamma-index pass rate of 87.0% (range, 91.2-84.6%) in nine prostate VMAT plans under 3 mm/3% criteria with a dose-calculation grid size of 2 mm. The pass rates were increased beyond 90% (average, 91.1%; range, 90.1-92.0%) when the dose-calculation grid size was decreased to 1 mm. We have confirmed that 3D radiochromic film dosimetry using the spiral water phantom is a simple and cost-effective approach to VMAT dose verification. 	J._Radiat._Res.	D016428 D013485 D023361
12376974	20021012	Mutation analysis of the BCL10 gene in childhood solid malignancies.	BCL10, a gene involved in apoptosis signaling, has recently been identified at chromosome 1p22. This gene was found to be mutated in several types of lymphomas and other kinds of solid tumors. Especially in hepatocellular carcinoma, high mutation rates have been reported. These findings suggest that its inactivation may play an important pathogenetic role in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, abnormalities of chromosome 1 where the BCL10 gene is located are a common feature in pediatric solid tumors. Therefore, we analyzed 95 pediatric solid cancers for genomic BCL10 mutations. Three exons, which encode the whole coding region, were examined in 95 tumor tissues by PCR-SSCP method. Samples revealing aberrant band patterns were subjected to direct sequencing analysis. A total of six nucleotide changes were detected. Two were in intron 1 (IVS1 + 11C &gt; G, IVS1 + 58G &gt; C) and four were in exons 1 or 3 (Ala5Ser, Leu8Leu, Thr162Met and Gly213Glu). Of four exonic changes, three at codons 5, 162, and 213 resulted in amino acid substitution. In non-tumor tissues, however, similar mutation types were found, suggesting that all nucleotide changes detected were genetic polymorphisms. This study represents the first genetic analysis of the BCL10 gene in pediatric solid malignant tumors. Our results suggest that BCL10 mutation as a mechanism involved in tumorigenesis is unlikely to be associated with most childhood malignancies. 	Med._Pediatr._Oncol.	D016428
21845034	20110817	Duloxetine in the management of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain.	Diabetic neuropathy affects up to 70% of diabetics, and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) is the most common and debilitating of the diabetic neuropathies. DPNP significantly reduces quality of life and increases management costs in affected patients. Despite the impact of DPNP, management is poor with one-quarter of patients receiving no treatment and many treated with medications having little or no efficacy in managing DPNP. Duloxetine is one of two drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for DPNP management. Duloxetine is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) proven safe, effective, and cost-saving in reducing DPNP symptoms at a dose of 60 mg/day. Duloxetine doses greater than 60 mg/day for DPNP management are not recommended since they are no more efficacious and associated with more side effects; addition of pregabalin or gabapentin for these patients may be beneficial. Side effects of duloxetine are generally mild and typical for the SNRI class including nausea, dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, sweating, dry mouth, constipation, and diarrhea. Given its other indications, duloxetine is a particularly good choice for DPNP treatment in patients with coexisting depression, anxiety, fibromyalgia, or chronic musculoskeletal pain. Duloxetine treatment had no clinically significant effect on glycemic control and did not increase the risk of cardiovascular events in diabetes patients. However, duloxetine use should be avoided in patients with hepatic disease or severe renal impairment. Given its safety, efficacy, and tolerability, duloxetine is an excellent choice for DPNP treatment in many patients. 	Patient_Prefer_Adherence	D016428
8718887	19960820	Mutational analysis of the catalytic subunit of the yeast vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase.	In order to generate a set of tools for probing structure-function relationships in the catalytic subunit of the yeast vacuolar H(+)-ATPase, the gene encoding this subunit (VMA1) was randomly mutagenized. Mutant plasmids unable to complement the growth defects of yeast cells lacking an intact VMA1 gene were isolated and sequenced. Eight different mutant alleles of VMA1 were examined for levels of the catalytic subunit and other subunits of the enzyme, assembly of the ATPase complex, targeting to the vacuolar membrane, and concanamycin A-sensitive ATPase activity. The mutations S811P and E740D resulted in mutant enzymes that assembled fully but were incapable of ATP hydrolysis, and the mutation E785G generated a similar but somewhat less severe phenotype (17% of the ATPase activity of wild-type vacuoles). When MgATP-dependent stripping of the peripheral subunits by 100 mM KNO3 was examined in these three mutants, only the E785G mutant exhibited significant stripping, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis, even at relatively low levels, generates a conformation susceptible to dissociation. Plasmids containing the mutations E751G and F752S partially complemented the growth defects and resulted in partial defects in ATPase activity that appear to reflect reduced catalytic efficiency. Partial defects in growth and ATPase activity were also seen in the Y797H mutant, but this mutation caused an assembly defect manifested as a preferential loss of two of the peripheral subunits of the enzyme. The phenotypes of these mutants are interpreted in the context of homologies with other V-type and F-type ATPases. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013486 D013487
23239635	20121215	Delayed onset congenital hypothyroidism in a patient with DUOX2 mutations and maternal iodine excess.	Congenital hypothyroidism (CH), one of the most common congenital endocrine disorders, causes irreversible intellectual disability in untreated patients. Today, the vast majority of patients receive early diagnosis and treatment in the context of newborn screening for CH, and achieve satisfactory cognitive development. However, a subset of patients with delayed onset are undetectable by newborn screening, and miss benefit from early intervention. Here, we report on a delayed-onset CH patient that had two contributing factors in the pathogenesis of CH simultaneously, i.e., a genetic defect and iodine excess. The patient was exposed to excessive iodine in utero because her mother consumed massive amounts of seaweed during pregnancy. Surprisingly, the patient had a negative result in newborn screening, but developed overt CH at age 3 months. She received thyroxine supplementation until when normalization of the thyroid function was confirmed at age 3 years (i.e., transient CH). Mutation screening for DUOX2, a causative gene for transient CH, showed biallelic mutations (p.[E327X]?+?[H678R]). This report provides a new example of environmental modification of phenotypes of CH due to a genetic defect, which can potentially distort screening results.

11222766	20010227	In vitro roles of invariant helix-turn-helix motif residue R383 in sigma(54) (sigma(N)).	In vitro DNA-binding and transcription properties of sigma(54) proteins with the invariant Arg383 in the putative helix-turn-helix motif of the DNA-binding domain substituted by lysine or alanine are described. We show that R383 contributes to maintaining stable holoenzyme-promoter complexes in which limited DNA opening downstream of the -12 GC element has occurred. Unlike wild-type sigma(54), holoenzymes assembled with the R383A or R383K mutants could not form activator-independent, heparin-stable complexes on heteroduplex Sinorhizobium meliloti nifH DNA mismatched next to the GC. Using longer sequences of heteroduplex DNA, heparin-stable complexes formed with the R383K and, to a lesser extent, R383A mutant holoenzymes, but only when the activator and a hydrolysable nucleotide was added and the DNA was opened to include the -1 site. Although R383 appears inessential for polymerase isomerisation, it makes a significant contribution to maintaining the holoenzyme in a stable complex when melting is initiating next to the GC element. Strikingly, Cys383-tethered FeBABE footprinting of promoter DNA strongly suggests that R383 is not proximal to promoter DNA in the closed complex. This indicates that R383 is not part of the regulatory centre in the sigma(54) holoenzyme, which includes the -12 promoter region elements. R383 contributes to several properties, including core RNA polymerase binding and to the in vivo stability of sigma(54). 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D013485
24878635	20140601	Evidence of the innate antiviral and neuroprotective properties of progranulin.	Compelling data exist that show that normal levels of progranulin (PGRN) are required for successful CNS aging. PGRN production is also modulated by inflammation and infection, but no data are available on the production and role of PGRN during CNS HIV infection. To determine the relationships between PGRN and HIV disease, neurocognition, and inflammation, we analyzed 107 matched CSF and plasma samples from CHARTER, a well-characterized HIV cohort. Levels of PGRN were determined by ELISA and compared to levels of several inflammatory mediators (IFN?, IL-6, IL-10, IP-10, MCP-1, TNF?, IL-1?, IL-4 and IL-13), as well as clinical, virologic and demographic parameters. The relationship between HIV infection and PGRN was also examined in HIV-infected primary human microglial cultures. In plasma, PGRN levels correlated with the viral load (VL, p&lt;0.001). In the CSF of subjects with undetectable VL, lower PGRN was associated with neurocognitive impairment (p?=?0.046). CSF PGRN correlated with CSF IP-10, TNF? and IL-10, and plasma PGRN correlated with plasma IP-10. In vitro, microglial HIV infection increased PGRN production and PGRN knockdown increased HIV replication, demonstrating that PGRN is an innate antiviral protein. We propose that PGRN plays dual roles in people living with HIV disease. With active HIV replication, PGRN is induced in infected macrophages and microglia and functions as an antiviral protein. In individuals without active viral replication, decreased PGRN production contributes to neurocognitive dysfunction, probably through a diminution of its neurotrophic functions. Our results have implications for the pathogenesis, biomarker studies and therapy for HIV diseases including HIV-associated neurocognitive dysfunction (HAND). 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061
7628611	19950717	Asn-265 of frog kainate binding protein is a functional glycosylation site: implications for the transmembrane topology of glutamate receptors.	Kainate binding proteins (KBPs) from frog and goldfish brain are glycosylated, integral membrane proteins. These KBPs are homologous (35-40%) to the C-terminal half of AMPA and kainate receptors which have been shown to form glutamate-gated ion channels. We report here that the frog KBP has three functional N-glycosylation sites. Of particular interest, Asn-265, a residue located between two putative membrane spanning regions of the frog KBP, is a functional N-glycosylation site. A mutation of Ser-267 to Gly renders this site non-functional as shown using an in vitro translation system and by transient expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells. The mutant receptor protein (S267G), when expressed in HEK cells, binds kainate with high affinity (Kd = 16 nM). These results further support a topology with three transmembrane segments for KBPs and, by sequence homology, for glutamate-gated ion channels. 	FEBS_Lett.	D016428 D013485 D013486
15157074	20040526	Mechanism of the T286A-mutant alphaCaMKII interactions with Ca2+/calmodulin and ATP.	The role of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) in the activation mechanism of alpha-Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (alphaCaMKII) was investigated using the T286A non-autophosphorylatable mutant of alphaCaMKII. Characterization of the T286A-alphaCaMKII mutant revealed k(cat) = 0.06 +/- 0.02 s(-1) for the T286A mutant, a 6 (+/- 2)-fold lower value compared to wild-type alphaCaMKII with 100 microM smooth muscle myosin light chain (MLC) as substrate. MLC phosphorylation by the T286A mutant and wild-type alphaCaMKII was cooperative, with Hill coefficients 2.3 +/- 0.1 and 2.4 +/- 0.3, respectively. K(m) values for MLC were 96 +/- 28 microM with T286A-alphaCaMKII and 49 +/- 29 microM for wild-type alphaCaMKII. Thus, while the activity of alphaCaMKII was sensitive to mutation of the Thr(286) residue to Ala, the mechanisms of the wild-type and T286A mutant enzyme appeared similar. K(d) for Ca(2+)/calmodulin was 2-fold reduced to 40 nM compared to that of wild-type alphaCaMKII (75 nM). ATP induced a 9-fold stabilization of Ca(2+)/calmodulin binding to the T286A mutant enzyme. Fluorescence stopped-flow kinetic experiments revealed that two Ca(2+)/calmodulin-enzyme complexes were formed, the first, unaffected by ATP, with association and dissociation rate constants of 2 x 10(7) M(-1) s(-1) and 5 s(-1), respectively, containing calmodulin in extended conformation. The second complex, in which calmodulin adopted a compact conformation, was formed with association rate constant 3 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1) and dissociation at 0.15 s(-1) in the absence and 0.015 s(-1) in the presence of ATP. These data show that ATP is involved in the activation mechanism by forming two classes of Ca(2+)/calmodulin.alphaCaMKII.ATP complex. It is likely that only one of the complexes is on the activation pathway. 	Biochemistry	D003160 D016428 D013485
24952158	20140622	Role of hydrophobic mutations on the binding affinity and stability of blood coagulation factor VIIIa: a computational molecular dynamics and free-energy analysis.	Factor VIIIa is a non-covalently bound hetero-trimer among A1, A2 and A3-C1-C2 domains and an essential co-factor for factor IXa enzyme during proteolytic activation of factor X zymogen. The relatively weak interactions between A2 and the interface A1/A3 domains dampen the functional stability of FVIIIa in plasma and results in rapid degradation. We studied the mutational effect of three charged residues (Asp519, Glu665 and Asp666) to several hydrophobic residues by molecular dynamics simulations. Analysis of the binding free energy by MM-PBSA and MM-GBSA methods shows that the mutation of Asp519 and Glu665 residues to either Val or Ala enhance the A2 domain binding affinity in agreement with the experimental site-specific mutagenesis data. Mutation of Asp666 to Val, Tyr, Met and Phe showed largest improvement in the A2-domain binding among the eight hydrophobic mutants studied. Our studies suggest that the enrichment of hydrophobic interactions in the buried surface regions of A2 domain plays crucial role in improving the overall stability of FVIIIa.

17452352	20070425	Differential regulation of repeated histone genes during the fission yeast cell cycle.	The histone genes are highly reiterated in a wide range of eukaryotic genomes. The fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, has three pairs of histone H3-H4 genes: hht1+-hhf1+, hht2+-hhf2+ and hht3+-hhf3+. While the deduced amino acid sequences are identical, it remains unknown whether transcriptional regulation differs among the three pairs. Here, we report the transcriptional properties of each H3-H4 gene pair during the cell cycle. The levels of transcripts of hht1+-hhf1+ and hht3+-hhf3+ pairs and hhf2+ are increased at S-phase, while that of hht2+ remains constant throughout the cell cycle. We showed that the GATA-type transcription factor, Ams2, binds to the promoter regions of core histone genes in an AACCCT-box-dependent manner and is required for activation of S-phase-specific transcription. Furthermore, we found that Ams2-depletion stimulates feedback regulation of histone transcripts, mainly up-regulating the basal levels of hht2+-hhf2+ transcription, which are normally down-regulated by Hip1 and Slm9, homologs of the human histone chaperone, HIRA. These observations provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of differential regulation of transcripts from repeated histone genes in the fission yeast. 	Nucleic_Acids_Res.	D016428 D013485
27338450	20160625	Lambda gpP-DnaB Helicase Sequestration and gpP-RpoB Associated Effects: On Screens for Auxotrophs, Selection for Rif(R), Toxicity, Mutagenicity, Plasmid Curing.	The bacteriophage lambda replication initiation protein P exhibits a toxic effect on its Escherichia coli (E. coli) host, likely due to the formation of a dead-end P-DnaB complex, sequestering the replicative DnaB helicase from further activity. Intracellular expression of P triggers SOS-independent cellular filamentation and rapidly cures resident ColE1 plasmids. The toxicity of P is suppressed by alleles of P or dnaB. We asked whether P buildup within a cell can influence E. coli replication fidelity. The influence of P expression from a defective prophage, or when cloned and expressed from a plasmid was examined by screening for auxotrophic mutants, or by selection for rifampicin resistant (Rif(R)) cells acquiring mutations within the rpoB gene encoding the ?-subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP), nine of which proved unique. Using fluctuation assays, we show that the intracellular expression of P evokes a mutator effect. Most of the Rif(R) mutants remained P(S) and localized to the Rif binding pocket in RNAP, but a subset acquired a P(R) phenotype, lost sensitivity to ColE1 plasmid curing, and localized outside of the pocket. One P(R) mutation was identical to rpo*Q148P, which alleviates the UV-sensitivity of ruv strains defective in the migration and resolution of Holliday junctions and destabilizes stalled RNAP elongation complexes. The results suggest that P-DnaB sequestration is mutagenic and supports an earlier observation that P can interact with RNAP. 	Viruses	D016428 D013485
15013897	20040312	Lattice corneal dystrophy type I without typical lattice lines: role of mutational analysis.	To describe a Japanese patient with lattice corneal dystrophy type I (LCD I) who lacked the typical lattice lines. Interventional case report. A complete ophthalmologic examination was performed on a 54-year-old woman, and the TGFBI gene was analyzed by direct genomic sequencing. The patient had diffuse opacification of the central corneal stroma but without lattice lines and corneal epithelial erosions bilaterally. Molecular genetic analysis identified a lattice corneal dystrophy I-associated heterozygous missense alteration (C417T) that changed arginine in codon 124 to cysteine (R124C) in the TGFBI gene. The cornea of the patient appeared to represent late-stage lattice corneal dystrophy I, which suggests the existence of interactions of modifier genes, environmental factors during corneal aging, or both. The molecular genetic analysis of TGFBI can offer rapid, accurate diagnosis of patients with atypical corneal appearance. 	Am._J._Ophthalmol.	D002363 D016428
18423577	20080422	Polymorphisms at the beta2-adrenergic receptor gene influence Alzheimer's disease susceptibility.	Increasing evidence indicates that the beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) may play an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the effect of two polymorphisms in the beta2-AR gene: Gly16Arg and Gln27Glu for the risk of sporadic Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) in 109 patients and 109 healthy controls matched for sex and age in a Han Chinese population. Results revealed that both the 16Gly allele and the 27Glu allele of the beta2-AR gene were associated with an increased risk of LOAD (P=0.009, OR=1.652 and P=0.002, OR=2.846, respectively), and they also showed a highly significant interaction with the Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) epsilon4 allele (OR=4.200 and 9.441, respectively). Examination of the haplotypes identified the Gly16Glu27 haplotype to increase the risk of LOAD (P=0.004). Our results suggest that variations in the beta2-AR gene play an important role in the pathogenesis of sporadic LOAD, and interact with the epsilon4 allele to markedly increase the LOAD risk.

To study the association between the polymorphisms Arg462Gln and Asp541Glu from the RNASEL gene (1q25), and the polymorphisms rs620861, rs1447295, rs6983267, rs7837328 from the chromosome 8q24 with the risk of presenting prostate cancer (PCa) and its clinical characteristics in a Hispanic (Chilean) population. The study was performed on 21 control patients and 83 patients diagnosed with PCa. Polymorphisms were analysed from blood samples through real-time PCR by using TaqMan probes, and the genetic analysis was performed with the SNPStats program. Also, a comparison was performed between clinical characteristics of PCa and the presence of the different polymorphism genotypes by using the Minitab software. There was a significant association between the genotype G/G from the polymorphism rs6983267 with an overall increased risk of PCa, in patients both with or without family history of PCa (OR = 4.47, 95% CI = 1.05-18.94, P = 0.034 and OR = 3.57, 95% CI = 0.96-13.35, P = 0.037, respectively). Regarding clinical parameters, patients carrying the genotype C/C from the polymorphism Asp541Glu had significantly higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels than patients carrying the other genotypes (P = 0.034). Moreover, patients with the genotype G/G of rs6983267 had higher PSA levels (P = 0.024). The polymorphism rs6983267 from region 3 of the chromosome 8q24 appears to be a prominent risk factor for PCa and a biomarker for cancer aggressiveness in the group of patients who presented higher levels of PSA at the time of diagnosis.

9232335	19970701	Presence of p53 mutations in primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in non-Asians of Los Angeles, California, a low-risk population for NPC.	Mutatins of the p53 tumor suppressor gene are rare in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients who reside in high-risk areas, such as Southeastern China. Among this high-risk group, a pre-existing infection with the EBV and consumption of Cantonese salted fish are closely associated with NPC. We investigated the prevalence of p53 mutations in 28 primary NPC specimens from white (including Hispanic) and African-American patients in Los Angeles, who are at low risk for NPC. Using PCR-based single-strand conformational polymorphism and direct sequencing, we found four mutations (14%) in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene in four patients. All were C-to-T transition mutations: two were present in exon 5-one at codon 142 [CCT (Pro)--&gt;CTT (Leu)] and another at codon 144 [CAG (Gln)--&gt;TAG (stop codon)]. The other two mutations were identified in exon 8: one at codon 273 [CGT (Arg)--&gt;CAT (His)], a CpG site, and one at codon 271, a silent mutation [GAG (Glu)--&gt;GAA (Glu)]. This is the first report investigating the presence of p53 missense mutations in NPC among a low-risk population. Our data indicate that p53 is also an infrequent event among NPC patients at low risk for the disease. 	Cancer_Epidemiol._Biomarkers_Prev.	D003160 D016428 D013485 D013487
21041050	20101103	Serial MRI changes in a patient with infantile Alexander disease and prolonged survival.	Alexander disease is a major entity of leukodystrophy; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the brain typically show extensive changes in the cerebral white matter with frontal predominance. Heterozygous missense mutations of GFAP are thought to be sufficient for the molecular diagnosis, which has widened the Alexander disease entity beyond the classical one. We report the patient, a 16-year-old Japanese boy, with infantile-onset Alexander disease, showing striking MRI findings; extreme white matter loss of cerebrum through cerebellum, severe atrophy of basal ganglia, cerebellum, brain stem, and cervical spinal cord. Molecular analysis showed a heterozygous mutation R239L (c.730G&gt;T) in GFAP. A relative long disease course, over 15years, with the help of mechanical ventilation revealed the striking MRI progression. 	Brain_Dev.	D002363 D016428 D013485
27497341	20160807	Influence of functional polymorphisms in DNA repair genes of myelodysplastic syndrome.	Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) malignances characterized by peripheral cytopenias and predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia transformation. Several studies show that the MDS pathogenesis is a complex and heterogeneous process that involves multiple steps through a sequence of genetic lesions in the DNA which lead to functional changes in the cell and the emergence and subsequent evolution of pre-malignant clone. Double strand breaks (DSB) lesions are the most severe type of DNA damage in HSCs, which, if not properly repaired, might contribute to the development of chromosomal abnormalities, which in turn may lead to leukemia development. We assessed the mRNA expression levels of ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51, XRCC5, XRCC6 and LIG4 genes in bone marrow samples of 47 MDS patients in order to evaluate the association with functional polymorphisms rs228593, rs4793191, rs9567623, rs1801320, rs3835, rs2267437 and rs1805388, respectively, and try to detect clinical associations. We found that the rs228593, rs2267437 and rs1805388 functional polymorphisms probably alter the level of expression of the ATM, XRCC6 and LIG4 genes, respectively, being important in the maintenance of genomic instability in MDS.

18990254	20081108	Cloning and bioactivity analysis of a CXC ligand in black seabream Acanthopagrus schlegeli: the evolutionary clues of ELR+CXC chemokines.	The ELR+CXC chemokines are multifunctional mediators that are mainly responsible for the recruitment of leucocytes to sites of inflammation and infection. Because of their high sequence identity with mammalian IL-8, fish IL-8-like CXCs have been named as piscine 'IL-8' and included in the ELR+ subgroup, even though there is no reliable functional or evolutionary evidence to support this classification. In this investigation, a homologue of piscine 'IL-8' from black seabream (Acanthopagrus schlegeli), called BS CXC, has been cloned and analyzed. The results revealed that BS CXC has a high gene similarity and tertiary structure similarity with piscine and mammalian CXC chemokines, both ELR-CXC and ELR+CXC, although it has a lower identity with ELR-CXC, compared with ELR+CXC chemokines. Like other piscine IL-8, BS CXC has only an incomplete ELR motif, which is essential for the mammalian ELR+CXC ability to attract granulocytes. Bioactivity assay demonstrated that the BS rCXC produced in E. coli significantly stimulated migration of fish neutrophils and macrophages, but had no effect on rat neutrophils and macrophages, whereas hrIL-8 induced strong chemotaxis of fish neutrophils but did not affect fish macrophages. BS CXC seems show some structural and functional properties of the intermediate between ELR-CXC and ELR+CXC. As an incomplete ELR+CXC chemokine from a modern fish, BS CXC provides some clues on the evolution from ancient ELR-CXC to ELR+CXC by retaining some properties of the intermediate stage in evolution, and it may be more appropriate to call this molecule 'piscine CXC with an incomplete ELR', instead of terming it fish 'IL-8'.

20062088	20100112	Screening and monitoring of MPL W515L mutation with real-time PCR in patients with myelofibrosis undergoing allogeneic-SCT.	Monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) after allogeneic (allo)-SCT for myelofibrosis (MF) allows recognizing the depth of remission and thus guides application of appropriate therapeutic interventions. MPL W515L/K mutations, which are detected in 5-10% of JAK2V617F-negative patients, may be useful for this purpose. Using a highly sensitive quantitative PCR method, we tested 90 patients with MF who underwent allo-SCT for the presence of MPL W515L/K mutations. Two patients with primary MF were found to harbor MPLW515L while no patient was positive for MPLW515K mutation. Both patients were JAK2V617F negative and cleared the mutation rapidly after allo-SCT and remained negative for a median follow-up of 19 months. The results of molecular monitoring correlated well with other remission parameters such as normalization of peripheral blood counts and morphology and complete donor chimerism. We conclude that MPLW515L can be cleared after allo-SCT and hence may be used as an MRD marker in a proportion of JAK2V617F-negative MF patients. 	Bone_Marrow_Transplant.	D016428 D013485
20462947	20100514	Rapid detection of TEM, SHV and CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Enterobacteriaceae using ligation-mediated amplification with microarray analysis.	Fast and adequate detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) is crucial for infection control measures and the choice of antimicrobial therapy. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a novel ESBL assay using ligation-mediated amplification combined with microarray analysis to detect the most prevalent ESBLs in Enterobacteriaceae: TEM, SHV and CTX-M. Analysis of the Lahey database revealed that the vast majority of TEM and SHV ESBLs differ from non-ESBL variants in three amino acid positions. TEM ESBLs have at least one of the following amino acid substitutions: R164S/H/C, G238D/N/S and E104K. In SHV ESBLs, one or more of the following substitutions is observed: D179A/N/G, G238S/A and E240K. Oligonucleotide probes were designed to detect these substitutions, covering 95% of ESBL TEM variants and 77% of ESBL SHV variants. In addition, probes were designed to distinguish between CTX-M groups 1, 2, 9 and 8/25. For evaluation of the assay, 212 Enterobacteriaceae isolates with various beta-lactamases were included (n = 106 ESBL positive). The sensitivity of the microarray was 101/106 (95%; 95% CI 89%-98%), and the specificity 100% (95% CI 97%-100%) using molecular characterization of ESBLs by PCR and sequencing as reference. Assay performance time was 8 h for 36 isolates. This novel commercially available DNA microarray system may offer an attractive option for rapid and accurate detection of CTX-M, TEM and SHV ESBL genes in Enterobacteriaceae in the clinical laboratory.

19565852	20090702	[Establishment and preliminary application of polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers for the single nucleotide polymorphisms of metabolic enzymes].	To develop a simple, accurate, rapid, economic, large-scale detection method for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) metabolic enzymes, using polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers (PCR-CTPP). The primers of CYP1A1 (A4889G), EPHX1 (A416G) and NQO1 (C609T) were designed for PCR-CTPP, and the PCR conditions were optimized. The results of genotyping were verified by DNA sequencing. The above SNPs were detected by the PCR-CTPP detection method in a randomly selected 183 healthy individuals of Han ethnicity. The genotype frequencies were analyzed and compared with people from other ethnicities. The allele-specific bands of CYP1A1 (A4889G), EPHX1 (A416G) and NQO1 (C609T) were successfully amplified by PCR-CTPP under the optimal conditions and the results of genotyping were consistent with DNA sequencing. Among 183 healthy Han individuals, the genotypic distributions of CYP1A1 (A4889G) , EPHX1 (A416G) and NQO1 (C609T) showed that the wild-type, homozygous variants, and heterozygotes were 103 (56.3%), 8 (4.4%), 72 (39.3%) and 142 (77.6%), 4 (2.2%), 37(20.2%), 60(32.8%), 32 (17.5%), 91 (49.7%) respectively. The distributions of genotypes were all in accordance with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P &gt; 0.05), with statistical differences and with other ethnic populations (P &lt; 0.05). The SNPs of metabolic enzymes can be detected by PCR-CTPP method which is simple, accurate, rapid, economic and with large scale. PCR-CTPP can be used for large scale clinical and epidemiological screening. 	Zhonghua_Liu_Xing_Bing_Xue_Za_Zhi	D004740 D016428
23984314	20130829	Celiac disease and autoimmune-associated conditions.	Celiac disease (CD) is frequently accompanied by a variety of extradigestive manifestations, thus making it a systemic disease rather than a disease limited to the gastrointestinal tract. This is primarily explained by the fact that CD belongs to the group of autoimmune diseases. The only one with a known etiology is related to a permanent intolerance to gluten. Remarkable breakthroughs have been achieved in the last decades, due to a greater interest in the diagnosis of atypical and asymptomatic patients, which are more frequent in adults. The known presence of several associated diseases provides guidance in the search of oligosymptomatic cases as well as studies performed in relatives of patients with CD. The causes for the onset and manifestation of associated diseases are diverse; some share a similar genetic base, like type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D); others share pathogenic mechanisms, and yet, others are of unknown nature. General practitioners and other specialists must remember that CD may debut with extraintestinal manifestations, and associated illnesses may appear both at the time of diagnosis and throughout the evolution of the disease. The implementation of a gluten-free diet (GFD) improves the overall clinical course and influences the evolution of the associated diseases. In some cases, such as iron deficiency anemia, the GFD contributes to its disappearance. In other disorders, like T1D, this allows a better control of the disease. In several other complications and/or associated diseases, an adequate adherence to a GFD may slow down their evolution, especially if implemented during an early stage.

18523359	20080605	Interleukin-10 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to brucellosis in Iranian patients.	Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a Th2-type cytokine that inhibits macrophage activation. It is known that production of IL-10 is affected by its gene promoter polymorphisms. To investigate the relationship between IL-10 gene promoter polymorphisms and susceptibility to brucellosis. One hundred and ninety patients with brucellosis and 81 healthy animal husbandmen who owned infected animals and consumed their contaminated dairy products were included in this study. All individuals were genotyped for three bi-allelic IL-10 gene promoter polymorphisms at positions -1082(G/A), -819(T/C), and -592(A/C) using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The distribution of C alleles at positions -592 and -819 of IL-10 were significantly higher in patients than in the healthy animal husbandmen (p=0.034 and p=0.0086, respectively). IL-10 ATA single and double haplotypes were significantly higher in controls, compared to the patients (p= 0.0278 and p=0.013, respectively). According to the results higher frequency of C alleles at positions -592 and -819 of IL-10 in patients may be considered as genetic factors for susceptibility to brucellosis.

1909892	19910924	Secondary structure and side-chain 1H and 13C resonance assignments of calmodulin in solution by heteronuclear multidimensional NMR spectroscopy.	Heteronuclear 2D and 3D NMR experiments were carried out on recombinant Drosophila calmodulin (CaM), a protein of 148 residues and with molecular mass of 16.7 kDa, that is uniformly labeled with 15N and 13C to a level of greater than 95%. Nearly complete 1H and 13C side-chain assignments for all amino acid residues are obtained by using the 3D HCCH-COSY and HCCH-TOCSY experiments that rely on large heteronuclear one-bond scalar couplings to transfer magnetization and establish through-bond connectivities. The secondary structure of this protein in solution has been elucidated by a qualitative interpretation of nuclear Overhauser effects, hydrogen exchange data, and 3JHNH alpha coupling constants. A clear correlation between the 13C alpha chemical shift and secondary structure is found. The secondary structure in the two globular domains of Drosophila CaM in solution is essentially identical with that of the X-ray crystal structure of mammalian CaM [Babu, Y., Bugg, C. E., &amp; Cook, W.J. (1988) J. Mol. Biol. 204, 191-204], which consists of two pairs of a &quot;helix-loop-helix&quot; motif in each globular domain. The existence of a short antiparallel beta-sheet between the two loops in each domain has been confirmed. The eight alpha-helix segments identified from the NMR data are located at Glu-6 to Phe-19, Thr-29 to Ser-38, Glu-45 to Glu-54, Phe-65 to Lys-77, Glu-82 to Asp-93, Ala-102 to Asn-111, Asp-118 to Glu-127, and Tyr-138 to Thr-146. Although the crystal structure has a long &quot;central helix&quot; from Phe-65 to Phe-92 that connects the two globular domains, NMR data indicate that residues Asp-78 to Ser-81 of this central helix adopt a nonhelical conformation with considerable flexibility.

11226626	20010228	Photoinduced transformation of 14-F-bacteriorhodopsin gelatin films based on both wild type and D96N mutant.	Spectral and kinetic transformations were studied in gelatin films made with 14-F wild type (WT) bacteriorhodopsin (BR) and 14-F D96N mutant BR. Unlike the recent study of water suspensions of the same pigments, where a red shifted species at 660 nm was shown to form under the light in 14-F WT only, there are no drastic differences in photoinduced behavior between gelatin films based on 14-F WT and 14-F D96N. It is not observed any photoinduced formation of red shifted species at 660 nm for both types of films as it is observed for corresponding pigments in water suspension. The observed results are explained in a terms of relationship between the rates of two photoinduced processes that occur in suspensions and films of corresponding pigments. Kinetic characteristics of the photoinduced processes for the films with chemical additives suggest that there are no advantages in using 14-F D96N films when compared to films based on 14-F WT.

26841241	20160204	MYO3A Causes Human Dominant Deafness and Interacts with Protocadherin 15-CD2 Isoform.	Hereditary hearing loss (HL) is characterized by both allelic and locus genetic heterogeneity. Both recessive and dominant forms of HL may be caused by different mutations in the same deafness gene. In a family with post-lingual progressive non-syndromic deafness, whole-exome sequencing of genomic DNA from five hearing-impaired relatives revealed a single variant, p.Gly488Glu (rs145970949:G&gt;A) in MYO3A, co-segregating with HL as an autosomal dominant trait. This amino acid change, predicted to be pathogenic, alters a highly conserved residue in the motor domain of MYO3A. The mutation severely alters the ATPase activity and motility of the protein in vitro, and the mutant protein fails to accumulate in the filopodia tips in COS7 cells. However, the mutant MYO3A was able to reach the tips of organotypic inner ear culture hair cell stereocilia, raising the possibility of a local effect on positioning of the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) complex at the stereocilia tips. To address this hypothesis, we investigated the interaction of MYO3A with the cytosolic tail of the integral tip-link protein protocadherin 15 (PCDH15), a core component of MET complex. Interestingly, we uncovered a novel interaction between MYO3A and PCDH15 shedding new light on the function of myosin IIIA at stereocilia tips. 	Hum._Mutat.	D016428 D052061 D013485
19654305	20090806	Proteasome inhibition causes regression of leukemia and abrogates BCR-ABL-induced evasion of apoptosis in part through regulation of forkhead tumor suppressors.	BCR-ABL plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and some cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Although ABL kinase inhibitors have shown great promise in the treatment of CML, the persistence of residual disease and the occurrence of resistance have prompted investigations into the molecular effectors of BCR-ABL. Here, we show that BCR-ABL stimulates the proteasome-dependent degradation of members of the forkhead family of tumor suppressors in vitro, in an in vivo animal model, and in samples from patients with BCR-ABL-positive CML or ALL. As several downstream mediators of BCR-ABL are regulated by the proteasome degradation pathway, we also show that inhibition of this pathway, using bortezomib, causes regression of CML-like disease. Bortezomib treatment led to inhibition of BCR-ABL-induced suppression of FoxO proteins and their proapoptotic targets, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and BIM, thereby providing novel insights into the molecular effects of proteasome inhibitor therapy. We additionally show sensitivity of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL T315I cells to bortezomib. Our data delineate the involvement of FoxO proteins in BCR-ABL-induced evasion of apoptosis and provide evidence that bortezomib is a candidate therapeutic in the treatment of BCR-ABL-induced leukemia.

27706582	20161006	Association between the -174 G/C polymorphism of the interleukin-6 gene and myocardial infarction risk: a meta-analysis.	Numerous studies have evaluated the association between the -174 G/C polymorphism in the interleukin-6 gene (IL6) and myocardial infarction (MI) risk. However, the results from the published studies are inconclusive. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine whether the IL6 -174 G/C polymorphism is associated with MI risk. A meta-analysis based on nine case-control studies was performed to address this issue. No significant associations between IL6 -174 G/C polymorphism and MI risk were observed in any of the genetic models (CC vs GG: OR = 1.18, 95%CI = 0.92-1.52; CG vs GG: OR = 1.09, 95%CI = 0.93-1.27; dominant model: OR = 1.11, 95%CI = 0.94-1.31; recessive model: OR = 1.10, 95%CI = 0.91-1.33). Furthermore, the subgroup analysis by ethnicity did not reveal a significant association between the IL6 -174 G/C polymorphism and susceptibility to MI in Caucasians. In conclusion, the results indicate that the IL6 -174 G/C polymorphism does not contribute to MI risk. 	Genet._Mol._Res.	D016428 D017418
27454313	20160726	Association of miR-146a, miR-149, miR-196a2, and miR-499 Polymorphisms with Ossification of the Posterior Longitudinal Ligament of the Cervical Spine.	Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) of the spine is considered a multifactorial and polygenic disease. We aimed to investigate the association between four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of pre-miRNAs [miR-146aC&gt;G (rs2910164), miR-149T&gt;C (rs2292832), miR-196a2T&gt;C (rs11614913), and miR-499A&gt;G (rs3746444)] and the risk of cervical OPLL in the Korean population. The genotypic frequencies of these four SNPs were analyzed in 207 OPLL patients and 200 controls by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. For four SNPs in pre-miRNAs, no significant differences were found between OPLL patients and controls. However, subgroup analysis based on OPLL subgroup (continuous: continuous type plus mixed type, segmental: segmental and localized type) showed that miR-499GG genotype was associated with an increased risk of segmental type OPLL (adjusted odds ratio = 4.314 with 95% confidence interval: 1.109-16.78). In addition, some allele combinations (C-T-T-G, G-T-T-A, and G-T-C-G of miR-146a/-149/-196a2/-499) and combined genotypes (miR-149TC/miR-196a2TT) were associated with increased OPLL risk, whereas the G-T-T-G and G-C-C-G allele combinations were associated with decreased OPLL risk. The results indicate that GG genotype of miR-499 is associated with significantly higher risks of OPLL in the segmental OPLL group. The miR-146a/-149/-196a2/-499 allele combinations may be a genetic risk factor for cervical OPLL in the Korean population. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428
3637637	19860717	The RNA required in the first step of chlorophyll biosynthesis is a chloroplast glutamate tRNA.	A molecule of chlorophyll is synthesized from eight molecules of delta-aminolevulinate (DALA), the universal precursor of porphyrins. The light-regulated conversion of glutamate to delta-aminolevulinate in the stroma of greening plastids involves the reduction of glutamate to glutamate-1-semialdehyde and its subsequent transamination. The components performing this conversion have been isolated from barley and Chlamydomonas and separated into three fractions by serial affinity chromatography on Blue Sepharose and haem- or chlorophyllin-Sepharose. The complete reaction can be performed in vitro in a reconstituted assay by combining all three fractions. An RNA is the essential component of the chlorophyllin-Sepharose-bound fraction. By nucleotide sequence analysis, we have now identified this RNA as a chloroplast glutamate acceptor RNA. Glutamate attached by an aminoacyl bond to the 3'-terminal adenosine of this RNA is a substrate for the enzyme(s) which perform the subsequent reactions. This reaction represents a novel role for transfer RNA: participation in the metabolic conversion of its cognate amino acid into another metabolite of low relative molecular mass which subsequently is not used in peptide bond synthesis.

27641708	20160920	Mechanosensory neurons control sweet sensing in Drosophila.	Animals discriminate nutritious food from toxic substances using their sense of taste. Since taste perception requires taste receptor cells to come into contact with water-soluble chemicals, it is a form of contact chemosensation. Concurrent with that contact, mechanosensitive cells detect the texture of food and also contribute to the regulation of feeding. Little is known, however, about the extent to which chemosensitive and mechanosensitive circuits interact. Here, we show Drosophila prefers soft food at the expense of sweetness and that this preference requires labellar mechanosensory neurons (MNs) and the mechanosensory channel Nanchung. Activation of these labellar MNs causes GABAergic inhibition of sweet-sensing gustatory receptor neurons, reducing the perceived intensity of a sweet stimulus. These findings expand our understanding of the ways different sensory modalities cooperate to shape animal behaviour. 	Nat_Commun	D016428
25611528	20150123	Comparing graphene growth on Cu(111) versus oxidized Cu(111).	The epitaxial growth of graphene on catalytically active metallic surfaces via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is known to be one of the most reliable routes toward high-quality large-area graphene. This CVD-grown graphene is generally coupled to its metallic support resulting in a modification of its intrinsic properties. Growth on oxides is a promising alternative that might lead to a decoupled graphene layer. Here, we compare graphene on a pure metallic to graphene on an oxidized copper surface in both cases grown by a single step CVD process under similar conditions. Remarkably, the growth on copper oxide, a high-k dielectric material, preserves the intrinsic properties of graphene; it is not doped and a linear dispersion is observed close to the Fermi energy. Density functional theory calculations give additional insight into the reaction processes and help explaining the catalytic activity of the copper oxide surface. 	Nano_Lett.	D016428 D013485
27224245	20160526	Von Willebrand Factor Gene Variants Associate with Herpes simplex Encephalitis.	Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is a rare complication of Herpes simplex virus type-1 infection. It results in severe parenchymal damage in the brain. Although viral latency in neurons is very common in the population, it remains unclear why certain individuals develop HSE. Here we explore potential host genetic variants predisposing to HSE. In order to investigate this we used a rat HSE model comparing the HSE susceptible SHR (Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats) with the asymptomatic infection of BN (Brown Norway). Notably, both strains have HSV-1 spread to the CNS at four days after infection. A genome wide linkage analysis of 29 infected HXB/BXH RILs (recombinant inbred lines-generated from the prior two strains), displayed variable susceptibility to HSE enabling the definition of a significant QTL (quantitative trait locus) named Hse6 towards the end of chromosome 4 (160.89-174Mb) containing the Vwf (von Willebrand factor) gene. This was the only gene in the QTL with both cis-regulation in the brain and included several non-synonymous SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphism). Intriguingly, in human chromosome 12 several SNPs within the intronic region between exon 43 and 44 of the VWF gene were associated with human HSE pathogenesis. In particular, rs917859 is nominally associated with an odds ratio of 1.5 (95% CI 1.11-2.02; p-value = 0.008) after genotyping in 115 HSE cases and 428 controls. Although there are possibly several genetic and environmental factors involved in development of HSE, our study identifies variants of the VWF gene as candidates for susceptibility in experimental and human HSE.

26498286	20151027	Changes in global gene expression of Vibrio parahaemolyticus induced by cold- and heat-stress.	Vibrio (V.) parahaemolyticus causes seafood-borne gastro-intestinal bacterial infections in humans worldwide. It is widely found in marine environments and is isolated frequently from seawater, estuarine waters, sediments and raw or insufficiently cooked seafood. Throughout the food chain, V. parahaemolyticus encounters different temperature conditions that might alter metabolism and pathogenicity of the bacterium. In this study, we performed gene expression profiling of V. parahaemolyticus RIMD 2210633 after exposure to 4, 15, 20, 37 and 42 ?C to describe the cold and heat shock response. Gene expression profiles of V. parahaemolyticus RIMD 2210633 after exposure to 4, 15, 20, 37 and 42 ?C were investigated via microarray. Gene expression values and RT-qPCR experiments were compared by plotting the log2 values. Moreover, volcano plots of microarray data were calculated to visualize the distribution of differentially expressed genes at individual temperatures and to assess hybridization qualities and comparability of data. Finally, enriched terms were searched in annotations as well as functional-related gene categories using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. Analysis of 37 ?C normalised transcriptomics data resulted in differential expression of 19 genes at 20 ?C, 193 genes at 4 ?C, 625 genes at 42 ?C and 638 genes at 15 ?C. Thus, the largest number of significantly expressed genes was observed at 15 and 42 ?C with 13.3 and 13%, respectively. Genes of many functional categories were highly regulated even at lower temperatures. Virulence associated genes (tdh1, tdh2, toxR, toxS, vopC, T6SS-1, T6SS-2) remained mostly unaffected by heat or cold stress. Along with folding and temperature shock depending systems, an overall temperature-dependent regulation of expression could be shown. Particularly the energy metabolism was affected by changed temperatures. Whole-genome gene expression studies of food related pathogens such as V. parahaemolyticus reveal how these pathogens react to stress impacts to predict its behaviour under conditions like storage and transport.

22359518	20120224	The retrohoming of linear group II intron RNAs in Drosophila melanogaster occurs by both DNA ligase 4-dependent and -independent mechanisms.	Mobile group II introns are bacterial retrotransposons that are thought to have invaded early eukaryotes and evolved into introns and retroelements in higher organisms. In bacteria, group II introns typically retrohome via full reverse splicing of an excised intron lariat RNA into a DNA site, where it is reverse transcribed by the intron-encoded protein. Recently, we showed that linear group II intron RNAs, which can result from hydrolytic splicing or debranching of lariat RNAs, can retrohome in eukaryotes by performing only the first step of reverse splicing, ligating their 3' end to the downstream DNA exon. Reverse transcription then yields an intron cDNA, whose free end is linked to the upstream DNA exon by an error-prone process that yields junctions similar to those formed by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Here, by using Drosophila melanogaster NHEJ mutants, we show that linear intron RNA retrohoming occurs by major Lig4-dependent and minor Lig4-independent mechanisms, which appear to be related to classical and alternate NHEJ, respectively. The DNA repair polymerase ? plays a crucial role in both pathways. Surprisingly, however, mutations in Ku70, which functions in capping chromosome ends during NHEJ, have only moderate, possibly indirect effects, suggesting that both Lig4 and the alternate end-joining ligase act in some retrohoming events independently of Ku. Another potential Lig4-independent mechanism, reverse transcriptase template switching from the intron RNA to the upstream exon DNA, occurs in vitro, but gives junctions differing from the majority in vivo. Our results show that group II introns can utilize cellular NHEJ enzymes for retromobility in higher organisms, possibly exploiting mechanisms that contribute to retrotransposition and mitigate DNA damage by resident retrotransposons. Additionally, our results reveal novel activities of group II intron reverse transcriptases, with implications for retrohoming mechanisms and potential biotechnological applications. 	PLoS_Genet.

22775767	20120711	An accurate and reliable real time SNP genotyping assay for?the HLA-G +3142 bp C&gt;G polymorphism.	Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G is a non classical HLA class I antigen with immuno-modulatory functions. The HLA-G gene is characterized by a +3142C&gt;G variant in the 3' untranslated region which is suggested to control protein production and to be associated with pathological conditions. DNAs form 221 randomly selected healthy subjects were genotyped for HLA-G +3142C&gt;G polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) (BaeGI), real-time PCR and sequencing. The 19% of the PCR-RFLP heterozygous samples were genotyped as 3142GG by real-time PCR and sequencing. This disagreement is caused by digestion efficiency in PCR-RFLP. This real-time PCR method will guarantee an accurate genotyping for future research and clinical purposes, where large cohorts should be tested. 	Tissue_Antigens	D016428
23056796	20121012	A Case of Henoch-Sch?nlein Purpura with P369S Mutation in MEFV Gene.	Henoch-Sch?nlein purpura (HSP) is the most common vasculitis of childhood. HSP can affect multiple organs presenting with a characteristic rash in most of the patients. Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is an inherited inflammatory disease common in mediterranean populations. HSP is the most common vasculitis seen in children with FMF. A 16 year old boy was referred with history of abdominal pain lasting for 20 days. He was hospitalized and had appendectomy. Due to the persistence of his abdominal pain after surgery he was admitted to our hospital. His physical examination showed palpable purpuric rashes symmetrically distributed on lower extremities. Abdominal examination revealed periumbilical tenderness. Laboratory tests showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Creactive protein and fibrinogen. Urinalysis revealed microscopic hematuria and severe proteinuria. The fecal occult blood testing was positive. Based on these clinic findings, the patient was diagnosed as HSP with renal, gastrointestinal tract and skin involvement. We performed DNA analysis in our patient because he had diagnosis of vasculitis with severe symptoms and found that he was carrying heterozygote P369S mutation. Our case is noteworthy as it indicates that it may be important not to overlook presence of FMF mutations in patients with a diagnosis of severe vasculitis. 	Iran_J_Pediatr	D016428
26161775	20150711	Identification of Genetic Defects in 33 Probands with Stargardt Disease by WES-Based Bioinformatics Gene Panel Analysis.	Stargardt disease (STGD) is the most common hereditary macular degeneration in juveniles, with loss of central vision occurring in the first or second decade of life. The aim of this study is to identify the genetic defects in 33 probands with Stargardt disease. Clinical data and genomic DNA were collected from 33 probands from unrelated families with STGD. Variants in coding genes were initially screened by whole exome sequencing. Candidate variants were selected from all known genes associated with hereditary retinal dystrophy and then confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Putative pathogenic variants were further validated in available family members and controls. Potential pathogenic mutations were identified in 19 of the 33 probands (57.6%). These mutations were all present in ABCA4, but not in the other four STGD-associated genes or in genes responsible for other retinal dystrophies. Of the 19 probands, ABCA4 mutations were homozygous in one proband and compound heterozygous in 18 probands, involving 28 variants (13 novel and 15 known). Analysis of normal controls and available family members in 12 of the 19 families further support the pathogenicity of these variants. Clinical manifestation of all probands met the diagnostic criteria of STGD. This study provides an overview of a genetic basis for STGD in Chinese patients. Mutations in ABCA4 are the most common cause of STGD in this cohort. Genetic defects in approximately 42.4% of STGD patients await identification in future studies. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
26980710	20160317	FAK and paxillin, two potential targets in pancreatic cancer.	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating cancer in large part due to late diagnosis and a lack of effective screening tests. In spite of recent progress in imaging, surgery and new therapeutic options for pancreatic cancer, the overall five-year survival still remains unacceptably low. Numerous studies have shown that focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is activated in many cancers including PDAC and promotes cancer progression and metastasis. Paxillin, an intracellular adaptor protein that plays a key role in cytoskeletal organization, connects integrins to FAK and plays a key role in assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions. Here, we have reviewed evidence in support of FAK as a potential therapeutic target and summarized related combinatorial therapies. 	Oncotarget	D016428 D016454
22966230	20120912	Molecular Regulation of the Mitochondrial F(1)F(o)-ATPsynthase: Physiological and Pathological Significance of the Inhibitory Factor 1 (IF(1)).	In mammals, the mitochondrial F(1)F(o)-ATPsynthase sets out the energy homeostasis by producing the bulk of cellular ATP. As for every enzyme, the laws of thermodynamics command it; however, it is privileged to have a dedicated molecular regulator that controls its rotation. This is the so-called ATPase Inhibitory Factor 1 (IF(1)) that blocks its reversal to avoid the consumption of cellular ATP when the enzyme acts as an ATP hydrolase. Recent evidence has also demonstrated that IF(1) may control the alignment of the enzyme along the mitochondrial inner membrane, thus increasing the interest for the molecule. We conceived this review to outline the fundamental knowledge of the F(1)F(o)-ATPsynthase and link it to the molecular mechanisms by which IF(1) regulates its way of function, with the ultimate goal to highlight this as an important and possibly unique means to control this indispensable enzyme in both physiological and pathological settings.

14692443	20031225	Two Dutch families with hereditary hyperferritinaemia-cataract syndrome and heterozygosity for an HFE-related haemochromatosis gene mutation.	Hereditary haemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder, leading to progressive iron overload, which is very common among the Caucasian population. In the vast majority of the cases, the hereditary iron overload is caused by mutations in the HFE gene. Most prominently this is the homozygous Cys282Tyr mutation. We report two Dutch families in which both propositi were found to be heterozygous for Cys282Tyr in the work-up of hyperferritinaemia. Frequent phlebotomies had no effect on the ferritin level, but led to microcytic anaemia. Finally, the family history with bilateral cataracts was the clue for the correct diagnosis. Hereditary hyperferritinaemia-cataract syndrome (HHCS) is an autosomal dominant disease characterised by elevated serum ferritin levels and bilateral cataracts in the absence of iron overload. Several point mutations and deletions within the iron-responsive element (IRE) in the 5' noncoding region of the L-ferritin gene have been found in HHCS families. In the first Dutch family a G to C transition at position 32 was found and a G to A mutation at the same location was found in the second Dutch family. In individuals with an isolated hyperferritinaemia (normal transferrin saturation), the presence of early onset (familial) cataract should raise the possibility of HHCS, even when Cys282Tyr heterozygosity is found.

21202061	20110105	The low-temperature phase of morpholinium tetra-fluoro-borate.	The crystal structure of the low-temperature form of the title compound, C(4)H(10)NO(+)?BF(4) (-), was determined at 80?K. Two reversible phase transitions, at 158/158 and 124/126?K (heating/cooling), were detected by differential scanning calorimetry for this compound, and the sequence of phase transitions was subsequently confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments. The asymmetric unit at 80?K consists of three BF(4) (-) tetra-hedral anions and three morpholinium cations (Z' = 3). Hydrogen-bonded morpholinium cations form chains along the [100] direction. The BF(4) (-) anions are connected to these chains by N-H?F hydrogen bonds. In the crystal structure, two different layers perpendicular to the [001] direction can be distinguished, which differ in the geometry of the hydrogen bonds between cationic and anionic species.

10706767	20000308	A rare mutation [IVS-I-130 (G-A)] in a Turkish beta-thalassemia major patient.	Here we describe the identification of the rare beta-thalassemia mutation IVS-I-130 (G-A) for the first time in Turkey. The hematological evaluation of the patient showed classical signs of beta-thalassemia major requiring regular blood transfusions every 30-35 days. DNA analysis was carried out using reverse dot-blot hybridization and restriction endonuclease digestion, as well as genomic sequencing. The patient was found to be heterozygous for the IVS-I-6 (T-C) and IVS-I-130 (G-A) mutations. In order to deduce a possible origin for the IVS-I-130 (G-A) mutation, the sequence polymorphisms in the DNA of the patient and her family were characterized. The method included the analysis of nine polymorphic nucleotides and the hypervariable microsatellite of composite sequence (AT)(x)T(y) 5' to the beta-globin gene by DNA sequencing. The sequence haplotype (HT4) carrying the IVS-I-130 (G-A) mutation is also observed in Algeria. This favors a Northeastern African origin for this allele. The observed results agree well with a recent introduction of this mutation to Turkey from Egypt toward the end of the 19th century. 	Am._J._Hematol.	D002363 D016428 D013485
8207815	19940701	Mutation in the UL97 open reading frame of human cytomegalovirus strains resistant to ganciclovir.	The same point mutation in the human cytomegalovirus UL97 open reading frame was found in three independently isolated ganciclovir-resistant mutants of strain AD169. Point mutations in the DNA polymerase genes of these strains have been previously identified (N.S. Lurain, K.D. Thompson, E.W. Holmes, and G.S. Read, J. Virol. 66:7146-7152, 1992). All three strains are, therefore, double mutants. To determine the contribution of the UL97 mutation to the high ganciclovir resistance of these mutants, the mutation from the ganciclovir-resistant strain D6/3/1 was transferred to the wild-type strain AD169 to produce the recombinant R6HS. The ganciclovir resistance of R6HS is 4-fold lower than that of D6/3/1 but 10-fold higher than that of AD169. R6HS, like AD169, is sensitive to the nucleotide analogs (S)-1-[(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxy) propyl]adenine and (S)-1-[(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxy)propyl]cytosine. Ganciclovir phosphorylation in R6HS-infected cells was at the same reduced level as that found in cells infected with the parental mutant D6/3/1. The same G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 1380 in the UL97 coding sequence is present in both R6HS and D6/3/1. This mutation results in the substitution of isoleucine for methionine at amino acid residue 460. In an alignment of the R6HS UL97 amino acid sequence with the amino acid sequences of a wide range of protein kinase family members, methionine 460 lies within a highly conserved region which may function in nucleotide binding and phosphate transfer.

16174285	20050922	Genetics of diabetic nephropathy in type 2 DM: candidate gene analysis for the pathogenic role of inflammation.	Hypertension, poor glycemic control and albuminuria are well known risk factors for diabetic nephropathy, but these factors do not explain all of the inter-individual variabilities in the rate of progression to kidney failure. Recent evidence showed that genetic predisposition affected the hyperglycemia-induced nephrotoxicity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). We reviewed the present state of knowledge concerning the relationship between genetics and diabetic nephropathy in type 2 DM. However, the results are inconclusive and the genetic determinants of diabetic nephropathy are not fully understood. In addition, genetic background of nephropathy in type 2 DM was thought to be more complex than in type 1 DM. Recent studies suggested that the inflammation would be an essential component of type 2 DM and its complications. We postulated that increased systemic and/or intrarenal inflammation in high glucose milieu is important in the pathogenesis of nephropathy in patients with type 2 DM. To investigate the impact of inflammation on diabetic nephropathy, we studied several polymorphisms in genes encoding inflammatory cytokine and chemokine in patients with type 2 DM. Among them, -511 C/T in interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tandem repeat in IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), -308 G/A in tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were significantly associated with an increased risk of kidney failure. In addition, some of them were remarkably different from those previously reported in the NCBI or literature based on the western population. Our results suggest that inflammation could play a pathogenic role in diabetic nephropathy in type 2 DM. A better understanding of genetic factors predisposing to diabetic nephropathy would not only help to identify diabetic patients at risk, but also be helpful to unveil the pathogenesis of DN.

27304219	20160616	Transcriptome Sequencing and Analysis for Culm Elongation of the World's Largest Bamboo (Dendrocalamus sinicus).	Dendrocalamus sinicus is the world's largest bamboo species with strong woody culms, and known for its fast-growing culms. As an economic bamboo species, it was popularized for multi-functional applications including furniture, construction, and industrial paper pulp. To comprehensively elucidate the molecular processes involved in its culm elongation, Illumina paired-end sequencing was conducted. About 65.08 million high-quality reads were produced, and assembled into 81,744 unigenes with an average length of 723 bp. A total of 64,338 (79%) unigenes were annotated for their functions, of which, 56,587 were annotated in the NCBI non-redundant protein database and 35,262 were annotated in the Swiss-Prot database. Also, 42,508 and 21,009 annotated unigenes were allocated to gene ontology (GO) categories and clusters of orthologous groups (COG), respectively. By searching against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway database (KEGG), 33,920 unigenes were assigned to 128 KEGG pathways. Meanwhile, 8,553 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 81,534 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) were identified, respectively. Additionally, 388 transcripts encoding lignin biosynthesis were detected, among which, 27 transcripts encoding Shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT) specifically expressed in D. sinicus when compared to other bamboo species and rice. The phylogenetic relationship between D. sinicus and other plants was analyzed, suggesting functional diversity of HCT unigenes in D. sinicus. We conjectured that HCT might lead to the high lignin content and giant culm. Given that the leaves are not yet formed and culm is covered with sheaths during culm elongation, the existence of photosynthesis of bamboo culm is usually neglected. Surprisedly, 109 transcripts encoding photosynthesis were identified, including photosystem I and II, cytochrome b6/f complex, photosynthetic electron transport and F-type ATPase, and 24 transcripts were characterized as antenna proteins that regarded as the main tool for capturing light of plants, implying stem photosynthesis plays a key role during culm elongation due to the unavailability of its leaf. By real-time quantitative PCR, the expression level of 6 unigenes was detected. The results showed the expression level of all genes accorded with the transcriptome data, which confirm the reliability of the transcriptome data. As we know, this is the first study underline the D. sinicus transcriptome, which will deepen the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of culm development. The results may help variety improvement and resource utilization of bamboos. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428
20922418	20101006	Sequence analysis of cox1 and nad1 genes in Echinococcus granulosus G3 genotype in camels (Camelus dromedarius) from central Iran.	Nineteen hydatid cyst isolates collected from camels in central Iran were subjected to sequences analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (nad1) genes. A consensus sequence obtained containing 366 nucleotides for cox1 and 471 nucleotides for nad1 genes. Overall, the camel isolates indicated five different sequences in cox1 and nine in nad1 genes. The sequences analysis indicated that 26.3%, 42.1%, and 31.6% of isolates belonging to G1, G3, and G6 genotypes of Echinococcus granulosus, respectively. The isolates with G3 genotype indicated one cox1 sequence having 100% homology with reference G3 sequence (AN: M84663) and two different nad1 sequences, one having 100% homology with reference G3 sequence (AN: AJ237634) and the other with a silent mutation (G to A) in position 279. The presence of G3 genotype (buffalo strain) of E. granulosus as dominant genotype in camels is emphasized. As G3 genotype has formerly been reported in human, the epidemiological role of camels is warranted in future surveys. 	Parasitol._Res.	D016428 D013485
22534548	20120427	An association between EGF and EGFR gene polymorphisms with gastric cancer in a Chinese Han population.	The epidermal growth factor and its receptor play an important role in the development of gastric cancer. We investigate the potential association between epidermal growth factor and its receptor gene polymorphisms with gastric cancer in a Chinese Han population. Polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism strategies were used to genotype EGF +61 G/A and EGFR+2073 A/T in 207 gastric cancer cases and 318 healthy controls. The A allele of EGF +61 G/A was less frequently in gastric cancer patients than in controls(OR=0.73, 95%CI=0.55-0.95, p=0.02). The A allele frequency was also associated with deeper tumor invasion(OR=1.74, 95%CI=1.05-2.89, p=0.03), increased lymph node metastasis (OR=1.74, 95%CI=1.08-2.82, p=0.02)and shorter survival time (95%CI=9.27-16.72, p=0.038).A T allele frequency in the EGFR +2073 A/T polymorphism was associated with increased lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer (OR=1.62, 95%CI=1.06-2.47,p=0.03). Our results suggest that the A allele of EGF +61 G/A polymorphism decreases the risk of gastric cancer. However, the presence of either the A allele of EGF +61 G/A or the EGFR +2073 T allele indicated a poor prognosis for gastric cancer patients. 	Hepatogastroenterology	D016428 D013485
11420310	20010623	Novel mechanism for Brugada syndrome: defective surface localization of an SCN5A mutant (R1432G).	The SCN5A gene encodes the alpha subunit of the human heart sodium channel (hH1), which plays a critical role in cardiac excitability. Mutations of SCN5A underlie Brugada syndrome, an inherited disorder that leads to ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. This study describes changes in cellular localization and functional expression of hH1 in a naturally occurring SCN5A mutation (R1432G) reported for Brugada syndrome. Using patch-clamp experiments, we show that there is an abolition of functional hH1 expression in R1432G mutants expressed in human tsA201 cells but not in Xenopus oocytes. In tsA201 cells, a conservative positively charged mutant, R1432K, produced sodium currents with normal gating properties, whereas other mutations at this site abolished functional sodium channel expression. Immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy showed that the wild-type alpha subunit expressed in tsA201 cells was localized to the cell surface, whereas the R1432G mutant was colocalized with calnexin within the endoplasmic reticulum. The beta(1) subunit was also localized to the cell surface in the presence of the alpha subunit; however, in its absence, the beta(1) subunit was restricted to a perinuclear localization. These results demonstrate that the disruption of SCN5A cell-surface localization is one mechanism that can account for the loss of functional sodium channels in Brugada syndrome.

17925002	20071011	Association of MTRR 66A&gt;G polymorphism with superoxide dismutase and disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease.	The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of nutritional (folate, vitamin B12) and genetic (MTHFR, MTR, MTRR, TCN) determinants of homocysteine metabolism and of superoxide dismutase with Crohn's disease (CD). One hundred forty patients with CD were compared with 248 matched healthy controls. Plasma homocysteine levels were higher in CD patients than controls (11.8 vs 10.4 micromol/L, P= 0.0004). Vitamin B12 and folate levels were lower in CD subjects compared to controls (207 vs 255 pmol/L, P= 0.0082, and 8.6 vs 11 nmol/L, P= 0036, respectively). Patients with a personal history of ileal resection, ileitis, or colectomy had significantly lower vitamin B12 levels. In multivariate analysis, vitamin B12 and MTHFR 677 TT carriers were the two significant independent factors of plasma homocysteine &gt;15 micromol/L in CD patients (P= 0.0187 and 0.0048, respectively). The significant association between homocysteine and vitamin B12 levels remained significant only in patients with the highest superoxide dismutase values (P &lt; 0.0001). The MTRR AA genotype was a significant independent predictor of CD risk (odds ratio 3.7, 95% CI 1.218-11.649, P= 0.0213). The level of superoxide dismutase was significantly higher (P= 0.0143) and was correlated with Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) scores (P for trend = 0.0276) in patients carrying MTRR AA genotype. Vitamin B12 and MTHFR 677 TT genotype are the main determinants of hyperhomocysteinemia in CD patients. The association of MTRR 66A&gt;G polymorphism with oxidant stress and disease activity provides rationale for screening vitamin deficiencies in these patients. 	Am._J._Gastroenterol.	D016428 D013485
25084004	20140802	Effect of pregnancy on anti-HEV antibody titres, plasma cytokines and the corresponding gene expression levels in the PBMCs of patients presenting with self-recovering clinical and subclinical hepatitis E.	High mortality in pregnant women (PR) is a characteristic of hepatitis E in developing countries. To understand the pathogenesis of HEV infection in self-limiting disease during pregnancy, we compared clinical (PR-patients) and subclinical-HEV-infections in pregnant women in the first (SC-PR-1) and later (2nd and 3rd, SC-PR-2+3) trimesters with the respective healthy controls and acute non-PR patients. The SC-PR-2+3 exhibited lower ALT, bilirubin levels, anti-HEV-IgM/IgG titres than the acute-PR/non-PR-patients (p&lt;0.05-0.0001). IFN?/IL4ratios indicated Th2/Th1 bias in non-PR and PR-patients respectively. Raised levels of 10/20 plasma cytokines in the non-PR-patients reflect predominant inflammatory response, unaltered- IFN?/reduced-IFN? responses and a robust chemokine secretion. On contrary, the acute-PR-patients exhibited drastic reduction in majority of the cytokines relative to in the non-PR-patients. Importantly, diminished or unaltered response was noted in the acute-PR-group when compared to the corresponding controls. The only exception was sIL2RA, increasing in both patient categories. Of the 14 genes evaluated, the expression of IFN?/IL10/IL1A/IL7/CCL2/CCL3/CXCL8/CXCL10 was higher in the non-PR patients. Of these, the expression of IFN?/IL10/IL1A/CCL2/CCL3/CXCL8 and, additionally, IL2/IL6/TNF genes was higher in the clinical-PRs. Almost identical pattern was noted in the control-PR-2+3 category indicating no influence of HEV infection. Comparison of patient-categories identified significant elevation of IFN?(P&lt;0.001), CCL2(p&lt;0.01), CXCL8(P&lt;0.05), IL1B(p&lt;0.05) and IL10(P&lt;0.0001) and decrease in CXCL10(&lt;0.05) in the PR-patients. The results suggest antibody-dependent disease severity and impaired immune response in the PR patients. Higher expression of cytokine-genes in the PBMCs did not correlate with the plasma-cytokine levels in the PR-patients. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
15824059	20050413	NMR chemical shift and relaxation measurements provide evidence for the coupled folding and binding of the p53 transactivation domain.	The interaction between the acidic transactivation domain of the human tumor suppressor protein p53 (p53TAD) and the 70 kDa subunit of human replication protein A (hRPA70) was investigated using heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) titration experiment was performed on a 15N-labeled fragment of hRPA70, containing the N-terminal 168 residues (hRPA701-168) and p53TAD. HRPA701-168 residues important for binding were identified and found to be localized to a prominent basic cleft. This binding site overlapped with a previously identified single-stranded DNA-binding site, suggesting that a competitive binding mechanism may regulate the formation of p53TAD-hRPA70 complex. The amide 1H and 15N chemical shifts of an uniformly 15N-labeled sample of p53TAD were also monitored before and after the addition of unlabeled hRPA701-168. In the presence of unlabeled hRPA701-168, resonance lineshapes increased and corresponding intensity reductions were observed for specific p53TAD residues. The largest intensity reductions were observed for p53TAD residues 42-56. Minimal binding was observed between p53TAD and a mutant form of hRPA701-168, where the basic cleft residue R41 was changed to a glutamic acid (R41E), demonstrating that ionic interactions play an important role in specifying the binding interface. The region of p53TAD most affected by binding hRPA701-168 was found to have some residual alpha helical and beta strand structure; however, this structure was not stabilized by binding hRPA701-168. 15N relaxation experiments were performed to monitor changes in backbone dynamics of p53TAD when bound to hRPA701-168. Large changes in both the transverse (R2) and rotating frame (R1) relaxation rates were observed for a subset of the p53TAD residues that had 1H-15N HSQC resonance intensity reductions during the complex formation. The folding of p53TAD upon complex formation is suggested by the pattern of changes observed for both R2 and R1. A model that couples the formation of a weak encounter complex between p53TAD and hRPA701-168 to the folding of p53TAD is discussed in the context of a functional role for the p53-hRPA70 complex in DNA repair.

23760981	20130614	The polymorphisms in the MGMT gene and the risk of cancer: a meta-analysis.	Polymorphisms in the MGMT gene have been implicated in susceptibility to cancer, but the published studies have reported inconclusive results. The objective of the current study was to investigate the genetic risk of polymorphisms in the MGMT gene for cancer. A meta-analysis was carried out to analyze the association between polymorphisms in the MGMT gene and cancer risk. Five polymorphisms (Leu84Phe, Leu53Leu, Ile143Val, Lys178Arg, and -485C/A) with 98 case-control studies from 49 articles were analyzed. The results indicated that individuals who carried the Phe/Phe homozygote genotype of Leu84Phe had a 31 % increased risk of cancer compared with the Leu allele (Leu + Leu/Phe) carriers (odds ratio [OR] = 1.32, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-1.52, P &lt; 0.0001 for Phe/Phe vs. Phe/Leu + Leu/Leu). However, there was no significant association between the risk of cancer and the other four polymorphisms (Leu53Leu, Ile143Val, Lys178Arg, and -485C/A). In further stratified analyses for the Leu84Phe and Ile143Val polymorphisms, the increased risk of cancer remained in subgroups of Caucasians, patients with esophageal cancer for the Leu84Phe polymorphism, and patients with lung cancer for the Ile143Val polymorphism. Results from the current meta-analysis suggested that Leu84Phe and Ile143Val in the MGMT gene are risk factors for cancer. In the future, more studies should be performed to validate our results.

16184031	20050927	MDR1 G1199A polymorphism alters permeability of HIV protease inhibitors across P-glycoprotein-expressing epithelial cells.	To evaluate the impact of the human multidrug resistance gene (MDR1) G1199A polymorphism (amino acid change Ser400Asn) on P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-dependent transepithelial permeability and uptake kinetics of HIV protease inhibitors (PI), by using recombinant epithelial cells expressing wild-type MDR1 (MDR1wt) or the G1199A variant (MDR1(1199A)). Using a recombinant expression system developed previously, the transepithelial permeability and uptake kinetic parameters of five PI, amprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir were estimated across polarized epithelial cells. For all PI, the transepithelial permeability ratio (basolateral-to-apical transport divided by apical-to-basolateral transport) was significantly greater in MDR1(1199A) cells than MDR1wt cells: amprenavir (1.7-fold), indinavir (1.8-fold), lopinavir (1.5-fold), ritonavir (2.8-fold), and saquinavir (2.1-fold). However, the impact of G1199A on P-gp activity appeared to primarily influence drug permeability in the apical-to-basolateral direction. Kinetic analysis of ritonavir and saquinavir uptake by MDR1wt- and MDR1(1199A)-expressing cells showed that Vmax was similar, while uptake Km was significantly higher in cells expressing the G1199A variant suggesting that alterations in P-gp-dependent efflux mediated by G1199A were due to changes in transporter affinity. Alterations in transepithelial permeability of HIV PI due to the G1199A polymorphism may impact oral bioavailability of PI and penetration into cells and tissues of the lymphoid and central nervous systems.

25153139	20140826	Association mapping of seed oil and protein content in Sesamum indicum L. using SSR markers.	Sesame is an important oil crop for the high oil content and quality. The seed oil and protein contents are two important traits in sesame. To identify the molecular markers associated with the seed oil and protein contents in sesame, we systematically performed the association mapping among 369 worldwide germplasm accessions under 5 environments using 112 polymorphic SSR markers. The general linear model (GLM) was applied with the criteria of logP ? 3.0 and high stability under all 5 environments. Among the 369 sesame accessions, the oil content ranged from 27.89%-58.73% and the protein content ranged from 16.72%-27.79%. A significant negative correlation of the oil content with the protein content was found in the population. A total of 19 markers for oil content were detected with a R2 value range from 4% to 29%; 24 markers for protein content were detected with a R2 value range from 3% to 29%, of which 19 markers were associated with both traits. Moreover, partial markers were confirmed using mixed linear model (MLM) method, which suggested that the oil and protein contents are controlled mostly by major genes. Allele effect analysis showed that the allele associated with high oil content was always associated with low protein content, and vice versa. Of the 19 markers associated with oil content, 17 presented near the locations of the plant lipid pathway genes and 2 were located just next to a fatty acid elongation gene and a gene encoding Stearoyl-ACP Desaturase, respectively. The findings provided a valuable foundation for oil synthesis gene identification and molecular marker assistant selection (MAS) breeding in sesame. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
16254973	20051029	Common variants of LRRK2 are not associated with sporadic Parkinson's disease.	Multiple mutations in the gene for the leucine-rich repeat kinase (LRRK2) cause autosomal dominant late-onset parkinsonism (PARK8). The Gly2019Ser mutation appears to be common in different populations. To investigate whether this novel gene influences the non-Mendelian sporadic form of Parkinson's disease, we genotyped 121 single nucleotide polymorphisms comprehensively covering the entire LRRK2 gene region in a set of 340 Parkinson's disease patients and 680 matched control subjects from Germany. No association could be demonstrated. We have therefore no evidence for the existence of a common variant in LRRK2 that has a strong influence on Parkinson's disease risk. 	Ann._Neurol.

21579041	20110518	Bis(?-phenyl-tellurido-?Te:Te)bis-[tetra-carbonyl-rhenium(I)].	The title compound, [Re(2)(C(6)H(5)Te)(2)(CO)(8)], crystallizes with two mol-ecules in the asymmetric unit, in which two Re atoms are coordinated in a slightly distorted octa-hedral environment and are bridged by two Te atoms, which show a distorted trigonal-pyramidal geometry. The torsion angles for the Te-Re-Te-Re sequence of atoms are 19.29?(18) and 16.54?(16)? in the two mol-ecules. Thus, the Re-Te four-membered rings in the two mol-ecules deviate significantly from planarity. Two intra-molecular C-H?O inter-actions occur in one of the mol-ecules. Te-Te [4.0551?(10)??] inter-actions between the two mol-ecules and weak inter-molecular C-H?O inter-actions stabilize the crystal packing. 	Acta_Crystallogr_Sect_E_Struct_Rep_Online	D016428
21655354	20110610	Matrix metalloproteinase-9 genetic variation and primary angle closure glaucoma in a Caucasian population.	To investigate the association between genetic variation at the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) locus and primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) in an Australian Caucasian population. A total of 107 Australian patients with PACG and 288 age and sex-matched controls were included in the current study. Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected and genotyped to cover the majority of common variation within MMP9. Allele, genotype and haplotype association analyses were conducted using PLINK. Two SNPs from MMP9, rs3918249 and rs17576 were significantly associated under the allelic model with p values of 0.006 for both SNPs. In addition, haplotype analysis revealed a protective haplotype TACGG to be significantly more frequent in controls (69%) than in PACG cases (59%), with p=0.006. This study demonstrates an association between MMP9 SNPs rs3918249 and rs17576 and PACG in the Australian population, suggesting MMP9 may be involved in the pathogenesis of this blinding disease. Further replication will be helpful in confirming this finding before future clinical translation. 	Mol._Vis.	D016428 D013485
25286968	20141008	Improved anti-emetic efficacy of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in cancer patients with genetic polymorphisms of ABCB1 (MDR1) drug transporter.	Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) remains a major adverse effect decreasing quality of life in patients with cancer. Genetic variations among patients may be responsible for part of the lack of efficacy of anti-emetic drugs. The aim of this study was to investigate how the genetic variants of the drug transporter ABCB1 (MDR1) gene affect anti-emetic treatment with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Patients (n?=?239) receiving moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy and ondansetron or granisetron were included in the study. Anti-emetic responses were recorded daily. The primary end-point of the assessment was the total control rates of CINV in the acute and delayed phases after chemotherapy. Genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP. In the acute phase, patients with ABCB13435TT, 1236TT or 2677TT genotypes had a higher control rate of CINV than other genotype groups: (64.7% in 3435TT versus 45.7% in 3435CC+CT, p?=?0.016; 65.1% in 1236TT versus 46.4% in 1236CC+CT, p?=?0.027; 66.7% in 2677TT versus 46.5% in other genotypes, p?=?0.021). Subjects carrying homozygous variant alleles together (TT-TT-TT) showed a significantly higher protection from nausea and vomiting (67.7% in TT-TT-TT versus 47.1% in other genotypes, p?=?0.032). After the logistic regression analysis with adjustment for other known covariates, the total control rate was significantly higher in the 3435TT genotype group during the acute phase (p?=?0.021). No significant change was found between the total control rates among genotypes in the delayed phase. Each of three 3435TT, C1236TT, 2677TT genotypes of ABCB1 and their combination was associated with about 50% higher anti-emetic response to 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in the acute phase of chemotherapy in patients with cancer receiving moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy. ABCB1 (MDR1) genotypes may contribute to predict the anti-emetic efficacy of 5-HT3 antagonists. 	Basic_Clin._Pharmacol._Toxicol.	D016428 D013485
22187345	20111222	Polymorphism of adiponectin (45T/G) and adiponectin receptor-2 (795G/A) in an Iranian population: relation with insulin resistance and response to treatment with pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.	Adiponectin, an adipose-derived plasma protein, is reduced in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Thiazolidinediones can increase adiponectin levels and improve insulin sensitivity. This study investigated the associations between type 2 diabetes and two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the adiponectin (45T/G) and adiponectin receptor-2 gene (795G/A), and investigated whether these genetic variants affect the response to pioglitazone in Iranian patients with type 2 diabetes. We genotyped 128 non-diabetic participants and 101 patients with type 2 diabetes for 45T/G and 795G/A with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assays. Patients were treated with pioglitazone for 12?weeks, after which we compared laboratory parameters in these two groups. Fasting blood sugar differed significantly in individuals with different 795G/A genotypes after pioglitazone treatment (P?=?0.009). The mean decrease in insulin/glucose ratio after treatment also differed significantly in individuals with different 45T/G genotypes (P?=?0.035). The T allele frequency for 45T/G was 87.11% in controls versus 81.68% in patients (P?=?0.071). The TG and GG genotypes were more frequent in patients (P?=?0.032). The G allele frequency for 795G/A was 76.17% in controls versus 80.20% in patients (P?=?0.179). 795G/A variants were not significantly different between patient and control group. The adiponectin gene 45T/G mutation may be an important determinant of type 2 diabetes in the Iranian population. However, adiponectin 45T/G and adiponectin receptor-2 795G/A polymorphisms were not significantly associated with the response to pioglitazone in our sample. 	Mol._Biol._Rep.	D016428 D013485
18294248	20080226	Familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 does not share hypersensitivity to nitric oxide with common types of migraine.	Familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 (FHM-2) and common types of migraine show phenotypic similarities which may indicate a common neurobiological background. The nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-cGMP) pathway plays a crucial role in migraine pathophysiology. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that ATP1A2 mutations in patients with FHM-2 are associated with hypersensitivity to NO-cGMP pathway. Eight FHM-2 patients with R202Q, R763C, V138A and L764P mutations and nine healthy controls received intravenous infusions of 0.5 mug kg(-1) min(-1) glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) over 20 min. We recorded the following variables: headache intensity on a verbal rating scale; mean flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (V(meanMCA)) by transcranial Doppler; diameter of the superficial temporal artery (STA) by ultrasound. The primary end-points were differences in incidence of migraine headache and area under the curve (AUC) for headache score during an immediate phase (0-120 min) and a delayed phase (2-14 h) after start of infusion. We found no difference in the incidence of reported migraine between FHM-2 patients, 25% (two out of eight), and controls, 0% (0 out of nine) (95% confidence interval -0.06, 0.56) (P = 0.21). The AUC(headache) in the immediate (P = 0.37) and delayed (P = 0.09) phase was not different between patients and controls. The GTN infusion resulted in a biphasic response in patients. During the immediate phase, the median peak headache occurred at 30 min and tended to be higher in patients, 1 (0, 3.8), than in controls, 0 (0, 1) (P = 0.056). During the delayed phase, the median peak headache occurred 4 h after the start of the infusion and was significantly higher in patients, 2.5 (0, 3), than in controls, 0 (0, 0) (P = 0.046). We found no difference in the AUC(VmeanMCA) (P = 0.77) or AUC(STA) (P = 0.53) between FHM-2 patients and controls. GTN infusion failed to induce more migraine in FHM-2 patients than in controls. The pathophysiological pathways underlying migraine headache in FHM-2 may be different from the common types of migraine. 	Cephalalgia	D016428 D013485
7900076	19941101	Construction and characterization of thrombin-resistant variants of recombinant human protein S.	Protein S is a vitamin K-dependent plasma protein that functions as a cofactor of activated protein C (APC) in the inactivation of coagulation factors Va and VIIIa. Protein S, migrates as a doublet on reduced SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This heterogeneity in molecular weight has been explained by limited proteolysis of protein S. Human protein S contains at Arg-49, Arg-60 and Arg-70 three potential cleavage sites. Whether cleavage occurs at all three sites is not known. To study the role of these arginine residues in human protein S, we have replaced them by leucine or isoleucine. All seven possible variants were constructed: three variants with single mutations (R49L, R60L, R70I), three variants with double mutations (R49L/R60L, R60L/R70I, R49L/R70I) and one variant with a triple mutation (R49L/R60L/R70I). On reduced SDS polyacrylamide gels the single and double variants migrate as a doublet just like the wild type protein S. The triple variant migrates as a single band at a molecular weight corresponding to the upper band of the doublet. The upper band of the single and double variants but not of the triple variant could be converted into the lower band by thrombin treatment. All variants showed cofactor activity to APC in a clotting assay. After thrombin treatment, this cofactor activity was abolished for the single (R49L, R60L, R70I) and double variants (R49L/R60L, R60L/R70I, R49L/R70I), while the triple variant (R49L/R60L/R70I) tested at several concentrations, retained its cofactor activity completely, suggesting resistance to thrombin. This shows that thrombin can cleave at all three arginine sites and that cleavage at each of these sites results in the loss of APC cofactor activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) 	Thromb._Haemost.

18413827	20080417	A genotype-phenotype examination of cyclin D1 on risk and outcome of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.	The variant allele of CCND1 G870A encodes a splice variant of the cyclin D1 protein, which possesses an increased half-life. To confirm the phenotypic effect of the variant allele, we examined the immunohistochemical staining pattern of the protein in tumors from a case population of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and compared it with the genotype of these individuals. We also examined how this genotype was associated with the risk of HNSCC and if this genotype-phenotype association was related to patient outcome. In a population-based case-control study of 698 cases and 777 controls, we both genotyped all participants for the CCND1 gene and did immunohistochemical staining of the cyclin D1 protein in the HNSCC tumors. The variant AA genotype was significantly associated with positive immunohistochemical staining (P &lt; 0.02), and this variant genotype was associated with a significantly elevated odds ratio of 1.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.0) for HNSCC overall, with risk greatest in oral and laryngeal sites. Positive immunohistochemical staining was inversely related to human papillomavirus 16 DNA present in the tumor (P &lt; 0.03). The AA genotype and superpositive immunohistochemical staining for cyclin D1 also had independent and significant effects on patient survival. These results strongly suggest that this splice variant, when present in two copies, is a significant predictor of both the occurrence of HNSCC as well as patient survival after treatment. These data further indicate that this variant protein is an important determinant of individual response to therapy for this disease. 	Clin._Cancer_Res.	D016428 D052061 D013485
10829066	20000601	Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 preferentially binds to the SHP-2-binding site on the shared cytokine receptor subunit gp130.	Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) is one member of a family of intracellular inhibitors of signaling pathways initiated by cytokines that use, among others, the common receptor subunit gp130. The SH2 domain of SOCS-3 has been shown to be essential for this inhibitory activity, and we have used a quantitative binding analysis of SOCS-3 to synthetic phosphopeptides to map the potential sites of interaction of SOCS-3 with different components of the gp130 signaling pathway. The only high-affinity ligand found corresponded to the region of gp130 centered around phosphotyrosine-757 (pY757), previously shown to be a docking site for the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. By contrast, phosphopeptides corresponding to other regions within gp130, Janus kinase, or signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins bound to SOCS-3 with weak or undetectable affinity. The significance of pY757 in gp130 as a biologically relevant SOCS-3 docking site was investigated by using transfected 293T fibroblasts. Although SOCS-3 inhibited signaling in cells transfected with a chimeric receptor containing the wild-type gp130 intracellular domain, inhibition was considerably impaired for a receptor carrying a Y--&gt;F point mutation at residue 757. Taken together, these data suggest that the mechanism by which SOCS-3 inhibits the gp130 signaling pathway depends on recruitment to the phosphorylated gp130 receptor, and that some of the negative regulatory roles previously attributed to the phosphatase SHP-2 might in fact be caused by the action of SOCS-3.

27922102	20161207	SLC2A8 (GLUT8) is a mammalian trehalose transporter required for trehalose-induced autophagy.	Trehalose is a disaccharide demonstrated to mitigate disease burden in multiple murine neurodegenerative models. We recently revealed that trehalose rapidly induces hepatic autophagy and abrogates hepatic steatosis by inhibiting hexose transport via the SLC2A family of facilitative transporters. Prior studies, however, postulate that intracellular trehalose is sufficient to induce cellular autophagy. The objective of the current study was to identify the means by which trehalose accesses the hepatocyte cytoplasm, and define the distal signaling mechanisms by which trehalose induces autophagy. We provide gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric, fluorescence microscopic and radiolabeled uptake evidence that trehalose traverses the plasma membrane via SLC2A8 (GLUT8), a homolog of the trehalose transporter-1 (Tret1). Moreover, GLUT8-deficient hepatocytes and GLUT8-deficient mice exposed to trehalose resisted trehalose-induced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and autophagic induction in vitro and in vivo. Although trehalose profoundly attenuated mTORC1 signaling, trehalose-induced mTORC1 suppression was insufficient to activate autophagy in the absence of AMPK or GLUT8. Strikingly, transient, heterologous Tret1 overexpression reconstituted autophagic flux and AMPK signaling defects in GLUT8-deficient hepatocyte cultures. Together, these data suggest that cytoplasmic trehalose access is carrier-mediated, and that GLUT8 is a mammalian trehalose transporter required for hepatocyte trehalose-induced autophagy and signal transduction.

21481229	20110413	Genome-wide survey of post-meiotic segregation during yeast recombination.	When mismatches in heteroduplex DNA formed during meiotic recombination are left unrepaired, post-meiotic segregation of the two mismatched alleles occurs during the ensuing round of mitosis. This gives rise to somatic mosaicism in multicellular organisms and leads to unexpected allelic combinations among progeny. Despite its implications for inheritance, post-meiotic segregation has been studied at only a few loci. By genotyping tens of thousands of genetic markers in yeast segregants and their clonal progeny, we analyzed post-meiotic segregation at a genome-wide scale. We show that post-meiotic segregation occurs in close to 10% of recombination events. Although the overall number of markers affected in a single meiosis is small, the rate of post-meiotic segregation is more than five orders of magnitude larger than the base substitution mutation rate. Post-meiotic segregation took place with equal relative frequency in crossovers and non-crossovers, and usually at the edges of gene conversion tracts. Furthermore, post-meiotic segregation tended to occur in markers that are isolated from other heterozygosities and preferentially at polymorphism types that are relatively uncommon in the yeast species. Overall, our survey reveals the genome-wide characteristics of post-meiotic segregation. The results show that post-meiotic segregation is widespread in meiotic recombination and could be a significant determinant of allelic inheritance and allele frequencies at the population level.

16222682	20051014	Medial temporal lobe dysgenesis in hypochondroplasia.	We describe two patients who have hypochondroplasia with medial temporal lobe dysgenesis. This association has only been reported once before. Both patients had an FGFR3 mutation: 1620C --&gt; A, resulting in Asn540Lys. FGFR3 is expressed in the brain during development and plays a role in hippocampal formation. We suggest FGFR3 mutations might cause cerebral malformations in hypochondroplasia as well as in thanatophoric dysplasia. Further neuroimaging studies of patients with hypochondroplasia and epilepsy or developmental delay may clarify the proportion of patients with hypochondroplasia who have this pattern of central nervous system abnormalities.

2646637	19890301	Sequence-specific 1H-NMR assignments and identification of two small antiparallel beta-sheets in the solution structure of recombinant human transforming growth factor alpha.	Transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) is a small mitogenic protein with about 35% sequence identity with epidermal growth factor (EGF). TGF alpha-like proteins have been proposed to play a role in oncogenesis and wound healing. This report describes sequence-specific 1H-NMR resonance assignments for recombinant human TGF alpha (hTGF alpha). These assignments provide the basis for interpreting NMR data which demonstrate that the solution structure of hTGF alpha includes an antiparallel beta-sheet involving residues Gly-19 to Leu-24 and Lys-29 to Cys-34 and a second, smaller, antiparallel beta-sheet involving residues Tyr-38 and Val-39 and His-45 and Ala-46. These data, together with constraints imposed by the disulfide bonds, are combined to construct a molecular model of the polypeptide chain fold for residues Cys-8 to Ala-46. The resulting structure is similar to that of mouse and human EGF. Human TGF alpha and mouse EGF, however, differ with respect to their structural dynamics, since amide proton/deuteron exchange is much faster for hTGF alpha than for mouse EGF at pH 3.5.

27852434	20161118	Crenactin forms actin-like double helical filaments regulated by arcadin-2.	The similarity of eukaryotic actin to crenactin, a filament-forming protein from the crenarchaeonPyrobaculum calidifontissupports the theory of a common origin of Crenarchaea and Eukaryotes. Monomeric structures of crenactin and actin are similar, although their filament architectures were suggested to be different. Here we report that crenactin formsbona fidedouble helical filaments that show exceptional similarity to eukaryotic F-actin. With cryo-electron microscopy and helical reconstruction we solved the structure of the crenactin filament to 3.8 ? resolution. When forming double filaments, the 'hydrophobic plug' loop in crenactin rearranges. Arcadin-2, also encoded by the arcade gene cluster, binds tightly with its C-terminus to the hydrophobic groove of crenactin. Binding is reminiscent of eukaryotic actin modulators such as cofilin and thymosin ?4 and arcadin-2 is a depolymeriser of crenactin filaments. Our work further supports the theory of shared ancestry of Eukaryotes and Crenarchaea. 	Elife	D016428 D013485
26715448	20151231	Roles of palmitoylation and the KIKK membrane-targeting motif in leukemogenesis by oncogenic KRAS4A.	We have previously shown that palmitoylation is essential for NRAS leukemogenesis, suggesting that targeting RAS palmitoylation may be an effective therapy for NRAS-related cancers. For KRAS-driven cancer, although much research has been focused on the KRAS4B splice variant, which does not undergo palmitoylation, KRAS4A has recently been shown to play an essential role in the development of carcinogen-induced lung cancer in mice and to be widely expressed in human cancers. However, the role of palmitoylation in KRAS4A tumorigenesis is not clear. The expression of KRAS4A in KRAS-mutated leukemia cell lines and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells were checked using western blotting and reverse transcriptions-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis, respectively. The leukemogenic potentials of oncogenic KRAS4A and its palmitoylation-defective mutants were examined by a mouse bone marrow transduction and transplantation model and the in vitro transformation assays. The activation of the RAS downstream signaling pathways and the membrane localizations of the KRAS4A and its mutants were analyzed via western blot analysis and confocal microscopy, respectively. We show here that KRAS4A is expressed in human leukemia cell lines and in AML cells harboring KRAS mutations and that mutation at the palmitoylation site of oncogenic KRAS4A significantly abrogates its leukemogenic potential. However, unlike NRAS, palmitoylation-defective KRAS4A still induces leukemia in mice, albeit with a much longer latency. Using NRAS/KRAS4A chimeric constructs, we found that the KIKK motif of KRAS4A contributes to the transforming activity of KRAS4A. Mutations at both palmitoylation site and the KIKK motif abolish the ability of oncogenic KRAS4A to induce leukemia in mice. Our studies suggest that therapies targeting RAS palmitoylation may also be effective in treating KRAS4A associated malignancies and that interfering the KIKK membrane-targeting motif would enhance the therapeutic effectiveness.

Differences were observed between IL-4 secretion by MDMs of CC and TT genotypes (p = 0.1). Bacteria proliferated more in MDMs from volunteers with higher IL-4 levels (p = 0.05). Microparticles showed higher efficacy (p = 0.05) than drugs. IL-4 and IL-10 SNPs affect the ability of macrophages to counter infection with M. tuberculosis. Microparticles elicit favorable macrophage cytokines regardless of SNPs. 	Pharmacogenomics	D016428 D013485

In the title compound, C(25)H(26)N(2)O(4)?CHCl(3), the aromatic rings of the imino-methyl-6-meth-oxy-phenol fragments make dihedral angles of 58.33?(6) and 87.74?(6)? with the central benzene ring. The mol-ecular conformation is stabilized by intra-molecular O-H?N hydrogen bonds. In the crystal, an inter-molecular C-H?O hydrogen bond involving the chloro-form solvent mol-ecule is observed. The crystal packing is further stabilized by ?-? stacking inter-actions [centroid-centroid distances = 3.739?(3)-3.776?(3)??] between the benzene rings of centrosymmetrically related mol-ecules.

19549167	20090625	Versatility of the capsular genes during biofilm formation by Streptococcus pneumoniae.	Streptococcus pneumoniae forms part of the natural microbiota of the nasopharynx. For the pneumococcus to cause infection, colonization needs to occur and this process is mediated by adherence of bacteria to the respiratory epithelium. Although the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of S. pneumoniae is known to be important for infection to occur, its role in colonization is controversial. Biofilm models are starting to emerge as a promising tool to investigate the role of CPS during nasopharyngeal carriage, which is the first step in the dissemination and initiation of a pneumococcal infection. Using a well-defined model system to analyse in vitro biofilm formation in pneumococcus, here we explore the molecular changes underlying the appearance of capsular mutants using type 3 S. pneumoniae cells. Spontaneous colony phase variants show promoter mutations, as well as duplications, deletions and point mutations in the cap3A gene, which codes for a UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UDP-GlcDH). Increased biofilm-forming capacity could usually be correlated with a reduction both in colony size and in the relative amount of CPS present on the cell surface of each colony variant. However, a mutation in Cap3A Thr83Ile (a strictly conserved residue in bacterial UDP-GlcDHs) that resulted in very low CPS production also led to impaired biofilm formation. We propose that non-encapsulated mutants of pneumococcal type 3 strains are essentially involved in the initial stages (the attachment stage) of biofilm formation during colonization/pathogenesis.

23190393	20121130	PRDM9 gene polymorphism may not be associated with defective spermatogenesis in the Chinese Han population.	PRDM9 is essential for the progression through early meiotic prophase, including double strand break repair, homologous chromosome pairing, and sex body formation during spermatogenesis. In order to evaluate the association of the PRDM9 gene variants with defective spermatogenesis in the Chinese Han population, we assessed two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PRDM9 gene (rs1874165 and rs2973631) using Sequenom iplex technology in 309 cases of severely defective spermatogenesis (199 cases with non-obstructive azoospermia and 110 cases with severe oligozoospermia) and 377 controls. The allele frequencies of the SNPs were not statistically different between the study groups and the controls (P =?0.95 in rs1874165 and P?=?0.80 in rs2973631, respectively). The genetic model analysis of the two SNPs indicated that these SNPs variants may not be associated with defective spermatogenesis in the Chinese Han population.

27229316	20160528	Histone methyltransferase Ash1L mediates activity-dependent repression of neurexin-1?.	Activity-dependent transcription is critical for the regulation of long-term synaptic plasticity and plastic rewiring in the brain. Here, we report that the transcription of neurexin1? (nrxn1?), a presynaptic adhesion molecule for synaptic formation, is regulated by transient neuronal activation. We showed that 10?minutes of firing at 50?Hz in neurons repressed the expression of nrxn1? for 24?hours in a primary cortical neuron culture through a transcriptional repression mechanism. By performing a screening assay using a synthetic zinc finger protein (ZFP) to pull down the proteins enriched near the nrxn1? promoter region in vivo, we identified that Ash1L, a histone methyltransferase, is enriched in the nrxn1? promoter. Neuronal activity triggered binding of Ash1L to the promoter and enriched the histone marker H3K36me2 at the nrxn1? promoter region. Knockout of Ash1L in mice completely abolished the activity-dependent repression of nrxn1?. Taken together, our results reveal that a novel process of activity-dependent transcriptional repression exists in neurons and that Ash1L mediates the long-term repression of nrxn1?, thus implicating an important role for epigenetic modification in brain functioning.

25765855	20150314	TP53 Y220C Is a Hotspot Mutation in Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.	Although TP53 mutations in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have been extensively studied, their association with the different subsites in the head and neck region has never been described. Sanger sequence analysis evaluating exons 4-9 in the TP53 gene was performed on 116 HNSCC patients. The exon location, exact codon and corresponding substitution in relation to the anatomical site (subsite) of the HNSCC were evaluated. We found nonsynonymous TP53 mutations in 70% (81/116) of the patients. In oral cavity carcinomas, most mutations occurred in exon 7 (37%). In oropharyngeal and laryngeal tumors, mutations were mainly found in exons 6 and 7. The most common mutation was located in codon 220, and all of these were an Y220C mutation. Five out of nine (56%) Y220C mutations occurred in oropharyngeal tumors. Additionally, 22% of all mutations observed in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) consisted of Y220C mutations. In this study, the subsite-related distribution of TP53 mutations underlines the biological diversity between tumors arising from different anatomical regions in the head and neck region. Moreover, the Y220C mutation was by far the most prevalent TP53 mutation in HNSCC and a relative hotspot mutation in the oropharynx. ? 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel. 	Pathobiology	D016428
17043057	20061018	PTEN c.511C&gt;T nonsense mutation in a BRRS family disrupts a potential exonic splicing enhancer and causes exon skipping.	Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by macrocephaly, intestinal hamartomatous polyps, lipomas and pigmented macules of the glans penis. We identified a Thai family affected with BRRS. In addition to typical manifestations of BRRS, the proband has a large hepatic AVM which is rarely found in BRRS. The molecular analysis revealed affected members were heterozygous for an exon skipping-associated nonsense mutation c.511C&gt;T in the PTEN gene. The mutation was previously assumed to be deleterious by causing a change to a termination codon, Q171X. We, herein, found that another pathogenic effect was splicing related by disrupting a potential exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) and causing an entire exon 6 skipping. The results prompted us to investigate other reported missense/nonsense mutations in the PTEN gene. We found that they do not colocalize with ESE sites, suggesting that most of their pathogenic effects are not through ESE disruption. 	Jpn._J._Clin._Oncol.	D002363 D016428 D013485
18600088	20080705	Alpha 2A adrenergic receptor polymorphism is associated with plasma von Willebrand factor levels in a general population.	High levels of plasma von Willebrand factor are a proposed risk factor for atherothrombotic disorders. Previously, ABO blood type and the von Willebrand factor -1793C/G polymorphism were shown to affect interindividual variations in plasma von Willebrand factor levels. We previously reported that polymorphisms of the alpha 2A adrenergic receptor, an epinephrine receptor, were associated with platelet function as assessed by platelet function analyzer-100. The measurement value of platelet function analyzer-100 has been reportedly associated with plasma von Willebrand factor levels. Also, it was demonstrated that epinephrine administration increases plasma von Willebrand factor levels in vivo. Thus, the present study investigated the association between plasma von Willebrand factor levels and genetic polymorphisms as follows: ABO blood type, von Willebrand factor -1051G/A (linked with -1793C/G), alpha 2A adrenergic receptor 1780A/G, and alpha 2A adrenergic receptor 2372A/G. Study subjects were genetically unrelated Japanese men (n = 277) recruited at their regular medical examinations. Genotyping of the polymorphisms was performed using the single nucleotide primer extension-based method. Plasma von Willebrand factor levels were measured as ristocetin-cofactor activities. The O blood type and alpha 2A adrenergic receptor 2372AA genotype were significantly associated with lower von Willebrand factor levels, though von Willebrand factor -1051G/A polymorphism did not affect them. In stratification analysis of the group according to blood type O and non-O, the significant association between the 2372AA genotype and lower plasma von Willebrand factor levels was observed in non-O subjects, but not O subjects. In conclusion, the alpha 2A adrenergic receptor 2372A/G polymorphism is associated with plasma von Willebrand factor levels in a general population. 	Blood_Coagul._Fibrinolysis	D016430 D016428
24917213	20140612	Interaction between the SLC19A1 gene and maternal first trimester fever on offspring neural tube defects.	Many studies have indicated that the reduced folate carrier gene (SLC19A1) is associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects (NTDs). However, the interaction between the SLC19A1 gene variant and maternal fever exposure and NTD risk remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the risk for NTDs was influenced by the interactions between the SLC19A1 (rs1051266) variant and maternal first trimester fever. We investigated the potential interaction between maternal first trimester fever and maternal or offspring SLC19A1 polymorphism through a population-based case-control study. One hundred and four nuclear families with NTDs and 100 control families with nonmal newborns were included in the study. SLC19A1 polymorphism was determined using polymerase chain reaction-restricted fragment length polymorphism. Mothers who had the GG/GA genotype and first trimester fever had an elevated risk of NTDs (adjusted odds ratio, 11.73; 95% confidence interval, 3.02-45.58) as compared to absence of maternal first trimester fever and AA genotype after adjusting for maternal education, paternal education, and age, and had a significant interactive coefficient (? = 3.17) between maternal GG/GA genotype and first trimester fever. However, there was no interaction between offspring's GG/GA genotype and maternal first trimester fever (the interactive coefficient ? = 0.97) after adjusting for confounding factors. Our findings suggested that the risk of NTDs was potentially influenced by a gene-environment interaction between maternal SLC19A1 rs1051266 GG/GA genotype and first trimester fever. Maternal GG/GA genotype may strengthen the effect of maternal fever exposure on NTD risk in this Chinese population. 	Birth_Defects_Res._Part_A_Clin._Mol._Teratol.	D003160 D016428 D016449 D013485
24502453	20140208	Clinical pharmacology of tyrosine kinase inhibitors becoming generic drugs: the regulatory perspective.	Over the last decades, billions have been spent and huge efforts have been taken in basic and clinical cancer research [CA Cancer J Clin63:11-30]. About a decade ago, the arms race between drugs and cancer cells reached a new level by introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) into pharmacological anti-cancer therapy. According to their molecular mechanism of action, TKI in contrast to so-called &quot;classic&quot; or &quot;conventional&quot; cytostatics belong to the group of targeted cancer medicines, characterized by accurately fitting with biological structures (i.e. active centers of kinases). Numerous (partly orphan) indications are covered by this new class of substances. Approximately ten years after the first substances of this class of medicines were authorized, patent protection will end within the next years. The following article covers clinical meaning and regulatory status of anti-cancer TKI and gives an outlook to what is expected from the introduction of generic anti-cancer TKI.

21439097	20110329	Genetic variation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis circulating in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine.	A persistent increase of tuberculosis cases has recently been noted in the Ukraine. The reported incidence of drug-resistant isolates of M. tuberculosis is growing steadily; however, data on the genetic variation of isolates of M. tuberculosis circulating in northern Ukraine and on the spectrum and frequency of occurrence of mutations determining resistance to the principal anti-tuberculosis drugs isoniazid and rifampicin have not yet been reported. Isolates of M. tuberculosis from 98 tuberculosis patients living in Kharkiv Oblast (Ukraine) were analyzed using VNTR- and RFLP-IS6110-typing methods. Mutations associated with resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid were detected by RFLP-PCR methods, and also confirmed by sequencing. We identified 75 different genetic profiles. Thirty four (34%) isolates belonged to the Beijing genotype and 23 (23%) isolates belonged to the LAM family. A cluster of isolates belonging to the LAM family had significant genetic heterogeneity, indicating that this family had an ancient distribution and circulation in this geographical region. Moreover, we found a significant percentage of the isolates (36%) belonged to as yet unidentified families of M. tuberculosis or had individual non-clustering genotypes. Mutations conferring rifampicin and isoniazid resistance were detected in 49% and 54% isolates, respectively. Mutations in codon 531 of the rpoB gene and codon 315 of the katG gene were predominant among drug-resistant isolates. An association was found for belonging to the LAM strain family and having multiple drug resistance (R = 0.27, p = 0.0059) and also for the presence of a mutation in codon 531 of the rpoB gene and belonging to the Beijing strain family (R = 0.2, p = 0.04). Transmission of drug-resistant isolates seems to contribute to the spread of resistant TB in this oblast. The Beijing genotype and LAM genotype should be seen as a major cause of drug resistant TB in this region. 	BMC_Infect._Dis.	D016428
23638973	20130504	Colon cancer cells adopt an invasive phenotype without mesenchymal transition in 3-D but not 2-D culture upon combined stimulation with EGF and crypt growth factors.	The intestinal crypt homeostasis is maintained by a combination of growth factors including Wnt, R-Spondin1, Noggin and the epidermal growth factor (EGF). In human colorectal cancer, the Wnt pathway is constitutively activated through genetic and epigenetic alterations in as many as 11 genes encoding components of this crypt stem-cell maintenance mechanism. Although the proliferation of colon cancer cells does not require Wnt, it is possible that colon cancer cells can still respond to the crypt growth factors in the colonic microenvironment. A number of studies have shown that epithelial cells behave differently in 3-D versus 2-D cultures. Because the 3-D conditions more closely mimic the in vivo environment, we examined the effects of Wnt and other crypt growth factors on colon cancer cell growth in 3-D culture. Colon cancer cells were grown in 3-D matrigel supplemented with different combinations of crypt growth factors and colonies were examined for morphology and pathways. When colon cancer cells were cultured in 3-D with EGF, they grew as round spheroid colonies. However, colon cancer cells also grew as flat, disc-like colonies when cultured with EGF plus Wnt, R-Spondin1 and Noggin. Disc colonies were found to have comparable levels of E-cadherin as the spheroid colonies, but showed decreased E-cadherin at the cell-matrix contact sites. Disc colonies also elaborated F-actin rich protrusions (FRP) at the cell-matrix edge, reminiscent of an invasive phenotype but without the expression of vimentin. These E-cadherin and F-actin alterations were not induced by the four growth factors in 2-D culture. Formation of the disc colonies was inhibited by the knockdown of ?-catenin and by protein kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib, imatinib and MK-2206. Furthermore, withdrawal of the crypt growth factors was able to revert the disc colonies to spheroid growth, showing that the invasive phenotype was reversible dependent on the availability of growth factors. These findings show that colon cancer cells remain responsive to the growth factors in the crypt microenvironment and can be induced to undergo morphological transformation in the more physiologically relevant 3-D culture.

26576680	20151119	Mental health literacy measures evaluating knowledge, attitudes and help-seeking: a scoping review.	Mental health literacy has received increasing attention as a useful strategy to promote early identification of mental disorders, reduce stigma and enhance help-seeking behaviors. However, despite the abundance of research on mental health literacy interventions, there is the absence of evaluations of current available mental health literacy measures and related psychometrics. We conducted a scoping review to bridge the gap. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and ERIC for relevant studies. We only focused on quantitative studies and English publications, however, we didn't limit study participants, locations, or publication dates. We excluded non-English studies, and did not check the grey literature (non peer-reviewed publications or documents of any type) and therefore may have missed some eligible measures. We located 401 studies that include 69 knowledge measures (14 validated), 111 stigma measures (65 validated), and 35 help-seeking related measures (10 validated). Knowledge measures mainly investigated the ability of illness identification, and factual knowledge of mental disorders such as terminology, etiology, diagnosis, prognosis, and consequences. Stigma measures include those focused on stigma against mental illness or the mentally ill; self-stigma ; experienced stigma; and stigma against mental health treatment and help-seeking. Help-seeking measures included those of help-seeking attitudes, intentions to seek help, and actual help-seeking behaviors. Our review provides a compendium of available mental health literacy measures to facilitate applying existing measures or developing new measures. It also provides a solid database for future research on systematically assessing the quality of the included measures. 	BMC_Psychiatry	D016428 D013485 D016454
24885030	20140603	Recombinant tandem multi-linear neutralizing epitopes of human enterovirus 71 elicited protective immunity in mice.	Human Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has emerged as the leading cause of viral encephalitis in children, especially in the Asia-Pacific regions. EV71 vaccine development is of high priority at present, and neutralization antibodies have been documented to play critical roles during in vitro and in vivo protection against EV71 infection. In this study, a novel strategy to produce EV71 vaccine candidate based on recombinant multiple tandem linear neutralizing epitopes (mTLNE) was proposed. The three well identified EV71 linear neutralizing epitopes in capsid proteins, VP1-SP55, VP1-SP70 and VP2-SP28, were sequentially linked by a Gly-Ser linker ((G4S)3), and expressed in E.coli in fusion with the Trx and His tag at either terminal. The recombinant protein mTLNE was soluble and could be purified by standard affinity chromatography. Following three dosage of immunization in adult mice, EV71-specific IgG and neutralization antibodies were readily induced by recombinant mTLNE. IgG subtyping demonstrated that lgG1 antibodies dominated the mTLNE-induced humoral immune response. Especially, cytokine profiling in spleen cells from the mTLNE-immunized mice revealed high production of IL-4 and IL-6. Finally, in vivo challenge experiments showed that passive transfer with anti-mTLNE sera conferred full protection against lethal EV71 challenge in neonatal mice. Our results demonstrated that this rational designed recombinant mTLNE might have the potential to be further developed as an EV71 vaccine in the future. 	Virol._J.	D016428 D013485
23225159	20121211	Somatic mutation of PARK2 tumor suppressor gene is not common in common solid cancers.	Recent studies identified that PARK2 gene was a candidate tumor suppressor gene in colorectal cancers and glioblastomas. The aim of this study was identify whether PARK2 somatic mutation is present in other solid tumor as well. In this study, we analyzed the entire coding sequences of human PARK2 gene in gastric, colorectal, breast, lung and prostate carcinoma by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and subsequent direct DNA sequencing. We found two missense mutations (p.Ser9Thr and p.Gly450Val) in colon carcinomas (4.3?%), which were not overlapped with the known PARK2 mutations. Our data suggest that somatic mutational events in PARK2 gene may be rare in colorectal, gastric, prostate, breast and lung carcinomas and may not play an important role in the development of these cancers.

17881868	20070921	Genotypic resistance mutations in treatment-na?ve and treatment-experienced patients under widespread use of antiretroviral drugs in Thailand: implications for further epidemiologic surveillance.	The aims of this study were to illustrate the prevalence and determinants of mutations associated with antiretroviral drug resistance in a group of antiretroviral-naive and treatment-experienced patients in Thailand, where antiretroviral drugs are widely used. One hundred and thirteen treatment-naive (92 CRF01_AE and 21 subtype B patients) and 1,709 treatment-experienced patients were recruited. Genotypic resistance to antiretroviral drugs was studied by sequencing the isolated viruses. Mutation frequencies in treatment-naive patients were reported along with those for treatment-experienced patients. The results showed that all of the patients with treatment-experienced patients showed the same pattern of genotypic resistance. The results also showed that only 14 drug-naive patients (12.4%) carried HIV-1, with at least one drug-resistant mutation. Moreover, four drug-naive patients were found to carry the marker mutations for transmission of drug resistance. The most commonly found marker in drug-naive patients was M36I/V/L (n=90, 81.1%), which is a common natural polymorphism among HIV-1 subtype CRF01_AE individuals. In order to prevent the rapid emergence of resistant virus strains, a national program to monitor antiretroviral drug resistance should be established. We also recommend routine genotypic testing in treatment-naive patients before starting antiretroviral therapy to prevent subtherapeutic response and viral failure. 	Jpn._J._Infect._Dis.

25331813	20141022	Biokinetics and effects of barium sulfate nanoparticles.	Nanoparticulate barium sulfate has potential novel applications and wide use in the polymer and paint industries. A short-term inhalation study on barium sulfate nanoparticles (BaSO? NPs) was previously published [Part Fibre Toxicol 11:16, 2014]. We performed comprehensive biokinetic studies of ???BaSO? NPs administered via different routes and of acute and subchronic pulmonary responses to instilled or inhaled BaSO? in rats. We compared the tissue distribution of ???Ba over 28 days after intratracheal (IT) instillation, and over 7 days after gavage and intravenous (IV) injection of ???BaSO?. Rats were exposed to 50 mg/m? BaSO? aerosol for 4 or 13 weeks (6 h/day, 5 consecutive days/week), and then gross and histopathologic, blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid analyses were performed. BAL fluid from instilled rats was also analyzed. Inhaled BaSO? NPs showed no toxicity after 4-week exposure, but a slight neutrophil increase in BAL after 13-week exposure was observed. Lung burden of inhaled BaSO? NPs after 4-week exposure (0.84???0.18 mg/lung) decreased by 95% over 34 days. Instilled BaSO? NPs caused dose-dependent inflammatory responses in the lungs. Instilled BaSO? NPs (0.28 mg/lung) was cleared with a half-life of???9.6 days. Translocated ???Ba from the lungs was predominantly found in the bone (29%). Only 0.15% of gavaged dose was detected in all organs at 7 days. IV-injected ???BaSO? NPs were predominantly localized in the liver, spleen, lungs and bone at 2 hours, but redistributed from the liver to bone over time. Fecal excretion was the dominant elimination pathway for all three routes of exposure. Pulmonary exposure to instilled BaSO? NPs caused dose-dependent lung injury and inflammation. Four-week and 13-week inhalation exposures to a high concentration (50 mg/m?) of BaSO? NPs elicited minimal pulmonary response and no systemic effects. Instilled and inhaled BaSO? NPs were cleared quickly yet resulted in higher tissue retention than when ingested. Particle dissolution is a likely mechanism. Injected BaSO? NPs localized in the reticuloendothelial organs and redistributed to the bone over time. BaSO? NP exhibited lower toxicity and biopersistence in the lungs compared to other poorly soluble NPs such as CeO? and TiO?. 	Part_Fibre_Toxicol	D003160 D016428 D052061 D013485
22589544	20120517	A competitive inhibitor that reduces recruitment of androgen receptor to androgen-responsive genes.	The androgen receptor (AR) has a critical role in the growth and progression of androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancers. To identify novel inhibitors of AR transactivation that block growth of prostate cancer cells, a luciferase-based high-throughput screen of ~160,000 small molecules was performed in cells stably expressing AR and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-luciferase reporter. CPIC (1-(3-(2-chlorophenoxy) propyl)-1H-indole-3-carbonitrile) was identified as a small molecule that blocks AR transactivation to a greater extent than other steroid receptors. CPIC inhibited AR-mediated proliferation of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines, with minimal toxicity in AR-negative cell lines. CPIC treatment also reduced the anchorage-independent growth of LAPC-4 prostate cancer cells. CPIC functioned as a pure antagonist by inhibiting the expression of AR-regulated genes in LAPC-4 cells that express wild-type AR and exhibited weak agonist activity in LNCaP cells that express the mutant AR-T877A. CPIC treatment did not reduce AR levels or alter its nuclear localization. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation to identify the site of action of CPIC. CPIC inhibited recruitment of androgen-bound AR to the PSA promoter and enhancer sites to a greater extent than bicalutamide. CPIC is a new therapeutic inhibitor that targets AR-mediated gene activation with potential to arrest the growth of prostate cancer. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D052061 D013486
16672840	20060505	Heart rate variability during recovery from a Wingate test in adolescent males.	To evaluate the effect of maturity status on the autonomic nervous system at rest and recovery after short-term, high-intensity exercise in adolescents. A biological maturity age was estimated in 27 males by calculating the years from peak height velocity (PHV) using a multiple regression equation. Subjects were divided into two groups: pre-PHV (years from PHV &lt; 0.49), N = 14, mean age = 12.29 +/- 0.91 yr; post-PHV (years from PHV &gt; 0.5, N = 13, mean age = 15.12 +/-0.76 yr). HR variability was used to evaluate autonomic function. ECG tracings were collected during 5 min at rest and recovery after a Wingate test and were analyzed in the frequency domain (low-frequency (LF), high-frequency (HF), LF/HF, total power (TP)). Data are presented as natural logarithms (LN). Changes in HR from HR(peak) during exercise to HR measured at minute 4 after exercise ([DELTA]HR4) were significantly greater in the pre-PHV group (84.31 +/-17.58 bpm) compared with the post-PHV group (69.42 +/-17.63 bpm). There were no significant differences in resting HR variability between pre- and post-PHV groups (P &gt; 0.05). Significant group x time interactions were found for LF(LN) (ms(2)) and TP(LN) (ms(2)) measured during recovery (P &lt; 0.05). Post hoc tests showed that the pre-PHV group had significantly higher postexercise LF(LN) (5.02 +/- 0.97 vs 4.19 +/- 0.79) and TP(LN) (6.36 +/- 1.02 vs 5.62 +/- 0.65) compared with the post-PHV group. When postexercise LF(LN) (ms(2)) was normalized for TP(LN) (ms(2)), there were no significant differences between groups (P &gt; 0.05). The pre-PHV group had higher total HR variability than the post-PHV group after a Wingate test, suggesting that maturity status significantly affects total HR variability during recovery after high-intensity exercise.

12784229	20030605	The genetics of deafness.	Deafness is an etiologically heterogeneous trait with many known genetic and environmental causes. Genetic factors account for at least half of all cases of profound congenital deafness, and can be classified by the mode of inheritance and the presence or absence of characteristic clinical features that may permit the diagnosis of a specific form of syndromic deafness. The identification of more than 120 independent genes for deafness has provided profound new insights into the pathophysiology of hearing, as well as many unexpected surprises. Although a large number of genes can clearly cause deafness, recessive mutations at a single locus, GJB2 or Connexin 26, account for more than half of all genetic cases in some, but not all populations. The high frequency may well be related to the greatly improved social, educational, and economic circumstances of the deaf that began with the introduction of sign language 300-400 years ago, along with a high frequency of marriages among the deaf in many countries. Similar mechanisms may account for the rapid fixation of genes for speech after the first mutations appeared 50,000-100,000 years ago. Molecular studies have shown that mutations involving several different loci may be the cause for the same form of syndromic deafness. Even within a single locus, different mutations can have profoundly different effects, leading to a different pattern of inheritance in some cases, or isolated hearing loss without the characteristic syndromic features in others. Most cases of genetic deafness result from mutations at a single locus, but an increasing number of examples are being recognized in which recessive mutations at two loci are involved. For example, digenic interactions are now known to be an important cause of deafness in individuals who carry a single mutation at the Connexin 26 locus along with a deletion involving the functionally related Connexin 30 locus. This mechanism complicates genetic evaluation and counseling, but provides a satisfying explanation for Connexin 26 heterozygotes who, for previously unknown reasons, are deaf. A specific genetic diagnosis can sometimes be of great clinical importance, as in the case of the mitochondrial A1555G mutation which causes gene carriers to be exquisitely sensitive to the ototoxic effects of aminoglycosides. This potentially preventable genetic-environmental interaction was the most common cause of genetic deafness in countries where these antibiotics were used indiscriminately in the past. Advances in genetic knowledge along with the use of cochlear implants have posed unique ethical dilemmas for society as well as the deaf community. Since most deaf children are born to hearing parents, it seems likely that deaf culture, and intermarriages among those born with deafness will recede during this century. Will future critics view this as one of the medical triumphs of the 21(st) Century, or as an egregious example of cultural genocide? On the other hand, genetics can provide empowering knowledge to the deaf community that for the first time can allow many deaf couples to know whether their children will be hearing or deaf even before they are conceived.

19074998	20081217	Unveiling a new essential cis element for the transactivation of the CYP3A4 gene by xenobiotics.	Pregnane X receptor (PXR) has been shown to form a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha) and to bind to the distal nuclear receptor-binding element 1 and an everted repeat separated by six nucleotides in the proximal promoter of the CYP3A4 gene. In the present study, a new rifampicin-responsive region, located at -7.6 kilobases upstream from the transcription initiation site, has been identified using reporter assays in HepG2 cells. This region contains a cluster of possible nuclear receptor-binding half-sites, AG(G/T)TCA-like sequence. Of these putative half-sites, we focused six half-sites and termed them alpha-eta half-sites. Introduction of a mutation into either an alpha or beta half-site of CYP3A4 reporter genes almost completely diminished the rifampicin-induced transcription. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, PXR/RXRalpha heterodimer bound to the direct repeat separated by four nucleotides (DR4) formed with alpha and beta half-sites. HepG2-based transactivation assays with the reporter gene constructs with or without mutations in the PXR binding element(s) demonstrated that this DR4 motif is essential for the transcriptional activation not only by rifampicin but also by various human PXR activators. In addition, reporter assays performed in human hepatocytes and mice with adenoviruses expressing luciferase derived from various CYP3A4 reporter genes and that expressing human PXR supported the results of experiments in HepG2 cells. These results suggest the obligatory role of the newly identified direct repeat separated by four nucleotides-type PXR binding element of the CYP3A4 gene for xenobiotic induction of CYP3A4.

26196479	20150722	Chronically Alternating Light Cycles Increase Breast Cancer Risk in Mice.	Although epidemiological studies in shift workers and flight attendants have associated chronic circadian rhythm disturbance (CRD) with increased breast cancer risk, causal evidence for this association is lacking. Several scenarios have been proposed to contribute to the shift work-cancer connection: (1) internal desynchronization, (2) light at night (resulting in melatonin suppression), (3) sleep disruption, (4) lifestyle disturbances, and (5) decreased vitamin D levels due to lack of sunlight. The confounders inherent in human field studies are less problematic in animal studies, which are therefore a good approach to assess the causal relation between circadian disturbance and cancer. However, the experimental conditions of many of these animal studies were far from the reality of human shift workers. For example, some involved xenografts (addressing tumor growth rather than cancer initiation and/or progression), chemically induced tumor models, or continuous bright light exposure, which can lead to suppression of circadian rhythmicity. Here, we have exposed breast cancer-prone p53(R270H/+)WAPCre conditional mutant mice (in a FVB genetic background) to chronic CRD by subjecting them to a weekly alternating light-dark (LD) cycle throughout their life. Animals exposed to the weekly LD inversions showed a decrease in tumor suppression. In addition, these animals showed an increase in body weight. Importantly, this study provides the first experimental proof that CRD increases breast cancer development. Finally, our data suggest internal desynchronization and sleep disturbance as mechanisms linking shift work with cancer development and obesity. 	Curr._Biol.	D016428 D013485
26099445	20150624	Genetic variants associated with female reproductive ageing--potential markers for assessing ovarian function and ovarian stimulation outcome.	This study searched for genetic markers of ovarian function, ovarian stimulation and IVF treatment outcome among genetic variants related to female reproductive ageing. It included 471 treatment cycles from 306 women undergoing IVF treatment. Genotypes for 36 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were evaluated for their association with early follicular phase parameters together with ovarian stimulation and IVF outcome parameters. Results show that genetic variation related to menopause timing also affects ovarian function, as several selected genetic markers were associated with studied traits. For example, rs2153157 (SYCP2L) was associated with amount of recombinant FSH (rFSH) necessary for obtaining one oocyte (P = 0.049) and the chances of biochemical and clinical pregnancy (P = 0.024 and P = 0.011, respectively), while rs4886238 (TDRD3) showed association with both the number of punctured ovarian follicles and oocytes obtained (P = 0.008 and P = 0.037, respectively). Furthermore, FSHB polymorphisms influence early follicular phase FSH concentrations and IVF treatment outcome, whereas SNPs in FSHR affect early antral follicle count and follicle numbers obtained during ovarian stimulation. This study suggests that genetic markers of female reproductive ageing are potential new biomarker candidates that could be considered in clinical ovarian reserve and function assessment in assisted conception.

27239201	20160531	Human Embryonic Stem Cells: A Model for the Study of Neural Development and Neurological Diseases.	Although the mechanism of neurogenesis has been well documented in other organisms, there might be fundamental differences between human and those species referring to species-specific context. Based on principles learned from other systems, it is found that the signaling pathways required for neural induction and specification of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) recapitulated those in the early embryo development in vivo at certain degree. This underscores the usefulness of hESCs in understanding early human neural development and reinforces the need to integrate the principles of developmental biology and hESC biology for an efficient neural differentiation.

24942734	20140620	A hyaluronan receptor for endocytosis (HARE) link domain N-glycan is required for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) signaling in response to the uptake of hyaluronan but not heparin, dermatan sulfate, or acetylated low density lipoprotein (LDL).	The human hyaluronan (HA) receptor for endocytosis (HARE; the 190-kDa C terminus of Stab2) is a major clearance receptor for multiple circulating ligands including HA, heparin (Hep), acetylated LDL (AcLDL), dermatan sulfate (DS), apoptotic debris, and chondroitin sulfate types A, C, D, and E. We previously found that HARE contains an N-glycan in the HA binding Link domain (at Asn(2280)), and cells expressing membrane-bound HARE(N2280A) bind and endocytose HA normally (Harris, E. N., Parry, S., Sutton-Smith, M., Pandey, M. S., Panico, M., Morris, H. R., Haslam, S. M., Dell, A., and Weigel, P. H. (2010) Glycobiology 20, 991-1001). Also, NF-?B-mediated signaling is activated by HARE-mediated endocytosis of HA, Hep, AcLDL, or DS but not by chondroitin sulfates (Pandey, M. S., and Weigel, P. H. (2014) J. Biol. Chem. 289, 1756-1767). Here we investigated the role of Link N-glycans in ligand uptake and NF-?B and ERK1/2 signaling. HA?HARE-mediated ERK1/2 activation was HA size- dependent, as found for NF-?B activation. HARE(N2280A) cells internalized HA, Hep, AcLDL, and DS normally. No ERK1/2 activation occurred during HA endocytosis by HARE(N2280A) cells, but activation did occur with Hep. Dual-luciferase recorder assays showed that NF-?B-mediated gene expression occurred normally in HARE(N2280A) cells endocytosing Hep, AcLDL, or DS but did not occur with HA. Activation of NF-?B by endogenous degradation of I?B-? was observed for HARE(N2280A) cells endocytosing Hep, AcLDL, or DS but not HA. We conclude that a Link domain complex N-glycan is required specifically for HARE?HA-mediated activation of ERK1/2 and NF-?B-mediated gene expression and that this initial activation mechanism is different from and independent of the initial mechanisms for HARE-mediated signaling in response to Hep, AcLDL, or DS uptake.

12568591	20030206	Correlation between hydrogen bond lengths and reduction potentials in Clostridium pasteurianum rubredoxin.	15N NMR hyperfine-shift data were collected for wild-type and site-specific mutant (V44I, V44A, and V44G) Clostridium pasteurianum rubredoxins in the oxidized state. Whereas most of the (15)N NMR signals did not exhibit large systematic changes upon mutation of residue 44, the signal from the backbone nitrogen of residue 44 itself (arrows) shifted by approximately 400 ppm. These shifts were used to determine the lengths of the hydrogen bond between the backbone amide of residue 44 and the side-chain sulfur of cysteine-44, which is covalently ligated to the iron of the metal center. The results, which demonstrated that this hydrogen bond is shorter in mutants with higher reduction potential, point to the importance of hydrogen bonds in modulating the reduction potential of iron-sulfur proteins.

26876023	20160216	GAME9 regulates the biosynthesis of steroidal alkaloids and upstream isoprenoids in the plant mevalonate pathway.	Steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) are cholesterol-derived molecules produced by solanaceous species. They contribute to pathogen defence but are toxic to humans and considered as anti-nutritional compounds. Here we show that GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM 9 (GAME9), an APETALA2/Ethylene Response Factor, related to regulators of alkaloid production in tobacco and Catharanthus roseus, controls SGA biosynthesis. GAME9 knockdown and overexpression in tomato and potato alters expression of SGAs and upstream mevalonate pathway genes including the cholesterol biosynthesis gene STEROL SIDE CHAIN REDUCTASE 2 (SSR2). Levels of SGAs, C24-alkylsterols and the upstream mevalonate and cholesterol pathways intermediates are modified in these plants. ?(7)-STEROL-C5(6)-DESATURASE (C5-SD) in the hitherto unresolved cholesterol pathway is a direct target of GAME9. Transactivation and promoter-binding assays show that GAME9 exerts its activity either directly or cooperatively with the SlMYC2 transcription factor as in the case of the C5-SD gene promoter. Our findings provide insight into the regulation of SGA biosynthesis and means for manipulating these metabolites in crops. 	Nat_Commun	D016428 D013485
23828749	20130706	Role of tumor necrosis factor-? -308 G/A promoter polymorphism in gastric cancer.	Gastric cancer (GC) is the fourth most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death world-wide after lung cancer. It is a multifactorial disease with the involvement of both genetic and environmental risk factors. Genetic variation in genes encoding cytokines and their receptors, determine the intensity of the inflammatory response, which may contribute to individual differences in severity of outcome of the disease. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-?) is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine and acid inhibitor. A bi allelic G to A polymorphism at -308 upstream from the transcription initiation site of the promoter is associated with elevated TNF levels. The present study is aimed at evaluating the role of TNF-?-308 (G ? A) gene polymorphism and susceptibility to GC. A case-control study was carried out in 114 GC patients and 229 healthy control subjects. TNF-? genotyping at position-308 (G ? A) was carried out by amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) method followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The distribution of TNF-? genotypes at -308 (G ? A) were GG 28.07%, GA 66.67% and AA 5.26% in GC patients and GG 33.19%, GA 55.89% and AA 10.92% in control subjects. The frequencies of alleles G and A were 0.614 and 0.386 in GC patients and 0.611 and 0.389 in control subjects respectively. The study showed no significant difference in the distribution of genotype and allelic frequencies between GC patients and control subject. 	Saudi_J_Gastroenterol	D003160 D016428 D013485
18817453	20080927	Rice XB15, a protein phosphatase 2C, negatively regulates cell death and XA21-mediated innate immunity.	Perception of extracellular signals by cell surface receptors is of central importance to eukaryotic development and immunity. Kinases that are associated with the receptors or are part of the receptors themselves modulate signaling through phosphorylation events. The rice (Oryza sativa L.) XA21 receptor kinase is a key recognition and signaling determinant in the innate immune response. A yeast two-hybrid screen using the intracellular portion of XA21, including the juxtamembrane (JM) and kinase domain as bait, identified a protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C), called XA21 binding protein 15 (XB15). The interaction of XA21 and XB15 was confirmed in vitro and in vivo by glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, respectively. XB15 fusion proteins purified from Escherichia coli and from transgenic rice carry PP2C activity. Autophosphorylated XA21 can be dephosphorylated by XB15 in a temporal- and dosage-dependent manner. A serine residue in the XA21 JM domain is required for XB15 binding. Xb15 mutants display a severe cell death phenotype, induction of pathogenesis-related genes, and enhanced XA21-mediated resistance. Overexpression of Xb15 in an XA21 rice line compromises resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. These results demonstrate that Xb15 encodes a PP2C that negatively regulates the XA21-mediated innate immune response. 	PLoS_Biol.	D016428 D052061 D013485 D013486
25435504	20141202	Expression, characterization and mutagenesis of an FAD-dependent glucose dehydrogenase from Aspergillus terreus.	An FAD-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) from Aspergillus terreus NIH2624 was expressed in Escherichia coli with a yield of 228?16U/L of culture. Co-expression with chaperones DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE and osmotic stress induced by simple carbon sources enhanced productivity significantly, improving the yield to 23883?563U/L after optimization. FAD-GDH was purified in two steps with the specific activity of 604U/mg. Using d-glucose as substrate, the optimal pH and temperature for FAD-GDH were determined to be 7.5 and 50?C, respectively. Activity was stable across the pH range 3.5-9.0, and the half-life was 52min at 42?C. Km and Vmax were calculated as 86.7?5.3mM and 928?35U/mg, and the molecular weight was approximately 65.6kDa based on size exclusion chromatography, indicating a monomeric structure. The 3D structure of FAD-GDH was simulated by homology modelling using the structure of A. niger glucose oxidase (GOD) as template. From the model, His551, His508, Asn506 and Arg504 were identified as key residues, and their importance was verified by site-directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, three additional mutants (Arg84Ala, Tyr340Phe and Tyr406Phe) were generated and all exhibited a higher degree of substrate specificity than the native enzyme. These results extend our understanding of the structure and function of FAD-GDH, and could assist potential commercial applications. 	Enzyme_Microb._Technol.	D003160 D016428 D013485
9452765	19980207	The involvement of the two acidic patches of spinach plastocyanin in the reaction with photosystem I.	Six different spinach plastocyanin mutants have been constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in Escherichia coli to probe the importance of the two acidic patches in the interaction with photosystem I. The mutants were: Asp42Lys, Glu43Asn, Glu43Lys, Glu43Gln/Asp44Asn, Glu59Lys/Glu60Gln and Glu43Asn/Glu59Lys/Glu60Gln and they have been characterised by optical absorption and EPR spectroscopy, redox titrations and isoelectric focusing. The electron transfer to photosystem I was investigated by flash-induced time-resolved absorption measurements at 830 nm. The kinetics were interpreted with a model that incorporates a rate-limiting conformational change from inactive to active forms of the plastocyanin-photosystem I complex. All mutations resulted in a displacement of the equilibrium towards the inactive conformation. The strongest impairment of the electron transfer was found for mutations in the larger acidic patch, in particular upon modification of residues 43 or 44. However, mutations of residues 59 and 60 in the smaller acidic patch also resulted in a lower reactivity. 	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D013485
23272117	20121229	Allitridi inhibits multiple cardiac potassium channels expressed in HEK 293 cells.	Allitridi (diallyl trisulfide) is an active compound (volatile oil) from garlic. The previous studies reported that allitridi had anti-arrhythmic effect. The potential ionic mechanisms are, however, not understood. The present study was designed to determine the effects of allitridi on cardiac potassium channels expressed in HEK 293 cells using a whole-cell patch voltage-clamp technique and mutagenesis. It was found that allitridi inhibited hKv4.3 channels (IC(50)?=?11.4 ?M) by binding to the open channel, shifting availability potential to hyperpolarization, and accelerating closed-state inactivation of the channel. The hKv4.3 mutants T366A, T367A, V392A, and I395A showed a reduced response to allitridi with IC(50)s of 35.5 ?M, 44.7 ?M, 23.7 ?M, and 42.4 ?M. In addition, allitridi decreased hKv1.5, hERG, hKCNQ1/hKCNE1 channels stably expressed in HEK 293 cells with IC(50)s of 40.2 ?M, 19.6 ?M and 17.7 ?M. However, it slightly inhibited hKir2.1 current (100 ?M, inhibited by 9.8% at -120 mV). Our results demonstrate for the first time that allitridi preferably blocks hKv4.3 current by binding to the open channel at T366 and T367 of P-loop helix, and at V392 and I395 of S6 domain. It has a weak inhibition of hKv1.5, hERG, and hKCNQ1/hKCNE1 currents. These effects may account for its anti-arrhythmic effect observed in experimental animal models. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
1484487	19921101	Site-directed mutagenesis of an amino acid residue in the bacteriophage P2 ogr protein implicated in interaction with Escherichia coli RNA polymerase.	The P2 ogr gene encodes a 72-amino-acid protein required for P2 late gene expression. This gene was defined originally by a class of compensatory mutations which overcome the block to P2 late transcription imposed by a host mutation, rpoA109, in the gene encoding the alpha subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. Spontaneous compensatory ogr mutations substitute a Cys for a Tyr residue at amino acid 42 in the Ogr polypeptide. Using suppression of an ogr amber mutation and site-directed oligonucleotide mutagenesis, we have studied the effect of amino acid substitutions at this position in Ogr. Substitution of charged residues at this site renders Ogr protein inactive, in rpoA+ and rpoA109 strains. While 11 different amino acids are capable of replacing the wild-type Tyr-42 to allow P2 growth to varying degrees in a wild-type E. coli strain, only three of these allow phage growth in strains carrying the rpoA109 mutation. Phages carrying Cys or Ala in place of Tyr-42 gave burst sizes at least as high as P2 ogr+ in a rpoA+ strain; a Gly substitution also allowed P2 to grow in either a rpoA+ or rpoA109 background, but markedly reduced the burst size. These results are consistent with a direct interaction between Ogr and the alpha subunit of E. coli RNA polymerase in positive control of P2 late transcription, and indicate that the block imposed by the rpoA109 mutation is due to steric hindrance.

20812179	20100903	The utility of alpha-methyl CoA racemase (P504S) expression as a marker of renal cell carcinomas.	Renal cell tumours are numerous and heterogeneous. Because of their clinicopathological heterogeneity, their accurate diagnosis may be challenging. In case of an equivocal diagnosis, immunohistochemistry may be a useful mean of diagnosis. Recently, alpha-methyl CoA racemase has been identified as a useful marker in kidney cancers. Our objectives are to highlight the role of alpha-methyl CoA racemase (AMACR) as a diagnostic marker in papillary renal carcinoma and to assess its utility in the other tumour types. Aretrospective review was performed on 62 patients who were treated for renal tumours between January 1994 and November 2005. Immunoreactivity was evaluated with a qualitative manner. Positive AMACR staining was defined as a coarse dense cytoplasmic granularity. The 62 renal tumours were diagnosed as papillary tumours in 22 cases, clear cell tumours in 18 cases, chromophobe carcinoma in 12 cases and oncocytoma in 10 cases among the 22 cases of papillary tumours, all the cases (100%) showed cytoplasmic immunoreactivity staining. 4 cases between the 18 clear cell carcinomas (22%) showed positivity with AMACR. The 12 cases of chromophobe carcinoma didn't express AMACR by immunohistochemistry. Only one case between the oncocytomas (1%) expressed AMACR. This study confirms the high sensitivity of AMACR for papillary renal cell carcinomas but we must keep in mind that weak focal AMACR staining could be present in other renal cell carcinomas.

8656074	19951101	Structural features in lipoprotein lipase necessary for the mediation of lipoprotein uptake into cells.	Lipoprotein lipase (LpL) has been shown to mediate the uptake of lipoproteins into cells. The uptake is initiated by binding of LpL to cell surface proteoglycans and to the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein. This ability of LpL is independent of catalytic activity and depends on the intact dimeric structure of the lipase and functional residues in the C-terminal domain. The goal of this study was to identify structural features in LpL that are essential in the mediation of lipoprotein uptake. Naturally occurring variants and LpL mutants produced by site-directed mutagenesis were cloned and expressed in COS-cells. A combination of immunoassays and separation on heparin-Sepharose columns was used to determine the molar ratio of monomeric to dimeric LpL in the expression media. The mutants were tested for their ability to mediate the uptake of 125I-labeled beta-VLDL in cultured Hep3b cells in direct comparison with wild type LpL. We found that the concentration of monomer in the media correlated negatively with the effect on the uptake mediated by the dimeric form of LpL. A mutation affecting the catalytic activity (Asp 156Gly) resulted in no significant reduction in the lipase-mediated beta-VLDL uptake. Point mutations in the proposed lipid binding region Trp390Ala or Trp393Ala and the substitution of 390-393 with the homologous hepatic lipase (HL) sequence were also normal, while the deletion of 390-393 reduced the ability to mediate the uptake by about 60% in comparison to wild type. A mutation known to impair heparin binding (Arg294Ala) was also less efficient than the wild type in mediating uptake. In conclusion, it is important to determine the monomer/dimer ratio in mutant preparations as the presence of monomers inhibits the uptake mediated by the dimeric LpL. Moreover, sites involved in heparin and lipid binding between residues 390-421 are important for LpL-mediated lipoprotein uptake. 	J._Lipid_Res.	D016428 D013485
26631972	20151204	Sec13 Regulates Expression of Specific Immune Factors Involved in Inflammation In Vivo.	The Sec13 protein functions in various intracellular compartments including the nuclear pore complex, COPII-coated vesicles, and inside the nucleus as a transcription regulator. Here we developed a mouse model that expresses low levels of Sec13 (Sec13(H/-)) to assess its functions in vivo, as Sec13 knockout is lethal. These Sec13 mutant mice did not present gross defects in anatomy and physiology. However, the reduced levels of Sec13 in vivo yielded specific immunological defects. In particular, these Sec13 mutant mice showed low levels of MHC I and II expressed by macrophages, low levels of INF-? and IL-6 expressed by stimulated T cells, and low frequencies of splenic IFN-?+CD8+ T cells. In contrast, the levels of soluble and membrane-bound TGF-? as well as serum immunoglobulin production are high in these mice. Furthermore, frequencies of CD19+CD5-CD95+ and CD19+CD5-IL-4+ B cells were diminished in Sec13(H/-) mice. Upon stimulation or immunization, some of the defects observed in the na?ve mutant mice were compensated. However, TGF-? expression remained high suggesting that Sec13 is a negative modulator of TGF-? expression and of its immunosuppressive functions on certain immune cells. In sum, Sec13 regulates specific expression of immune factors with key functions in inflammation. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D052061 D013485
25180155	20140903	Significant clinical response to JAK1/2 inhibition in a patient with CSF3R-T618I-positive atypical chronic myeloid leukemia.	Mutations in CSF3R (colony-stimulating factor 3 receptor) are frequent oncogenic drivers in chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) and atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML). Here we describe a 75 year old man who was diagnosed with CSF3R-T618I-positive atypical CML. He presented with leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia and developed massive splenomegaly and severe constitutional symptoms. Hydroxyurea was given over a 6 month period but failed to provide any measureable clinical benefit. Eventually, he was treated with ruxolitinib, an FDA-approved JAK1/2 inhibitor, which resulted in dramatic improvement of his blood counts. He also had significant reduction of spleen volume and constitutional symptoms. This case highlights the need for a clinical trial to interrogate JAK1/2 as a potential molecular target in CNL and aCML in patients with or without CSF3R mutation. A clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib for this patient population is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02092324). 	Leuk_Res_Rep	D016428
27455870	20160727	PP2A(Cdc55)'s role in reductional chromosome segregation during achiasmate meiosis in budding yeast is independent of its FEAR function.	PP2A(Cdc55) is a highly conserved serine-threonine protein phosphatase that is involved in diverse cellular processes. In budding yeast, meiotic cells lacking PP2A(Cdc55) activity undergo a premature exit from meiosis I which results in a failure to form bipolar spindles and divide nuclei. This defect is largely due to its role in negatively regulating the Cdc Fourteen Early Anaphase Release (FEAR) pathway. PP2A(Cdc55) prevents nucleolar release of the Cdk (Cyclin-dependent kinase)-antagonising phosphatase Cdc14 by counteracting phosphorylation of the nucleolar protein Net1 by Cdk. CDC55 was identified in a genetic screen for monopolins performed by isolating suppressors of spo11? spo12? lethality suggesting that Cdc55 might have a role in meiotic chromosome segregation. We investigated this possibility by isolating cdc55 alleles that suppress spo11? spo12? lethality and show that this suppression is independent of PP2A(Cdc55)'s FEAR function. Although the suppressor mutations in cdc55 affect reductional chromosome segregation in the absence of recombination, they have no effect on chromosome segregation during wild type meiosis. We suggest that Cdc55 is required for reductional chromosome segregation during achiasmate meiosis and this is independent of its FEAR function. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
11206403	20010224	Polymorphisms in the neurogenin 3 gene (NEUROG) and their relation to altered insulin secretion and diabetes in the Danish Caucasian population.	AIM/HYPOTHESIS. Neurogenin 3 (NEUROG3) is a member of the subfamily of basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors involved in differentiation of the endocrine pancreas and therefore a possible candidate gene for maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Using Polymerase-chain-reaction single-stranded-conformation polymorphism, we examined the coding region including the 5'-untranslated and 3'- untranslated regions of the NEUROG3 in a group of 133 diabetic patients comprising 19 MODY patients, 19 patients with dominant Type I diabetes, and 31 early-onset and 64 late-onset Type II diabetic patients. We found two missense mutations, Glyl67Arg and Serl99Phe, as well as two non-coding variants in the 5' UTR, a c --&gt; t nucleotide variant at position -10 upstream of the start codon in one MODY patient and a 2 base pair (CA) deletion polymorphism at position -44/-45. Allele frequencies measured in 377 diabetic patients and in 217 glucose-tolerant control subjects were: Gly167Arg, 0.04 (95 % CI: 0.02-0.06) and 0.04 (0.02-0.06); Ser199Phe, 0.31 (0.26-0.36) and 0.30 (0.24-0.36); -44-45delCA, 0.33 (0.31-0.35) and 0.35 (0.32-0.38), respectively. Both Ser199Phe and the -44-45delCA were in linkage disequilibrium (chi2 &gt; 60) but the Ser199Phe and the -44-45delCA polymorphism were not associated with consistent changes in fasting- or glucose-induced insulin secretion in 249 glucose-tolerant offspring (first-degree relatives) of Type II diabetic parents or in 217 unrelated middle-aged glucose tolerant subjects. Genetic variability in NEUROG3 is not associated with dominant Type I diabetes, MODY, Type II diabetes or changes in insulin secretion in the Danish Caucasians examined subjects.

S. maltophilia Sm777 exhibits innate resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, this bacterium tolerates high levels (0.1 to 50 mM) of various toxic metals, such as Cd, Pb, Co, Zn, Hg, Ag, selenite, tellurite and uranyl. S. maltophilia Sm777 was able to grow in the presence of 50 mM selenite and 25 mM tellurite and to reduce them to elemental selenium (Se(0)) and tellurium (Te(0)) respectively. Transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis showed cytoplasmic nanometer-sized electron-dense Se(0) granules and Te(0) crystals. Moreover, this bacterium can withstand up to 2 mM CdCl(2) and accumulate this metal up to 4% of its biomass. The analysis of soluble thiols in response to ten different metals showed eightfold increase of the intracellular pool of cysteine only in response to cadmium. Measurements by Cd K-edge EXAFS spectroscopy indicated the formation of Cd-S clusters in strain Sm777. Cysteine is likely to be involved in Cd tolerance and in CdS-clusters formation. Our data suggest that besides high tolerance to antibiotics by efflux mechanisms, S. maltophilia Sm777 has developed at least two different mechanisms to overcome metal toxicity, reduction of oxyanions to non-toxic elemental ions and detoxification of Cd into CdS.

26422504	20151001	Unique chloride-sensing properties of WNK4 permit the distal nephron to modulate potassium homeostasis.	Dietary potassium deficiency activates thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransport along the distal nephron. This may explain, in part, the hypertension and cardiovascular mortality observed in individuals who consume a low-potassium diet. Recent data suggest that plasma potassium affects the distal nephron directly by influencing intracellular chloride, an inhibitor of the with-no-lysine kinase (WNK)-Ste20p-related proline- and alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) pathway. As previous studies used extreme dietary manipulations, we sought to determine whether the relationship between potassium and NaCl cotransporter (NCC) is physiologically relevant and clarify the mechanisms involved. We report that modest changes in both dietary and plasma potassium affect NCC in vivo. Kinase assay studies showed that chloride inhibits WNK4 kinase activity at lower concentrations than it inhibits activity of WNK1 or WNK3. Also, chloride inhibited WNK4 within the range of distal cell chloride concentration. Mutation of a previously identified WNK chloride-binding motif converted WNK4 effects on SPAK from inhibitory to stimulatory in mammalian cells. Disruption of this motif in WNKs 1, 3, and 4 had different effects on NCC, consistent with the three WNKs having different chloride sensitivities. Thus, potassium effects on NCC are graded within the physiological range, which explains how unique chloride-sensing properties of WNK4 enable it to mediate effects of potassium on NCC in vivo.

Advances in cystic fibrosis management have significantly improved life expectancy in these patients. However, we are now faced with a growing number of long-term extrapulmonary consequences of this disease, including ophthalmic complications of diabetes in cystic fibrosis patients. We present a unique report that documents a case of diabetic papillopathy progressing to nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy resulting in vision loss in a patient with CF and diabetes. It highlights the potentially devastating consequences of longstanding diabetes in CF patients. 	Case_Rep_Endocrinol	D016428
11923418	20020330	Regulated cationic channel function in Xenopus oocytes expressing Drosophila big brain.	Big brain (bib) is a neurogenic gene that when mutated causes defects in cell fate determination during Drosophila neurogenesis through an unknown mechanism. The protein Big Brain (BIB) has sequence identity with the major intrinsic protein family that includes the water- and ion-conducting aquaporin channels. We show here that BIB expressed heterologously in Xenopus oocytes provides a voltage-insensitive, nonselective cation channel function with permeability to K+ &gt; Na+ &gt; tetraethylammonium. The conductance, activated in response to endogenous signaling pathways in BIB-expressing oocytes, is decreased after treatment with 20 microm insulin and is enhanced with 10 microm lavendustin A, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Western blot analysis confirms that BIB is tyrosine-phosphorylated. Both tyrosine phosphorylation and the potentiating effect of lavendustin A are removed by partial deletion of the C terminus (amino acids 317-700). Current activation is not observed in control oocytes or in oocytes expressing a nonfunctional mutant (BIB E71N) that appears to be expressed on the plasma membrane by confocal microscopy and Western blotting. These results indicate that BIB can participate in tyrosine kinase-regulated transmembrane signaling and may suggest a role for membrane depolarization in the neurogenic function of BIB in early development.

16818686	20060705	Exon 19 deletion mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor are associated with prolonged survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with gefitinib or erlotinib.	Somatic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been detected in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and are associated with sensitivity to treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib. Our study explored the relationship between the two most common types of somatic EGFR mutations, exon 19 deletions and the L858R point mutation, and outcomes of patients following treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib. Tumor specimens obtained before treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib were analyzed for EGFR mutations. Patients with exon 19 deletion or L858R mutations were identified. The response rate, time to progression, and overall survival were determined for the two groups. We identified 36 patients with NSCLC and an EGFR mutation who were treated with gefitinib or erlotinib. Patients with an exon 19 deletion had a significantly longer overall survival compared with patients with an L858R mutation (38 versus 17 months; P = 0.04). There were also trends toward higher response rate (73% versus 50%) and improved time to progression (24 versus 10 months) for the patients with an exon 19 deletion, although these were not independently significant in a multivariate analysis. A difference in response rate for patients treated with gefitinib compared with erlotinib was also noted [18 of 23 (78%) versus 3 of 9 (33%); P = 0.04]. No obvious difference in time to progression or overall survival was noted between gefitinib- and erlotinib-treated patients. Patients with NSCLC and EGFR exon 19 deletions have a longer survival following treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib compared with those with the L858R mutation. Pooling of greater numbers of patients and completion of prospective trials are needed to further define the predictive and prognostic roles of different EGFR mutations with respect to treatment with gefitinib, erlotinib, and other EGFR inhibitors.

22331277	20120215	Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis.	To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs typically administered in primary care for the management of patients with sciatica. Systematic review. Data source International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, and LILACS. Randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy and tolerability of drugs versus placebo or other treatment for sciatica. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale. Pain and disability outcomes were converted to a common 0 to 100 scale. Data were pooled with a random effects model, and the GRADE approach was used in summary conclusions. Twenty three published reports met the inclusion criteria. The evidence to judge the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, and opioid analgesics ranged from moderate to low quality. Most of the pooled estimates did not favour the active treatment over placebo. The pooled results of two trials of corticosteroids (mean difference in overall and leg pain -12.2, 95% confidence interval -20.9 to -3.4) and a single trial of the anticonvulsant gabapentin for chronic sciatica (mean difference in overall pain relief -26.6, -38.3 to -14.9) showed some benefits but only in the short term. The median rate of adverse events was 17% (interquartile range 10-30%) for the active drugs and 11% (3-23%) for placebo. Trial limitations included failure to use validated outcome measures, lack of long term follow-up, and small sample size. As the existing evidence from clinical trials is of low quality, the efficacy and tolerability of drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica in primary care is unclear.

12686490	20030411	Inhibition of human glutathione S-transferase P1-1 by the flavonoid quercetin.	In the present study, the inhibition of human glutathione S-transferase P1-1 (GSTP1-1) by the flavonoid quercetin has been investigated. The results show a time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of GSTP1-1 by quercetin. GSTP1-1 activity is completely inhibited upon 1 h incubation with 100 microM quercetin or 2 h incubation with 25 microM quercetin, whereas 1 and 10 microM quercetin inhibit GSTP1-1 activity to a significant extent reaching a maximum of 25 and 42% inhibition respectively after 2 h. Co-incubation with tyrosinase greatly enhances the rate of inactivation, whereas co-incubation with ascorbic acid or glutathione prevents this inhibition. Addition of glutathione upon complete inactivation of GSTP1-1 partially restores the activity. Inhibition studies with the GSTP1-1 mutants C47S, C101S and the double mutant C47S/C101S showed that cysteine 47 is the key residue in the interaction between quercetin and GSTP1-1. HPLC and LC-MS analysis of trypsin digested GSTP1-1 inhibited by quercetin did not show formation of a covalent bond between Cys 47 residue of the peptide fragment 45-54 and quercetin. It was demonstrated that the inability to detect the covalent quercetin-peptide adduct using LC-MS is due to the reversible nature of the adduct-formation in combination with rapid and preferential dimerization of the peptide fragment once liberated from the protein. Nevertheless, the results of the present study indicate that quinone-type oxidation products of quercetin likely act as specific active site inhibitors of GSTP1-1 by binding to cysteine 47.

12667061	20030402	Highly conserved serine in the third transmembrane helix of the luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin receptor regulates receptor activation.	The elucidation of the role of highly conserved polar amino acids in the transmembrane helices of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is important in understanding the mechanism of receptor activation. To this end, the significance of a highly conserved serine residue in the third transmembrane alpha-helix (TM3) of the luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin receptor (LH/hCGR) in regulating receptor activation was examined. Results showed that mutation of serine 431 to alanine (S431A) decreased the ability of the receptor to mediate cAMP production in response to hCG, suggesting that S431 stabilizes the active state of the receptor. Homology with other GPCRs suggests that S431 may participate in the coordination of a Na(+) ion. Since Na(+) has been found to stabilize the active state of the receptor in the presence of hCG, the possibility that S431 promotes receptor activation by mediating the effects of Na(+) was explored. Results showed that the regulation of hormone-induced receptor activation by S431 was independent of Na(+). A rhodopsin-based homology model of the TM region of the LH/hCGR was developed to identify other amino acids that might mediate the effects of Na(+) on receptor function. Results indicate that substitution of an Asp at position 556 with Tyr alters the ability of Na(+) to regulate receptor activation. The homology model is used to explain this result as well as to identify a mechanism through which S431 may regulate receptor signaling. Taken together, these studies provide novel insights into the mechanism of LH/hCG receptor activation. 	Biochemistry	D003160 D016428 D013487
18521620	20080604	Plk1 regulates mitotic Aurora A function through betaTrCP-dependent degradation of hBora.	Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and Aurora A play key roles in centrosome maturation, spindle assembly, and chromosome segregation during cell division. Here we show that the functions of these kinases during early mitosis are coordinated through Bora, a partner of Aurora A first identified in Drosophila. Depletion of human Bora (hBora) results in spindle defects, accompanied by increased spindle recruitment of Aurora A and its partner TPX2. Conversely, hBora overexpression induces mislocalization of Aurora A and monopolar spindle formation, reminiscent of the phenotype seen in Plk1-depleted cells. Indeed, Plk1 regulates hBora. Following Cdk1-dependent recruitment, Plk1 triggers hBora destruction by phosphorylating a recognition site for SCF(Beta-TrCP). Plk1 depletion or inhibition results in a massive accumulation of hBora, concomitant with displacement of Aurora A from spindle poles and impaired centrosome maturation, but remarkably, co-depletion of hBora partially restores Aurora A localization and bipolar spindle formation. This suggests that Plk1 controls Aurora A localization and function by regulating cellular levels of hBora. 	Chromosoma	D016428 D013485
22553361	20120504	The histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation pathway is regulated by target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling and functions directly in ribosomal RNA biogenesis.	Epigenetic changes in chromatin through histone post-translational modifications are essential for altering gene transcription in response to environmental cues. How histone modifications are regulated by environmental stimuli remains poorly understood yet this process is critical for delineating how epigenetic pathways are influenced by the cellular environment. We have used the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway, which transmits environmental nutrient signals to control cell growth, as a model to delineate mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. A chemical genomics screen using the TOR inhibitor rapamycin against a histone H3/H4 mutant library identified histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation (H3K56ac) as a chromatin modification regulated by TOR signaling. We demonstrate this acetylation pathway functions in TOR-dependent cell growth in part by contributing directly to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis. Specifically, H3K56ac creates a chromatin environment permissive to RNA polymerase I transcription and nascent rRNA processing by regulating binding of the high mobility group protein Hmo1 and the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) processome complex. Overall, these studies identify a novel chromatin regulatory role for TOR signaling and support a specific function for H3K56ac in ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene transcription and nascent rRNA processing essential for cell growth.

24762672	20140426	Associations of lipoprotein lipase gene rs326 with changes of lipid profiles after a high-carbohydrate and low-fat diet in healthy Chinese Han youth.	To investigate the effects of a high-carbohydrate and low-fat (HC/LF) diet on plasma lipids and apolipoproteins (Apos) of healthy Chinese Han youth with different genotypes of lipoprotein lipase gene (LPL) rs326, 56 subjects were given a washout diet of 30.1% fat and 54.1% carbohydrate for seven days, followed by the HC/LF diet of 13.8% fat and 70.1% carbohydrate for six days, with no total energy restriction. Plasma glucose, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), Apo B-100 and Apo A-I were analyzed at baseline and before and after the HC/LF diet. The results show that, when compared with before the HC/LF diet, only the male G carriers experienced increased HDL-C (p = 0.008) and Apo A-I (p = 0.005) after the HC/LF diet. Decreased TC in both males and females and increased TG in females were found regardless of the genotype after the HC/LF diet. LDL-C decreased in all the subjects although the decrease was not significant in the female G carriers. These results demonstrate that the G allele of LPL rs326 associates with the elevated levels of HDL-C and Apo A-I after the HC/LF diet in males of the healthy Chinese Han Youth.

1159355	19750801	Patterns of activity in the antennular motoneurones of the hermit crab Pagurus alaskensis (Benedict).	1. Using electromyogram recordings from the antennular muscles of intact animals and recordings from the antennular nerves of partially dissected preparations, the patterns of activity in specific antennular motoneurones have been described during antennular flicking and antennular withdrawal. 2. The slow extensor motoneurone A30S is active during flicking in addition to the phasic component of the antennular motor system (A30F, A31F and A32F). 3. The flexion phase of a flick is the result of a burst of variable duration and number of spikes within flexor motoneurones A31F and A32F. 4. The extension phase of a flick is the result of a burst of variable duration and number of spikes in extensor motoneurones A30F and A30S. 5. Extension-withdrawal and slow flexion-withdrawal reflexes, tonic flexion withdrawal and maintained flexion at the MS-DS joint usually result from activity in part of the tonic component of the antennular motor system:moto-neurones A30S, A31S and A32S. 6. Fast flexion-withdrawal reflexes result from a burst of spikes in motoneurone A31F-S which constitutes the phaso-tonic component of the antennular motor system. 7. During high-frequency activity (15-60/sec), reciprocity exists between the slow flexor motoneurones A31S and A32S and slow extensor motoneurone A30S. 	J._Exp._Biol.	D016428
10323345	19990514	Identification, sequencing and serology of HLA-B*3527.	We describe a variant HLA-B*35 allele (B*3527) that was detected by the polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) in an individual on the Welsh Bone Marrow Donor registry. B*3527 differs from B*3501 by a single base (G/A) at position 302 that encodes an amino acid change of Ser to Asn at position 77 in the Bw6 epitope. Serological studies using 38 B35-, 4 Bw6- and 7 Bw4-reactive sera indicated that the B*3527 product was indistinguishable from the B35 specificity, and that the substitution did not significantly affect the Bw6 epitope. A family study determined the B*3527 bearing haplotype as: HLA-A*29, B*3527, Cw*0401, DRB1*0404, DRB4*0101/0103, DQA1*03, DQB1*0302, BFS, C4A3, C4B1.

21931645	20110921	An exhaustive, non-euclidean, non-parametric data mining tool for unraveling the complexity of biological systems--novel insights into malaria.	Complex, high-dimensional data sets pose significant analytical challenges in the post-genomic era. Such data sets are not exclusive to genetic analyses and are also pertinent to epidemiology. There has been considerable effort to develop hypothesis-free data mining and machine learning methodologies. However, current methodologies lack exhaustivity and general applicability. Here we use a novel non-parametric, non-euclidean data mining tool, HyperCube?, to explore exhaustively a complex epidemiological malaria data set by searching for over density of events in m-dimensional space. Hotspots of over density correspond to strings of variables, rules, that determine, in this case, the occurrence of Plasmodium falciparum clinical malaria episodes. The data set contained 46,837 outcome events from 1,653 individuals and 34 explanatory variables. The best predictive rule contained 1,689 events from 148 individuals and was defined as: individuals present during 1992-2003, aged 1-5 years old, having hemoglobin AA, and having had previous Plasmodium malariae malaria parasite infection ?10 times. These individuals had 3.71 times more P. falciparum clinical malaria episodes than the general population. We validated the rule in two different cohorts. We compared and contrasted the HyperCube? rule with the rules using variables identified by both traditional statistical methods and non-parametric regression tree methods. In addition, we tried all possible sub-stratified quantitative variables. No other model with equal or greater representativity gave a higher Relative Risk. Although three of the four variables in the rule were intuitive, the effect of number of P. malariae episodes was not. HyperCube? efficiently sub-stratified quantitative variables to optimize the rule and was able to identify interactions among the variables, tasks not easy to perform using standard data mining methods. Search of local over density in m-dimensional space, explained by easily interpretable rules, is thus seemingly ideal for generating hypotheses for large datasets to unravel the complexity inherent in biological systems.

24377541	20140101	Role of MYH polymorphisms in sporadic colorectal cancer in China: a case-control, population-based study.	Biallelic germline variants of the 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OG) repair gene MYH have been associated with colorectal neoplasms that display somatic G:C?T:A transversions. However, the effect of single germline variants has not been widely studied, prompting the present investigation of monoallelic MYH variants and susceptibility to sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) in a Chinese population. Between January 2006 and December 2012, 400 cases of sporadic CRC and 600 age- and sex-matched normal blood donors were screened randomly for 7 potentially pathogenic germline MYH exons using genetic testing technology. Variants of heterozygosity at the MYH locus were assessed in both sporadic cancer patients and healthy controls. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine risk factors for cancer onset. Five monoallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the 7 exon regions of MYH, which were detected in 75 (18.75%) of 400 CRC patients as well as 42 (7%) of 600 normal controls. The region of exon 1 proved to be a linked polymorphic region for the first time, a triple linked variant including exon 1-316 G?A, exon 1-292 G?A and intron 1+11 C?T, being identified in 13 CRC patients and 2 normal blood donors. A variant of base replacement, intron 10-2 A?G, was identified in the exon 10 region in 21 cases and 7 controls, while a similar type of variant in the exon 13 region, intron 13+12 C?T, was identified in 8 cases and 6 controls. Not the only but a newly missense variant in the present study, p. V463E (Exon 14+74 T?A), was identified in exon 14 in 6 patients and 1 normal control. In exon 16, nt. 1678-80 del GTT with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was identified in 27 CRC cases and 26 controls. There was no Y165C in exon 7 or G382D in exon 14, the hot- spot variants which have been reported most frequently in Caucasian studies. After univariate analysis and multivariate analysis, the linked variant in exon 1 region (p=0.002), intron 10-2 A?G (p=0.004) and p. V463E (p=0.036) in the MYH gene were selected as 3 independent risk factors for CRC. According to these results, the linked variant in Exon 1 region, Intron 10-2 A?G of base replacement and p. V463E of missense variant, the 3 heterozygosity variants of MYH gene in a Chinese population, may relate to the susceptibility to sporadic CRC. Lack of the hot-spot variants of Caucasians in the present study may due to the ethnic difference in MYH gene. 	Asian_Pac._J._Cancer_Prev.	D016428 D013485
25204677	20140911	Genome-wide screening identifies new genes required for stress-induced phase 2 detoxification gene expression in animals.	Phase 2 detoxification enzymes provide a vital defence against reactive oxygen species, including xenobiotic metabolites, which cause the oxidative damage involved in drug toxicity and many diseases. Hence, there is great interest in understanding how levels of these enzymes are regulated. CnC transcription factors, such as mammalian Nrf2, drive the expression of phase 2 enzymes and are activated as an important conserved response to oxidative stress and xenobiotics. For instance, the Caenorhabditis elegans Nrf2 orthologue, SKN-1, is activated in response to arsenite by the stress-activated p38-related kinase, PMK-1, leading to increased expression of phase 2 enzymes. Here we have used a genome-wide screening approach to identify other C. elegans genes that are required for stress-induced increases in phase 2 detoxification gene expression. Taking advantage of the elevated phase 2 gene expression in a mutant lacking the peroxidase PRDX-2, we have identified many new genes that are required for stress-induced expression of gcs-1, a phase 2 enzyme critically required for glutathione synthesis. Significantly, these include genes previously implicated in resistance to ionizing radiation, longevity and responses to pathogenic infection. Many of these new candidate activators of gcs-1 are also required for the stress-induced intestinal expression of other phase 2 genes. However, intriguingly, our data suggest other factors may be specifically required for the stress-induced expression of gcs-1. Notably, we demonstrate that the candidate activator TIR-1(SARM1) and the MAPKKK NSY-1(Ask1) are required for the arsenite-induced activation of PMK-1. However, our data suggest that the majority of candidates participate in novel mechanisms to promote gcs-1 expression. For example, the E4 ubiquitin ligase UFD-2(UBE4B) is dispensable for PMK-1 activation but important for maintaining nuclear levels of SKN-1, the stress-induced expression of multiple SKN-1-target genes and oxidative stress resistance. Here we present the first functional, genome-wide analysis identifying genes that are required for activation of phase 2 detoxification genes in an animal. Our study identifies potential new regulators of Nrf2, reveals that additional mechanisms promote the stress-induced expression of specific phase 2 detoxification genes and provides new insight into the relationships between these universally important stress defences, oxidative stress resistance and aging.

7774669	19950215	The function of a highly-conserved arginine residue in activation of the muscarinic M1 receptor.	Arg123 in the rat muscarinic M1 receptor is part of the highly conserved triad Asp-Arg-Tyr found at the junction of transmembrane helix 3 with the second intracellular loop. Mutation of Arg123 to Lys, Ala, Leu, Glu and Gln had no effect on levels of receptor expression in COS-7 cells, or on affinities for the antagonist N-methylscopolamine. Acetylcholine stimulation of the Lys123 receptor evoked the same maximum phosphoinositide response as the wild type, although the potency was reduced six-fold, but mutation to other residues strongly disrupted receptor function. Mutation of Arg123 always decreased the ratio of the high affinity to the low affinity agonist binding constant, but the absolute effect on the latter varied from a 4-fold increase for the Lys123 to a small decrease for the Leu123 mutation. These results suggest that a positive charge at position 123 is central to the activation of G-proteins by the muscarinic M1 receptor. 	Eur._J._Pharmacol.	D016428 D013485
18556755	20080617	Cis-regulatory modules in the mammalian liver: composition depends on strength of Foxa2 consensus site.	Foxa2 is a critical transcription factor that controls liver development and plays an important role in hepatic gluconeogensis in adult mice. Here, we use genome-wide location analysis for Foxa2 to identify its targets in the adult liver. We then show by computational analyses that Foxa2 containing cis-regulatory modules are not constructed from a random assortment of binding sites for other transcription factors expressed in the liver, but rather that their composition depends on the strength of the Foxa2 consensus site present. Genes containing a cis-regulatory module with a medium or weak Foxa2 consensus site are much more liver-specific than the genes with a strong consensus site. We not only provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of Foxa2 regulation but also introduce a novel method for identification of different cis-regulatory modules involving a single factor.

Comparisons, with non parametric Kruskal-Wallis' analysis, were done. NDC participants presented more intrusive errors than ANC group in the first and second trials and in the delay recall of the memory task; also they had more intrusive errors than the DC patients in intrusive errors of the first trial and delay recall of the same task. The ANC and DC groups had significantly more intrusions only in third trial. Intrusive errors could be considered as a cognitive preclinical marker for familial AD. 	Rev_Neurol	D004740 D016428

A wide range of responses of patients with CPCML to IM has been reported. Several factors were proposed to predict response including molecular response at 3 and 6 months. To study the impact of pretreatment BCR-ABL transcript level on molecular response to IM, and to assess the value of the milestone ; ?10% transcript at 3 months on PFS and OS. Fifty five adult CP-CML patients receiving daily dose of 400 mg IM were subjected to molecular and cytogenetic analysis at diagnosis and at regular time intervals. Median follow up period was 36 months (15-48). Hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses were rated according to ELN. Two Patient groups were distinguished regarding response to IM therapy. A group of 22/55 patients (40%) having pretreatment BCR-ABL(IS) level ?200% and a second patient group 33/55 (60%) having transcript level &gt;200%. The ?10% milestone was achieved by 15/22 patients (68%) versus 7/33 patients (21%), p=0.04 in favor of the first group. Optimal responders in first group were 14/22 (64%) compared to 13/33 (39%) in second group, p=0.02. Achievement of 10% transcript level significantly correlated with longer PFS. The median BCR-ABL(IS) transcripts levels in optimal responders at 3, 6 and 18 months was 10%, 2% and 0.1%, respectively compared to 100%, 65% and 10%, in suboptimal/resistant patients p=0.001. Resistance in 11 patients was correlated with identifiable ABL Kinase mutations. The Pretreatment 200% cutoff and the 3 month BCR-ABL(IS) ?10% transcript levels proved strong predictors of response to IM and significantly correlated with probability of CCyR, MMR and PFS.

20426823	20100430	HIV-1 recombinants with multiple parental strains in low-prevalence, remote regions of Cameroon: evolutionary relics?	The HIV pandemic disseminated globally from Central West Africa, beginning in the second half of the twentieth century. To elucidate the virologic origins of the pandemic, a cross-sectional study was conducted of the genetic diversity of HIV-1 strains in villagers in 14 remote locations in Cameroon and in hospitalized and STI patients. DNA extracted from PBMC was PCR amplified from HIV(+) subjects. Partial pol amplicons (N = 164) and nearly full virus genomes (N = 78) were sequenced. Among the 3956 rural villagers studied, the prevalence of HIV infection was 4.9%; among the hospitalized and clinic patients, it was 8.6%. Virus genotypes fell into two distinctive groups. A majority of the genotyped strains (109/164) were the circulating recombinant form (CRF) known to be endemic in West Africa and Central West Africa, CRF02_AG. The second most common genetic form (9/164) was the recently described CRF22_01A1, and the rest were a collection of 4 different subtypes (A2, D, F2, G) and 6 different CRFs (-01, -11, -13, -18, -25, -37). Remarkably, 10.4% of HIV-1 genomes detected (17/164) were heretofore undescribed unique recombinant forms (URF) present in only a single person. Nearly full genome sequencing was completed for 78 of the viruses of interest. HIV genetic diversity was commonplace in rural villages: 12 villages each had at least one newly detected URF, and 9 villages had two or more. These results show that while CRF02_AG dominated the HIV strains in the rural villages, the remainder of the viruses had tremendous genetic diversity. Between the trans-species transmission of SIVcpz and the dispersal of pandemic HIV-1, there was a time when we hypothesize that nascent HIV-1 was spreading, but only to a limited extent, recombining with other local HIV-1, creating a large variety of recombinants. When one of those recombinants began to spread widely (i.e. became epidemic), it was recognized as a subtype. We hypothesize that the viruses in these remote Cameroon villages may represent that pre-epidemic stage of viral evolution. 	Retrovirology	D016428 D052061 D013485
11181701	20010222	Activation of the COOH-terminal Src kinase (Csk) by cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibits signaling through the T cell receptor.	In T cells, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) type I colocalizes with the T cell receptor-CD3 complex (TCR/CD3) and inhibits T cell function via a previously unknown proximal target. Here we examine the mechanism for this PKA-mediated immunomodulation. cAMP treatment of Jurkat and normal T cells reduces Lck-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the TCR/CD3 zeta chain after T cell activation, and decreases Lck activity. Phosphorylation of residue Y505 in Lck by COOH-terminal Src kinase (Csk), which negatively regulates Lck, is essential for the inhibitory effect of cAMP on zeta chain phosphorylation. PKA phosphorylates Csk at S364 in vitro and in vivo leading to a two- to fourfold increase in Csk activity that is necessary for cAMP-mediated inhibition of TCR-induced interleukin 2 secretion. Both PKA type I and Csk are targeted to lipid rafts where proximal T cell activation occurs, and phosphorylation of raft-associated Lck by Csk is increased in cells treated with forskolin. We propose a mechanism whereby PKA through activation of Csk intersects signaling by Src kinases and inhibits T cell activation. 	J._Exp._Med.	D016428 D013485 D013487
21204229	20110105	A novel homozygous COL11A2 deletion causes a C-terminal protein truncation with incomplete mRNA decay in a Turkish patient.	Recessive mutations in COL11A2 (collagen, type XI, alpha 2), are responsible for otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED) and non-syndromic hearing loss while dominant mutations are associated with Stickler type III, isolated cleft palate, Robin sequence, non-ophthalmic Stickler syndrome, early onset osteoarthritis and autosomal dominant hearing loss. We describe here the clinical findings of two Turkish cousins with OSMED carrying a novel homozygous truncating mutation in exon 38 of COL11A2 gene, c.2763delT, identified on cDNA and confirmed at gDNA. This mutation is located on triple helix repeat domain of the collagen alpha-2(XI) chain, where the majority of the previously identified mutations are located. Real-time RT-PCR experiment provided that mutated transcript does not decay completely. Although our analysis displays the partial survival of the mutant transcript from blood tissue, not from cartilage, we propose that this mechanism may play an important role on the variable expressivity of the heterozygous COL11A2 gene mutations.

25402841	20141118	Crystal structure of Bacillus anthracis virulence regulator AtxA and effects of phosphorylated histidines on multimerization and activity.	The Bacillus anthracis virulence regulator AtxA controls transcription of the anthrax toxin genes and capsule biosynthetic operon. AtxA activity is elevated during growth in media containing glucose and CO(2)/bicarbonate, and there is a positive correlation between the CO(2)/bicarbonate signal, AtxA activity and homomultimerization. AtxA activity is also affected by phosphorylation at specific histidines. We show that AtxA crystallizes as a dimer. Distinct folds associated with predicted DNA-binding domains (HTH1 and HTH2) and phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system-regulated domains (PRD1 and PRD2) are apparent. We tested AtxA variants containing single and double phosphomimetic (His?Asp) and phosphoablative (His?Ala) amino acid changes for activity in B.?anthracis cultures and for protein-protein interactions in cell lysates. Reduced activity of AtxA H199A, lack of multimerization and activity of AtxAH379D variants, and predicted structural changes associated with phosphorylation support a model for control of AtxA function. We propose that (i) in the AtxA dimer, phosphorylation of H199 in PRD1 affects HTH2 positioning, influencing DNA-binding; and (ii) phosphorylation of H379 in PRD2 disrupts dimer formation. The AtxA structure is the first reported high-resolution full-length structure of a PRD-containing regulator, and can serve as a model for proteins of this family, especially those that link virulence to bacterial metabolism.

24952589	20140623	Efficient search, mapping, and optimization of multi-protein genetic systems in diverse bacteria.	Developing predictive models of multi-protein genetic systems to understand and optimize their behavior remains a combinatorial challenge, particularly when measurement throughput is limited. We developed a computational approach to build predictive models and identify optimal sequences and expression levels, while circumventing combinatorial explosion. Maximally informative genetic system variants were first designed by the RBS Library Calculator, an algorithm to design sequences for efficiently searching a multi-protein expression space across a &gt;?10,000-fold range with tailored search parameters and well-predicted translation rates. We validated the algorithm's predictions by characterizing 646 genetic system variants, encoded in plasmids and genomes, expressed in six gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial hosts. We then combined the search algorithm with system-level kinetic modeling, requiring the construction and characterization of 73 variants to build a sequence-expression-activity map (SEAMAP) for a biosynthesis pathway. Using model predictions, we designed and characterized 47 additional pathway variants to navigate its activity space, find optimal expression regions with desired activity response curves, and relieve rate-limiting steps in metabolism. Creating sequence-expression-activity maps accelerates the optimization of many protein systems and allows previous measurements to quantitatively inform future designs. 	Mol._Syst._Biol.

18271955	20080215	Zosuquidar restores drug sensitivity in P-glycoprotein expressing acute myeloid leukemia (AML).	Chemotherapeutic drug efflux via the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter encoded by the MDR1/ABCB1 gene is a significant cause of drug resistance in numerous malignancies, including acute leukemias, especially in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Therefore, the P-gp modulators that block P-gp-mediated drug efflux have been developed, and used in combination with standard chemotherapy. In this paper, the capacity of zosuquidar, a specific P-gp modulator, to reverse chemoresistance was examined in both leukemia cell lines and primary AML blasts. The transporter protein expressions were analyzed by flow cytometry using their specific antibodies. The protein functionalities were assessed by the uptake of their fluorescence substrates in presence or absence their specific modulators. The drug cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT test. Zosuquidar completely or partially restored drug sensitivity in all P-gp-expressing leukemia cell lines tested and enhanced the cytotoxicity of anthracyclines (daunorubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantrone) and gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) in primary AML blasts with active P-gp. In addition, P-gp inhibition by zosuquidar was found to be more potent than cyclosporine A in cells with highly active P-gp. These in vitro studies suggest that zosuquidar may be an effective adjunct to cytotoxic chemotherapy for AML patients whose blasts express P-gp, especially for older patients.

27355965	20160630	Epithelial Intermediate Filaments: Guardians against Microbial Infection?	Intermediate filaments are abundant cytoskeletal components of epithelial tissues. They have been implicated in overall stress protection. A hitherto poorly investigated area of research is the function of intermediate filaments as a barrier to microbial infection. This review summarizes the accumulating knowledge about this interaction. It first emphasizes the unique spatial organization of the keratin intermediate filament cytoskeleton in different epithelial tissues to protect the organism against microbial insults. We then present examples of direct interaction between viral, bacterial, and parasitic proteins and the intermediate filament system and describe how this affects the microbe-host interaction by modulating the epithelial cytoskeleton, the progression of infection, and host response. These observations not only provide novel insights into the dynamics and function of intermediate filaments but also indicate future avenues to combat microbial infection. 	Cells	D016428 D016454
8625469	19960401	Mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene in rat esophageal papillomas induced by N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine.	Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of human neoplasms. The location and types of p53 gene mutation can reflect exposure of humans to certain types carcinogenic agents. Much less is known about the role of p53 mutational inactivation in rodent tumors. Using both 'Hot' (radioactive) and 'Cold' (non-radioactive) single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analyses, the present study of analyzed exons 5-8 and the exon-intron junction of the p53 gene from rat esophageal papillomas induces by N- nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA) for mutations. Nine of 30 (30%) esophageal papillomas contained SSCP mobility shifts, principally within exons 5 and 7. These positive SSCP findings were further validated by direct DNA sequencing analysis. Eight of the nine mutations were G:C--&gt;A:T transitions in codons 131, 149, 153, 242 (2), 243, 248, and the 5 end of intron 7. None of these G:C--&gt;A:T mutations occurred at the CpG sites. The other mutation was a frameshift mutation in codon 176. The G:C-A:T transitions observed in this study are consistent with the documented formation of O(6)-methylguanine adducts in DNA N-nitroso compounds. These results suggest that point mutations of the p53 gene are involved in the development of approximately one-third of NMBA-induced rat esophageal papillomas. 'Hot' and 'Cold' SSCP methods were equally sensitive for the identification of mutations in the rat p53 gene. 	Carcinogenesis	D016428
16109423	20050820	Structural snapshots of MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase along the reaction coordinate provide insights into enzyme and nucleoside flexibility during catalysis.	MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase (MTAN) irreversibly hydrolyzes the N9-C1' bond in the nucleosides, 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) to form adenine and the corresponding thioribose. MTAN plays a vital role in metabolic pathways involving methionine recycling, biological methylation, polyamine biosynthesis, and quorum sensing. Crystal structures of a wild-type (WT) MTAN complexed with glycerol, and mutant-enzyme and mutant-product complexes have been determined at 2.0A, 2.0A, and 2.1A resolution, respectively. The WT MTAN-glycerol structure provides a purine-free model and in combination with the previously solved thioribose-free MTAN-ADE structure, we now have separate apo structures for both MTAN binding subsites. The purine and thioribose-free states reveal an extensive enzyme-immobilized water network in their respective binding subsites. The Asp197Asn MTAN-MTA and Glu12Gln MTAN-MTR.ADE structures are the first enzyme-substrate and enzyme-product complexes reported for MTAN, respectively. These structures provide representative snapshots along the reaction coordinate and allow insight into the conformational changes of the enzyme and the nucleoside substrate. A &quot;catalytic movie&quot; detailing substrate binding, catalysis, and product release is presented. 	J._Mol._Biol.	D016428 D013485 D013486
26339417	20150905	Variants of human papillomavirus type 16 predispose toward persistent infection.	A cohort study of 292 Chinese women was conducted to determine the relationship between human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 variants and persistent viral infection. Enrolled patients were HPV16 positive and had both normal cytology and histology. Flow-through hybridization and gene chip technology was used to identify the HPV type. A PCR sequencing assay was performed to find HPV16 E2, E6 and E7 gene variants. The associations between these variants and HPV16 persistent infection was analyzed by Fisher's exact test. It was found that the variants T178G, T350G and A442C in the E6 gene, as well as C3158A and G3248A variants in the E2 gene were associated with persistent HPV16 infection. No link was observed between E7 variants and persistent viral infection. Our findings suggest that detection of specific HPV variants would help identify patients who are at high risk for viral persistence and development of cervical neoplasia.

12956767	20030906	Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor in young patients with myocardial infarction and its relationship with the fibrinolytic function and the protein C system.	Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a fibrinolytic inhibitor. Studies in coronary artery disease have reported increased TAFI activity (TAFI Act) and low TAFI antigen (TAFI Ag) levels. This controversy might be explained by the polymorphisms of its gene. Only the Thr325Ile polymorphism modulates both TAFI Ag and Act levels in vitro. This study assessed TAFI Ag and Act levels, TAFI Thr325Ile polymorphism, the fibrinolytic and protein C systems and some prothrombotic mutations in a young patient group (n = 127, aged &lt; 51 years, with myocardial infarction) and a control group (n = 99) with similar characteristics. Patients exhibited hypofibrinolysis and higher plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels. Although TAFI Ag was lower, TAFI Act level was significantly higher in patients and positively correlated with PAI-1, protein C inhibitor and the euglobulin lysis time. No differences between groups were found according to the Thr325Ile polymorphism. Irrespective of the genotype, patients had higher TAFI Act levels. The Ile-325 variant exhibited lower TAFI Ag levels. We suggest that the hypofibrinolysis observed in these patients results from an increase in both PAI-1 and TAFI Act, which is not related to the Thr325Ile polymorphism. Patients have high TAFI Act with low TAFI Ag levels, probably because of an increased stability of TAFI related to a fibrinolytic hypofunction. 	Br._J._Haematol.	D016428 D013485
26005655	20150526	The TP53 Codon 72 Polymorphism and Risk of Sporadic Prostate Cancer among Iranian Patients.	The TP53 gene is one of the most frequently mutated genes amongst human malignancies, particularly TP53 codon 72 polymorphism. Furthermore, an association between the TP53 codon 72 variants and prostate cancer has been reported in several studies. Although some studies have indicated an association between the TP53 Arg/Arg variant and an increased risk for prostate cancer, other studies have shown a positive correlation between the TP53 Pro/Pro genotype instead. Therefore, to clarify if this polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer in Iranian men, we conducted a case-control study of 40 sporadic prostate cancer patients and 80 benign prostate hyperplasia cases. The TP53 codon 72 was genotyped using an allele specific PCR. A significant association between the TP53 codon 72 genotype and prostate cancer risk was found (OR = 6.8, 95% CI = [1.8-25.1], P = 0.005). However, the results of this study did not support an association between age, the Gleason score nor TP53 genotype at codon 72 in prostate cancer patients. TP53 codon 72 polymorphism may have a great impact in the development of prostate cancer. 	Iran._J._Public_Health	D016428
15688029	20050203	G125A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the human BAX promoter affects gene expression.	Earlier we had reported a guanine to adenosine substitution at position 125 (G125A) in the BAX promoter, and its association with higher stage of the disease and failure to achieve complete response to treatment in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that G125A leads to a reduction in the transcription of the BAX gene and that this is a direct cause of altered BAX mRNA and protein expression. In lymphocytes of CLL patients, BAX mRNA expression was determined by RNase protection assay and Bax protein was detected by immunoblotting. The presence of G125A in the BAX promoter was associated with lower BAX mRNA (P=0.004) and protein (P=0.024) levels. In transient expression assays using wild-type and mutant BAX promoter sequences linked to Luciferase as a reporter, the G125A polymorphism reduced expression of the BAX promoter by 2.6-fold. These studies suggest a mechanism for the biological effect of the G125A. 	Oncogene	D016428
26436105	20151006	Validation of a semiconductor next-generation sequencing assay for the clinical genetic screening of CFTR.	Genetic testing for cystic fibrosis and CFTR-related disorders mostly relies on laborious molecular tools that use Sanger sequencing to scan for mutations in the CFTR gene. We have explored a more efficient genetic screening strategy based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the CFTR gene. We validated this approach in a cohort of 177 patients with previously known CFTR mutations and polymorphisms. Genomic DNA was amplified using the Ion AmpliSeq? CFTR panel. The DNA libraries were pooled, barcoded, and sequenced using an Ion Torrent PGM sequencer. The combination of different robust bioinformatics tools allowed us to detect previously known pathogenic mutations and polymorphisms in the 177 samples, without detecting spurious pathogenic calls. In summary, the assay achieves a sensitivity of 94.45% (95% CI: 92% to 96.9%), with a specificity of detecting nonvariant sites from the CFTR reference sequence of 100% (95% CI: 100% to 100%), a positive predictive value of 100% (95% CI: 100% to 100%), and a negative predictive value of 99.99% (95% CI: 99.99% to 100%). In addition, we describe the observed allelic frequencies of 94 unique definitely and likely pathogenic, uncertain, and neutral CFTR variants, some of them not previously annotated in the public databases. Strikingly, a seven exon spanning deletion as well as several more technically challenging variants such as pathogenic poly-thymidine-guanine and poly-thymidine (poly-TG-T) tracts were also detected. Targeted NGS is ready to substitute classical molecular methods to perform genetic testing on the CFTR gene. 	Mol_Genet_Genomic_Med	D016428
23578383	20130413	Oxidative stress induced by inactivation of TP53INP1 cooperates with KrasG12D to initiate and promote pancreatic carcinogenesis in the murine pancreas.	Tumor protein p53-induced nuclear protein 1 (TP53INP1) is involved in cell stress response. Its?expression is lost at the pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia 1b (PanIN1b)/PanIN2 stage of pancreatic carcinogenesis. Our objective was to determine whether TP53INP1 loss of expression contributes to pancreatic cancer formation in a conditional KrasG12D mouse model. We generated Kras-INP1KO mice using LSL-Kras(G12D/+);Pdx1-Cre(+/-) mice (Kras mice) and TP53INP1(-/-) mice. Analysis of pancreases during ageing shows that in the presence of activated Kras, TP53INP1 loss of expression accelerated PanIN formation and increased pancreatic injury and the number of high-grade lesions as compared with what occurs in Kras mice. Moreover, cystic lesions resembling intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) were observed as early as 2 months of age. Remarkably, TP53INP1 is down-regulated in human IPMN. Activation of the small GTPase Rac1 shows that more oxidative stress is generated in Kras-INP1KO than in Kras mice pancreas despite elevated levels of the Nrf2 antioxidant regulator. We firmly establish the link between Kras-INP1KO pancreatic phenotype and oxidative stress?with rescue of the phenotype by the antioxidant action of N-acetylcysteine. Our data provide in?vivo functional demonstration that TP53INP1 deficiency accelerates progression of pancreatic cancer, underlining its role in the occurrence of IPMN and highlighting the importance of TP53INP1 in the control of oxidative status during development of pancreatic cancer.

18524859	20080606	Cation transport activity of anion exchanger 1 mutations found in inherited distal renal tubular acidosis.	Anion exchanger 1 (AE1) is encoded by SLC4A1 and mediates electroneutral anion exchange across cell membranes. It is the most abundant protein in the red cell membrane, but it is also found in the basolateral membrane of renal alpha-intercalated cells, where it is required for normal urinary acidification. Recently, four point mutations in red cell AE1 have been described that convert the anion exchanger to a cation conductance. SLC4A1 mutations can also cause type 1 hypokalemic distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA). We investigated the properties of four dRTA-associated AE1 mutations (R589H, G609R, S613F, and G701D) by heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Although these AE1 mutants are functional anion exchangers, unlike the red cell disease mutants, we found that they also demonstrated a cation leak. We found a large cation leak in the G701D mutant. This mutant normally requires coexpression with glycophorin A for surface membrane expression in red blood cells and oocytes. However, we found that coexpressing wild-type kidney AE1 with G701D in oocytes still caused a cation leak, consistent with heterodimerized G701D reaching the cell membrane and retaining its cation conductance property. These findings have potential structural and functional implications for AE1, and they indicate that while anion exchange and cation conductance properties are distinct, they can coexist.

24036972	20130917	Structure and function of cytochrome P450S in insect adaptation to natural and synthetic toxins: insights gained from molecular modeling.	Over evolutionary time, insect herbivores have adapted to the presence of natural toxins and more recently to synthetic insecticides in or on the plants they consume. Biochemical analyses and molecular modeling of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) that metabolize these compounds have provided insight into the many variations affecting their catalytic activity. Phylogenetically distinct P450s may metabolize similar substrates, and phylogenetically similar P450s may metabolize different substrates; as well, some P450s process broad arrays of both phytochemicals and synthetic insecticides, while closely related P450s are restricted to a narrow range of phytochemicals. Mapped on the predicted three-dimensional structures of insect P450s developed from available mammalian P450 crystal structures, differences in multiple regions of the insect proteins reveal the evolutionary processes occurring as P450 genes have duplicated and diverged. Analyses of site-directed mutants in select lepidopteran and dipteran P450s demonstrate that slight changes in the catalytic site, the putative product release channel, and the proximal surface (interacting with electron transfer partners such as cytochrome P450 reductase and cytochrome b5) yield pronounced activity differences. Additionally, changes in the catalytic site and in the linker region preceding the proline-hinge influence P450 folding. With predicted structures available for many mammalian P450s involved in metabolism of xenobiotics, it is possible to record allelic variation relative to catalytically important regions in the overall P450 structure and to predict functionally critical differences. Together with information on the relative levels of allelic variant transcripts, comprehensive characterization of the mechanisms that modulate metabolism of natural and synthetic xenobiotics in insects can yield insights into plant-insect coevolution and into novel approaches for chemical pest management.

24312333	20131207	Enhanced reliability and accuracy for field deployable bioforensic detection and discrimination of Xylella fastidiosa subsp. pauca, causal agent of citrus variegated chlorosis using razor ex technology and TaqMan quantitative PCR.	A reliable, accurate and rapid multigene-based assay combining real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and a Razor Ex BioDetection System (Razor Ex) was validated for detection of Xylella fastidiosa subsp. pauca (Xfp, a xylem-limited bacterium that causes citrus variegated chlorosis [CVC]). CVC, which is exotic to the United States, has spread through South and Central America and could significantly impact U.S. citrus if it arrives. A method for early, accurate and sensitive detection of Xfp in plant tissues is needed by plant health officials for inspection of products from quarantined locations, and by extension specialists for detection, identification and management of disease outbreaks and reservoir hosts. Two sets of specific PCR primers and probes, targeting Xfp genes for fimbrillin and the periplasmic iron-binding protein were designed. A third pair of primers targeting the conserved cobalamin synthesis protein gene was designed to detect all possible X. fastidiosa (Xf) strains. All three primer sets detected as little as 1 fg of plasmid DNA carrying X. fastidiosa target sequences and genomic DNA of Xfp at as little as 1 - 10 fg. The use of Razor Ex facilitates a rapid (about 30 min) in-field assay capability for detection of all Xf strains, and for specific detection of Xfp. Combined use of three primer sets targeting different genes increased the assay accuracy and broadened the range of detection. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a field-deployable rapid and reliable bioforensic detection and discrimination method for a bacterial phytopathogen based on multigene targets.

23836506	20130710	Mutations in ? adducin are associated with inherited cerebral palsy.	Cerebral palsy is estimated to affect nearly 1 in 500 children, and although prenatal and perinatal contributors have been well characterized, at least 20% of cases are believed to be inherited. Previous studies have identified mutations in the actin-capping protein KANK1 and the adaptor protein-4 complex in forms of inherited cerebral palsy, suggesting a role for components of the dynamic cytoskeleton in the genesis of the disease. We studied a multiplex consanguineous Jordanian family by homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing, then used patient-derived fibroblasts to examine functional consequences of the mutation we identified in vitro. We subsequently studied the effects of adducin loss of function in Drosophila. We identified a homozygous c.1100G&gt;A (p.G367D) mutation in ADD3, encoding gamma adducin in all affected members of the index family. Follow-up experiments in patient fibroblasts found that the p.G367D mutation, which occurs within the putative oligomerization critical region, impairs the ability of gamma adducin to associate with the alpha subunit. This mutation impairs the normal actin-capping function of adducin, leading to both abnormal proliferation and migration in cultured patient fibroblasts. Loss of function studies of the Drosophila adducin ortholog hts confirmed a critical role for adducin in locomotion. Although likely a rare cause of cerebral palsy, our findings indicate a critical role for adducins in regulating the activity of the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting that impaired adducin function may lead to neuromotor impairment and further implicating abnormalities of the dynamic cytoskeleton as a pathogenic mechanism contributing to cerebral palsy.

18582360	20080628	Polymorphism patterns in Duffy-binding protein among Thai Plasmodium vivax isolates.	The Duffy-binding protein II of Plasmodium vivax (PvDBPII) has been considered as an attractive target for vaccine-mediated immunity despite a possible highly polymorphic nature. Among seven PvDBP domains, domain II has been shown to exhibit a high rate of nonsynonymous polymorphism, which has been suggested to be a potential immune (antibody binding) evasion mechanism. This study aimed to determine the extent of genetic polymorphisms and positive natural selection at domain II of the PvDBP gene among a sampling of Thai P. vivax isolates. The PvDBPII gene was PCR amplified and the patterns of polymorphisms were characterized from 30 Thai P. vivax isolates using DNA cloning and sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences and positive selection were done using DnaSP ver 4.0 and MEGA ver 4.0 packages. This study demonstrated a high rate of nonsynonymous polymorphism. Using Sal I as the reference strain, a total of 30 point-mutations were observed in the PvDBPII gene among the set of Thai P. vivax isolates, of which 25 nonsynonymous and five synonymous were found. The highest frequency of polymorphism was found in five variant amino acids (residues D384G, R390H, L424I, W437R, I503K) with the variant L424I having the highest frequency. The difference between the rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations estimated by the Nei and Gojobori's method suggested that PvDBPII antigen appears to be under selective pressure. Phylogenetic analysis of PvDBPII Thai P. vivax isolates to others found internationally demonstrated six distinct allele groups. Allele groups 4 and 6 were unique to Thailand. Polymorphisms within PvDBPII indicated that Thai vivax malaria parasites are genetically diverse. Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences using the Neighbour-Joining method demonstrated that Thai isolates shared distinct alleles with P. vivax isolates from different geographical areas. The study reported here will be valuable for the development of PvDBPII-based malaria vaccine. 	Malar._J.	D016428 D013486
21362313	20110303	A novel missense mutation of the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A gene in a patient with Angelman syndrome.	Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurogenetic disorder caused by an expression defect of the maternally inherited copy of ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) gene from chromosome 15. Although the most common genetic defects include maternal deletions of chromosome 15q11-13, paternal uniparental disomy and imprinting defect, mutations in the UBE3A gene have been identified in approximately 10% of AS patients. A Chinese girl of 28 months presented clinical manifestation of AS. Genetic diagnosis and molecular genetic defects were studied by methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) and linkage analysis by short tandem repeat (STR). We further performed sequence analysis of all the coding exons and flanking sequences of the UBE3A gene. The novel mutation screening was also performed in 100 unrelated healthy individuals to exclude the possibility of identifying a polymorphism variation. The MS-PCR analysis of the patient showed biparental inheritance of chromosome 15 with a normal methylation pattern in the 15q11-q13 region. And STR analysis revealed that the patient also inherited biparental alleles for six microsatellites. A novel mutation, cDNA1199 C&gt; A (p.P400H), in exon 9 of the maternal UBE3A gene, was identified in the patient. Meanwhile, the mutation was observed in the patient's mother who had a normal phenotype. It is necessary to perform the UBE3A gene mutation analysis in non-deletion/non-UPD/non-ID patients with AS. The clinical picture of the patient is concordant with that observed in previously reported AS patients with UBE3A mutation. 	Chin._Med._J.	D016428
8934899	19960401	Isolation, phenotypic characterization, and phylogenetic position of a novel, facultatively autotrophic, moderately thermophilic bacterium, Thiobacillus thermosulfatus sp. nov.	Thiobacillus thermosulfatus ATCC 51520T (T = type strain) was isolated from sewage sludge samples enriched with elemental sulfur. The cells of this organism were gram negative, rod shaped, motile, facultatively autotrophic, and strictly aerobic and contained polyphosphate inclusions and polyhedral bodies. During growth on thiosulfate, the following intermediates were produced: tetrathionate, trithionate, and sulfate, and the pH was lowered from neutrality to around 2.5. Autotrophic growth was observed at pH values between 4.3 and 7.8 and at temperatures of 34 to 65 degrees C; optimum growth occurred at pH 5.2 to 5.6 and 50 to 52.5 degrees C. Ubiquinone Q8 was present in the respiratory chain. The DNA contained 61 +/- 1 mol% G+C. No denitrification was observed under autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions. The cells produced a glycocalyx during growth in the presence of S0. As determined by a 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, T. thermosulfatus is a distinct species that belongs to the beta subdivision of the Proteobacteria and is closely related phylogenetically to Thiobacillus perometabolis. The GenBank accession number for the complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of T. thermosulfatus is U27839. 	Int._J._Syst._Bacteriol.	D016428 D013485
2808403	19891115	Hormonal regulation of male-specific rat hepatic cytochrome P-450g (P-450IIC13) by androgens and the pituitary.	The present study examines the hormonal regulation male-specific cytochrome P-450g (IIC13) and its mRNA. Neonatal gonadectomy of male rats abolished hepatic expression of P-450g and its mRNA in adulthood, while ovariectomy had little effect. Neonatal administration of testosterone to neonatally gonadectomized male or female rats partially masculinized expression of P-450g and its mRNA, and postpubertal administration of testosterone (testosterone capsules implanted at 5 weeks) completely masculinized their expression. However, castration of male rats at puberty (5 weeks) had no effect on P-450g or its mRNA at 10 weeks. Male-specific development of P-450g and P-450 M-1 (IIC11) mRNA were imprinted similarly by testosterone. However, hypophysectomy experiments demonstrated that the two male-specific forms of P-450 are regulated quite differently. Hypophysectomy of male rats decreased hepatic content of P-450 M-1 mRNA by approximately 50%, and intermittent injections of growth hormone completely restored this mRNA. In contrast, hypophysectomy of male rats increased P-450g and its mRNA by approximately 50%, while intermittent injections of growth hormone produced a slight decrease. Hypophysectomy of female rats increased P-450g and its mRNA to adult male levels, but produced only a small increase in P-450 M-1 mRNA. Continuous infusion of growth hormone into sham hypophysectomized male rats (to mimic the female growth hormone pattern) resulted in a complete loss of P-450g and its mRNA. These results indicate that the expression of P-450g is not dependent on the male pulsatile growth hormone pattern, but suggest instead that the continuous secretion of growth hormone suppresses P-450g in the female rat.

21348941	20110226	Alizarine derivatives as new dual inhibitors of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase-associated DNA polymerase and RNase H activities effective also on the RNase H activity of non-nucleoside resistant reverse transcriptases.	HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) has two associated activities, DNA polymerase and RNase H, both essential for viral replication and validated drug targets. Although all RT inhibitors approved for therapy target DNA polymerase activity, the search for new RT inhibitors that target the RNase H function and are possibly active on RTs resistant to the known non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNRTI) is a viable approach for anti-HIV drug development. In this study, several alizarine derivatives were synthesized and tested for both HIV-1 RT-associated activities. Alizarine analogues K-49 and KNA-53 showed IC(50) values for both RT-associated functions of ? 10 ?m. When tested on the K103N RT, both derivatives inhibited the RT-associated functions equally, whereas when tested on the Y181C RT, KNA-53 inhibited the RNase H function and was inactive on the polymerase function. Mechanism of action studies showed that these derivatives do not intercalate into DNA and do not chelate the divalent cofactor Mg(2+) . Kinetic studies demonstrated that they are noncompetitive inhibitors, they do not bind to the RNase H active site or to the classical NNRTI binding pocket, even though efavirenz binding negatively influenced K-49/KNA-53 binding and vice versa. This behavior suggested that the alizarine derivatives binding site might be close to the NNRTI binding pocket. Docking experiments and molecular dynamic simulation confirmed the experimental data and the ability of these compounds to occupy a binding pocket close to the NNRTI site. 	FEBS_J.

10633133	20000114	Prevalent connexin 26 gene (GJB2) mutations in Japanese.	The gene responsible for DNFB1 and DFNA3, connexin 26 (GJB2), was recently identified and more than 20 disease causing mutations have been reported so far. This paper presents mutation analysis for GJB2 in Japanese non-syndromic hearing loss patients compatible with recessive inheritance. It was confirmed that GJB2 mutations are an important cause of hearing loss in this population, with three mutations, 235delC, Y136X, and R143W, especially frequent. Of these three mutations, 235delC was most prevalent at 73%. Surprisingly, the 35delG mutation, which is the most common GJB2 mutation in white subjects, was not found in the present study. Our data indicated that specific combinations of GJB2 mutation exist in different populations. 	J._Med._Genet.	D016428 D013485 D013487
19390693	20090425	SVOP is a nucleotide binding protein.	Synaptic Vesicle Protein 2 (SV2) and SV2-related protein (SVOP) are transporter-like proteins that localize to neurotransmitter-containing vesicles. Both proteins share structural similarity with the major facilitator (MF) family of small molecule transporters. We recently reported that SV2 binds nucleotides, a feature that has also been reported for another MF family member, the human glucose transporter 1 (Glut1). In the case of Glut1, nucleotide binding affects transport activity. In this study, we determined if SVOP also binds nucleotides and assessed its nucleotide binding properties. We performed in vitro photoaffinity labeling experiments with the photoreactive ATP analogue, 8-azido-ATP[gamma] biotin and purified recombinant SVOP-FLAG fusion protein. We found that SVOP is a nucleotide-binding protein, although both its substrate specificity and binding site differ from that of SV2. Within the nucleotides tested, ATP, GTP and NAD show same level of inhibition on SVOP-FLAG labeling. Dose dependent studies indicated that SVOP demonstrates the highest affinity for NAD, in contrast to SV2, which binds both NAD and ATP with equal affinity. Mapping of the binding site revealed a single region spanning transmembrane domains 9-12, which contrasts to the two binding sites in the large cytoplasmic domains in SV2A. SVOP is the third MF family member to be found to bind nucleotides. Given that the binding sites are unique in SVOP, SV2 and Glut1, this feature appears to have arisen separately.

10387009	19990701	Sliding clamp of the bacteriophage T4 polymerase has open and closed subunit interfaces in solution.	The sliding clamps of bacteriophage T4 (gp45), Escherichia coli (beta clamp), and yeast (PCNA) are required for processive DNA synthesis by their cognate DNA polymerases. The X-ray crystal structures of all three of these clamps have been shown to be closed, circular complexes. This paper reports investigations of the solution structure of bacteriophage T4 gp45 by analytical ultracentrifugation, fluorescence, and hydrodynamic modeling. Mutants of gp45 with inter- and intrasubunit disulfide bonds were created to alter the solution structure of gp45, with additional mutagenesis used to investigate the importance of the proline-rich loop region found between the two domains of each gp45 monomer. The wild-type gp45 trimer assembles from monomers cooperatively with a dissociation constant of 0.21 microM2 and values between 0.088 and 0. 32 microM2 for the mutants. Velocity ultracentrifugation experiments showed that wild-type gp45 possesses a sedimentation coefficient strongly dependent on concentration, typical of asymmetric or elongated molecules, that when extrapolated to zero concentration yields a sedimentation coefficient of 4.0 S. The loop and the disulfide mutants exhibited sedimentation coefficients with little concentration dependence, typical of symmetric or spherical molecules, that when extrapolated to zero concentration yielded sedimentation coefficients of 4.4-4.8 S. The lower sedimentation coefficient in the former case is consistent with wild-type gp45 being more asymmetric or elongated than the mutant forms. Fluorescence-resonance energy-transfer experiments were used to measure the distance between two amino acids (W91 and V162C-coumarin) on opposite sides of the gp45 subunit interface. For an intrasubunit disulfide mutant, the distance between these two amino acids was determined to be 19 A (14 A in the X-ray crystal structure), consistent with a closed complex. For the mutants without intrasubunit disulfides, the efficiency of fluorescence-resonance energy transfer was in accord with a model of gp45 being an open complex composed of two closed subunit interfaces and a third open interface separated by a distance of 35-38 A. The collective data supplemented with hydrodynamic modeling were consistent with gp45 subunit separation achieved within the plane of the gp45 ring. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013487
23116024	20121103	[Immediate and long-term results of nephrectomy with inferior vena cava thrombectomy in renal cell carcinoma].	Results of treatment of 32 patients after nephrectomy with thrombectomy for renal cell carci-noma complicated by tumor thrombosis of the inferior vena cava were analyzed. The study in-cluded patients only with II - IV clot levels: 26 patients with T3b - the length of the thrombus 5.1 +/- 1.75 cm, 6 patients with T3c - the length of a thrombus - 14.8 +/- 0.98 cm. One patient (3.1%) died due to pulmonary artery thromboembolia in immediate postoperative period. 1-2 degrees Clavier Complications were observed in 11 patients, 3-4 degree - in two (6.2%) patients. 90.4% of patients had metastases in distant organs and (or) in the regional lymph nodes, which nega-tively affected the survival rates of patients - 5-year survival rate was 36%. The presence of lymphogenous metastases, MSKCC criteria were factors affecting survival rate. Survival rates of patients with T3b and T3C levels were not statistically different. The results of postoperative systemic targeted therapy were significantly statistically better than the results of immunotherapy. 	Urologiia	D004740 D016428
27556208	20160825	MMP1-1607 polymorphism increases the risk for periapical lesion development through the upregulation MMP-1 expression in association with pro-inflammatory milieu elements.	In this study, we evaluated the association between the MMP1-1607 polymorphism (rs1799750) and pro-inflammatory milieu elements with MMP-1 mRNA levels in vivo. MMP1-1607 SNP and the mRNA levels of MMP-1, TNF-a, IFN-g, IL-17A, IL-21, IL-10, IL-4, IL-9, and FOXp3 were determined via RealTimePCR in DNA/RNA samples from patients presenting periapical granulomas (N=111, for both genotyping and expression analysis) and control subjects (N=214 for genotyping and N=26 for expression analysis). The Shapiro-Wilk, Fisher, Pearson, Chi-square ordinal least squares regression tests were used for data analysis (p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant). The MMP1-1607 1G/2G and 1G/2G+2G/2G genotypes were significantly more prevalent in the patients than in controls, comprising a risk factor for periapical lesions development. MMP-1 mRNA levels were higher in periapical lesions than in healthy periodontal ligament samples, as well as higher in active than in inactive lesions. The polymorphic allele 2G carriers presented a significantly higher MMP-1 mRNA expression when compared with the 1G/1G genotype group. The ordered logistic regression demonstrated a significant correlation between the genetic polymorphism and the expression levels of MMP-1. Additionally, the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-17A, IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-21, IL-10, IL-9, and IL-4 were significant as complementary explanatory variables of MMP-1 expression. The MMP1-1607 SNP was identified as a risk factor for periapical lesions development, possibly due to its association with increased MMP-1 mRNA levels in periapical lesions. The MMP-1 expression is also under the control of the inflammatory milieu elements, being the cytokines TNF-a, IL-21, IL-17A, and IFN-g associated with increased MMP-1 levels in periapical lesions, while IL-10, IL-9, or IL-4 presented an inverse association.

22932448	20120831	Novel germline CDK4 mutations in patients with head and neck cancer.	Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) together with its regulatory subunit cyclin D1, governs cell cycle progression through G1 phase. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, including p16INK4A in turn regulate CDK4. In particular, deregulation of the p16/CDK4/cyclin D1 complex has been established in a variety of human tumors including gliomas, sarcomas, melanoma, breast and colorectal cancer. However, changes in CDK4 have rarely been observed. In this study we used a combination of PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing for mutational screening of CDK4. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocyte of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck, for screening germline mutations in coding regions of CDK4. Variations observed in exon 2 and 5 were three missense mutations, g5051G &gt; C (Ser52Thr), g5095G &gt; C (Glu67Gln), g5906C &gt; A, g5907C &gt; G (Pro194Ser) and novel frame shift mutations g7321_23delTGA, g7121_7122insG, g7143delG in exon 7 and 3'UTR respectively. In conclusion, two novel mutations were found in N terminal domain which indicates that CDK4 mutation may play a major role in the development and progression of squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck.

23755147	20130612	Effect of single amino acid substitution observed in cancer on Pim-1 kinase thermodynamic stability and structure.	Pim-1 kinase, a serine/threonine protein kinase encoded by the pim proto-oncogene, is involved in several signalling pathways such as the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Many cancer types show high expression levels of Pim kinases and particularly Pim-1 has been linked to the initiation and progression of the malignant phenotype. In several cancer tissues somatic Pim-1 mutants have been identified. These natural variants are nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms, variations of a single nucleotide occurring in the coding region and leading to amino acid substitutions. In this study we investigated the effect of amino acid substitution on the structural stability and on the activity of Pim-1 kinase. We expressed and purified some of the mutants of Pim-1 kinase that are expressed in cancer tissues and reported in the single nucleotide polymorphisms database. The point mutations in the variants significantly affect the conformation of the native state of Pim-1. All the mutants, expressed as soluble recombinant proteins, show a decreased thermal and thermodynamic stability and a lower activation energy values for kinase activity. The decreased stability accompanied by an increased flexibility suggests that Pim-1 variants may be involved in a wider network of protein interactions. All mutants bound ATP and ATP mimetic inhibitors with comparable IC50 values suggesting that the studied Pim-1 kinase mutants can be efficiently targeted with inhibitors developed for the wild type protein.

53195	19751101	Anti-thymocyte serum may enhance or suppress the response to the same antigenic determinant.	Treatment of BALB/c mice with heterologous anti-thymocyte serum (ATS) increases their response to the C-polysaccharide of a rough strain of Pneumococcus, R36A, but suppresses their response to a vaccine of the whole organism. Phosphorylcholine is the major antigenic determinant for both the C-polysaccharide and vaccine. ATS also suppresses the response to phosphorylcholine when it is coupled to various protein carriers. In so far as was examined, ATS had no effect on adherent cells or the capability of adherent cells and antigen to stimulate an antibody response in non-adherent cells. The contrasting effects of the antiserum can best be accounted for by assuming that it acts on at least two different populations of thymic-derived cells. 	Immunology	D016428 D013487
26417243	20150930	Balance of inflammatory pathways and interplay of immune cells in the liver during homeostasis and injury.	Multiple potentially harmful stimuli challenge the liver, the chief metabolic and detoxifying organ of the human body. Due to its central anatomical location, continuous blood flow from the gastrointestinal tract through the hepatic sinusoids allows the metabolically active hepatocytes, the non-parenchymal cells and the various immune cell populations residing and patrolling in the liver to interact with antigens and microbiological components coming from the intestine. Cytokines are key mediators within the complex interplay of intrahepatic immune cells and hepatocytes, because they can activate effector functions of immune cells as well as hepatocytic intracellular signaling pathways controlling cellular homeostasis. Kupffer cells and liver-infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages are primary sources of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The liver is also enriched in natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells, which fulfill functions in pathogen defense, T cell recruitment and modulation of fibrogenic responses. TNF can activate specific intracellular pathways in hepatocytes that influence cell fate in different manners, e.g. pro-apoptotic signals via the caspase cascade, but also survival pathways, namely the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway. NF-kappaB regulates important functions in liver physiology and pathology. The exact dissection of the contribution of recruited and resident immune cells, their soluble cytokine and chemokine mediators and the intracellular hepatocytic response in liver homeostasis and injury could potentially identify novel targets for the treatment of acute and chronic liver disease, liver fibrosis or cirrhosis.

16442780	20060131	No association of complexin1 and complexin2 genes with schizophrenia in a Japanese population.	Several investigations suggest that complexin may be a schizophrenia-susceptibility factor. We conducted a genetic association analysis between complexin genes (CPLX1 and CPLX2) and schizophrenia in Japanese patients (377 cases and 341 controls). Ten and eleven haplotype-tagging (ht)SNPs in CPLX1 and CPLX2, respectively, were selected. Only one htSNP (rs930047 in CPLX2) in allele-wise analysis showed significance, and even this disappeared with an increased sample size (563 cases and 519 controls: P = .757). Haplotype-wise analysis showed a weak association with a combination of htSNPs in CPLX2 (P = .0424), but this may be a result of type I error due to multiple testing. Our results suggest that complexin genes do not play a major role in schizophrenia in Japanese patients. 	Schizophr._Res.	D016428 D013485
9428676	19980115	Information transfer in multienzyme complexes--2. The role of Arg64 of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii phosphoribulokinase in the information transfer between glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoribulokinase.	A mutant phosphoribulokinase has been isolated from the 12-2B mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. In this mutant, Arg64 has been replaced by Cys. The enzyme, which may exist in the dimeric and tetrameric states, is almost devoid of activity. Neither of these enzymes is able to form a complex with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The phosphoribulokinase gene has been expressed in Escherichia coli. The resulting recombinant protein, after isolation and purification, is apparently identical to the native enzyme extracted from the chloroplast. Three mutants have been generated by site directed mutagenesis. Arg64 has been replaced by Ala, Lys or Glu. With the exception of the latter, the two other mutants, [A64]phosphoribulokinase and [K64]phosphoribulokinase, are active when they are reduced, and nearly totally inactive in their oxidized state. Their activity, however, is decreased relative to that of the native, or to that of the wild-type recombinant phosphoribulokinase. Both the catalytic constant and the apparent affinity of ribulose 5-phosphate are decreased relative to the corresponding values obtained for the wild-type, the native or the recombinant enzyme. Whereas the [A64]phosphoribulokinase is unable to form a complex with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, [K64]phosphoribulokinase does, but the stability of the resulting complex is much decreased relative to that of the wild-type complex. The oxidized mutant [K64]phosphoribulokinase becomes active in the presence of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase but this activity is smaller than that of the corresponding wild-type enzyme. Taken together, these results show that Arg64 plays a major role in the association of the two enzymes and in the information transfer that takes place between glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoribulokinase. As this residue also appears to be important for catalytic activity, it may be tempting to consider that it stabilizes a conformation that is required for both the catalytic activity and the formation of the bienzyme complex.

26439863	20151007	Cell Surface Proteomic Map of HIV Infection Reveals Antagonism of Amino Acid Metabolism by Vpu and Nef.	Critical cell surface immunoreceptors downregulated during HIV infection have previously been identified using non-systematic, candidate approaches. To gain a comprehensive, unbiased overview of how HIV infection remodels the T cell surface, we took a distinct, systems-level, quantitative proteomic approach. &gt;100 plasma membrane proteins, many without characterized immune functions, were downregulated during HIV infection. Host factors targeted by the viral accessory proteins Vpu or Nef included the amino acid transporter SNAT1 and the serine carriers SERINC3/5. We focused on SNAT1, a ?-TrCP-dependent Vpu substrate. SNAT1 antagonism was acquired by Vpu variants from the lineage of SIVcpz/HIV-1 viruses responsible for pandemic AIDS. We found marked SNAT1 induction in activated primary human CD4+ T cells, and used Consumption and Release (CoRe) metabolomics to identify alanine as an endogenous SNAT1 substrate required for T cell mitogenesis. Downregulation of SNAT1 therefore defines a unique paradigm of HIV interference with immunometabolism. 	Cell_Host_Microbe	D016428 D013485
25581429	20150113	No evidence that selection has been less effective at removing deleterious mutations in Europeans than in Africans.	Non-African populations have experienced size reductions in the time since their split from West Africans, leading to the hypothesis that natural selection to remove weakly deleterious mutations has been less effective in the history of non-Africans. To test this hypothesis, we measured the per-genome accumulation of nonsynonymous substitutions across diverse pairs of populations. We find no evidence for a higher load of deleterious mutations in non-Africans. However, we detect significant differences among more divergent populations, as archaic Denisovans have accumulated nonsynonymous mutations faster than either modern humans or Neanderthals. To reconcile these findings with patterns that have been interpreted as evidence of the less effective removal of deleterious mutations in non-Africans than in West Africans, we use simulations to show that the observed patterns are not likely to reflect changes in the effectiveness of selection after the populations split but are instead likely to be driven by other population genetic factors.

17137630	20061202	Roles of distal arginine in activity and stability of Coprinus cinereus peroxidase elucidated by kinetic and NMR analysis of the Arg51Gln, -Asn, -Leu, and -Lys mutants.	In heme peroxidases, a distal His residue plays an essential role in the initial two electron oxidation of resting state enzyme to compound I by hydrogen peroxide. A distal Arg residue assists in this process. The contributions of the charge, H-bonding capacity, size, and mobility of this Arg residue to Coprinus cinereus peroxidase (CIP) reactivity and stability have been examined by substituting Arg51 with Gln (retains H-bond donor at N epsilon position), Asn (small size, H-bond donor and acceptor), Leu (similar to Asn, but hydrophobic), and Lys (charge and H-bond donor, but at N zeta position). UV-visible spectroscopy was used to monitor pH-linked heme changes, compound I formation and reduction, fluoride binding, and thermostability. (1)H NMR spectroscopy enabled heme pocket differences in both resting and cyanide-ligated states of the enzymes to be evaluated and compared with wild-type CIP. We found that the H-bonding capacity of distal Arg is key to fast compound I formation and ligand binding to heme, whereas charge is important for lowering the pK(a) of distal His and for the binding and stabilisation of anionic ligands at heme iron. The properties of the distal Arg residue in CIP, cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) differ significantly in their pH induced transitions and dynamics. 	J._Inorg._Biochem.

15953352	20050615	Constitutive high-affinity choline transporter endocytosis is determined by a carboxyl-terminal tail dileucine motif.	Maintenance of acetylcholine synthesis depends on the effective functioning of a high-affinity sodium-dependent choline transporter (CHT1). Recent studies have shown that this transporter is predominantly localized inside the cell, unlike other neurotransmitter transporters, suggesting that the trafficking of CHT1 to and from the plasma membrane may play a crucial role in regulating choline uptake. Here we found that CHT1 is rapidly and constitutively internalized in clathrin-coated vesicles to Rab5-positive early endosomes. CHT1 internalization is controlled by an atypical carboxyl-terminal dileucine-like motif (L531, V532) which, upon replacement by alanine residues, blocks CHT1 internalization in both human embryonic kidney 293 cells and primary cortical neurons and results in both increased CHT1 cell surface expression and choline transport activity. Perturbation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis with dynamin-I K44A increases cell surface expression and transport activity to a similar extent as mutating the dileucine motif, suggesting that we have identified the motif responsible for constitutive CHT1 internalization. Based on the observation that the localization of CHT1 to the plasma membrane is transient, we propose that acetylcholine synthesis may be influenced by processes that lead to the attenuation of constitutive CHT1 endocytosis.

The orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) GPR3 enhances the processing of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) to the neurotoxic beta-amyloid (A?) peptide via incompletely understood mechanisms. Through overexpression and shRNA knockdown experiments in HEK293 cells, we show that ?-arrestin2 (?arr2), a GPCR-interacting scaffold protein reported to bind ?-secretase, is an essential factor for GPR3-stimulated A? production. For a panel of GPR3 receptor mutants, the degree of stimulation of A? production correlates with receptor-?-arrestin binding and receptor trafficking to endocytic vesicles. However, GPR3's recruitment of ?arr2 cannot be the sole explanation, because interaction with ?arr2 is common to most GPCRs, whereas GPR3 is relatively unique among GPCRs in enhancing A? production. In addition to ?-arrestin, APP is present in a complex with GPR3 and stimulation of A? production by GPR3 mutants correlates with their level of APP binding. Importantly, among a broader selection of GPCRs, only GPR3 and prostaglandin E receptor 2 subtype EP2 (PTGER2; another GPCR that increases A? production) interact with APP, and PTGER2 does so in an agonist-stimulated manner. These data indicate that a subset of GPCRs, including GPR3 and PTGER2, can associate with APP when internalized via ?arr2, and thereby promote the cleavage of APP to generate A?.

21106500	20101126	TGM6 identified as a novel causative gene of spinocerebellar ataxias using exome sequencing.	Autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxias constitute a large, heterogeneous group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases with multiple types. To date, classical genetic studies have revealed 31 distinct genetic forms of spinocerebellar ataxias and identified 19 causative genes. Traditional positional cloning strategies, however, have limitations for finding causative genes of rare Mendelian disorders. Here, we used a combined strategy of exome sequencing and linkage analysis to identify a novel spinocerebellar ataxia causative gene, TGM6. We sequenced the whole exome of four patients in a Chinese four-generation spinocerebellar ataxia family and identified a missense mutation, c.1550T-G transition (L517W), in exon 10 of TGM6. This change is at a highly conserved position, is predicted to have a functional impact, and completely cosegregated with the phenotype. The exome results were validated using linkage analysis. The mutation we identified using exome sequencing was located in the same region (20p13-12.2) as that identified by linkage analysis, which cross-validated TGM6 as the causative spinocerebellar ataxia gene in this family. We also showed that the causative gene could be mapped by a combined method of linkage analysis and sequencing of one sample from the family. We further confirmed our finding by identifying another missense mutation c.980A-G transition (D327G) in exon seven of TGM6 in an additional spinocerebellar ataxia family, which also cosegregated with the phenotype. Both mutations were absent in 500 normal unaffected individuals of matched geographical ancestry. The finding of TGM6 as a novel causative gene of spinocerebellar ataxia illustrates whole-exome sequencing of affected individuals from one family as an effective and cost efficient method for mapping genes of rare Mendelian disorders and the use of linkage analysis and exome sequencing for further improving efficiency.

10446207	19990814	An analysis of the binding of repressor protein ModE to modABCD (molybdate transport) operator/promoter DNA of Escherichia coli.	Expression of the modABCD operon in Escherichia coli, which codes for a molybdate-specific transporter, is repressed by ModE in vivo in a molybdate-dependent fashion. In vitro DNase I-footprinting experiments identified three distinct regions of protection by ModE-molybdate on the modA operator/promoter DNA, GTTATATT (-15 to -8; region 1), GCCTACAT (-4 to +4; region 2), and GTTACAT (+8 to +14; region 3). Within the three regions of the protected DNA, a pentamer sequence, TAYAT (Y = C or T), can be identified. DNA-electrophoretic mobility experiments showed that the protected regions 1 and 2 are essential for binding of ModE-molybdate to DNA, whereas the protected region 3 increases the affinity of the DNA to the repressor. The stoichiometry of this interaction was found to be two ModE-molybdate per modA operator DNA. ModE-molybdate at 5 nM completely protected the modABCD operator/promoter DNA from DNase I-catalyzed hydrolysis, whereas ModE alone failed to protect the DNA even at 100 nM. The apparent K(d) for the interaction between the modA operator DNA and ModE-molybdate was 0.3 nM, and the K(d) increased to 8 nM in the absence of molybdate. Among the various oxyanions tested, only tungstate replaced molybdate in the repression of modA by ModE, but the affinity of ModE-tungstate for modABCD operator DNA was 6 times lower than with ModE-molybdate. A mutant ModE(T125I) protein, which repressed modA-lac even in the absence of molybdate, protected the same region of modA operator DNA in the absence of molybdate. The apparent K(d) for the interaction between modA operator DNA and ModE(T125I) was 3 nM in the presence of molybdate and 4 nM without molybdate. The binding of molybdate to ModE resulted in a decrease in fluorescence emission, indicating a conformational change of the protein upon molybdate binding. The fluorescence emission spectra of mutant ModE proteins, ModE(T125I) and ModE(Q216*), were unaffected by molybdate. The molybdate-independent mutant ModE proteins apparently mimic in its conformation the native ModE-molybdate complex, which binds to a DNA sequence motif of TATAT-7bp-TAYAT. 	J._Biol._Chem.

22430955	20120321	Genotype and subtype profiling of PSI-7977 as a nucleotide inhibitor of hepatitis C virus.	PSI-7977, a prodrug of 2'-F-2'-C-methyluridine monophosphate, is the purified diastereoisomer of PSI-7851 and is currently being investigated in phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of hepatitis C. In this study, we profiled the activity of PSI-7977 and its ability to select for resistance using a number of different replicon cells. Results showed that PSI-7977 was active against genotype (GT) 1a, 1b, and 2a (strain JFH-1) replicons and chimeric replicons containing GT 2a (strain J6), 2b, and 3a NS5B polymerase. Cross-resistance studies using GT 1b replicons confirmed that the S282T change conferred resistance to PSI-7977. Subsequently, we evaluated the ability of PSI-7977 to select for resistance using GT 1a, 1b, and 2a (JFH-1) replicon cells. S282T was the common mutation selected among all three genotypes, but while it conferred resistance to PSI-7977 in GT 1a and 1b, JFH-1 GT 2a S282T showed only a very modest shift in 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) for PSI-7977. Sequence analysis of the JFH-1 NS5B region indicated that additional amino acid changes were selected both prior to and after the emergence of S282T. These include T179A, M289L, I293L, M434T, and H479P. Residues 179, 289, and 293 are located within the finger and palm domains, while 434 and 479 are located on the surface of the thumb domain. Data from the JFH-1 replicon variants showed that amino acid changes within the finger and palm domains together with S282T were required to confer resistance to PSI-7977, while the mutations on the thumb domain serve to enhance the replication capacity of the S282T replicons.

3119764	19871201	Constitutive secretion of cystatin C (gamma-trace) by monocytes and macrophages and its downregulation after stimulation.	Cystatin C (gamma-trace) was found to be a constitutively secreted protein of isolated human monocytes and mouse peritoneal macrophages, as well as the histiocytic lymphoma cell lines U937, P388D.1, and J774. This proteinase inhibitor is not uniquely secreted by monocytes/macrophages, but was also identified in the conditioned media from several primary cells, including brain cells, and diverse established cell lines. In vitro treatment of resident mouse peritoneal macrophages with either LPS or IFN-gamma caused a downregulation in cystatin C secretion. Elaboration of this protein was also diminished by macrophages that had been stimulated by thioglycollate in vivo, and treatment of these cells with LPS led to further decline. It is suggested that, under some inflammatory conditions, downregulation of cystatin C may contribute to tissue pathology. 	J._Exp._Med.	D016428 D013487
17123590	20061125	Association between a functional single nucleotide polymorphism in the MDM2 gene and sporadic endometrial cancer risk.	MDM2 is an important negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. A naturally occurring T/G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the MDM2 gene promoter, SNP309, causes an increase in MDM2 protein levels and impairment of p53 tumor suppressor activity. SNP309 occurs at a relatively high frequency in the general population and has been associated with accelerated tumorigenesis in hereditary Li-Fraumeni associated cancers as well as in sporadic soft tissue sarcomas. The objective of this study was to examine the association between SNP309 and sporadic endometrial cancer risk. Genomic DNA was isolated from 73 patients with endometrial cancer and 79 healthy, female controls. The MDM2 gene promoter region was amplified by PCR and the SNP309 genotype determined by restriction enzyme digestion of the amplified DNA fragment. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between genotypes and endometrial cancer risk and histopathologic features. The homozygous G/G genotype was found in 25% of endometrial cancer cases and 11% of controls. In an age-adjusted analysis of cases and controls, the G/G genotype increased the risk of endometrial cancer 2.76-fold (95% CI: 1.06, 7.20; p=0.03) compared to presence of a wild-type T allele (T/G and T/T genotypes). No association was found between the SNP309 G/G genotype and either endometrial cancer histology, grade, stage, or age at diagnosis. The MDM2 SNP309 homozygous G/G genotype may be a genetic variant that influences sporadic endometrial cancer susceptibility. 	Gynecol._Oncol.	D016428
21188113	20101229	Frequency of heterozygous TET2 deletions in myeloproliferative neoplasms.	The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), including polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis, are a group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders with overlapping clinical and cytogenetic features and a variable tendency to evolve into acute leukemia. These diseases not only share overlapping chromosomal abnormalities but also a number of acquired somatic mutations. Recently, mutations in a putative tumor suppressor gene, ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) on chromosome 4q24 have been identified in 12% of patients with MPN. Additionally 4q24 chromosomal rearrangements in MPN, including TET2 deletions, have also been observed using conventional cytogenetics. The goal of this study was to investigate the frequency of genomic TET2 rearrangements in MPN using fluorescence in situ hybridization as a more sensitive method for screening and identifying genomic deletions. Among 146 MPN patients, we identified two patients (1.4%) who showed a common 4q24 deletion, including TET2. Our observations also indicated that the frequency of TET2 deletion is increased in patients with an abnormal karyotype (5%). 	Cancer_Manag_Res	D016428
18816374	20080926	Pattern of humoral immune response to Plasmodium falciparum blood stages in individuals presenting different clinical expressions of malaria.	The development of protective immunity against malaria is slow and to be maintained, it requires exposure to multiple antigenic variants of malaria parasites and age-associated maturation of the immune system. Evidence that the protective immunity is associated with different classes and subclasses of antibodies reveals the importance of considering the quality of the response. In this study, we have evaluated the humoral immune response against Plasmodium falciparum blood stages of individuals naturally exposed to malaria who live in endemic areas of Brazil in order to assess the prevalence of different specific isotypes and their association with different malaria clinical expressions. Different isotypes against P. falciparum blood stages, IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgM, IgE and IgA, were determined by ELISA. The results were based on the analysis of different clinical expressions of malaria (complicated, uncomplicated and asymptomatic) and factors related to prior malaria exposure such as age and the number of previous clinical malaria attacks. The occurrence of the H131 polymorphism of the FcgammaIIA receptor was also investigated in part of the studied population. The highest levels of IgG, IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 antibodies were observed in individuals with asymptomatic and uncomplicated malaria, while highest levels of IgG4, IgE and IgM antibodies were predominant among individuals with complicated malaria. Individuals reporting more than five previous clinical malaria attacks presented a predominance of IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 antibodies, while IgM, IgA and IgE antibodies predominated among individuals reporting five or less previous clinical malaria attacks. Among individuals with uncomplicated and asymptomatic malaria, there was a predominance of high-avidity IgG, IgG1, IgG2 antibodies and low-avidity IgG3 antibodies. The H131 polymorphism was found in 44.4% of the individuals, and the highest IgG2 levels were observed among asymptomatic individuals with this allele, suggesting the protective role of IgG2 in this population. Together, the results suggest a differential regulation in the anti-P. falciparum antibody pattern in different clinical expressions of malaria and showed that even in unstable transmission areas, protective immunity against malaria can be observed, when the appropriated antibodies are produced.

24324269	20131211	Sorting of ?1-adrenergic receptors is mediated by pathways that are either dependent on or independent of type I PDZ, protein kinase A (PKA), and SAP97.	The ?1-adrenergic receptor (?1-AR) is a target for treatment of major cardiovascular diseases, such as heart failure and hypertension. Recycling of agonist-internalized ?1-AR is dependent on type I PSD-95/DLG/ZO1 (PDZ) in the C-tail of the ?1-AR and on protein kinase A (PKA) activity (Gardner, L. A., Naren, A. P., and Bahouth, S. W. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 5085-5099). We explored the effects of point mutations in the PDZ and in the activity of PKA on recycling of the ?1-AR and its binding to the PDZ-binding protein SAP97. These studies indicated that ?1-AR recycling was inhibited by PKA inhibitors and by mutations in the PDZ that interfered with SAP97 binding. The trafficking effects of short sequences differing in PDZ and SAP97 binding were examined using chimeric mutant ?1-AR. ?1-AR chimera containing the type I PDZ of the ?2-adrenergic receptor that does not bind to SAP97 failed to recycle except when serine 312 was mutated to aspartic acid. ?1-AR chimera with type I PDZ sequences from the C-tails of aquaporin-2 or GluR1 recycled in a SAP97- and PKA-dependent manner. Non-PDZ ?1-AR chimera derived from ?-opioid, dopamine 1, or GluR2 receptors promoted rapid recycling of chimeric ?1-AR in a SAP97- and PKA-independent manner. Moreover, the nature of the residue at position -3 in the PDZ regulated whether the ?1-AR was internalized alone or in complex with SAP97. These results indicate that divergent pathways were involved in trafficking the ?1-AR and provide a roadmap for its trafficking via type I PDZs versus non-PDZs. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D052061
9425153	19980214	Pex17p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a novel peroxin and component of the peroxisomal protein translocation machinery.	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae pex17-1 mutant was isolated from a screen to identify mutants defective in peroxisome biogenesis. pex17-1 and pex17 null mutants fail to import matrix proteins into peroxisomes via both PTS1- and PTS2-dependent pathways. The PEX17 gene (formerly PAS9; Albertini, M., P. Rehling, R. Erdmann, W. Girzalsky, J.A.K.W. Kiel, M. Veenhuis, and W.-H Kunau. 1997. Cell. 89:83-92) encodes a polypeptide of 199 amino acids with one predicted membrane spanning region and two putative coiled-coil structures. However, localization studies demonstrate that Pex17p is a peripheral membrane protein located at the surface of peroxisomes. Particulate structures containing the peroxisomal integral membrane proteins Pex3p and Pex11p are evident in pex17 mutant cells, indicating the existence of peroxisomal remnants (&quot;ghosts&quot;). This finding suggests that pex17 null mutant cells are not impaired in peroxisomal membrane biogenesis. Two-hybrid studies showed that Pex17p directly binds to Pex14p, the recently proposed point of convergence for the two peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS)-dependent import pathways, and indirectly to Pex5p, the PTS1 receptor. The latter interaction requires Pex14p, indicating the potential of these three peroxins to form a trimeric complex. This conclusion is supported by immunoprecipitation experiments showing that Pex14p and Pex17p coprecipitate with both PTS receptors in the absence of Pex13p. From these and other studies we conclude that Pex17p, in addition to Pex13p and Pex14p, is the third identified component of the peroxisomal translocation machinery. 	J._Cell_Biol.	D016428 D013485
19779622	20090926	No consistent effect of ADRB2 haplotypes on obesity, hypertension and quantitative traits of body fatness and blood pressure among 6,514 adult Danes.	Evidence regarding the association of variation within ADRB2, the gene encoding the beta-adrenergic receptor 2 (ADRB2) with obesity and hypertension is exceedingly ambiguous. Despite negative reports, functional impacts of individual genetic variants have been reported. Also, functional haplotypes as well as haplotype combinations affecting expression levels in vivo of ADRB2 mRNA and protein as well as receptor sensitivity have been reported. The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate if variations within ADRB2 as haplotypes or as haplotype combinations confer an increased prevalence of obesity and hypertension among adults. We genotyped five variants required to capture common variation in a region including the ADRB2 locus in a population-based study of 6,514 unrelated, middle-aged Danes. Phases of the genotypes were estimated in silico. The variations were then investigated for their combined association with obesity, hypertension and related quantitative traits. The present study did not find consistent evidence for an association of ADRB2 variants with either obesity or hypertension when variations were analysed in a case-control study. The same lack of impact was also seen in the quantitative trait analyses, apart from nominal differences on waist-to-hip ratio and systolic blood pressure between specific haplotype combinations. In a population-based sample of 6,514 Danes we found no consistent associations between five common variants which tag the ADRB2 locus and prevalence of obesity or hypertension neither when analysed as individual haplotypes nor as haplotype pairs.

23604864	20130423	No evidence for association of the CD40, CD40L and BLYS polymorphisms, B-cell co-stimulatory molecules, with Brazilian endemic Plasmodium vivax malaria.	Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent malaria species in Brazil. The parasite-host coevolutionary process can be viewed as an 'arms race', in which adaptive genetic changes in one are eventually matched by alterations in the other. Following the candidate gene approach we analyzed the CD40, CD40L and BLYS genes that participate in B-cell co-stimulation, for associations with P. vivax malaria. The study sample included 97 patients and 103 controls. We extracted DNA using the extraction and purification commercial kit and identified the following SNPs: -1C &gt; T in the CD40 gene, -726T &gt; C in the CD40L gene and the -871C &gt; T in the BLyS gene using PCR-RFLP. We analyzed the genotype and allele frequencies by direct counting. We also compared the observed with the expected genotype frequencies using the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The allele and genotype frequencies for these SNPs did not differ statistically between patient and control groups. Gene-gene interactions were not observed between the CD40 and BLYS and between the CD40L and BLYS genes. Overall, the genes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Significant differences were not observed among the frequencies of antibody responses against P. vivax sporozoite and erythrocytic antigens and the CD40 and BLYS genotypes. The results of this study show that, although the investigated CD40, CD40L and BLYS alleles differ functionally, this variation does not alter the functionality of the molecules in a way that would interfere in susceptibility to the disease. The variants of these genes may influence the clinical course rather than simply increase or decrease susceptibility. 	Trans._R._Soc._Trop._Med._Hyg.	D016428 D013485
21737555	20110709	Genetic variants associated with severe pneumonia in A/H1N1 influenza infection.	The A/H1N1 influenza strain isolated in Mexico in 2009 caused severe pulmonary illness in a small number of exposed individuals. Our objective was to determine the influence of genetic factors on their susceptibility. We carried out a case-control association study genotyping 91 patients with confirmed severe pneumonia from A/H1N1 infection and 98 exposed but asymptomatic household contacts, using the HumanCVD BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Four risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms were significantly (p&lt;0.0001) associated with severe pneumonia: rs1801274 (Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G, low-affinity IIA, receptor (FCGR2A) gene, chromosome 1; OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.69-4.25); rs9856661 (gene unknown, chromosome 3; OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.64-4.18); rs8070740 (RPA interacting protein (RPAIN) gene, chromosome 17; OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.63-4.39); and rs3786054 (complement component 1, q subcomponent binding protein (C1QBP) gene, chromosome 17; OR 3.13, 95% CI 1.89-5.17). All SNP associations remained significant after adjustment for sex and comorbidities. The SNPs on chromosome 17 were in linkage disequilibrium. These findings revealed that gene polymorphisms located in chromosomes 1 and 17 might influence susceptibility to development of severe pneumonia in A/H1N1 infection. Two of these SNPs are mapped within genes (FCGR2A, C1QBP) involved in the handling of immune complexes and complement activation, respectively, suggesting that these genes may confer risk due to increased activation of host immunity.

24350896	20131220	STAT3 gene mutations and their association with pure red cell aplasia in large granular lymphocyte leukemia.	Large granular lymphocyte leukemia (LGL L) has been morphologically characterized as a group of lymphoproliferative diseases that include T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGL L) and chronic lymphoproliferative disorders of natural killer cells (CLPD-NK). We investigated mutations in the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene in Asian cohorts of T-LGL L and CLPD-NK (n = 42 and 11, respectively). Two mutations, Y640F and D661Y, were identified using direct sequencing or allele-specific (AS) PCR. Y640F and D661Y mutations were found in seven and 18 patients, respectively. Two patients were positive for both mutations. Frequencies of STAT3 mutations in T-LGL L and CLPD-NK were 47.6% and 27.2%, respectively. Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) was associated with the mutations (P = 0.005). The mutations were persistently found at stable levels in some patients after more than 5 years using AS-quantitative PCR. The results of the present study indicate that the SH2 domain of the STAT3 gene is frequently mutated in Asian T-LGL L and CLPD-NK, and that PRCA is closely correlated with the mutations.

19187203	20090204	Characterization of a Rab11 homologue, EoRab11a, in Euplotes octocarinatus.	Rab GTPases are crucial in the regulation of intracellular vesicular trafficking. A novel Rab GTPase gene, EoRab11a (GenBank accession no. EF061065), was isolated and identified from Euplotes octocarinatus cells in this study. It contains an ORF of 696-bp nucleotides, encoding 231 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 26.8 kDa. Alignment of EoRab11a with other Rab11 proteins from other eukaryotes demonstrated that these proteins shared 53-61% identity at the amino acid level. The recombinant EoRab11a was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by immobilized metal chelate affinity chromatography and iron chromatography. The GTPase activity of EoRab11a was 0.0024 min(-1) detected by HPLC at 30 degrees C. Three mutations were generated at amino acids Ser21 and Gly22 positions in the G1 domain of EoRab11a. All three mutants, S21P, S21G and G22R, increased the GTPase activity in vitro. Immunofluorescence microscopy results indicated that EoRab11a was localized on the phagosomal membrane during phagocytosis of E. octocarinatus. These data show that EoRab11a possesses GTP hydrolysis activity and may participate in vesicle transport events during phagocytosis of E. octocarinatus. 	FEMS_Microbiol._Lett.	D016428 D013485
24244197	20131119	Activin signaling targeted by insulin/dFOXO regulates aging and muscle proteostasis in Drosophila.	Reduced insulin/IGF signaling increases lifespan in many animals. To understand how insulin/IGF mediates lifespan in Drosophila, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analysis with the insulin/IGF regulated transcription factor dFOXO in long-lived insulin/IGF signaling genotypes. Dawdle, an Activin ligand, is bound and repressed by dFOXO when reduced insulin/IGF extends lifespan. Reduced Activin signaling improves performance and protein homeostasis in muscles of aged flies. Activin signaling through the Smad binding element inhibits the transcription of Autophagy-specific gene 8a (Atg8a) within muscle, a factor controlling the rate of autophagy. Expression of Atg8a within muscle is sufficient to increase lifespan. These data reveal how insulin signaling can regulate aging through control of Activin signaling that in turn controls autophagy, representing a potentially conserved molecular basis for longevity assurance. While reduced Activin within muscle autonomously retards functional aging of this tissue, these effects in muscle also reduce secretion of insulin-like peptides at a distance from the brain. Reduced insulin secretion from the brain may subsequently reinforce longevity assurance through decreased systemic insulin/IGF signaling. 	PLoS_Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013485
15466946	20041007	Oats, antioxidants and endothelial function in overweight, dyslipidemic adults.	To determine effects of oat and antioxidant vitamin (C 500 mg, E 400 IU) ingestion on endothelial function in overweight, dyslipidemic adults. Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial Intervention(s): Subjects (16 males &gt; or = age 35; 14 postmenopausal females) were assigned, in random order, to oats (60 g oatmeal), vitamin E (400 IU) plus vitamin C (500 mg), the combination of oats and vitamins, or placebo, and underwent brachial artery reactivity scans (BARS) following a single dose of each treatment, and again following 6 weeks of daily ingestion, with 2-week washout periods. At each test, a provocation high-fat meal (50 g, predominantly saturated) was administered and subjects were scanned pre, and 3 hours post-ingestion. Mean flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD; measured as percent diameter change before and after treatments) at baseline was 6.35 +/- 3.37. Oats increased FMD non-significantly (p &gt; 0.05) with both single acute dose (from 6.07 +/- 6.25 to 9.22 +/- 8.82) and six weeks of sustained treatment (from 6.01 +/- 10.07 to 8.69 +/- 8.42). The direction of effect was negative for vitamins and the oat/vitamin combination with both acute and sustained treatment. There were no significant differences in FMD change among the treatments in either phase of the study, however when acute and sustained effects were pooled, oat treatment significantly augmented FMD (p &lt; 0.05). This trial suggests but does not confirm a beneficial influence of oat ingestion on endothelial function in overweight, dyslipidemic adults. Further study of this potential association is warranted.

19450249	20090520	The mitochondrial genome structure of Xenoturbella bocki (phylum Xenoturbellida) is ancestral within the deuterostomes.	Mitochondrial genome comparisons contribute in multiple ways when inferring animal relationships. As well as primary sequence data, rare genomic changes such as gene order, shared gene boundaries and genetic code changes, which are unlikely to have arisen through convergent evolution, are useful tools in resolving deep phylogenies. Xenoturbella bocki is a morphologically simple benthic marine worm recently found to belong among the deuterostomes. Here we present analyses comparing the Xenoturbella bocki mitochondrial gene order, genetic code and control region to those of other metazoan groups. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Xenoturbella bocki was determined. The gene order is most similar to that of the chordates and the hemichordates, indicating that this conserved mitochondrial gene order might be ancestral to the deuterostome clade. Using data from all phyla of deuterostomes, we infer the ancestral mitochondrial gene order for this clade. Using inversion and breakpoint analyses of metazoan mitochondrial genomes, we test conflicting hypotheses for the phylogenetic placement of Xenoturbella and find a closer affinity to the hemichordates than to other metazoan groups. Comparative analyses of the control region reveal similarities in the transcription initiation and termination sites and origin of replication of Xenoturbella with those of the vertebrates. Phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial sequence indicate a weakly supported placement as a basal deuterostome, a result that may be the effect of compositional bias. The mitochondrial genome of Xenoturbella bocki has a very conserved gene arrangement in the deuterostome group, strikingly similar to that of the hemichordates and the chordates, and thus to the ancestral deuterostome gene order. Similarity to the hemichordates in particular is suggested by inversion and breakpoint analysis. Finally, while phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial sequences support a basal deuterostome placement, support for this decreases with the use of more sophisticated models of sequence evolution.

21541224	20110505	The multifaceted poliovirus 2A protease: regulation of gene expression by picornavirus proteases.	After entry into animal cells, most viruses hijack essential components involved in gene expression. This is the case of poliovirus, which abrogates cellular translation soon after virus internalization. Abrogation is achieved by cleavage of both eIF4GI and eIF4GII by the viral protease 2A. Apart from the interference of poliovirus with cellular protein synthesis, other gene expression steps such as RNA and protein trafficking between nucleus and cytoplasm are also altered. Poliovirus 2A(pro) is capable of hydrolyzing components of the nuclear pore, thus preventing an efficient antiviral response by the host cell. Here, we compare in detail poliovirus 2A(pro) with other viral proteins (from picornaviruses and unrelated families) as regard to their activity on key host factors that control gene expression. It is possible that future analyses to determine the cellular proteins targeted by 2A(pro) will uncover other cellular functions ablated by poliovirus infection. Further understanding of the cellular proteins hydrolyzed by 2A(pro) will add further insight into the molecular mechanism by which poliovirus and other viruses interact with the host cell.

24453138	20140124	Reelin gene variants and risk of autism spectrum disorders: an integrated meta-analysis.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a severe neurological disorder with a high degree of heritability. Reelin gene (RELN), which plays a crucial role in the migration and positioning of neurons during brain development, has been strongly posed as a candidate gene for ASD. Genetic variants in RELN have been investigated as risk factors of ASD in numerous epidemiologic studies but with inconclusive results. To clearly discern the effects of RELN variants on ASD, the authors conducted a meta-analysis integrating case-control and transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) studies published through 2001 to 2013. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals were used to estimate the associations between three RELN variants (rs736707, rs362691, and GGC repeat variant) and ASD. In overall meta-analysis, the summary ORs for rs736707, rs362691, and GGC repeat variant were 1.11 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.80-1.54], 0.69 (95% CI: 0.56-0.86), and 1.09 (95% CI: 0.97-1.23), respectively. Besides, positive result was also obtained in subgroup of broadly-defined ASD for rs362691 (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.52-0.86). Our meta-analysis revealed that the RELN rs362691, rather than rs736707 or GGC repeat variant, might contribute significantly to ASD risk. 	Am._J._Med._Genet._B_Neuropsychiatr._Genet.

23637998	20130503	GSTT1 null genotype contributes to lung cancer risk in asian populations: a meta-analysis of 23 studies.	Genetic variation in glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) may contribute to lung cancer risk. Many studies have investigated the correlation between the Glutathione S-transferase T1 (GSTT1) null genotype and lung cancer risk in Asian population but yielded inconclusive results. We performed a meta-analysis of 23 studies including 4065 cases and 5390 controls. We assessed the strength of the association of GSTT1 with lung cancer risk and performed sub-group analyses by source of controls, smoking status, histological types, and sample size. A statistically significant correlation between GSTT1 null genotype and lung cancer in Asian population was observed (OR?=?1.28, 95% CI?=?1.10, 1.49; Pheterogeneity&lt;0.001 and I(2)?=?62.0%). Sub-group analysis revealed there was a statistically increased lung cancer risk in ever-smokers who carried the GSTT1 null genotype (OR?=?1.94, 95% CI?=?1.27, 2.96; P heterogeneity?=?0.02 and I(2)?=?58.1%). It was also indicated that GSTT1 null genotype could increase lung cancer risk among population-based studies (OR?=?1.25, 95% CI?=?1.04, 1.50; Pheterogeneity?=?0.003 and I(2)?=?56.8%). The positive association was also found in studies of sample size (?500 participants) (OR?=?1.34, 95% CI?=?1.10, 1.62; Pheterogeneity&lt;0.001 and I(2)?=?65.4%). These meta-analysis results suggest that GSTT1 null genotype is associated with a significantly increased risk of lung cancer in Asian population. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D017418 D013485
25801113	20150325	The effect of rs9939609 FTO gene polymorphism on weight loss after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.	Remarkable differences in weight loss have been observed in obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). These high variations might be partly explained by genetic factors. The rs9939609 fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) polymorphism has been implicated in the susceptibility of obesity. We aimed to explore the effects of the rs9939609 FTO gene polymorphism on weight loss among severely obese patients applying for LSG. All individuals were analyzed for the FTO rs9939609 gene polymorphism. A total of 74 morbid obese patients (20 male, 54 female) were operated. Body weight and body mass index (BMI) were measured at before LSG and after surgery at the sixth month. Twenty-eight patients (37.8%) had genotype TT (wild-type allel), 36 patients (48.6%) had genotype TA, and 10 patients (13.5%) had genotype AA. In both wild-type group and mutant group, BMI and weight levels decreased at the sixth month after surgery. Percent of excess weight loss (EWL) at 6 months of follow-up was similar in both groups. There were no differences between the mutant and wild-type groups percent of EWL at the sixth month after applying LSG. Our data showed that the rs9939609 FTO gene polymorphism is not a useful genetic test prior to LSG to help clinicians predicting the weight loss for severely obese patients in short-term follow-up.

22385787	20120306	Pathologic diversity of glioneuronal tumor with neuropil-like islands: a histological and immunohistochemical study with a special reference to isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) in 5 cases.	Glioneuronal tumor with neuropil-like islands (GTNI) is featured by &quot;neuropil-like islands (NIs)&quot; within dominating astroglial components. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations, particularly IDH1 R132H (G395A), are found in WHO Grade II and III diffuse gliomas as well as secondary, but not primary, glioblastomas. We reviewed 5 cases of GTNI, and assessed histology and immunohistochemistry with various antibodies, including those for IDH1 R132H, as well as direct DNA sequencing for IDH1 G395A. NIs were variable in morphology, and constantly synaptophysin-positive and glial fibrillary acidic protein-negative. The glioma components were primary glioblastoma in 2 cases, anaplastic astrocytoma in 1 and anaplastic oligoastrocytoma in 2. The IDH1 R132H was expressed in the 2 cases with oligoastrocytoma: In 1, NIs and the astrocytoma-like area as well as the oligodendroglioma-like area were positive. In the other, only the oligodendrogliomalike area was positive. The mutation analysis performed on the latter case with DNA separately sampled from the oligodendroglioma- like area and the astrocytoma-like area detected IDH1 G395A in both areas. We have shown diverse pathologic aspects of GTNI. Also, we have shown that the expression of IDH1 R132H in GTNI is largely concordant with that in diffuse gliomas, and that it can be dependent on each histologic component although the mutant IDH1 gene is ubiquitously present within the tumor.

23826226	20130705	Central control of circadian phase in arousal-promoting neurons.	Cells of the dorsomedial/lateral hypothalamus (DMH/LH) that produce hypocretin (HCRT) promote arousal in part by activation of cells of the locus coeruleus (LC) which express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) drives endogenous daily rhythms, including those of sleep and wakefulness. These circadian oscillations are generated by a transcriptional-translational feedback loop in which the Period (Per) genes constitute critical components. This cell-autonomous molecular clock operates not only within the SCN but also in neurons of other brain regions. However, the phenotype of such neurons and the nature of the phase controlling signal from the pacemaker are largely unknown. We used dual fluorescent in situ hybridization to assess clock function in vasopressin, HCRT and TH cells of the SCN, DMH/LH and LC, respectively, of male Syrian hamsters. In the first experiment, we found that Per1 expression in HCRT and TH oscillated in animals held in constant darkness with a peak phase that lagged that in AVP cells of the SCN by several hours. In the second experiment, hamsters induced to split their locomotor rhythms by exposure to constant light had asymmetric Per1 expression within cells of the middle SCN at 6 h before activity onset (AO) and in HCRT cells 9 h before and at AO. We did not observe evidence of lateralization of Per1 expression in the LC. We conclude that the SCN communicates circadian phase to HCRT cells via lateralized neural projections, and suggests that Per1 expression in the LC may be regulated by signals of a global or bilateral nature.

20506646	20100529	[CX3CR1 polymorphism in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy].	To investigate the association between CX3CR1 gene polymorphism and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs3732378 (V249I) and rs3732379(T280M) in CX3CR1 gene were determined using PCR-RFLP. The frequencies of genotype and allele of these two SNPs were compared between 211 DCM patients and 211 normal controls. The genotype distribution of these two SNPs had no deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium either in DCM patients or in the controls. No significant difference was found in the frequencies of genotype and allele in rs3732378 and rs3732379 between the DCM patients and the controls. CX3CR1 gene polymorphism is not associated with DCM. 	Sichuan_Da_Xue_Xue_Bao_Yi_Xue_Ban	D016428 D013485
12140136	20020726	A T2517C polymorphism in the GSTM4 gene is associated with risk of developing lung cancer.	The human Mu class Glutathione S-Transferases is a family of genes encoding phase II detoxifying enzymes thus playing a significant role in the detoxification of potential carcinogens. While there are many contradicting reports on the association of GSTM1 polymorphisms and cancer development, no studies exist to date describing polymorphisms in GSTM4. We have identified a new C-T polymorphism in intron 6 of the GSTM4 gene (T2517C, Genebank sequence accession number X68677) and termed the allele carrying T at this position allele *A and the allele carrying C, allele *B. Screening a population sample in Merseyside, England, revealed 23 carriers of the *B allele out of 156 healthy control individuals but only 12 carriers of the *B allele out of 163 individuals with lung cancer (O.R.=2.23, Fisher's test P=0.026). The polymorphism did not demonstrate any associations with tumour type, gender, and age at presentation. This is the first report on the implication of a polymorphism in the GSTM4 gene in lung cancer risk. Further studies are required to investigate the relation of this polymorphism to cancer risk to substantiate these findings. 	Lung_Cancer	D003160 D016428

23176254	20121127	Screening of Finnish RAD51C founder mutations in prostate and colorectal cancer patients.	Rare, heterozygous germline mutations in the RAD51C gene have been found in breast and ovarian cancer families. In the Finnish population, we have identified two founder mutations in RAD51C that increase the risk of ovarian cancer but not breast cancer in the absence of ovarian cancer. Risk for other cancers has not been studied. To study the role of RAD51C mutations in other common cancer types, we genotyped the Finnish RAD51C founder mutations c.837?+?1G?&gt;?A and c.93delG in 1083 prostate cancer patients and 802 colorectal cancer patients using TaqMan Real-Time PCR. No RAD51C mutations c.837?+?1G?&gt;?A or c.93delG were detected among the prostate or colorectal cancer patients. The results suggest that the RAD51C mutations do not predispose to prostate or colorectal cancer. 	BMC_Cancer	D016428 D013485
19487633	20090603	Effects of acute insulin-induced hypoglycemia on spatial abilities in adults with type 1 diabetes.	OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of acute insulin-induced hypoglycemia on spatial cognitive abilities in adult humans with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Sixteen adults with type 1 diabetes underwent two counterbalanced experimental sessions: euglycemia (blood glucose 4.5 mmol/l [81 mg/dl]) and hypoglycemia (2.5 mmol/l [45 mg/dl]). Arterialized blood glucose levels were maintained using a hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp technique. During each session, subjects underwent detailed assessment of spatial abilities from the Kit of Factor-Referenced Cognitive Tests and two tests of general cognitive function. RESULTS Spatial ability performance deteriorated significantly during hypoglycemia. Results for the Hidden Patterns, Card Rotations, Paper Folding, and Maze Tracing tests were all impaired significantly (P &lt; or = 0.001) during hypoglycemia, as were results for the Cube Comparisons Test (P = 0.03). The Map Memory Test was not significantly affected by hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS Hypoglycemia is a common side effect of insulin therapy in individuals with type 1 diabetes, and spatial abilities are of critical importance in day-to-day functioning. The deterioration in spatial abilities observed during modest experimental hypoglycemia provides novel information on the cerebral hazards of hypoglycemia that has potential relevance to everyday activities.

26576216	20151118	Tau Hyperphosphorylation and Oxidative Stress, a Critical Vicious Circle in Neurodegenerative Tauopathies?	Hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau in brain, are pathological hallmarks of a large family of neurodegenerative disorders, named tauopathies, which include Alzheimer's disease. It has been shown that increased phosphorylation of tau destabilizes tau-microtubule interactions, leading to microtubule instability, transport defects along microtubules, and ultimately neuronal death. However, although mutations of the MAPT gene have been detected in familial early-onset tauopathies, causative events in the more frequent sporadic late-onset forms and relationships between tau hyperphosphorylation and neurodegeneration remain largely elusive. Oxidative stress is a further pathological hallmark of tauopathies, but its precise role in the disease process is poorly understood. Another open question is the source of reactive oxygen species, which induce oxidative stress in brain neurons. Mitochondria have been classically viewed as a major source for oxidative stress, but microglial cells were recently identified as reactive oxygen species producers in tauopathies. Here we review the complex relationships between tau pathology and oxidative stress, placing emphasis on (i) tau protein function, (ii) origin and consequences of reactive oxygen species production, and (iii) links between tau phosphorylation and oxidative stress. Further, we go on to discuss the hypothesis that tau hyperphosphorylation and oxidative stress are two key components of a vicious circle, crucial in neurodegenerative tauopathies.

17611075	20070706	Phosphorylation at Ser729 specifies a Golgi localisation for protein kinase C epsilon (PKCepsilon) in 3T3 fibroblasts.	We demonstrate that GFP-PKCepsilon concentrates at a perinuclear site in living fibroblasts and that cell passage induces rapid translocation of PKCepsilon to the periphery where it appears to colocalise with F-actin. When newly passaged cells have adhered and are proliferating again, GFP-PKCepsilon returns to its perinuclear site. GFP-PKCepsilon co-localises with wheat germ agglutinin suggesting that it is associated with the Golgi at the perinuclear site. In support, PKCepsilon is detected in a Golgi-enriched fraction in pre-passage cells but is lost from the fraction after passage. PKCepsilon at the perinuclear Golgi site is phosphorylated at Ser729 but cell passage induces the loss of the phosphate at this site as reported previously [England et al. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 10437-10442]. PKCepsilon S729A, S729E and S729T mutants, which are not recognised by a specific antiphosphoPKCepsilon (Ser729) antibody, do not concentrate at a perinuclear/Golgi site in proliferating fibroblasts. This suggests that both phosphorylation and serine rather than threonine are needed at position 729 to locate PKCepsilon at its perinuclear/Golgi site. Phorbol ester induced translocation of PKCepsilon to the nucleus also requires dephosphorylation at Ser729; after translocation nuclear PKCepsilon lacks a phosphate at Ser729. Sulphation and secretion of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains from fibroblasts increases on passage and returns to basal as cells proliferate showing that cell passage influences secretory events at the Golgi. The results indicate that Ser729 phosphorylation plays a role in determining PKCepsilon localisation in fibroblasts. 	Cell._Signal.	D016428 D013485
21431831	20110325	Acid epimerization of 20-keto pregnane glycosides is determined by 2D-NMR spectroscopy.	Carbohydrates influence many essential biological events such as apoptosis, differentiation, tumor metastasis, cancer, neurobiology, immunology, development, host-pathogen interactions, diabetes, signal transduction, protein folding, and many other contexts. We now report on the structure determination of pregnane glycosides isolated from the aerial parts of Ceropegia fusca Bolle (Asclepiadaceae). The observation of cicatrizant, vulnerary and cytostatic activities in some humans and animals of Ceropegia fusca Bolle, a species endemic to the Canary Islands, encouraged us to begin a pharmacological study to determine their exact therapeutic properties. High resolution (1)H-NMR spectra of pregnane glycosides very often display well-resolved signals that can be used as starting points in several selective NMR experiments to study scalar (J coupling), and dipolar (NOE) interactions. ROESY is especially suited for molecules such that ??(c) ~ 1, where ?(c) are the motional correlation times and ? is the angular frequency. In these cases the NOE is nearly zero, while the rotating-frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) is always positive and increases monotonically for increasing values of ?(c). The ROESY shows dipolar interactions cross peaks even in medium-sized molecules which are helpful in unambiguous assignment of all the interglycosidic linkages. Selective excitation was carried out using a double pulsed-field gradient spin-echo sequence (DPFGSE) in which 180? Gaussian pulses are sandwiched between sine shaped z-gradients. Scalar interactions were studied by homonuclear DPFGSE-COSY and DPFGSE-TOCSY experiments, while DPFGSE-ROESY was used to monitor the spatial environment of the selectively excited proton. Dipolar interactions between nuclei close in space can be detected by the 1D GROESY experiment, which is a one-dimensional counterpart of the 2D ROESY method. The C-12 and C-17 configurations were determined by ROESY experiments. 	J._Biomol._NMR	D016428 D013485
6726088	19840401	Genetic polymorphism of apolipoprotein E: a variant form of apolipoprotein E2 distinguished by sodium dodecyl sulfate--polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.	The apolipoprotein E2 ( apoE2 ) variant that possesses a cysteine substituted for an arginine at residue 158 in the amino acid sequence E2( Arg158 ----Cys) can be distinguished by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from other forms of apoE, including E3 (the parent form), E4( Cys112 ----Arg), E2( Arg145 ----Cys), and E2( Lys146 ----Gln). The E2( Arg158 ----Cys) migrates as a distinctly separable band with a higher apparent molecular weight than the other forms. Chemical modification of apoE2 ( Arg158 ----Cys) with sulfhydryl reagents (2-bromoethyl)-trimethylammonium bromide or cysteamine, which convert cysteine to arginyl or lysyl analogues, respectively, abolishes the difference in apparent molecular weight and results in the co-electrophoresis of E2( Arg158 ----Cys) with other apoE forms. The mobilities of the other apoE variants are not affected by these modifications. These results suggest that the substitution site at residue 158 is a key location, important in modifying the behavior of apoE and in modulating its apparent molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Furthermore, the technique used in this study may be very helpful in distinguishing specific mutant forms of apoE2 . 	J._Lipid_Res.	D016428
23968943	20130824	Meta-analysis on the association between the TF gene rs1049296 and AD.	Polymorphisms of genes participating in iron transportation have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. The association between transferrin (TF) gene rs1049296 (P570S) polymorphism and AD is controversial. We performed meta analysis on data from 19 studies with 6310 cases and 13661 controls to reexamine the association between the TF gene rs1049296 polymorphism and AD. We applied a fixed-effects model to combine the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Egger's test was carried out to evaluate the potential publication bias. The overall ORs with 95% CIs showed statistical association between the TF gene rs1049296 polymorphism and the risk of AD in the allele contrast, the recessive model and the dominant model for allele C2 (fixed-effects pooled OR 1.11; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.17, pooled OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.21, and pooled OR 1.23; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.47, respectively). In the contrast of C2C2+C2C1 vs C1C1, large heterogeneity among the Asian subgroup (p=0.041, I2= 68.6%) was observed but not among the overall population (p = 0.184, I2= 22.4%). No publication bias was observed. The present meta analysis demonstrated that TF gene rs1049296 polymorphism is a genetic determinant of AD. 	Can_J_Neurol_Sci	D016428 D017418 D013485
17586032	20070626	Association between Q551R IL4R genetic variants and atopic asthma risk demonstrated by meta-analysis.	IL4R, the gene encoding the alpha chain of the IL-4 and IL-13 receptors, has received extensive attention as a candidate gene for asthma risk. However, the results from studies testing for associations of the I50V and Q551R IL4R genetic variants are conflicting. We sought to determine the average risk of asthma associated with the I50V and Q551R IL4R variants based on the results of case-control studies reported in the literature. Meta-analyses were performed with data from case-control association studies that met specified inclusion criteria (9 and 8 studies for I50V and Q551R, respectively). Random-effects models were used to calculate combined odds ratios (ORs) and significance of associations. Analyses were performed for asthma in general and for subgroups based on the atopy status of the asthma population. The R551 IL4R variant was significantly associated with increased risk of asthma, most notably atopic asthma (combined OR, 1.6; P = .004). Exclusion of the outlier study reporting an OR of less than 1 greatly increased the significance of association (OR, 1.8; P = 3 x 10(-9)). I50V variants were not significantly associated with asthma. A meta-analysis of results from case-control studies strongly supports the conclusion that the R551 IL4R variant imparts a modest yet significant risk for atopic asthma. Knowledge that the R551 IL4R variant is associated with increased asthma risk should provide a basis for understanding the heterogeneity of asthma pathogenesis and for pharmacogenetic approaches to treat individuals carrying this variant.

26725115	20160104	Intravital FRAP Imaging using an E-cadherin-GFP Mouse Reveals Disease- and Drug-Dependent Dynamic Regulation of Cell-Cell Junctions in Live Tissue.	E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions play a prominent role in maintaining the epithelial architecture. The disruption or deregulation of these adhesions in cancer can lead to the collapse of tumor epithelia that precedes invasion and subsequent metastasis. Here we generated an E-cadherin-GFP mouse that enables intravital photobleaching and quantification of E-cadherin mobility in live tissue without affecting normal biology. We demonstrate the broad applications of this mouse by examining E-cadherin regulation in multiple tissues, including mammary, brain, liver, and kidney tissue, while specifically monitoring E-cadherin mobility during disease progression in the pancreas. We assess E-cadherin stability in native pancreatic tissue upon genetic manipulation involving Kras and p53 or in response to anti-invasive drug treatment and gain insights into the dynamic remodeling of E-cadherin during in?situ cancer progression. FRAP in the E-cadherin-GFP mouse, therefore, promises to be a valuable tool to fundamentally expand our understanding of E-cadherin-mediated events in native microenvironments.

27624965	20160915	Mechanism of Poliovirus Resistance to Host Phosphatidylinositol-4 Kinase III ? Inhibitor.	Phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase III ? (PI4KB) and oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family I have been identified as the major targets of anti-enterovirus drug candidates. Resistance mutations in poliovirus (PV) to these inhibitors have been identified in viral 3A protein, represented by a G5318A (3A-Ala70Thr) mutation, but the mechanism of viral resistance to host PI4KB/OSBP inhibitors remained unknown. In this study, we found that a G5318A mutation enhances the basal levels of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and of the 3A protein and decreases the levels of the 3AB protein during PV replication. The 3A protein acted as a major effector responsible for the resistance to PI4KB inhibitor, but did not enhance the PI4KB activity in vitro in contrast to the 2C, 2BC, 3AB, and 3D proteins. The 3AB protein acted as the primary target of a G5318A mutation and also as an effector. We identified novel resistance mutations to a PI4KB inhibitor [C5151U (3A-T14M) and C5366U (3A-H86Y) mutations] and found that there is a positive correlation between the extent of the resistance phenotype and the levels of the 3A proteins. These results suggested that the 3A protein overproduced by enhanced processing of the 3AB protein with the resistance mutations overcomes the inhibitory effect of PI4KB inhibitor on PV replication independently of the hyperactivation of the PI4KB/OSBP pathway.

16176974	20050924	Phosphorylation of N-cadherin-associated cortactin by Fer kinase regulates N-cadherin mobility and intercellular adhesion strength.	Cortactin regulates the strength of nascent N-cadherin-mediated intercellular adhesions through a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent mechanism. Currently, the functional significance of cortactin phosphorylation and the kinases responsible for the regulation of adhesion strength are not defined. We show that the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Fer phosphorylates cadherin-associated cortactin and that this process is involved in mediating intercellular adhesion strength. In wild-type fibroblasts N-cadherin ligation-induced transient phosphorylation of Fer, indicating that junction formation activates Fer kinase. Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin after N-cadherin ligation was strongly reduced in fibroblasts expressing only catalytically inactive Fer (D743R), compared with wild-type cells. In wild-type cells, N-cadherin-coated bead pull-off assays induced fourfold greater endogenous N-cadherin association than in D743R cells. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching showed that GFP-N-cadherin mobility at nascent contacts was 50% faster in wild-type than D743R cells. In shear wash-off assays, nascent intercellular adhesion strength was twofold higher in wild-type than D743R cells. Cortactin recruitment to adhesions was independent of Fer kinase activity, but was impacted by N-cadherin ligation-provoked Rac activation. We conclude that N-cadherin ligation induces Rac-dependent cortactin recruitment and Fer-dependent cortactin phosphorylation, which in turn promotes enhanced mobilization and interaction of surface expressed N-cadherin in contacting cells.

15157276	20040526	APOAV (T-1131&gt;C) variant has no effect on mother's height in a large population study.	The important role of APOAV gene T-1131&gt;C variant in determination of plasma triglyceride levels has been proved on many population studies. Recently, associations between C-1131 allele and higher mother's height as well as with longer fetal birth length were suggested. In 1,305 females, aged between 28 and 67 years and having at least one child, we have analyzed a putative association between T-1131&gt;C APOAV variant (analyzed by PCR and restriction analysis) and body height. Mother's body height did not differ between T/T homozygotes (N = 1093, 162.5 +/- 6.5 cm) and C allele carriers (N = 212, 162.1 +/- 6.4 cm). Thus we have failed to confirm, that mothers with APOAV C-1131 allele are higher than T/T-1131 homozygotes. 	Lipids_Health_Dis	D016420 D016428
27626059	20160915	N-Myc expression enhances the oncolytic effects of vesicular stomatitis virus in human neuroblastoma cells.	N-myc oncogene amplification is associated but not present in all cases of high-risk neuroblastoma (NB). Since oncogene expression could often modulate sensitivity to oncolytic viruses, we wanted to examine if N-myc expression status would determine virotherapy efficacy to high-risk NB. We showed that induction of exogenous N-myc in a non-N-myc-amplified cell line background (TET-21N) increased susceptibility to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus (mutant VSV?M51) and alleviated the type I IFN-induced antiviral state. Cells with basal N-myc, on the other hand, were less susceptible to virus-induced oncolysis and established a robust IFN-mediated antiviral state. The same effects were also observed in NB cell lines with and without N-myc amplification. Microarray analysis showed that N-myc overexpression in TET-21N cells downregulated IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) with known antiviral functions. Furthermore, virus infection caused significant changes in global gene expression in TET-21N cells overexpressing N-myc. Such changes involved ISGs with various functions. Therefore, the present study showed that augmented susceptibility to VSV?M51 by N-myc at least involves downregulation of ISGs with antiviral functions and alleviation of the IFN-stimulated antiviral state. Our studies suggest the potential utility of N-myc amplification/overexpression as a predictive biomarker of virotherapy response for high-risk NB using IFN-sensitive oncolytic viruses.

21588221	20110519	9-Ethyl-9H-carbazole-3-carbaldehyde.	The title mol-ecule, C(15)H(13)NO, approximates a planar conformation except for the alkyl chain (ethyl group) bonded to the N atom with a maximum deviation from the least-squares plane through the 15 planar atoms of 0.120?(2)?? for the O atom. The distance of the formyl O atom from the plane of the carbazole ring is 0.227?(2)??. The N-C bond lengths in the central ring are significantly different, reflecting the electron-withdrawing properties of the aldehyde group. As a consequence, charge transfer may occur from the carbazole N atom to the substituted benzene ring. 	Acta_Crystallogr_Sect_E_Struct_Rep_Online	D016428
26264590	20150813	Long-term effects of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by sphincter-preserving resection on anal sphincter function in relation to quality of life among locally advanced rectal cancer patients: a cross-sectional analysis.	There is growing recognition for the consequences of rectal cancer treatment to maintain an adequate functional sphincter in the long-term rather than preserving the anal sphincter itself. This study aims to evaluate long-term effects of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by sphincter-preserving resection on anal sphincter function in relation to quality of life (QoL) among locally advanced rectal cancer patients. Twenty-nine patients treated with nCRT followed by low anterior resection surgery were included in this study. Data on patient demographics, tumor location and symptoms of urgency and fecal soiling were recorded and evaluated with respect to Wexner Fecal Incontinence Scoring Scale, European Organization for Research and Cancer (EORTC) cancer-specific (EORTC QLQ-C30) and colorectal cancer-specific (EORTC QLQ-CR38) questionnaires and anorectal manometrical findings. Correlation of manometrical findings with Wexner Scale, EORTC QLQ-CR38 scores and EORTC QLQ-C30 scores was also evaluated. Median follow-up was 45.6?months (ranged 7.5-98?months. Higher scores for incontinence for gas (p?=?0.001), liquid (p?=?0.048) and solid (p?=?0.019) stool, need to wear pad (p?=?0.001) and alteration in life style (p?=?0.004) in Wexner scale, while lower scores for future perspective (p?=?0.010) and higher scores for defecation problems (p?=?0.001) in EORTC QLQ-CR38 were noted in patients with than without urgency. Manometrical findings of resting pressure (mmHg) was positively correlated with body image (r?=?0.435, p?=?0.030) and sexual functioning (r?=?0.479, p?=?0.011) items of functional scale, while rectal sensory threshold (RST) volume (mL) was positively correlated with defecation problems (r?=?0.424, p?=?0.031) items of symptom scale in EORTC QLQ-CR38 and negatively correlated with social function domain (r?=?-0.479, p?=?0.024) in EORTC QLQ-C30. RST volume was also positively correlated with Wexner scores including incontinence for liquid stool (r?=?0.459, p?=?0.024), need to wear pad (r?=?0.466, p?=?0.022) and alteration in lifestyle (r?=?0.425, p?=?0.038). The high risk of developing functional anal impairment as well as the systematic registration of not only oncological but also functional and QoL related outcomes seem important in rectal cancer patients in the long-term disease follow-up.

27486307	20160804	Rational design and synthesis of novel diphenyl ether derivatives as antitubercular agents.	A series of triclosan mimic diphenyl ether derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. The binding mode of the compounds at the active site of enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase of M. tuberculosis has been explored. Among them, compound 10b was found to possess antitubercular activity (minimum inhibitory concentration =12.5 ?g/mL) comparable to triclosan. All the synthesized compounds exhibited low levels of cytotoxicity against Vero and HepG2 cell lines, and three compounds 10a, 10b, and 10c had a selectivity index more than 10. Compound 10b was also evaluated for log P, pKa, human liver microsomal stability, and % protein binding, in order to probe its druglikeness. Based on the antitubercular activity and druglikeness profile, it may be concluded that compound 10b could be a lead for future development of antitubercular drugs. 	Drug_Des_Devel_Ther	D016428
24031445	20130914	Mutants with heteroresistance to amphotericin B and fluconazole in Candida.	Several studies have reported the occurrence of infections caused by Candida yeasts as well as the increasing prevalence of non albicans species. The aim of the present work is focused on the obtaining of heteroresistance to amphotericin B and fluconazole in Candida species using two distinct methodologies: selection and induction. Resistant samples were obtained by selective pressure using a medium with fluconazole for growth, followed by growth in a medium with amphotericin B. The selective pressure was also created beginning with growth in amphotericin B medium followed by growth in fluconazole medium. Concomitantly, samples were submitted to the induction of resistance through cultivation in increasing concentrations of fluconazole, followed by cultivation in increasing concentrations of amphotericin B. Subsequently, the induction began with amphotericin B followed by fluconazole. Three samples resistant to fluconazole and amphotericin B were obtained, two by induction (C. glabrata and C. tropicalis) and one by selection (C. tropicalis). Both C. tropicalis originated from the same wild sample. After successive transfers for drug free medium, only the sample obtained by selection was able to maintain the resistance phenotype. These results suggest that the phenotype of heteroresitance to fluconazole and amphotericin B can be produced by two methodologies: selection and induction. 	Braz._J._Microbiol.	D016428
9617836	19980609	Capture-ELISA based on recombinant PR3 is sensitive for PR3-ANCA testing and allows detection of PR3 and PR3-ANCA/PR3 immunecomplexes.	Proteinase 3 (PR3), a constituent of azurophil granules of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear cells, PMNs), is the target antigen for most anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCA) in Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). We have recently developed an expression system for recombinant PR3 (rPR3) that is recognized by c-ANCA. Here, we report on the development and characterization of two monoclonal antibodies (moABs) and a rabbit polyclonal antiserum generated against this rPR3. Epitope competition analysis indicates that the moABs MCPR3-1 and MCPR3-2 recognize overlapping epitopes on the PR3 molecule that are distinct from the ones recognized by moABs 4A5 and 6A6 developed by others. Since MCPR3-2 does not appear to compete for epitopes recognized by a sizable proportion of PR3-ANCA, we used it to develop a sensitive capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for clinical PR3-ANCA testing. Both purified PMN PR3 and crude human mast cell line (HMC-1)/PR3-S176A cell lysates were used as sources of PR3 target antigen in this assay with equal analytical sensitivity and specificity. Of 109 patients with ANCA-associated disease, 91 (83.5%) and 90 (82.6%) were PR3-ANCA positive by capture ELISA when PMN-PR3 and HMC-1/PR3-S176A cell lysates were used as antigen, respectively. When HMC-1/PR3 and HMC-1/PR3-S176A cells were used as indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) substrate, 88 (80.7%) and 92 (84.4%) were PR3-ANCA positive, respectively. These differences were not statistically significant. Only 1 of 151 controls without defined ANCA-associated disease tested positive by capture ELISA with either target antigen (both negative by PR3-ANCA specific IIF). The capture ELISA can also be used to detect of PR3-ANCA immunecomplexes and, in combination with the rabbit antiserum, for the quantitative measurement of PR3 in biological fluids.

19443106	20090516	Enhanced adsorption of phenol from water by a novel polar post-crosslinked polymeric adsorbent.	A novel post-crosslinked polymeric adsorbent PDM-2 was prepared by Friedel-Crafts reaction of pendant vinyl groups without external crosslinking agent. Both the specific surface area and the pore volume of starting copolymer PDM-1 increased significantly after post-crosslinking. Batch adsorption runs of phenol from aqueous solution onto PDM-1 and PDM-2 were investigated. Commercial macroporous resins XAD-4 and AB-8 were chosen as the comparison. Experimental results showed that isotherms of phenol adsorption onto these four polymeric adsorbents could be represented by Freundlich model reasonably. PDM-2 exhibited higher adsorption capacity of phenol than other three adsorbents, which resulted from synergistic effect of larger specific surface area and polar groups on the network. The adsorption process for phenol was proved to be exothermic and spontaneous in nature. Thermodynamic parameters such as Gibb's free energy (DeltaG), change in enthalpy (DeltaH) and change in entropy (DeltaS) were calculated. Kinetics studies indicated that phenol uptake onto PDM-1 and PDM-2 followed the pseudo-second order model and the intraparticle diffusion process was a rate-controlling step. Column adsorption runs demonstrated that nearly 100% regeneration efficiency for PDM-2 by 3BV industrial alcohol and the adsorbate phenol can be easily recovered by further distilling. Continuous column adsorption-regeneration cycles indicated negligible capacity loss of PDM-2 during operation. 	J._Hazard._Mater.	D016428 D013485
21926562	20110920	Pharmacological consequence of the A118G ? opioid receptor polymorphism on morphine- and fentanyl-mediated modulation of Ca?? channels in humanized mouse sensory neurons.	The most common functional single nucleotide polymorphism of the human OPRM1 gene, A118G, has been shown to be associated with interindividual differences in opioid analgesic requirements, particularly with morphine, in patients with acute postoperative pain. The purpose of this study was to examine whether this polymorphism would modulate the morphine and fentanyl pharmacological profile of sensory neurons isolated from a humanized mouse model homozygous for either the 118A or 118G allele. The coupling of wild-type and mutant ? opioid receptors to voltage-gated Ca channels after exposure to either ligand was examined by employing the whole cell variant of the patch-clamp technique in acutely dissociated trigeminal ganglion neurons. Morphine-mediated antinociception was measured in mice carrying either the 118AA or 118GG allele. The biophysical parameters (cell size, current density, and peak current amplitude potential) measured from both groups of sensory neurons were not significantly different. In 118GG neurons, morphine was approximately fivefold less potent and 26% less efficacious than that observed in 118AA neurons. On the other hand, the potency and efficacy of fentanyl were similar for both groups of neurons. Morphine-mediated analgesia in 118GG mice was significantly reduced compared with the 118AA mice. This study provides evidence to suggest that the diminished clinical effect observed with morphine in 118G carriers results from an alteration of the receptor's pharmacology in sensory neurons. In addition, the impaired analgesic response with morphine may explain why carriers of this receptor variant have an increased susceptibility to become addicted to opioids.

10526657	19991020	Genetic comparisons of patients with cystic fibrosis with or without meconium ileus. Clinical Centers of the French CF Registry.	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR). Neonatal meconium ileus (MI) occurs in 10-20 percent of newborns with CF. The purpose of this study was to determine the allelic frequencies of the CF mutation in French patients with and without MI and the incidence of MI in 7 homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for mutation of the CFTR gene. Our study confirms the positive association between delta F508, the most frequent CF mutation, G542X mutation and MI and a negative association with G551D. 	Ann._Genet.	D003160 D016428
26555409	20151112	Development of a PubMed Based Search Tool for Identifying Sex and Gender Specific Health Literature.	An effective literature search strategy is critical to achieving the aims of Sex and Gender Specific Health (SGSH): to understand sex and gender differences through research and to effectively incorporate the new knowledge into the clinical decision making process to benefit both male and female patients. The goal of this project was to develop and validate an SGSH literature search tool that is readily and freely available to clinical researchers and practitioners. PubMed, a freely available search engine for the Medline database, was selected as the platform to build the SGSH literature search tool. Combinations of Medical Subject Heading terms, text words, and title words were evaluated for optimal specificity and sensitivity. The search tool was then validated against reference bases compiled for two disease states, diabetes and stroke. Key sex and gender terms and limits were bundled to create a search tool to facilitate PubMed SGSH literature searches. During validation, the search tool retrieved 50 of 94 (53.2%) stroke and 62 of 95 (65.3%) diabetes reference articles selected for validation. A general keyword search of stroke or diabetes combined with sex difference retrieved 33 of 94 (35.1%) stroke and 22 of 95 (23.2%) diabetes reference base articles, with lower sensitivity and specificity for SGSH content. The Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center SGSH PubMed Search Tool provides higher sensitivity and specificity to sex and gender specific health literature. The tool will facilitate research, clinical decision-making, and guideline development relevant to SGSH. 	J_Womens_Health_(Larchmt)	D016428 D013485
18445358	20080501	TCF7L2 genetic defect and type 2 diabetes.	After two decades of limited success, the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is finally being revealed. Within only 2 years, an avalanche of studies identified several genes expressed in pancreatic beta cells and involved in the control of insulin secretion, such as transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), a key element of the Wnt signaling pathway. In Europeans, genome-wide association scans showed that TCF7L2 has been the most important locus predisposing to T2D so far. For the first time, a gene is consistently involved in T2D susceptibility in all major ethnic groups. At the individual level, carrying the TCF7L2 risk allele increases T2D risk 50%. However, at the population level, the attributable risk is lower than 25% and varies with the allele frequency. The presence of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 risk allele increases TCF7L2 gene expression in beta cells, possibly impairing glucagon-like peptide-1-induced insulin secretion and/or the production of new mature beta cells. The tremendous association of TCF7L2 polymorphisms with T2D provides new insights into future genetic predisposition tests but remains the tip of the T2D genetic iceberg. 	Curr._Diab._Rep.

25412680	20141122	Comparative genomics of closely related Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi strains reveals genome dynamics and the acquisition of novel pathogenic elements.	Typhoid fever is an infectious disease of global importance that is caused by Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi). This disease causes an estimated 200,000 deaths per year and remains a serious global health threat. S. Typhi is strictly a human pathogen, and some recovered individuals become long-term carriers who continue to shed the bacteria in their faeces, thus becoming main reservoirs of infection. A comparative genomics analysis combined with a phylogenomic analysis revealed that the strains from the outbreak and carrier were closely related with microvariations and possibly derived from a common ancestor. Additionally, the comparative genomics analysis with all of the other completely sequenced S. Typhi genomes revealed that strains BL196 and CR0044 exhibit unusual genomic variations despite S. Typhi being generally regarded as highly clonal. The two genomes shared distinct chromosomal architectures and uncommon genome features; notably, the presence of a ~10 kb novel genomic island containing uncharacterised virulence-related genes, and zot in particular. Variations were also detected in the T6SS system and genes that were related to SPI-10, insertion sequences, CRISPRs and nsSNPs among the studied genomes. Interestingly, the carrier strain CR0044 harboured far more genetic polymorphisms (83% mutant nsSNPs) compared with the closely related BL196 outbreak strain. Notably, the two highly related virulence-determinant genes, rpoS and tviE, were mutated in strains BL196 and CR0044, respectively, which revealed that the mutation in rpoS is stabilising, while that in tviE is destabilising. These microvariations provide novel insight into the optimisation of genes by the pathogens. However, the sporadic strain was found to be far more conserved compared with the others. The uncommon genomic variations in the two closely related BL196 and CR0044 strains suggests that S. Typhi is more diverse than previously thought. Our study has demonstrated that the pathogen is continually acquiring new genes through horizontal gene transfer in the process of host adaptation, providing novel insight into its unusual genomic dynamics. The understanding of these strains and virulence factors, and particularly the strain that is associated with the large outbreak and the less studied asymptomatic Typhi carrier in the population, will have important impact on disease control.

24767283	20140429	LEOPARD syndrome: clinical dilemmas in differential diagnosis of RASopathies.	Diagnosis within RASopathies still represents a challenge. Nevertheless, many efforts have been made by clinicians to identify specific clinical features which might help in differentiating one disorder from another. Here, we describe a child initially diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome. The follow-up of the proband, the clinical evaluation of his father together with a gene-by-gene testing approach led us to the proper diagnosis. We report a 8-year-old male with multiple caf?-au-lait macules, several lentigines and dysmorphic features that suggest Noonan syndrome initially diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome. However, after a few years of clinical and ophthalmological follow-up, the absence of typical features of Neurofibromatosis type 1 and the lack of NF1 mutation led us to reconsider the original diagnosis. A new examination of the patient and his similarly affected father, who was initially referred as healthy, led us to suspect LEOPARD syndrome, The diagnosis was then confirmed by the occurrence in both patients of a heterozygous mutation c.1403 C?&gt;?T, p.(Thr468Met), of PTPN11. Subsequently, the proband was also found to have type-1 Arnold-Chiari malformation in association with syringomyelia. Our experience suggests that differential clinical diagnosis among RASopathies remains ambiguous and raises doubts on the current diagnostic clinical criteria. In some cases, genetic tests represent the only conclusive proof for a correct diagnosis and, consequently, for establishing individual prognosis and providing adequate follow-up. Thus, molecular testing represents an essential tool in differential diagnosis of RASophaties. This view is further strengthened by the increasing accessibility of new sequencing techniques.Finally, to our knowledge, the described case represents the third report of the occurrence of Arnold Chiari malformation and the second description of syringomyelia with LEOPARD syndrome.

24587291	20140304	Independent expansion of zincin metalloproteinases in Onygenales fungi may be associated with their pathogenicity.	To get a comprehensive view of fungal M35 family (deuterolysin) and M36 family (fungalysin) genes, we conducted genome-wide investigations and phylogenetic analyses of genes in these two families from 50 sequenced Ascomycota fungi with different life styles. Large variations in the number of M35 family and M36 family genes were found among different fungal genomes, indicating that these two gene families have been highly dynamic through fungal evolution. Moreover, we found obvious expansions of Meps in two families of Onygenales: Onygenaceae and Arthodermataceae, whereas species in family Ajellomycetace did not show expansion of these genes. The strikingly different gene duplication and loss patterns in Onygenales may be associated with the different pathogenicity of these species. Interestingly, likelihood ratio tests (LRT) of both M35 family and M36 family genes suggested that several branches leading to the duplicated genes in dermatophytic and Coccidioides fungi had signatures of positive selection, indicating that the duplicated Mep genes have likely diverged functionally to play important roles during the evolution of pathogenicity of dermatophytic and Coccidioides fungi. The potentially positively selected residues discovered by our analysis may have contributed to the development of new physiological functions of the duplicated Mep genes in dermatophytic fungi and Coccidioides species. Our study adds to the current knowledge of the evolution of Meps in fungi and also establishes a theoretical foundation for future experimental investigations. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
26359410	20150912	Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis Following Olanzapine Treatment and 759C/T Polymorphism of HTR2C Gene: A Case Report.	Acute pancreatitis can be attributed to numerous potential causes, such as alcohol abuse, chololithiasis, infection, lesions, tumors, hypercalcemia, hyperlipidemia, and medications. Among psychotropic medications, the use of some atypical antipsychotics, such as clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone, has been implicated in the development of acute pancreatitis, although the underlying mechanism has not been clarified. We describe the case of a young man with no other major medical problems, alcohol abuse or predisposing factors, who developed acute necrotizing pancreatitis following olanzapine administration, possibly through severe elevation of serum triglycerides. A pharmacogenomic analysis revealed the presence of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 2C, G protein-coupled (HTR2C) -759C genotype which is related to increased risk for metabolic syndrome.

23173096	20121123	NANOGP8: evolution of a human-specific retro-oncogene.	NANOGP8 is a human (Homo sapiens) retrogene, expressed predominantly in cancer cells where its protein product is tumorigenic. It arose through retrotransposition from its parent gene, NANOG, which is expressed predominantly in embryonic stem cells. Based on identification of fixed and polymorphic variants in a genetically diverse set of human NANOG and NANOGP8 sequences, we estimated the evolutionary origin of NANOGP8 at approximately 0.9 to 2.5 million years ago, more recent than previously estimated. We also discovered that NANOGP8 arose from a derived variant allele of NANOG containing a 22-nucleotide pair deletion in the 3' UTR, which has remained polymorphic in modern humans. Evidence from our experiments indicates that NANOGP8 is fixed in modern humans even though its parent allele is polymorphic. The presence of NANOGP8-specific sequences in Neanderthal reads provided definitive evidence that NANOGP8 is also present in the Neanderthal genome. Some variants between the reference sequences of NANOG and NANOGP8 utilized in cancer research to distinguish RT-PCR products are polymorphic within NANOG or NANOGP8 and thus are not universally reliable as distinguishing features. NANOGP8 was inserted in reverse orientation into the LTR region of an SVA retroelement that arose in a human-chimpanzee-gorilla common ancestor after divergence of the orangutan ancestral lineage. Transcription factor binding sites within and beyond this LTR may promote expression of NANOGP8 in cancer cells, although current evidence is inferential. The fact that NANOGP8 is a human-specific retro-oncogene may partially explain the higher genetic predisposition for cancer in humans compared with other primates. 	G3_(Bethesda)	D016428 D013485
22337883	20120217	The transcription factor Erg controls endothelial cell quiescence by repressing activity of nuclear factor (NF)-?B p65.	The interaction of transcription factors with specific DNA sequences is critical for activation of gene expression programs. In endothelial cells (EC), the transcription factor NF-?B is important in the switch from quiescence to activation, and is tightly controlled to avoid excessive inflammation and organ damage. Here we describe a novel mechanism that controls the activation of NF-?B in EC. The transcription factor Erg, the most highly expressed ETS member in resting EC, controls quiescence by repressing proinflammatory gene expression. Focusing on intercellular adhesion molecule 1(ICAM)-1 as a model, we identify two ETS binding sites (EBS -118 and -181) within the ICAM-1 promoter required for Erg-mediated repression. We show that Erg binds to both EBS -118 and EBS -181, the latter located within the NF-?B binding site. Interestingly, inhibition of Erg expression in quiescent EC results in increased NF-?B-dependent ICAM-1 expression, indicating that Erg represses basal NF-?B activity. Erg prevents NF-?B p65 from binding to the ICAM-1 promoter, suggesting a direct mechanism of interference. Gene set enrichment analysis of transcriptome profiles of Erg and NF-?B-dependent genes, together with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies, reveals that this mechanism is common to other proinflammatory genes, including cIAP-2 and IL-8. These results identify a role for Erg as a gatekeeper controlling vascular inflammation, thus providing an important barrier to protect against inappropriate endothelial activation. 	J._Biol._Chem.

23151860	20121116	+276 G/T single nucleotide polymorphism of the adiponectin gene is associated with the susceptibility to biliary atresia.	Biliary atresia (BA) is an intractable neonatal inflammatory and obliterative cholangiopathy, leading to progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis. Adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory adipokine, is known to play a possible role in liver diseases. The objective of our study was to determine the relationship between adiponectin gene polymorphisms and BA susceptibility. A total of 106 BA patients and 107 healthy controls were included in this study. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the adiponectin gene, +45T/G (rs2241766) and +276G/T (rs1501299), were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Genotype distributions of +45 T/G and +276 G/T SNPs were seen in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for both BA patients and controls. The frequency of the G/G genotype at +276G/T was significantly higher in BA patients than in the controls (P=0.009). Regarding +45T/ G in BA patients, the frequency of the T/T genotype tended to be lower than in the controls, but the difference was not significant. Moreover, the G allele at +276G/T in BA patients was more common than in the controls (P=0.0043). In contrast, the frequency of the T allele at +45T/G was not significantly different between BA patients and the controls. None of the haplotypes studied was found to significantly influence the risk of BA. +276G/T SNP is strongly associated with BA, particularly with the G allele. We postulate that the +276G/T adiponectin gene polymorphism confers increased susceptibility to BA. 	World_J_Pediatr	D016428 D013485
2884570	19870503	An amino-acid substitution involved in phenylketonuria is in linkage disequilibrium with DNA haplotype 2.	Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive human genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH, phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase, EC 1.14.16.1). PKU is a common inborn error of amino-acid metabolism in caucasian populations and approximately 1 in 50 individuals are carriers of a PKU allele. To define the molecular basis of PKU, we characterized twelve restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) haplotypes of the PAH locus in the northern European population and observed that 90% of the PKU alleles in this population are confined to four common RFLP haplotypes. We have recently reported a splicing mutation in the PAH gene that is associated with RFLP haplotype 3 which is present at about 40% of mutant alleles. We now report the molecular lesion associated with the RFLP haplotype 2 mutant allele. This defect is caused by a C-to-T transition in exon 12 resulting in an amino-acid substitution (Arg to Trp) at residue 408 of PAH. Direct hybridization analysis of the point mutation using a specific oligonucleotide probe demonstrated that this mutation is also in linkage disequilibrium with RFLP haplotype 2 alleles that make up about 20% of mutant PAH genes.

In this study, we sought to investigate the putative association of the oxidized metabolites derived from linoleic acid (OXFAs) with pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We studied 80 obese adolescents (age 13.3 ? 3.31 years; body mass index 33.0 ? 6.79 kg/m(2)), who underwent an oral glucose tolerance test, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure the hepatic fat content, and the measurement of OXFAs and caspase-cleaved Citokeratin18 fragment (CK-18), a robust biomarker of liver injury. In this study, we show that only in subjects with hepatic steatosis, the OXFAs are associated with the CK-18 and that this association is modulated by the PNPLA3 rs738409 variant. We also show that most of the OXFAs are associated with a lower insulin secretion and that adolescents with T2D have higher levels of OXFAs than subjects with impaired or normal glucose tolerance. These observations lead to the hypothesis that the OXFAs may be the pathogenic link between liver injury and T2D and that the novel therapeutic opportunities targeting the OXFAs are possible in adolescents with early-onset NAFLD and T2D.

21303558	20110210	A framework for automatic heart sound analysis without segmentation.	A new framework for heart sound analysis is proposed. One of the most difficult processes in heart sound analysis is segmentation, due to interference form murmurs. Equal number of cardiac cycles were extracted from heart sounds with different heart rates using information from envelopes of autocorrelation functions without the need to label individual fundamental heart sounds (FHS). The complete method consists of envelope detection, calculation of cardiac cycle lengths using auto-correlation of envelope signals, features extraction using discrete wavelet transform, principal component analysis, and classification using neural network bagging predictors. The proposed method was tested on a set of heart sounds obtained from several on-line databases and recorded with an electronic stethoscope. Geometric mean was used as performance index. Average classification performance using ten-fold cross-validation was 0.92 for noise free case, 0.90 under white noise with 10 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and 0.90 under impulse noise up to 0.3 s duration. The proposed method showed promising results and high noise robustness to a wide range of heart sounds. However, more tests are needed to address any bias that may have been introduced by different sources of heart sounds in the current training set, and to concretely validate the method. Further work include building a new training set recorded from actual patients, then further evaluate the method based on this new training set. 	Biomed_Eng_Online	D016428 D013485
23836442	20130710	Polymorphisms and expression of the WNT8A gene in Hirschsprung's disease.	Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is a congenital disorder characterized by an absence of intrinsic ganglion cells in the nerves forming the plexus of the lower intestine. The WNT signaling pathway is considered to play an important role in embryonic development. In the present study, we analyzed 2 polymorphisms of the WNT8A gene (rs78301778 and rs6596422) to determine their association with the risk and development of HSCR. Allele frequencies and genotype distributions were analyzed by sequence analysis in patients with HSCR and normal controls. Using real-time PCR, western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry, we detected the mRNA and protein expression of WNT8A in patients with HSCR. The data indicated that the differences in genotype distributions and allele frequencies of rs78301778 and rs6596422 between various clinical classi?cations were statistically signi?cant. The analysis of the mRNA and protein expression of WNT8A revealed that the expression of WNT8A was increased in the stenotic colon segments compared with the normal colon segments. In conclusion, the data presented in this study suggest that the WNT8A gene is involved in the susceptibility to HSCR, and plays an important role in the occurrence and development of HSCR. These findings warrant further investigation. 	Int._J._Mol._Med.	D016428 D013485
26090309	20150620	Impact of particle size, temperature and humic acid on sorption of uranium in agricultural soils of Punjab.	Batch experiments were conducted to study the sorption of uranium (U) onto soil in deionised water as a function of its dosage, temperature and humic acid (HA). Furthermore, soils were characterized for particle sizes in the form of sand (&gt;63??m), silt (&gt;2-&lt;63??m) and clay (&lt;2??m). The textural analysis revealed that soils were admixture of mainly sand and silt along with a small abundance of clay. X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that clay factions ranging from 2.8 to 5% dominated by quartz and montmorillonite. Experimental results indicated that soil with high abundance of clays and low sand content has relatively high U sorption which could be due to availability of high exchange surfaces for metal ions. However, at low concentration of HA, sorption of U was maximum and thereby decreased as the HA concentration increased. The maximum sorption may be due to increase in the negative active surface sites on HA and further decrease could be attributed to saturation of sorption site and surface precipitation. Conversely, the thermodynamic data suggested that the sorption is spontaneous and enhanced at higher temperature. 	Springerplus	D016428
27014578	20160326	Successful intrauterine treatment of a patient with cobalamin C defect.	Cobalamin C (cblC) defect is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder that affects cobalamin metabolism. Patients are treated with hydroxycobalamin to ameliorate the clinical features of early-onset disease and prevent clinical symptoms in late-onset disease. Here we describe a patient in whom prenatal maternal treatment with 30?mg/week hydroxycobalamin and 5?mg/day folic acid from week 15 of pregnancy prevented disease manifestation in a girl who is now 11?years old with normal IQ and only mild ophthalmic findings. The affected older sister received postnatal treatment only and is severely intellectually disabled with severe ophthalmic symptoms. This case highlights the potential of early, high-dose intrauterine treatment in a fetus affected by the cblC defect. 	Mol_Genet_Metab_Rep	D016428
23023380	20121002	Toll like receptor-4 896A/G gene variation, a risk factor for migraine headaches.	The pathogenesis of migraine involves immune-mediated mechanisms in the vascular endothelium. Toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4) is a signaling receptor of innate immunity which plays a role in various neuropathologies related to neuron inflammation. This case/control study is aimed to investigate whether TLR-4 896A/G variation is related to migraine headaches in an Iranian population. A total of 170 migraine patients (130 females, mean age 33.24 ? 11 years) and 170 age, sex, and ethnicity matched healthy controls (118 females, mean age of 31 ? 10 years) were recruited. Genotyping was carried out using the tetra primer amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR. The frequency of G allele was higher in migraine patients than the controls (15% vs. 4.7%; p&lt;0.0001). Interestingly, the distribution of heterozygous 896A/G genotype statistically differed between migraineurs and controls (25.3% vs. 8.2%, p=0.00002, OR 3.87, 95% CI; 2.02-7.4). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that G allele in affected female migraineurs is an independent factor associated with increased risk of migraine (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.23-8.24, p=0.01). Our results showed TLR-4 polymorphism as a genetic risk factor for migraine. However, further studies in different populations are required to elucidate the precise role of TLR-4 896A/G mutation in susceptibility to migraine. 	Iran_J_Immunol	D016428 D013485
21176923	20101224	Functional parkin promoter polymorphism in Parkinson's disease: new data and meta-analysis.	A functional SNP (rs9347683) in the promoter region of the parkin gene had been implicated as a risk factor in older Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Using a case-control methodology, we genotyped the SNP in the promoter region of the parkin gene to investigate their association with risk of PD and conducted a pooled analysis of published papers in the English literature. A total of 1087 study subjects comprising 595 patients with PD and 492 unrelated healthy controls were recruited. The frequency of &quot;GG&quot; genotype in the elderly sub-group (? 65 years) was higher in PD compared to controls (OR=1.11) though we did not observe any difference in allele or genotype frequencies between the cases and the controls (P&gt;0.05) in the overall PD population. Those with genotype &quot;GG&quot; were associated with a higher Hoehn-Yahr stage compared with PD patients carrying &quot;GT&quot;+&quot;TT&quot; (P=0.040). A pooled analysis involving more than &gt;3000 subjects revealed that the frequency of genotypes in PD patients did not differ from the controls (OR=0.98, 95% CI: 0.86-1.12). However, in the group ? 65 years of age, the &quot;GG&quot; genotype was higher in PD (OR=1.51, 95% CI: 1.06-2.13, P=0.020) among the ethnic Chinese. While we did not demonstrate a significant association of the parkin promoter polymorphism with PD in our sample, the pooled data suggest that the variant may increase the risk of PD in the more elderly population among the ethnic Chinese, suggesting possible ethnicity-specific effect. Further in vitro and in vivo studies to evaluate this functional parkin variant are warranted. 	J._Neurol._Sci.	D016428 D017418 D013485 D016454
