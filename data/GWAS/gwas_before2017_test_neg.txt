17171662	20061216	No association between the Ser9Gly polymorphism of the dopamine D3 receptor gene and schizophrenia in a Spanish sample.	This study aims to further evaluate the controversial association between the Ser9Gly polymorphism in codon 9 of the D3 dopamine receptor gene (DRD3) and schizophrenia in psychiatric inpatients acutely hospitalized in two general hospitals in Madrid, Spain. The Ser9Gly polymorphism of the DRD3 was examined in 178 schizophrenic patients, 286 patients with other psychiatric diagnoses, and 132 controls recruited. Genotype frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. No association was found between schizophrenia and the Ser9Gly polymorphism of the D3 dopamine receptor gene.

25695052	20150220	A complex genome-microRNA interplay in human mitochondria.	Small noncoding regulatory RNA exist in wide spectrum of organisms ranging from prokaryote bacteria to humans. In human, a systematic search for noncoding RNA is mainly limited to the nuclear and cytosolic compartments. To investigate whether endogenous small regulatory RNA are present in cell organelles, human mitochondrial genome was also explored for prediction of precursor microRNA (pre-miRNA) and mature miRNA (miRNA) sequences. Six novel miRNA were predicted from the organelle genome by bioinformatics analysis. The structures are conserved in other five mammals including chimp, orangutan, mouse, rat, and rhesus genome. Experimentally, six human miRNA are well accumulated or deposited in human mitochondria. Three of them are expressed less prominently in Northern analysis. To ascertain their presence in human skeletal muscles, total RNA was extracted from enriched mitochondria by an immunomagnetic method. The expression of six novel pre-miRNA and miRNA was confirmed by Northern blot analysis; however, low level of remaining miRNA was found by sensitive Northern analysis. Their presence is further confirmed by real time RT-PCR. The six miRNA find their multiple targets throughout the human genome in three different types of software. The luciferase assay was used to confirm that MT-RNR2 gene was the potential target of hsa-miR-mit3 and hsa-miR-mit4. 	Biomed_Res_Int	D016428 D013485
26433589	20151005	Cerebral Vasculitis in X-linked Lymphoproliferative Disease Cured by Matched Unrelated Cord Blood Transplant.	Vasculitis occurs rarely in association with X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP). There are four published cases of non-EBV XLP-associated cerebral vasculitis reported, none of whom have survived without major cognitive impairment. A 9-year old boy initially presented aged 5 years with a restrictive joint disease. He subsequently developed dysgammaglobulinemia, episodic severe pneumonitis, aplastic anaemia, gastritis and cerebral vasculitis. A diagnosis of XLP was made, based on flow cytometric analysis and the identification of a novel mutation in SH2D1A, c.96G&gt;C. No peripheral blood lymphocyte clonal proliferation was identified and he was EBV negative, although human herpes virus-7 (HHV7) was detected repeatedly in his cerebrospinal fluid. He underwent a reduced intensity unrelated umbilical cord blood transplant, but failed to engraft. A second 5/6 matched cord gave 100 % donor engraftment. Complications included BK virus-associated haemorrhagic cystitis, a possible NK-cell mediated immune reconstitution syndrome and post-transplant anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, the latter treated with cyclophosphamide and rituximab. At +450 days post-transplant he is in remission from his vasculitis and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, and HHV-7 has remained undetectable. This is the second published description of joint disease in XLP, and only the fourth case of non-EBV associated cerebral vasculitis in XLP, as well as being the first to be successfully treated for this manifestation. This case raises specific questions about vasculitis in XLP, in particular the potential relevance of HHV-7 to the pathogenesis. 	J._Clin._Immunol.	D002363 D016428
18851755	20081015	Intraspecific divergence in sperm morphology of the green sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis: implications for selection in broadcast spawners.	Sperm morphology can be highly variable among species, but less is known about patterns of population differentiation within species. Most studies of sperm morphometric variation are done in species with internal fertilization, where sexual selection can be mediated by complex mating behavior and the environment of the female reproductive tract. Far less is known about patterns of sperm evolution in broadcast spawners, where reproductive dynamics are largely carried out at the gametic level. We investigated variation in sperm morphology of a broadcast spawner, the green sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis), within and among spawnings of an individual, among individuals within a population, and among populations. We also examined population-level variation between two reproductive seasons for one population. We then compared among-population quantitative genetic divergence (QST) for sperm characters to divergence at neutral microsatellite markers (FST). All sperm traits except total length showed strong patterns of high diversity among populations, as did overall sperm morphology quantified using multivariate analysis. We also found significant differences in almost all traits among individuals in all populations. Head length, axoneme length, and total length had high within-male repeatability across multiple spawnings. Only sperm head width had significant within-population variation across two reproductive seasons. We found signatures of directional selection on head length and head width, with strong selection possibly acting on head length between the Pacific and West Atlantic populations. We also discuss the strengths and limitations of the QST-FST comparison. Sperm morphology in S. droebachiensis is highly variable, both among populations and among individuals within populations, and has low variation within an individual across multiple spawnings. Selective pressures acting among populations may differ from those acting within, with directional selection implicated in driving divergence among populations and balancing selection as a possible mechanism for producing variability among males. Sexual selection in broadcast spawners may be mediated by different processes from those acting on internal fertilizers. Selective divergence in sperm head length among populations is associated with ecological differences among populations that may play a large role in mediating sexual selection in this broadcast spawner.

22984420	20120918	Agonistic and antagonistic roles for TNIK and MINK in non-canonical and canonical Wnt signalling.	Wnt signalling is a key regulatory factor in animal development and homeostasis and plays an important role in the establishment and progression of cancer. Wnt signals are predominantly transduced via the Frizzled family of serpentine receptors to two distinct pathways, the canonical ?-catenin pathway and a non-canonical pathway controlling planar cell polarity and convergent extension. Interference between these pathways is an important determinant of cellular and phenotypic responses, but is poorly understood. Here we show that TNIK (Traf2 and Nck-interacting kinase) and MINK (Misshapen/NIKs-related kinase) MAP4K signalling kinases are integral components of both canonical and non-canonical pathways in Xenopus. xTNIK and xMINK interact and are proteolytically cleaved in vivo to generate Kinase domain fragments that are active in signal transduction, and Citron-NIK-Homology (CNH) Domain fragments that are suppressive. The catalytic activity of the Kinase domain fragments of both xTNIK and xMINK mediate non-canonical signalling. However, while the Kinase domain fragments of xTNIK also mediate canonical signalling, the analogous fragments derived from xMINK strongly antagonize this signalling. Our data suggest that the proteolytic cleavage of xTNIK and xMINK determines their respective activities and is an important factor in controlling the balance between canonical and non-canonical Wnt signalling in vivo.

23565265	20130409	Evidence of new risk genetic factor to systemic lupus erythematosus: the UBASH3A gene.	The ubiquitin associated and Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain containing A (UBASH3a) is a suppressor of T-cell receptor signaling, underscoring antigen presentation to T-cells as a critical shared mechanism of diseases pathogenesis. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the UBASH3a gene influence the susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Caucasian populations. We evaluated five UBASH3a polymorphisms (rs2277798, rs2277800, rs9976767, rs13048049 and rs17114930), using TaqMan? allelic discrimination assays, in a discovery cohort that included 906 SLE patients and 1165 healthy controls from Spain. The SNPs that exhibit statistical significance difference were evaluated in a German replication cohort of 360 SLE patients and 379 healthy controls. The case-control analysis in the Spanish population showed a significant association between the rs9976767 and SLE (Pc?=?9.9E-03 OR?=?1.21 95%CI?=?1.07-1.37) and a trend of association for the rs2277798 analysis (P?=?0.09 OR?=?0.9 95%CI?=?0.79-1.02). The replication in a German cohort and the meta-analysis confirmed that the rs9976767 (Pc?=?0.02; Pc?=?2.4E-04, for German cohort and meta-analysis, respectively) and rs2277798 (Pc?=?0.013; Pc?=?4.7E-03, for German cohort and meta-analysis, respectively) UBASH3a variants are susceptibility factors for SLE. Finally, a conditional regression analysis suggested that the most likely genetic variation responsible for the association was the rs9976767 polymorphism. Our results suggest that UBASH3a gene plays a role in the susceptibility to SLE. Moreover, our study indicates that UBASH3a can be considered as a common genetic factor in autoimmune diseases.

25476429	20141206	[CREBBP gene mutation in two boys with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome].	To investigate the clinical and genetic features of 2 patients with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Using next generation sequencing (NGS) the CREBBP and EP300 genes of 2 children who were diagnosed as Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The mutations identified by NGS were verified by PCR were analyzed. The 2 patients at the age of 5 months and 4.5 years manifested short stature (the height were 60 cm and 99 cm respectively), low hairline, thick and dense hair and eyebrows, long lash, epicanthus of both eyes, protruded supercilliary arch, broad and flat thumbs and halluces, and particular facial abnormalities. Patient 2 had language retardation besides. One missense mutation of c.3535A&gt;G, p.Ser1179Gly was found in CREBBP gene in patient 1 and one microdeletion mutation of c.4995_4999delCGCCT, p. Ala1666Pro fs66x was found inpatient 2. Both mutations were reported for the first time. Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is characterized by mental and growth retardation, wide and flat thumbs and first toes, and dysmorphic facial features. CREBBP is one of the causative genes. Mutation detection on CREBBP gene can confirm the diagnosis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. 	Zhonghua_Er_Ke_Za_Zhi	D016428
26742696	20160109	Characterization of Rv0888, a Novel Extracellular Nuclease from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.	Bacterial extracellular nucleases play important roles in virulence, biofilm formation, utilization of extracellular DNA as a nutrient, and degradation of neutrophil DNA extracellular traps. However, there is no current data available for extracellular nucleases derived from M. tuberculosis. Herein, we have identified and characterized Rv0888, an extracellular nuclease in M. tuberculosis. The protein was overexpressed in E. coli, and the purified Rv0888 protein was found to require divalent cations for activity, with an optimal temperature and pH of 41??C and 6.5, respectively. Further results demonstrated that Rv0888 nuclease activity could be inhibited by four Chinese medicine monomers. Based on sequence analysis, Rv0888 nuclease exhibited no homology with any known extracellular nucleases, indicating that Rv0888 is a novel nuclease. Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that the H353, D387, and D438 residues play catalytic roles in Rv0888. In vivo infection studies confirmed that Rv0888 is required for infection and is related to pathogenicity, as the persistent ability of recombinant Mycobacterium smegmatis (rMS) Rv0888NS/MS and Rv0888S/MS is significantly higher than pMV262/MS in the lung tissue, and the Rv0888NS/MS and Rv0888S/MS could produce pathological changes in the mice lung. These results show that Rv0888 is relevant to pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D013485
21738606	20110709	A flexible approach for highly multiplexed candidate gene targeted resequencing.	We have developed an integrated strategy for targeted resequencing and analysis of gene subsets from the human exome for variants. Our capture technology is geared towards resequencing gene subsets substantially larger than can be done efficiently with simplex or multiplex PCR but smaller in scale than exome sequencing. We describe all the steps from the initial capture assay to single nucleotide variant (SNV) discovery. The capture methodology uses in-solution 80-mer oligonucleotides. To provide optimal flexibility in choosing human gene targets, we designed an in silico set of oligonucleotides, the Human OligoExome, that covers the gene exons annotated by the Consensus Coding Sequencing Project (CCDS). This resource is openly available as an Internet accessible database where one can download capture oligonucleotides sequences for any CCDS gene and design custom capture assays. Using this resource, we demonstrated the flexibility of this assay by custom designing capture assays ranging from 10 to over 100 gene targets with total capture sizes from over 100 Kilobases to nearly one Megabase. We established a method to reduce capture variability and incorporated indexing schemes to increase sample throughput. Our approach has multiple applications that include but are not limited to population targeted resequencing studies of specific gene subsets, validation of variants discovered in whole genome sequencing surveys and possible diagnostic analysis of disease gene subsets. We also present a cost analysis demonstrating its cost-effectiveness for large population studies. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061 D013485
25867060	20150414	Role of Runx2 phosphorylation in prostate cancer and association with metastatic disease.	The osteogenic transcription factor, Runx2, is abnormally expressed in prostate cancer (PCa) and associated with metastatic disease. During bone development, Runx2 is activated by signals known to be hyperactive in PCa including the RAS/MAP kinase pathway, which phosphorylates Runx2 on multiple serine residues including S301 and S319 (equivalent to S294 and S312 in human Runx2). This study examines the role of these phosphorylation sites in PCa. Runx2 was preferentially expressed in more invasive PCa cell lines (PC3&gt;C4-2B&gt;LNCaP). Furthermore, analysis using a P-S319-Runx2-specific antibody revealed that the ratio of P-S319-Runx2/total Runx2 as well as P-ERK/total ERK was highest in PC3 followed by C4-2B and LNCaP cells. These results were confirmed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, which showed a higher percentage of PC3 cells staining positive for P-S319-Runx2 relative to C4-2B and LNCaP cells. Phosphorylated Runx2 had an exclusively nuclear localization. When expressed in prostate cell lines, wild-type Runx2 increased metastasis-associated gene expression, in vitro migratory and invasive activity as well as in vivo growth of tumor cell xenografts. In contrast, S301A/S319A phosphorylation site mutations greatly attenuated these Runx2 responses. Analysis of tissue microarrays from 129 patients revealed strong nuclear staining with the P-S319-Runx2 antibody in primary PCas and metastases. P-S319-Runx2 staining was positively correlated with Gleason score and occurrence of lymph node metastases while little or no Runx2 phosphorylation was seen in normal prostate, benign prostate hyperplasia or prostatitis indicating that Runx2 S319 phosphorylation is closely associated with PCa induction and progression towards an aggressive phenotype. These studies establish the importance of Runx2 phosphorylation in prostate tumor growth and highlight its value as a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target.

17556358	20070609	Phenotypic and structural analyses of hepatitis C virus NS3 protease Arg155 variants: sensitivity to telaprevir (VX-950) and interferon alpha.	Telaprevir (VX-950) is a highly selective, potent inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3.4A serine protease. It has demonstrated strong antiviral activity in patients chronically infected with genotype 1 HCV when dosed alone or in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a. Substitutions of Arg(155) of the HCV NS3 protease domain have been previously detected in HCV isolates from some patients during telaprevir dosing. In this study, Arg(155) was replaced with various residues in genotype 1a protease domain proteins and in genotype 1b HCV subgenomic replicons. Characterization of both the purified enzymes and reconstituted replicon cells demonstrated that substitutions of Arg(155) with these residues conferred low level resistance to telaprevir (&lt;25-fold). An x-ray structure of genotype 1a HCV protease domain with the R155K mutation, in a complex with an NS4A co-factor peptide, was determined at a resolution of 2.5A. The crystal structure of the R155K protease is essentially identical to that of the wild-type apoenzyme (Protein Data Bank code 1A1R) except for the side chain of mutated residue 155. Telaprevir was docked into the x-ray structure of the R155K protease, and modeling analysis suggests that the P2 group of telaprevir loses several hydrophobic contacts with the Lys(155) side chain. It was demonstrated that replicon cells containing substitutions at NS3 protease residue 155 remain fully sensitive to interferon alpha or ribavirin. Finally, these variant replicons were shown to have reduced replication capacity compared with the wild-type HCV replicon in cells. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428
23695387	20130523	Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can improve outcome of colorectal cancer patients with unresectable metastasis.	The prognosis for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with unresectable metastases is dismal. This study compared outcomes of different metastatic treatments. We collected 653 CRC cases with unresectable metastases including 490 cases receiving primary tumor resection then chemotherapy (surgery group) and 163 patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy then did or did not receive operations (chemotherapy (C/T) group) from 2004 to 2010. The statistical endpoint was overall survival from the date of diagnosis. In the C/T group, 124 (76%) patients received an operation after 9.0???6.2 months of chemotherapy, including 57 (34.9%) patients with curative surgery. The C/T group had a higher proportion of T4 lesions (37.4%) than the surgery group (26.9%). Survival of the C/T group was longer than that of the surgery group (28.8???8.8 vs. 24.3???7.5 months; p?=?0.043). Survival of 57 patients receiving curative surgery was 36.0???6.3 months, which was significantly better than that of the 67 patients receiving palliative resection (25.2???5.6, p?&lt;?0.001). In the surgery group, 42 (8.6%) patients received curative metastasectomy after 8.5???7.1 months of postoperative chemotherapy; survival was 30.8???7.8 months, which was significantly better than that of patients who did not receive metastasectomy (22.4???6.3 months). In multivariate analysis, poor differentiation, lymphovascular invasion, isolated cancer nodules, clinical risk score, and curative surgery were independent prognostic factors of overall patient survival. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can improve outcome of CRC patients with unresectable metastases. 	Int_J_Colorectal_Dis	D016428
16502006	20060228	Function of the tunnel in acetylcoenzyme A synthase/carbon monoxide dehydrogenase.	Acetylcoenzyme A synthase/carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (ACS/CODH) contains two Ni-Fe-S active-site clusters (called A and C) connected by a tunnel through which CO and CO2 migrate. Site-directed mutants A578C, L215F, and A219F were designed to block the tunnel at different points along the region between the two C-clusters. Two other mutant proteins F70W and N101Q were designed to block the region that connects the tunnel at the betabeta interface with a water channel also located at that interface. Purified mutant proteins were assayed for Ni/Fe content and examined by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Analyses indicate that same metal clusters found in wild-type (WT) ACS/CODH (i.e., the A-, B-, C-, and probably D-clusters) are properly assembled in the mutant enzymes. Stopped-flow kinetics revealed that these centers in the mutants are rapidly reducible by dithionite but are only slowly reducible by CO, suggesting an impaired ability of CO to migrate through the tunnel to the C-cluster. Relative to the WT enzyme, mutant proteins exhibited little CODH or ACS activity (using CO2 as a substrate). Some ACS activity was observed when CO was a substrate, but not the cooperative CO inhibition effect characteristic of WT ACS/CODH. These results suggest that CO and CO2 enter and exit the enzyme at the water channel along the betabeta subunit interface. They also suggest two pathways for CO during synthesis of acetylcoenzyme A, including one in which CO enters the enzyme and migrates through the tunnel before binding at the A-cluster, and another in which CO binds the A-cluster directly from the solvent.

8605978	19960318	Electrophysiological properties of the hypokalaemic periodic paralysis mutation (R528H) of the skeletal muscle alpha 1s subunit as expressed in mouse L cells.	Hypokalaemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) is an autosomal dominant muscle disease which has been linked to point mutations in the skeletal muscle L-type calcium channel alpha 1 subunit (alpha 1s). Here, we have introduced one of the point mutations causing HypoPP (R528H) into cDNA of the rabbit alpha 1s. Expression of either the wild-type alpha 1s or the mutant R528H alpha 1s (alpha 1s-R528H) subunits was obtained in mouse Ltk- cells using a selectable expression vector. The alpha 1s-R528H subunit led to the expression of functional L-type Ca2+ channels. Corresponding whole-cell Ba2+ currents exhibit very slow activation and inactivation kinetics, typical for recombinant skeletal Ca2+ channel currents. Voltage-dependent activation and inactivation properties were similar for alpha 1s- and alpha 1s-R528H, as well as their sensitivity to the dihydropyridine agonist Bay K 8644. Differences in alpha 1s- and alpha 1s-R528H-directed channels reside in the Ba2+ current density, which was significantly reduced 3.2 fold in cells expressing alpha 1s-R528H. It was concluded that the R528H mutation af alpha 1s results in minor differences in the electrophysiological properties but significantly reduces the whole-cell Ca2+ channel current in its amplitude.

25897119	20150422	Repression of hypoxia-inducible factor ? signaling by Set7-mediated methylation.	Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1? and HIF-2? are the main regulators of cellular responses to hypoxia. Post-translational modifications of HIF-1? and 2? are necessary to modulate their functions. The methylation of non-histone proteins by Set7, an SET domain-containing lysine methyltransferase, is a novel regulatory mechanism to control cell protein function in response to various cellular stresses. In this study, we show that Set7 methylates HIF-1? at lysine 32 and HIF-2? at lysine K29; this methylation inhibits the expression of HIF-1?/2? targets by impairing the occupancy of HIF-? on hypoxia response element of HIF target gene promoter. Set7-null fibroblasts and the cells with shRNA-knocked down Set7 exhibit upregulated HIF target genes. Set7 inhibitor blocks HIF-1?/2? methylation to enhance HIF target gene expression. Set7-null fibroblasts and the cells with shRNA-knocked down Set7 or inhibition of Set7 by the inhibitor subjected to hypoxia display an increased glucose uptake and intracellular adenosine triphosphate levels. These findings define a novel modification of HIF-1?/2? and demonstrate that Set7-medited lysine methylation negatively regulates HIF-? transcriptional activity and HIF-1?-mediated glucose homeostasis.

26914862	20160226	Comprehensive Structure-Activity Relationship of Triantennary N-Acetylgalactosamine Conjugated Antisense Oligonucleotides for Targeted Delivery to Hepatocytes.	The comprehensive structure-activity relationships of triantennary GalNAc conjugated ASOs for enhancing potency via ASGR mediated delivery to hepatocytes is reported. Seventeen GalNAc clusters were assembled from six distinct scaffolds and attached to ASOs. The resulting ASO conjugates were evaluated in ASGR binding assays, in primary hepatocytes, and in mice. Five structurally distinct GalNAc clusters were chosen for more extensive evaluation using ASOs targeting SRB-1, A1AT, FXI, TTR, and ApoC III mRNAs. GalNAc-ASO conjugates exhibited excellent potencies (ED50 0.5-2 mg/kg) for reducing the targeted mRNAs and proteins. This work culminated in the identification of a simplified tris-based GalNAc cluster (THA-GN3), which can be efficiently assembled using readily available starting materials and conjugated to ASOs using a solution phase conjugation strategy. GalNAc-ASO conjugates thus represent a viable approach for enhancing potency of ASO drugs in the clinic without adding significant complexity or cost to existing protocols for manufacturing oligonucleotide drugs.

19608538	20090718	Retinol-binding site in interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP): a novel hydrophobic cavity.	Interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) appears to target and protect retinoids during the visual cycle. X-ray crystallographic studies had noted a betabetaalpha-spiral fold shared with crotonases and C-terminal protein transferases. The shallow cleft formed by the fold was assumed to represent the retinol-binding site. However, a second hydrophobic site consisting of a highly restricted cavity was more recently appreciated during in silico ligand-docking studies. In this study, the ligand-binding environment within the second module of Xenopus IRBP (X2IRBP) is defined. Pristine recombinant polypeptide corresponding to X2IRBP was expressed in a soluble form and purified to homogeneity without its fusion tag. Phenylalanine was substituted for tryptophan at each of the putative retinol-binding domains (W450F, hydrophobic cavity; W587F, shallow cleft). Binding of 11-cis and all-trans retinol were observed in titrations monitoring retinol fluorescence enhancement, quenching of tryptophan fluorescence, and energy transfer. The effect of oleic acid on retinol binding was also examined. A ligand-binding stoichiometry of approximately 1:1 was observed for 11-cis and all-trans with K(d) in the tens of nanomolar range. The substitution mutants showed little effect on retinol binding in titrations after fluorescence enhancement. However, the W450F and not the W587F mutant showed a markedly reduced capacity for fluorescence quenching for both 11-cis and all-trans retinol. Oleic acid inhibited the binding of 11-cis and all-trans retinol in an apparent noncompetitive manner. The binding site for 11-cis and all-trans retinol is a novel hydrophobic cavity that is highly restrictive and probably distinct from the long chain fatty acid-binding site.

24136861	20131019	Paralogue annotation identifies novel pathogenic variants in patients with Brugada syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.	Distinguishing genetic variants that cause disease from variants that are rare but benign is one of the principal challenges in contemporary clinical genetics, particularly as variants are identified at a pace exceeding the capacity of researchers to characterise them functionally. We previously developed a novel method, called paralogue annotation, which accurately and specifically identifies disease-causing missense variants by transferring disease-causing annotations across families of related proteins. Here we refine our approach, and apply it to novel variants found in 2266 patients across two large cohorts with inherited sudden death syndromes, namely catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) or Brugada syndrome (BrS). Over one third of the novel non-synonymous variants found in these studies, which would otherwise be reported in a clinical diagnostics setting as 'variants of unknown significance', are categorised by our method as likely disease causing (positive predictive value 98.7%). This identified more than 500 new disease loci for BrS and CPVT. Our methodology is widely transferable across all human disease genes, with an estimated 150 000 potentially informative annotations in more than 1800 genes. We have developed a web resource that allows researchers and clinicians to annotate variants found in individuals with inherited arrhythmias, comprising a referenced compendium of known missense variants in these genes together with a user-friendly implementation of our approach. This tool will facilitate the interpretation of many novel variants that might otherwise remain unclassified. 	J._Med._Genet.	D016428 D013485
16041072	20050726	Structure of the wild-type TEM-1 beta-lactamase at 1.55 A and the mutant enzyme Ser70Ala at 2.1 A suggest the mode of noncovalent catalysis for the mutant enzyme.	One of the best-studied examples of a class A beta-lactamase is Escherichia coli TEM-1 beta-lactamase. In this class of enzymes, the active-site serine residue takes on the role of a nucleophile and carries out beta-lactam hydrolysis. Here, the structures of the wild-type and the S70G enzyme determined to 1.55 and 2.1 A, respectively, are presented. In contrast to the previously reported 1.8 A structure, the active site of the wild-type enzyme (1.55 A) structure does not contain sulfate and Ser70 appears to be in the deprotonated form. The X-ray crystal structure of the S70G mutant has an altered Ser130 side-chain conformation that influences the positions of water molecules in the active site. This change allows an additional water molecule to be positioned similarly to the serine hydroxyl in the wild-type enzyme. The structure of the mutant enzyme suggests that this water molecule can assume the role of an active-site nucleophile and carry out noncovalent catalysis. The drop in activity in the mutant enzyme is comparable to the drop observed in an analogous mutation of the nucleophilic serine in alkaline phosphatase, suggesting common chemical principles in the utilization of nucleophilic serine in the active site of different enzymes.

18662395	20080730	The effects of phosphatidylserine on endocrine response to moderate intensity exercise.	Previous research has indicated that phosphatidylserine (PS) supplementation has the potential to attenuate the serum cortisol response to acute exercise stress. Equivocal findings suggest that this effect might be dose dependent. This study aimed to examine the influence of short-term supplementation with a moderate dose of PS (600 mg per day) on plasma concentrations of cortisol, lactate, growth hormone and testosterone before, during, and following moderate intensity exercise in healthy males. 10 healthy male subjects participated in the study. Each subject was assigned to ingest 600 mg PS or placebo per day for 10 days using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Serial venous blood samples were taken at rest, after a 15 minute moderate intensity exercise protocol on a cycle ergometer that consisted of five 3-minute incremental stages beginning at 65% and ending at 85% VO2 max, and during a 65 minute passive recovery. Plasma samples were assessed for cortisol, growth hormone, testosterone, lactate and testosterone to cortisol ratio for treatment (PS or placebo). Mean peak cortisol concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) were lower following PS (39 +/- 1% and 35 +/- 0%, respectively) when compared to placebo (p &lt; 0.05). PS increased AUC for testosterone to cortisol ratio (184 +/- 5%) when compared to placebo (p &lt; 0.05). PS and placebo supplementation had no effect on lactate or growth hormone levels. The findings suggest that PS is an effective supplement for combating exercise-induced stress and preventing the physiological deterioration that can accompany too much exercise. PS supplementation promotes a desired hormonal status for athletes by blunting increases in cortisol levels. 	J_Int_Soc_Sports_Nutr	D016428
19308260	20090325	Detecting linkage between a trait and a marker in a random mating population without pedigree record.	Modern linkage-based approaches employing extended pedigrees are becoming powerful tools for localizing complex quantitative trait loci. For these linkage mapping methods, it is necessary to reconstruct extended pedigrees which include living individuals, using extensive pedigree records. Unfortunately, such records are not always easy to obtain and application of the linkage-based approaches has been restricted. Within a finite population under random mating, latent inbreeding rather than non-random inbreeding by consanguineous marriages is expected to occur and is attributable to coalescence in a finite population. Interestingly, it has been revealed that significant random inbreeding exists even in general human populations. Random inbreeding should be used to detect the hidden coancestry between individuals for a particular chromosomal position and it could also have application in linkage mapping methods. Here we present a novel method, named finite population based linkage mapping (FPL) method, to detect linkage between a quantitative trait and a marker via random inbreeding in a finite population without pedigree records. We show how to estimate coancestry for a chromosomal position between individuals by using multipoint Bayesian estimation. Subsequently, we describe the FPL method for detecting linkage via interval mapping method using a nonparametric test. We show that the FPL method does work via simulated data. For a random sample from a finite population, the FPL method is more powerful than a standard pedigree-based linkage mapping method with using genotypes of all parents of the sample. In addition, the FPL method was demonstrated by actual microsatellite genotype data of 750 Japanese individuals that are unrelated according to pedigree records to map a known Psoriasis susceptible locus. For samples without pedigree records, it was suggested that the FPL method require limited number of individuals, therefore would be better than other methods using thousands of individuals.

27543801	20160821	Different Combinations of Glucose Tolerance and Blood Pressure Status and Incident Diabetes, Hypertension, and Chronic Kidney Disease.	The impact of different combinations of glucose tolerance and blood pressure status on the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension (HTN), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) still needs to be investigated. A total of 12?808 Iranian adults aged ?20?years were included in 3 separate analyses to investigate incidence of T2DM, HTN, and CKD. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios (95% CI). During a median follow-up of &gt;10?years, the overall incidence rate for T2DM, HTN, and CKD was 12.2, 29.8, and 24.8 per 1000?person-years. For incident T2DM, considering normal glucose tolerance/normal blood pressure as reference, prediabetes (PreDM)/HTN had the highest risk (hazard ratio: 7.22 [5.71-9.12]) while PreDM/normal blood pressure also showed a significant risk (5.58 [4.41-7.05]). Furthermore, risk of PreDM/HTN was higher than PreDM/normal blood pressure (P&lt;0.05). For incident HTN, normal glucose tolerance/prehypertension was a strong predictor (3.28 [2.91-3.69]); however, addition of PreDM or T2DM did not increase the risk. For incident CKD, every category that included HTN and/or T2DM showed significant risk; this risk was marginally significant for the PreDM/HTN group (1.19 [0.98-1.43], P=0.06). In addition, PreDM/ normal blood pressure was a marginally significant risk factor for incident HTN while normal glucose tolerance/prehypertension was a significant predictor of T2DM. Presence of HTN was associated with increased risk of T2DM among the PreDM population; however, dysglycemia did not increase the risk of HTN among individuals with prehypertension. For incident CKD, intensive management of HTN and T2DM, rather than their predisease states, should be considered. 	J_Am_Heart_Assoc	D016428 D064888
27145753	20160506	Genetic polymorphism rs3760396 of the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 gene (CCL2) associated with the susceptibility of lung cancer in a pathological subtype-specific manner in Han-ancestry Chinese: a case control study.	Chemokines are well known inflammatory factors critical for tumor development in diverse tissues, including lung cancer. Chemokine (C-C motif) Ligand 2 (CCL2) was one of such chemokines important for both primary tumor development and metastasis of various cancers. Polymorphism at rs3760396 of CCL2 genes is associated with the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The goal of our study was to examine the relationship of genetic polymorphisms rs3760396 with the susceptibility of lung cancer and its pathological subtypes in Han-ancestry Chinese population. rs3760396 G/C polymorphism of CCL2 was genotyped using PCR in 394 patients with lung cancer and 545 cancer-free controls from the same Northeast region of China. After controlling for gender, age and smoking status, no significant association was observed between rs3760396 polymorphism and overall lung cancer. However, minor allele G of rs3760396 polymorphism was significantly associated with increased risk of adenosquamous lung carcinoma with either allelic genetic model (OR = 5.29, P &lt; 0.001), or dominant genetic model (OR = 9.88, P &lt; 0.001), or genotypic model (GC genotype vs. CC genotype, OR = 10.73, P &lt; 0.001). Although rs3760396 polymorphism was not significantly associated with increased risk of adenocarcinoma subtype, it was nominally associated with the pooled outcome of either adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma under allelic genetic model (OR = 1.54, P = 0.023) or dominant genetic model (OR = 1.57, P = 0.031). Our study suggested rs3760396 polymorphism of CCL2 is associated not only with prognosis of NSCLC, but also with risk of lung cancer in a subtype-specific manner. Our results further supported previous evidence of the important role of CCL2 in lung cancer development. 	BMC_Cancer	D016428 D013485
24505369	20140208	Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) Promoter polymorphisms are well linked with lower stomach tumor formation in eastern Indian population.	Expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), an interstitial collagenase, plays a major role in cellular invasion during development of gastric cancer, a leading cause of death worldwide. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -1607 1G/2G site of the MMP-1 gene promoter has been reported to alter transcription level. While the importance's of other SNPs in the MMP-1 promoter have not yet been studied in gastric cancer, our aim was to investigate MMP-1 gene promoter polymorphisms and gastric cancer susceptibility in eastern Indian population. A total of 145 gastric cancer patients and 145 healthy controls were genotyped for MMP-1 -1607 1G/2G (rs1799750) by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), while MMP-1 -519 A/G (rs1144393), MMP-1 -422 T/A (rs475007), MMP-1 -340 T/C (rs514921) and MMP-1 -320 T/C (rs494379) were genotyped by DNA sequencing. A positive association was found with MMP-1 -422 T/A SNP that showed significant risk for regional lymph node metastasis (P?=?0.021, Odd's ratio (OR)?=?3.044, Confidence intervals (CI)?=?1.187-7.807). In addition, we found a significant association with lower stomach tumor formation among gastric cancer patients for three adjacent polymorphisms near the transcriptional start sites of [MMP-1 -422 T/A (P?=?0.043, OR?=?2.182, CI?=?1.03-4.643), MMP-1 -340 T/C (P?=?0.075, OR?=?1.97, CI?=?0.94-4.158) and MMP-1 -320 T/C (P?=?0.034, OR?=?2.224, CI?=?1.064-40731)]. MMP-1 level in patients' serum was correlated with MMP-1 promoter haplotypes conferring these three SNPs to evaluate the functional importance of these polymorphisms in lower stomach tumor formation and significant correlation was observed. Furthermore, MMP-1 -519 A/G polymorphism displayed poor cellular differentiation (P?=?0.024, OR?=?3.8, CI?=?1.69-8.56) attributing a higher risk of cancer progression. In conclusion, MMP-1 proximal promoter SNPs are associated with the risk of lower stomach tumor formation and node metastasis in eastern Indian population. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485
26445905	20151009	Intracellular Temperature Sensing: An Ultra-bright Luminescent Nanothermometer with Non-sensitivity to pH and Ionic Strength.	Luminescence thermometry usually suffer from cellular complexity of the biochemical environment (such as pH and ionic strength), and thus the accuracy and reliability of the determined intracellular temperature are directly affected. Herein, a photoluminescent nanothermometer composed of polymer encapsulated quantum dots (P-QD) has been developed. And the prepared nanothermometer exhibits some advantages: such as non-sensitivity to pH and ionic strength, as well as high detection sensitivity and ultrahigh reversibility. The intracellular temperature was accurately determined under physiological conditions with different pH and ionic strength, and direct measurement of thermogenesis in individual cells has been achieved.

26661061	20151215	Receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1, a target of NKX2-1/TTF-1 lineage-survival oncogene, inhibits apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1-mediated pro-apoptotic signaling in lung adenocarcinoma.	We previously identified receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) as a transcriptional target of the NKX2-1/TTF-1 lineage-survival oncogene in lung adenocarcinoma. ROR1 consequently sustains a favorable balance between pro-survival phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B and pro-apoptotic apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)-p38MAPK signaling. In contrast to recent advances in understanding how ROR1 sustains pro-survival signaling, the mechanism of ROR1 repression of pro-apoptotic signaling remains rather elusive. In the present study, we investigated the underlying mechanism of ROR1-mediated inhibition of the ASK1-p38MAPK signaling pathway. Growth inhibition mediated by siROR1 was partially but significantly alleviated by ASK1 co-knockdown in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Also, ASK1 phosphorylation at Thr845, which reflects its activated state, was clearly inhibited by ROR1 overexpression in both steady state and oxidative stress-elicited conditions in MSTO-211H cells. In addition, we found that ROR1 was physically associated with ASK1 at the C-terminal serine threonine-rich domain of ROR1. Furthermore, ROR1 kinase activity was shown to be required to repress the ASK1-p38 axis and oxidative stress-induced cell death. The present findings thus support our notion that ROR1 sustains lung adenocarcinoma survival, at least in part, through direct physical interaction with ASK1 and consequential repression of the pro-apoptotic ASK1-p38 axis in a ROR1 kinase activity-dependent manner.

21276431	20110201	A pronociceptive role for the 5-HT2 receptor on spinal nociceptive transmission: an in vivo electrophysiological study in the rat.	Serotonin (5-HT) plays a major yet complex role in modulating spinal nociceptive transmission as a consequence of the number of 5-HT receptor subtypes. These include the 5-HT2 receptor, which is further sub classified into 5-HT2A, B and C. Studies have described both a pro- and antinociceptive action following 5-HT2A-receptor activation; therefore, to shed light on the directional nature of spinal 5-HT2A receptor activity, we investigated the effects of spinal administration of the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, ketanserin, on the evoked responses of dorsal horn neurones to electrical, mechanical and thermal stimulation. We also assessed the effects of systemic administration of ritanserin, a 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist and spinal application of (?)-2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride (DOI) (3.6 and 17.8?g/50?l), a 5-HT2A/2C agonist, on the same evoked neuronal responses. Ketanserin (1, 10 and 100?g/50?l) produced a dose related inhibition of the evoked responses to noxious mechanical punctate and thermal stimuli only. Ritanserin (2mg/kg) replicated the inhibitory effects seen with ketanserin on the natural evoked neuronal responses and also potently inhibited the C-fibre, post discharge, input and wind-up evoked responses. DOI increased the mechanical and thermal evoked responses, an effect reversed by ketanserin. Thus, our findings show that spinal ketanserin (1-100?g/50?l) and systemic ritanserin (2mg/kg), at these doses, have similar antinociceptive effects, whereas the agonist, DOI, produced excitatory effects, on spinal neuronal activity. Our data, therefore, supports a pronociceptive role for 5-HT2 receptors, most likely through modulation of 5-HT2A receptor activity, on spinal nociceptive transmission under normal conditions.

11004573	20000927	High-pressure denaturation of apomyoglobin.	The pressure denaturation of wild type and mutant apomyoglobin (apoMb) was investigated using a high-pressure, high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance and high-pressure fluorescence techniques. Wild type apoMb is resistant to pressures up to 80 MPa, and denatures to a high-pressure intermediate, I(p), between 80 and 200 MPa. A further increase of pressure to 500 MPa results in denaturation of the intermediate. The two tryptophans, both in the A helix, remain sequestered from solvent in the high-pressure intermediate, which retains some native NOESY cross peaks in the AGH core as well as between F33 and F43. High-pressure fluorescence shows that the tryptophans remain inaccessible to solvent in the I(p) state. Thus the high-pressure intermediate has some structural properties in common with the apoMb I(2) acid intermediate. The resistance of the AGH core to pressures up to 200 MPa provides further evidence that the intrinsic stability of these alpha-helices is responsible for their presence in a number of equilibrium intermediates as well as in the earliest kinetic folding intermediate. Mutations in the AGH core designed to disrupt packing by burying a charge or increasing the size of a hydrophobic residue significantly perturbed the unfolding of native apoMb to the high-pressure intermediate. The F123W and S108L mutants both unfolded at lower pressures, while retaining some resistance to pressures below 50 MPa. The charge burial mutants, A130K and S108K, are not stable at very low pressures and both denature to the intermediate by 100 MPa, half of the pressure required for wild type apoMb. Thus a similar intermediate state is created independent of the method of perturbation, and mutations have similar effects on native state destabilization for both methods of denaturation. These data suggest that equilibrium intermediates that can be formed through different means are likely to resemble a kinetic intermediate. 	Biochim._Biophys._Acta	D016428 D013485 D013487
14613514	20031114	Tumor suppressor gene E-cadherin and its role in normal and malignant cells.	E-cadherin tumor suppressor genes are particularly active area of research in development and tumorigenesis. The calcium-dependent interactions among E-cadherin molecules are critical for the formation and maintenance of adherent junctions in areas of epithelial cell-cell contact. Loss of E-cadherin-mediated-adhesion characterises the transition from benign lesions to invasive, metastatic cancer. Nevertheless, there is evidence that E-cadherins may also play a role in the wnt signal transduction pathway, together with other key molecules involved in it, such as beta-catenins and adenomatous poliposis coli gene products.The structure and function of E-cadherin, gene and protein, in normal as well as in tumor cells are reviewed in this paper.

2496745	19890124	Probing the functional role of threonine-113 of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase for its effect on turnover efficiency, catalysis, and binding.	The role of Thr-113 of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase in binding and catalysis was probed by amino acid substitution. Thr-113, a strictly conserved residue that forms a hydrogen bond to the active-site Asp-27 and to the amino group of methotrexate through a fixed water molecule, was replaced by valine. The kinetic scheme is identical in form with the wild-type scheme, although many of the rate constants vary, including a decrease in the association rate constants and an increase in the dissociation rate constants for folate ligands, a decrease in the hydride-transfer rate constant in both directions, and an increase in the intrinsic pKa of Asp-27. Overall, replacement of Thr-113 by Val decreases the binding of folate substrates by approximately 2.3 kcal/mol. These multiple complex changes on various ground and transition states underscore the optimal properties of a strictly conserved residue in the evolution of catalytic function.

20534631	20100611	Subunit and small-molecule interaction of ribonucleotide reductases via surface plasmon resonance biosensor analyses.	Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) synthesizes deoxyribonucleotides for DNA replication and repair and is controlled by sophisticated allosteric regulation involving differential affinity of nucleotides for regulatory sites. We have developed a robust and sensitive method for coupling biotinylated RNRs to surface plasmon resonance streptavidin biosensor chips via a 30.5 A linker. In comprehensive studies on three RNRs effector nucleotides strengthened holoenzyme interactions, whereas substrate had no effect on subunit interactions. The RNRs differed in their response to the negative allosteric effector dATP that binds to an ATP-cone domain. A tight RNR complex was formed in Escherichia coli class Ia RNR with a functional ATP cone. No strengthening of subunit interactions was observed in the class Ib RNR from the human pathogen Bacillus anthracis that lacks the ATP cone. A moderate strengthening was seen in the atypical Aeromonas hydrophila phage 1 class Ia RNR that has a split catalytic subunit and a non-functional ATP cone with remnant dATP-mediated regulatory features. We also successfully immobilized a functional catalytic NrdA subunit of the E.coli enzyme, facilitating study of nucleotide interactions. Our surface plasmon resonance methodology has the potential to provide biological insight into nucleotide-mediated regulation of any RNR, and can be used for high-throughput screening of potential RNR inhibitors.

22497664	20120414	Genetic diversity and naturally polymorphisms in HIV type 1 integrase isolates from Maputo, Mozambique: implications for integrase inhibitors.	HIV proviral DNA integration into the host chromosome is carried out by integrase becoming an important target antiretroviral therapy. Raltegravir was the first integrase inhibitor approved for use in HIV therapy and elvitegravir is in the late phase of clinical development; both show good results in monotherapy studies and may be used worldwide for rescue therapy. In this work we analyzed 57 integrase sequences obtained from samples from drug-naive and first line regime-failing patients from Maputo, Mozambique, to evaluate the presence of natural polymorphisms and resistance mutations associated with raltegravir and elvitegravir. No major mutations conferring resistance to integrase inhibitors were found and polymorphic accessory mutations were solely observed in low frequency among subtype C sequences-L74M (3.4%), T97A (1.8%), and E157Q (1.8%)-suggesting that this new antiretroviral drug class will be effective in Mozambique providing a good perspective to the introduction of this class of drugs in that country.

10323730	19990514	Novel missense mutation (Leu466Arg) of the DAX1 gene in a patient with X-linked congenital adrenal hypoplasia.	We identified a DAX1 missense mutation, a substitution of arginine for leucine at codon 466 (Leu466Arg), in an infant with X-linked congenital adrenal hypoplasia (AHC). A heterozygous substitution, Leu466Arg, was also identified in his mother and sister. Since leucine at position 466 is well conserved among other orphan nuclear hormone receptor superfamilies and Leu466Arg was not detected among 50 normal Japanese control individuals, the mutation is most likely responsible for X-linked AHC. It is interesting to note that Leu466Arg among all mutations ever reported is located at the most C-terminal region of the DAX-1 protein. Most mutations identified previously were located in the C-terminal presumptive ligand binding domain. Hence, the C-terminal end of the DAX-1 protein may play an important role in the biological function, such as in normal adrenal embryogenesis. 	Am._J._Med._Genet.	D002363 D016428
22438826	20120323	Temporal transcriptional profiling of somatic and germ cells reveals biased lineage priming of sexual fate in the fetal mouse gonad.	The divergence of distinct cell populations from multipotent progenitors is poorly understood, particularly in vivo. The gonad is an ideal place to study this process, because it originates as a bipotential primordium where multiple distinct lineages acquire sex-specific fates as the organ differentiates as a testis or an ovary. To gain a more detailed understanding of the process of gonadal differentiation at the level of the individual cell populations, we conducted microarrays on sorted cells from XX and XY mouse gonads at three time points spanning the period when the gonadal cells transition from sexually undifferentiated progenitors to their respective sex-specific fates. We analyzed supporting cells, interstitial/stromal cells, germ cells, and endothelial cells. This work identified genes specifically depleted and enriched in each lineage as it underwent sex-specific differentiation. We determined that the sexually undifferentiated germ cell and supporting cell progenitors showed lineage priming. We found that germ cell progenitors were primed with a bias toward the male fate. In contrast, supporting cells were primed with a female bias, indicative of the robust repression program involved in the commitment to XY supporting cell fate. This study provides a molecular explanation reconciling the female default and balanced models of sex determination and represents a rich resource for the field. More importantly, it yields new insights into the mechanisms by which different cell types in a single organ adopt their respective fates. 	PLoS_Genet.	D016428 D052061 D013485
15194771	20040615	Functional analysis of the putative fusion domain of the baculovirus envelope fusion protein F.	Group II nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPVs), e.g., Spodoptera exigua MNPV, lack a GP64-like protein that is present in group I NPVs but have an unrelated envelope fusion protein named F. In contrast to GP64, the F protein has to be activated by a posttranslational cleavage mechanism to become fusogenic. In several vertebrate viral fusion proteins, the cleavage activation generates a new N terminus which forms the so-called fusion peptide. This fusion peptide inserts in the cellular membrane, thereby facilitating apposition of the viral and cellular membrane upon sequential conformational changes of the fusion protein. A similar peptide has been identified in NPV F proteins at the N terminus of the large membrane-anchored subunit F(1). The role of individual amino acids in this putative fusion peptide on viral infectivity and propagation was studied by mutagenesis. Mutant F proteins with single amino acid changes as well as an F protein with a deleted putative fusion peptide were introduced in gp64-null Autographa californica MNPV budded viruses (BVs). None of the mutations analyzed had an major effect on the processing and incorporation of F proteins in the envelope of BVs. Only two mutants, one with a substitution for a hydrophobic residue (F152R) and one with a deleted putative fusion peptide, were completely unable to rescue the gp64-null mutant. Several nonconservative substitutions for other hydrophobic residues and the conserved lysine residue had only an effect on viral infectivity. In contrast to what was expected from vertebrate virus fusion peptides, alanine substitutions for glycines did not show any effect. 	J._Virol.	D016428
24172198	20131101	Compound heterozygosity of the functionally null Cdh23(v-ngt) and hypomorphic Cdh23(ahl) alleles leads to early-onset progressive hearing loss in mice.	The waltzer (v) mouse mutant harbors a mutation in Cadherin 23 (Cdh23) and is a model for Usher syndrome type 1D, which is characterized by congenital deafness, vestibular dysfunction, and prepubertal onset of progressive retinitis pigmentosa. In mice, functionally null Cdh23 mutations affect stereociliary morphogenesis and the polarity of both cochlear and vestibular hair cells. In contrast, the murine Cdh23(ahl) allele, which harbors a hypomorphic mutation, causes an increase in susceptibility to age-related hearing loss in many inbred strains. We produced congenic mice by crossing mice carrying the v niigata (Cdh23(v-ngt)) null allele with mice carrying the hypomorphic Cdh23(ahl) allele on the C57BL/6J background, and we then analyzed the animals' balance and hearing phenotypes. Although the Cdh23(v-ngt/ahl) compound heterozygous mice exhibited normal vestibular function, their hearing ability was abnormal: the mice exhibited higher thresholds of auditory brainstem response (ABR) and rapid age-dependent elevation of ABR thresholds compared with Cdh23(ahl/ahl) homozygous mice. We found that the stereocilia developed normally but were progressively disrupted in Cdh23(v-ngt/ahl) mice. In hair cells, CDH23 localizes to the tip links of stereocilia, which are thought to gate the mechanoelectrical transduction channels in hair cells. We hypothesize that the reduction of Cdh23 gene dosage in Cdh23(v-ngt/ahl) mice leads to the degeneration of stereocilia, which consequently reduces tip link tension. These findings indicate that CDH23 plays an important role in the maintenance of tip links during the aging process. 	Exp._Anim.	D016428 D013485
24779299	20140501	Study of genetic variants of 8q21 and 8q24 associated with prostate cancer in Jing-Jin residents in northern China.	To identify the genetic risk of six genetic variants at 8q21 and 8q24 (including rs1512268, A; rs12543663, C; rs10086908, C; rs1016343, T; rs13252298, A, and rs6983561, C) associated with prostate cancer in Beijing and Tianjin (Jing-jin) area residents in northern China. 574 subjects were enrolled. Blood samples and clinical information were collected from histologically confirmed prostate cancer cases (n = 286) and clinically evaluated matched normal controls (n = 288) from Chinese men in northern China. Six SNPs at 8q21 and 8q24 were genotyped by high-resolution melt and sequencing in subjects. We compared statistical differences between the prevalence of risk genotypes with prostate cancer in cases and controls and analyzed the association between clinical covariates and risk loci in case groups to infer their relationship with aggressive prostate cancer. Three genotypes of rs10086908, CC (OR = 2.48; 95% CI = 1.02 - 5.98, p = 0.037) rs1016343, TT (OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.07 - 2.53, p = 0.023); and rs6983561, CC (OR = 1.91; 95% CI = 1.09 - 3.63, p = 0.044) at 8q24 were identified to be associated with prostate cancer risk in Jing-jin Chinese. The D' values of both two-locus haplotypes (T-A: rs1016343 vs. rs13252298; T-C: rs1016343 vs. rs6983561) were 0.907 and 0.859, respectively, the three-locus haplotype, only TAC constituted by the loci (rs1016343, T; rs13252298, A; rs6983561, C) was also associated with prostate cancer (p = 0.033), revealing rs1016343 vs. rs6983561 with significant differences between cases and controls. According to clinical covariates and odds ratios of risk genotypes relative to non-risk genotypes, rs6983561, CC was associated with age (OR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.02 - 6.13, p = 0.039), and tumor aggressiveness (OR = 1.15; 95% Cl = 1.06 - 1.23, p = 0.013). The loci including rs10086908, rs1016343, and rs6983561 at 8q24 could be associated with prostate cancer in Jing-jin residents in northern China. Our results suggest that these loci could influence susceptibility to prostate cancer in the northern Chinese population. 	Clin._Lab.	D016428 D013485
27068683	20160413	A common theme in extracellular fluids of beetles: extracellular superoxide dismutases crucial for balancing ROS in response to microbial challenge.	Extracellular Cu/Zn superoxide dismutases (SODs) are critical for balancing the level of reactive oxygen species in the extracellular matrix of eukaryotes. In the present study we have detected constitutive SOD activity in the haemolymph and defensive secretions of different leaf beetle species. Exemplarily, we have chosen the mustard leaf beetle, Phaedon cochleariae, as representative model organism to investigate the role of extracellular SODs in antimicrobial defence. Qualitative and quantitative proteome analyses resulted in the identification of two extracellular Cu/Zn SODs in the haemolymph and one in the defensive secretions of juvenile P. cochleariae. Furthermore, quantitative expression studies indicated fat body tissue and defensive glands as the main synthesis sites of these SODs. Silencing of the two SODs revealed one of them, PcSOD3.1, as the only relevant enzyme facilitating SOD activity in haemolymph and defensive secretions in vivo. Upon challenge with the entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae, PcSOD3.1-deficient larvae exhibited a significantly higher mortality compared to other SOD-silenced groups. Hence, our results serve as a basis for further research on SOD regulated host-pathogen interactions. In defensive secretions PcSOD3.1-silencing affected neither deterrent production nor activity against fungal growth. Instead, we propose another antifungal mechanism based on MRJP/yellow proteins in the defensive exudates. 	Sci_Rep	D016428 D013485

One prominent example is the secretases responsible for the generation of amyloid beta peptide, which is believed to be central for the development of Alzheimer's disease. It is therefore desirable to identify and characterize these proteases. We have developed a novel functional approach for identification of proteases and modulators by coupling the protease activity to caspase-mediated apoptosis. Here we show the proof of principle for this approach using beta-secretase as an example. We provide data showing that 1. A modified caspase-3 containing beta-secretase cleavage site induces apoptosis in 293T cells. 2. The modified caspase-3 induced apoptosis is correlated with the susceptibility of beta-secretase recognition sequence to beta-secretase. 3. In vivo beta-secretase competitors BACE2 and BACE2(D110A) prevent the modified caspase-3 induced cell death. Therefore, this approach can be a useful tool in studies of proteolytic cleavage provided only that the protease recognition sequence is known. 	Mol._Biotechnol.	D016428
23618081	20130427	Evaluation of androgen-induced effects on the uptake of [18F]FDG, [11C]choline and [11C]acetate in an androgen-sensitive and androgen-independent prostate cancer xenograft model.	Androgen deprivation (AD) is generally used as a first-line palliative treatment in prostate cancer (PCa) patients with rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after primary therapy. To acquire an accurate detection of tumour viability following AD with positron emission tomography (PET), an androgen-independent uptake of tracers would be advantageous. Several metabolic PET tracers are employed for detecting recurrent PCa. We evaluated the effect of AD on the uptake of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose ([18F]FDG), [11C]choline and [11C]acetate in vivo. An [18F]FDG, [11C]choline and [11C]acetate baseline micro(?)PET/? computed tomography (CT) scan was subsequently performed in xenografts of androgen-sensitive (LAPC-4) and androgen-independent (22Rv1) tumours in nude mice. An untreated control group was compared to a surgical castration group, i.e. androgen-deprived group. ?PET/?CT imaging with the above-mentioned tracers was repeated 5 days after the start of treatment. The percentage change of SUVmax and SUVmeanTH in the tumours was calculated. AD did not significantly affect the uptake of [18F]FDG and [11C]choline in LAPC-4 tumours as compared with the uptake of both tracers in untreated tumours. In control 22Rv1 tumours, [11C]choline and [18F]FDG uptake increased over time. However, compared with the uptake in control tumours, AD significantly decreased the uptake of [11C]choline and tended to decrease [18F]FDG uptake. [11C]acetate uptake remained unaffected by AD in both PCa xenograft models. [18F]FDG and especially [11C]choline PET, which is currently used for the detection of recurrent PCa, could miss or underestimate the presence of local recurrent PCa following AD therapy. [11C]acetate uptake occurs independently of androgens and thus may be more favourable for detecting tumour viability during or following AD. 	EJNMMI_Res	D016428
21152129	20101215	Pigmentation, Melanocyte Colonization, and p53 Status in Basal Cell Carcinoma.	Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common neoplasm in the Caucasian population. Only a fraction of BCC exhibits pigmentation. Lack of melanocyte colonization has been suggested to be due to p53-inactivating mutations in the BCC cells interfering with the p53-proopiomelanocortin pathway and the production of alpha melanocyte-stimulating hormone in the tumor. To evaluate this, we determined tumor pigmentation as well as expression of melan-A and of p53 in 49 BCC tissues by means of immunohistochemistry. As expected, we observed a positive relation between tumor pigmentation and melan-A positive intra-tumoral melanocytes. Melanocyte colonization and, to a lesser extent, p53 overexpression showed intraindividual heterogeneity in larger tumors. p53 overexpression, which is indicative of p53 mutations, was not correlated to melanocyte colonization of BCC. Sequencing of exon 5-8 of the p53 gene in selected BCC cases revealed that colonization by melanocytes and BCC pigmentation is neither ablated by p53 mutations nor generally present in BCCs with wild-type p53.

16782899	20060620	Direct interaction of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) with Met is required for FAK to promote hepatocyte growth factor-induced cell invasion.	Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) has been implicated to be a point of convergence of integrin and growth factor signaling pathways. Here we report that FAK directly interacts with the hepatocyte growth factor receptor c-Met. Phosphorylation of c-Met at Tyr-1349 and, to a lesser extent, Tyr-1356 is required for its interaction with the band 4.1 and ezrin/radixin/moesin homology domain (FERM domain) of FAK. The F2 subdomain of the FAK FERM domain alone is sufficient for Met binding, in which a patch of basic residues (216KAKTLRK222) are critical for the interaction. Met-FAK interaction leads to FAK activation and subsequent contribution to hepatocyte growth factor-induced cell motility and cell invasion. Our results provide evidence that constitutive Met-FAK interaction may be a critical determinant for tumor cells to acquire invasive potential. 	Mol._Cell._Biol.	D016428 D013485
19424422	20090509	Unique structure and stability of HmuY, a novel heme-binding protein of Porphyromonas gingivalis.	Infection, survival, and proliferation of pathogenic bacteria in humans depend on their capacity to impair host responses and acquire nutrients in a hostile environment. Among such nutrients is heme, a co-factor for oxygen storage, electron transport, photosynthesis, and redox biochemistry, which is indispensable for life. Porphyromonas gingivalis is the major human bacterial pathogen responsible for severe periodontitis. It recruits heme through HmuY, which sequesters heme from host carriers and delivers it to its cognate outer-membrane transporter, the TonB-dependent receptor HmuR. Here we report that heme binding does not significantly affect the secondary structure of HmuY. The crystal structure of heme-bound HmuY reveals a new all-beta fold mimicking a right hand. The thumb and fingers pinch heme iron through two apical histidine residues, giving rise to highly symmetric octahedral iron co-ordination. The tetrameric quaternary arrangement of the protein found in the crystal structure is consistent with experiments in solution. It shows that thumbs and fingertips, and, by extension, the bound heme groups, are shielded from competing heme-binding proteins from the host. This may also facilitate heme transport to HmuR for internalization. HmuY, both in its apo- and in its heme-bound forms, is resistant to proteolytic digestion by trypsin and the major secreted proteases of P. gingivalis, gingipains K and R. It is also stable against thermal and chemical denaturation. In conclusion, these studies reveal novel molecular properties of HmuY that are consistent with its role as a putative virulence factor during bacterial infection. 	PLoS_Pathog.

26217177	20150729	Contra-Directional Expression of Serum Homocysteine and Uric Acid as Important Biomarkers of Multiple System Atrophy Severity: A Cross-Sectional Study.	Serum Hcy was higher in MSA patients when compared to healthy subjects, particularly in male patients.Serum UA was lower in MSA patients when compared healthy subjects, particularly in male patients.Serum Hcy levels were significantly positively correlated with the severity of MSA.The ROC curve for the combination of Hcy and UA showed potential diagnostic value in discriminating MSA from healthy subjects. There is evidence suggesting that inflammatory responses play a critical role in the pathogenesis of multiple system atrophy (MSA). Whether inflammatory mediators can be used as reliable biomarkers to detect the severity and progression of MSA remains largely unknown. We performed a cross-sectional study that included 47 patients with MSA and 50 healthy age-matched controls. Serum levels of homocysteine (Hcy), uric acid (UA), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. These levels positively correlated with the severity of MSA, based on both motor and non-motor symptoms. Several scales were used to rate the severity of MSA, including the Unified multiple system atrophy rating scale, Parkinson's disease sleep scale, Non-motor Symptoms Scale, the Schwab &amp; England activities of daily living scale, Webster Scale, modified Hoehn and Yahr staging scale, and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was applied to map the diagnostic accuracy of MSA against healthy subjects. Compared with healthy subjects, we found that serum Hcy was higher, UA was lower, and CRP levels were unchanged in MSA patients. These findings were especially prominent in male patients. No significant differences of serum Hcy and UA were observed between patients of MSA and PD. Interestingly, there was a significant correlation between Hcy levels and MSA severity such as movement dysfunction, declined cognition, and cardiovascular symptoms. Additionally, the ROC curve for the combination of Hcy and UA (AUC 0.736) showed potential diagnostic value in discriminating MSA from healthy subjects. Our findings suggest that the inflammatory mediators Hcy and UA may play important roles in the pathogenesis of MSA. The measurement of serum Hcy and UA levels could then be a useful tool to accurately distinguish MSA from healthy subjects. 	Front_Cell_Neurosci	D016428

19948131	20091202	Reversible, temperature-dependent supramolecular assembly of aquaporin-4 orthogonal arrays in live cell membranes.	The shorter &quot;M23&quot; isoform of the glial cell water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) assembles into orthogonal arrays of particles (OAPs) in cell plasma membranes, whereas the full-length &quot;M1&quot; isoform does not. N-terminal residues are responsible for OAP formation by AQP4-M23 and for blocking of OAP formation in AQP4-M1. In investigating differences in OAP formation by certain N-terminus mutants of AQP4, as measured by freeze-fracture electron microscopy versus live-cell imaging, we discovered reversible, temperature-dependent OAP assembly of certain weakly associating AQP4 mutants. Single-particle tracking of quantum-dot-labeled AQP4 in live cells and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy showed &gt;80% of M23 in OAPs at 10-50 degrees C compared to &lt;10% of M1. However, OAP formation by N-terminus cysteine-substitution mutants of M1, which probe palmitoylation-regulated OAP assembly, was strongly temperature-dependent, increasing from &lt;10% at 37 degrees C to &gt;70% at 10 degrees C for the double mutant M1-C13A/C17A. OAP assembly by this mutant, but not by native M23, could also be modulated by reducing its membrane density. Exposure of native M1 and single cysteine mutants to 2-bromopalmitate confirmed the presence of regulated OAP assembly by S-palmitoylation. Kinetic studies showed rapid and reversible OAP formation during cooling and OAP disassembly during heating. Our results provide what to our knowledge is the first information on the energetics of AQP4 OAP assembly in plasma membranes. 	Biophys._J.	D016428 D052061 D013485
22730064	20120626	Respiratory syncytial virus infection augments NOD2 signaling in an IFN-?-dependent manner in human primary cells.	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants, with remarkable variability in disease severity. An exaggerated proinflammatory response and influx of leukocytes is part of the pathogenesis of severe RSV disease. Here, we show an increase in proinflammatory cytokine production by human immune cells after stimulation with RSV and muramyl dipeptide (MDP), which is recognized by nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2). PBMCs from Crohn's disease patients homozygous for the 3020insC mutation in the NOD2 gene did not show a synergistic response to stimulation with RSV and MDP, suggesting that NOD2 is essential for the observed synergy. Further experiments aimed at identifying the viral ligand indicated that viral RNA plays an essential role in the recognition of RSV. Stimulation with RSV or Poly(I:C) induced IFN-? expression, which resulted in an increased expression of the viral receptors TLR3 and RIG-I, as well as an increased NOD2 expression. Our data indicate that IFN-? induction by viral RNA is an essential first step in the increased proinflammatory response to MDP. We hypothesize that the enhanced proinflammatory response to MDP following RSV infection may be an important factor in determining the outcome of the severity of disease. 	Eur._J._Immunol.

Here, we have described an 875+1G--&gt;A mutation, found for the first time in a homozygous state in an 8 yr old boy. He was the child of a couple of Egyptian first level cousins, both carriers of the mutation. The functional test revealed the 875+1G--&gt;A to be a severe mutation, leading to defective protein function as detected by nasal potential difference (NPD) measurements. 	J._Cyst._Fibros.

12411425	20021102	Mechanism of lonidamine inhibition of the CFTR chloride channel.	1. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl(-) channel is blocked by a broad range of organic anionic compounds. Here we investigate the effects of the indazole compound lonidamine on CFTR channels expressed in mammalian cell lines using patch clamp recording. 2. Application of lonidamine to the intracellular face of excised membrane patches caused a voltage-dependent block of CFTR currents, with an apparent K(d) of 58 micro M at -100 mV. 3. Block by lonidamine was apparently independent of channel gating but weakly sensitive to the extracellular Cl(-) concentration. 4. Intracellular lonidamine led to the introduction of brief interruptions in the single channel current at hyperpolarized voltages, leading to a reduction in channel mean open time. Lonidamine also introduced a new component of macroscopic current variance. Spectral analysis of this variance suggested a blocker on rate of 1.79 micro M(-1) s(-1) and an off-rate of 143 s(-1). 5. Several point mutations within the sixth transmembrane region of CFTR (R334C, F337S, T338A and S341A) significantly weakened block of macroscopic CFTR current, suggesting that lonidamine enters deeply into the channel pore from its intracellular end. 6. These results identify and characterize lonidamine as a novel CFTR open channel blocker and provide important information concerning its molecular mechanism of action. 	Br._J._Pharmacol.

3207714	19881004	Comparative triplet-state properties of the three tryptophan residues in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme and in the enzyme complex with methylmercury(II).	Triplet-state energies, zero-field splittings (ZFS), and total decay rate constants of the individual triplet-state sublevels of the tryptophan (Trp) residues located at positions 126, 138, and 158 in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme have been determined by using low-temperature phosphorescence and optical detection of magnetic resonance spectroscopy in zero applied magnetic field. An investigation of spectral and kinetic properties of individual Trp residues was facilitated by measurements on point-mutated proteins containing two Trp----Tyr substitutions. We find that the phosphorescence lifetime of the buried Trp-138 is considerably shorter than those of the solvent-exposed Trp residues. CH3HgII binding to cysteine residues in T4 lysozyme selectively perturbs the triplet state of Trp-158 by means of an external heavy-atom effect. In contrast with the previous observation of selective x-sublevel perturbation in the Trp-CH3Hg complex, the radiative character of the z sublevel (z is the out-of-plane axis) is selectively enhanced due to the heavy-atom perturbation of Trp-158. The observed pattern of radiative and total sublevel decay constants of the perturbed Trp is attributed to a special orientation of the Hg atom with respect to the indole plane.

27075750	20160415	Reliable handling of highly A/T-rich genomic DNA for efficient generation of knockin strains of Dictyostelium discoideum.	Social amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum, is a well-established model organism for studying cellular physiology and developmental pattern formation. Its haploid genome facilitates functional analysis of genes by a single round of mutagenesis including targeted disruption. Although the efficient generation of knockout strains based on an intrinsically high homologous recombination rate has been demonstrated, successful reports for knockin strains have been limited. As social amoeba has an exceptionally high adenine and thymine (A/T)-content, conventional plasmid-based vector construction has been constrained due to deleterious deletion in E. coli. We describe here a simple and efficient strategy to construct GFP-knockin cassettes by using a linear DNA cloning vector derived from N15 bacteriophage. This allows reliable handling of DNA fragments whose A/T-content may be as high as 85?%, and which cannot be cloned into a circular plasmid. By optimizing the length of recombination arms, we successfully generate GFP-knockin strains for five genes involved in cAMP signalling, including a triple-colour knockin strain. This robust strategy would be useful in handling DNA fragments with biased A/T-contents such as the genome of lower organisms and the promoter/terminator regions of higher organisms. 	BMC_Biotechnol.

19825200	20091015	A1C predicts type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance in a population at risk: the community diabetes prevention project.	In a population at risk for type 2 diabetes (T2DM), we assessed early physical and metabolic markers that predict progression from normal to impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and T2DM. A total of 388 individuals (22% male, age 46 + 11 years) at risk for T2DM were randomized to Standard (n = 182) or Intervention (n = 206) care and evaluated at baseline and 5 annual follow-up visits, including blood pressure, BMI, A1C, lipids, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, VO2max, fasting glucose, insulin and C-peptide. The Standard group received results of annual lab tests and quarterly newsletters, while the Intervention group received quarterly newsletters and detailed discussions of lab results, routine self-directed activities, semi-annual group meetings and monthly telephone calls for ongoing support. Overall, 359 (93%) returned for at least one follow-up visit and 272 (70%) completed the final 5-year assessment. Return rates, changes in measures and incidence of IGT/T2DM were similar between groups. Low cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) was the most prevalent baseline abnormality. A1C and BMI were significant predictors of IGT/T2DM after controlling for other factors. The risk of IGT/T2DM within 5 years was 17.16 (95% CL: 6.169, 47.736) times greater for those with baseline A1C&gt;=5.8% as compared to those &lt;5.8% (p &lt; 0.0001). Baseline A1C&gt;=5.8% was a significant predictor of IGT/T2DM within 5 years in a population at high risk for T2DM. A1C is routinely performed among patients with diabetes, however these data and other evidence suggest that it may also be a useful tool for risk assessment and screening.

17110639	20061118	Variants in estrogen biosynthesis genes, sex steroid hormone levels, and endometrial cancer: a HuGE review.	Variants in genes involved in estrogen biosynthesis are likely to be important in the etiology of endometrial cancer. This review summarizes data on variants in seven genes in the estrogen biosynthesis pathway and their relation to circulating levels of sex steroid hormones in women and to risk of endometrial cancer. Little or no association was found between genotypes of the cytochrome P-450 genes CYP11A1 (-528[TTTTA]n) or CYP17A1 (-34T/C) or the 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 gene HSD17B1 (Ser312Gly) and levels of progesterone, androgens, or estrogens. The position -34T/C variant in CYP17A1 appears to be associated with reduced risk of endometrial cancer, with those homozygous for the variant allele having about half the risk of those homozygous for the wild type. Linked variants in CYP19A1 (intron 4 [TTTA]n, intron 4 [TCT] insertion/deletion, exon 10 C/T) are related to some hormone levels and, based on two studies, to risk of endometrial cancer. For other genes (HSD3B1, HSD3B2, HSD17B2), no information is available on these associations. Results indicate the need to study other variants and haplotypes in these genes, particularly CYP17A1 and CYP19A1, as well as variants in other genes involved in hormone biosynthesis and metabolism pathways. Larger studies or combined studies that allow for investigation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions are warranted. 	Am._J._Epidemiol.	D016428 D016454
24691160	20140403	New perspectives in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) I: endogenous angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition.	Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors represent the fifth most often prescribed drugs. ACE inhibitors decrease 5-year mortality by approximately one-fifth in cardiovascular patients. Surprisingly, there are reports dating back to 1979 suggesting the existence of endogenous ACE inhibitors, which endogenous inhibitory effects are much less characterized than that for the clinically administered ACE inhibitors. Here we aimed to investigate this endogenous ACE inhibition in human sera. It was hypothesized that ACE activity is masked by an endogenous inhibitor, which dissociates from the ACE when its concentration decreases upon dilution. ACE activity was measured by FAPGG hydrolysis first. The specific (dilution corrected) enzyme activities significantly increased by dilution of human serum samples (23.2 ? 0.7 U/L at 4-fold dilution, 51.4 ? 0.3 U/L at 32-fold dilution, n = 3, p = 0.001), suggesting the presence of an endogenous inhibitor. In accordance, specific enzyme activities did not changed by dilution when purified renal ACE was used, where no endogenous inhibitor was present (655 ? 145 U/L, 605 ? 42 U/L, n = 3, p = 0.715, respectively). FAPGG conversion strongly correlated with angiotensin I conversion suggesting that this feature is not related to the artificial substrate. Serum samples were ultra-filtered to separate ACE (MW: 180 kDa) and the hypothesized inhibitor. Filtering through 50 kDa filters was without effect, while filtering through 100 kDa filters eliminated the inhibiting factor (ACE activity after &lt;100 kDa filtering: 56.4 ? 2.4 U/L, n = 4, control: 26.4 ? 0.7 U/L, n = 4, p&lt;0.001). Lineweaver-Burk plot indicated non-competitive inhibition of ACE by this endogenous factor. The endogenous inhibitor had higher potency on the C-terminal active site than N-terminal active site of ACE. Finally, this endogenous ACE inhibition was also present in mouse, donkey, goat, bovine sera besides men (increasing of specific ACE activity from 4-fold to 32-fold dilution: 2.8-fold, 1.7-fold, 1.5-fold, 1.8-fold, 2.6-fold, respectively). We report here the existence of an evolutionary conserved mechanism suppressing circulating ACE activity, in vivo, similarly to ACE inhibitory drugs. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485

8556304	19950101	Characterization of phenylketonuria alleles in the Italian population.	In order to identify the molecular basis of phenylketonuria (PKU) in Italy, we screened the entire coding sequence of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in 20 Italian PKU patients, whose origins are scattered throughout Italy. The frequency of each identified mutation and of 5 other European mutations was determined within a panel of 92 Italian PKU patients. This approach allowed us to identify 20 different PKU mutations and characterize 64% of the Italian PKU chromosomes. Eleven mutations (IVS10nt546, L48S, R158Q, R261Q, P281L, R261X, R252W, delta T55, IVS7nt1, IVS12nt1, Y414C) represent 55.4% of the Italian PKU alleles, the most common mutations being IVS10nt546 (12.4%) and L48S (9%). All the other mutations are very rare. These data confirm the great heterogeneity expected from previous RFLP haplotype studies. Genotype/phenotype correlation allowed for assessment of the clinical impact of the 20 identified mutations. 	Eur._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D013485
18767027	20080904	Association of HPC2/ELAC2 and RNASEL non-synonymous variants with prostate cancer risk in African American familial and sporadic cases.	The RNASEL and HPC2/ELAC2 genes have been implicated in hereditary prostate cancer. Further assessment of the role of these genes in sporadic prostate cancer in African American men (AAM) is warranted. Genotyping of HPC2/ELAC2 variants (S217L, A541T), along with RNASEL variants (R462Q and E541D) was completed in 155 African American sporadic and 88 familial prostate cancer cases, and 296 healthy male controls. Logistic regression analysis was performed and odds ratios (OR) were calculated, while correcting for both age and population stratification using admixture informative markers. The HPC2/ELAC2 217L allele was significantly associated with risk of prostate cancer when taking all cases into account (OR = 1.6; 1.0-2.6; P = 0.03). The RNASEL 541D allele was associated with a decrease in risk of prostate cancer in sporadic cases (OR = 0.4; 0.2-0.8; P = 0.01). We did not detect an association between prostate cancer risk and the RNASEL R462Q variant. Results from haplotype analyses of the two RNASEL variants revealed highly significant differences in haplotype allele frequencies between cases and controls suggesting a synergistic effect at the RNASEL locus. One haplotype in particular (462R-541D) is far more frequent in our control population and shows a strong protective effect against prostate cancer (OR = 0.47, P = 8.1 x 10(-9)). These results suggest that HPC2/ELAC2 and RNASEL may play a role, however minor, in prostate cancer risk among AAM. 	Prostate	D016428 D052061
18075465	20071214	Promoter polymorphisms and allelic imbalance in ABCB1 expression.	The ABCB1 (MDR1) gene, encoding the transporter P-glycoprotein, is known to act on a broad range of prescription medicines. For this reason a large number of studies have assessed the functional consequences of variation in this gene. Particular attention has focused on the ABCB1_3435C&gt;T polymorphism, an exonic variant resulting in a synonymous change. This variant has been associated with mRNA, protein and serum levels, and with responses to a number of medicines. The results of association studies have, however, been variable and it is not currently clear whether this polymorphism is functional or is in linkage disequilibrium with functionally distinct alleles. To identify functional variation in the ABCB1 gene we assessed allelic imbalance by pyrosequencing cDNA from 80 lymphoblastoid B cell lines from the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) collection, including 74 individuals heterozygous for 3435C&gt;T. We found that the degree of ABCB1 allelic imbalance differed among B-cell lines. In an effort to fine-map variants that influence the proportion of the two allelic mRNA species we genotyped representative common variations near the 3435C&gt;T polymorphism by using a tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) approach. In one approach, we assessed in segregating families the impact of cis-acting variants on mRNA levels by using allelic imbalance as the phenotype in a regression analysis that distinguishes the coupling arrangements (phase) among alleles. In a second approach, we assessed allelic imbalance levels in lymphoblastoid B-cell lines from unrelated HapMap individuals, and performed an association using tagSNPs in a 5-Mb region surrounding the gene. Two potential cis-acting variants, a promoter rs28656907/rs28373093 dinucleotide polymorphism (P=0.007) and the rs10245483 SNP (P=0.0003) located 2 Mb upstream from the gene, were predictors of ABCB1 expression. The study outlines a general experimental approach for fine mapping gene variants that influence mRNA expression by using cultured cell lines. 	Pharmacogenet._Genomics	D016428 D013485

Unexpectedly, treatment of cells with A-443654 causes paradoxical hyperphosphorylation of Akt at its two regulatory sites (Thr308 and Ser473). We explored whether inhibitor-induced hyperphosphorylation of Akt by A-443654 is a consequence of disrupted feedback regulation at a pathway level or whether it is a direct consequence of inhibitor binding to the ATP binding site of Akt. Catalytically inactive mutants of Akt revealed that binding of an inhibitor to the ATP site of Akt is sufficient to directly cause hyperphosphorylation of the kinase in the absence of any pathway feedback effects. We conclude that ATP-competitive Akt inhibitors impart regulatory phosphorylation of their target kinase Akt. These results provide new insights into both natural regulation of Akt activation and Akt inhibitors entering the clinic. 	Nat._Chem._Biol.	D016428 D052061 D013485
22443207	20120327	Collapsin response mediator protein-2 phosphorylation promotes the reversible retraction of oligodendrocyte processes in response to non-lethal oxidative stress.	The extension of processes of oligodendrocyte (OLG) and their precursor cells are crucial for migration, axonal contact and myelination. Here we show that a non-lethal oxidative stress induced by 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) elicited a rapid shortening of processes (~24%) in primary OLGs and in oligodendroglial cell line (OLN-93) cells (~36%) as compared with vehicle-exposed cells. This was reversible and prevented by antioxidants. Proteomics of OLG lysates with and without 3-NP treatment yielded collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP-2) as a candidate effector molecule. Inhibition of rho kinase was sufficient to prevent process retraction in both OLGs and OLN-93 cells. Oxidative stress increased phosphorylation of CRMP-2 at T555 that was completely prevented by Y27632. Moreover, transfection of OLN-93 cells with the mutant CRMP-2 T555A which cannot be phosphorylated by rho kinase, prevented process shortening induced by 3-NP as compared with wild-type CRMP-2. Our results suggest a role for endogenous reactive oxygen species in a pathway that regulates OLG process extension. The vulnerability of late myelinated neurons in the adult brain and the presence of white matter pathology in human dementias warrant the study of this oligodendroglial pathway in the early stages of neurodegenerative conditions characterized by oxidative stress.

25275497	20141003	Protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-distal sequences engage CRISPR Cas9 DNA target cleavage.	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated enzyme Cas9 is an RNA-guided nuclease that has been widely adapted for genome editing in eukaryotic cells. However, the in vivo target specificity of Cas9 is poorly understood and most studies rely on in silico predictions to define the potential off-target editing spectrum. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), we delineate the genome-wide binding panorama of catalytically inactive Cas9 directed by two different single guide (sg) RNAs targeting the Trp53 locus. Cas9:sgRNA complexes are able to load onto multiple sites with short seed regions adjacent to (5')NGG(3') protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Yet among 43 ChIP-seq sites harboring seed regions analyzed for mutational status, we find editing only at the intended on-target locus and one off-target site. In vitro analysis of target site recognition revealed that interactions between the 5' end of the guide and PAM-distal target sequences are necessary to efficiently engage Cas9 nucleolytic activity, providing an explanation for why off-target editing is significantly lower than expected from ChIP-seq data.

9225977	19970701	A double mutant LDL receptor allele in a cypriot family with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.	Two novel mutations Q363X and D365E were identified in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene in a Cypriot patient with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Restriction enzyme analysis of the index case and seven of her family members, by using AvaII and PvuII respectively, demonstrated that the two exon 8 mutations are transmitted in cis within the family. The disease phenotype is probably caused by the stop-363 mutation; this would result in a truncated protein that would probably be rapidly degraded in the extracellular space. 	Hum._Genet.

20807397	20100903	The landscape of human genes involved in the immune response to parasitic worms.	More than 2 billion individuals worldwide suffer from helminth infections. The highest parasite burdens occur in children and helminth infection during pregnancy is a risk factor for preterm delivery and reduced birth weight. Therefore, helminth infections can be regarded as a strong selective pressure. Here we propose that candidate susceptibility genes for parasitic worm infections can be identified by searching for SNPs that display a strong correlation with the diversity of helminth species/genera transmitted in different geographic areas. By a genome-wide search we identified 3478 variants that correlate with helminth diversity. These SNPs map to 810 distinct human genes including loci involved in regulatory T cell function and in macrophage activation, as well as leukocyte integrins and co-inhibitory molecules. Analysis of functional relationships among these genes identified complex interaction networks centred around Th2 cytokines. Finally, several genes carrying candidate targets for helminth-driven selective pressure also harbour susceptibility alleles for asthma/allergy or are involved in airway hyper-responsiveness, therefore expanding the known parallelism between these conditions and parasitic infections. Our data provide a landscape of human genes that modulate susceptibility to helminths and indicate parasitic worms as one of the major selective forces in humans. 	BMC_Evol._Biol.	D016428 D013485
20550866	20100617	[Non-syndromic cleft lip/cleft palate and C677T methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase variant in Mexican children].	Non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCLP) is a common malformation. The aetiology is multifactorial. An incidence of 1.1-1.39 per 1000 new births had been reported in Mexico. The folic acid intake in preconceptional stage has been reported to prevent malformations such as neural tube defects (NTD) and NSCLP. The C677T variant of the methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene is responsible of a thermolabile form, related to decrease of folate and increase homocysteine. This variant has been associated with CLP, in different populations, but results are still controversial. Our objective was to determine the allelic (AF) and genotypic frequency (GF) of the MTHFR-C677T variant in Mexican children with NSCLP. Transverse comparative study in 67 Mexican children with NSCLP and a control group with 70 unrelated Mexican individuals without NSCLP. The AF in NSCLP was 39 %. There was no statistical difference between AF in the two groups (39 versus 41). In this population, genotype C677T was not a major risk factor for this malformation, however, sample size, other genes implicated and genes-environment interactions must be considered.

11585758	20011005	Mechanisms of uptake and resistance to troxacitabine, a novel deoxycytidine nucleoside analogue, in human leukemic and solid tumor cell lines.	Troxacitabine (Troxatyl; BCH-4556; (-)-2'-deoxy-3'-oxacytidine), a deoxycytidine analogue with an unusual dioxolane structure and nonnatural L-configuration, has potent antitumor activity in animal models and is in clinical trials against human malignancies. The current work was undertaken to identify potential biochemical mechanisms of resistance to troxacitabine and to determine whether there are differences in resistance mechanisms between troxacitabine, gemcitabine, and cytarabine in human leukemic and solid tumor cell lines. The CCRF-CEM leukemia cell line was highly sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of troxacitabine, gemcitabine, and cytarabine with inhibition of proliferation by 50% observed at 160, 20, and 10 nM, respectively, whereas a deoxycytidine kinase (dCK)-deficient variant (CEM/dCK(-)) was resistant to all three drugs. In contrast, a nucleoside transport-deficient variant (CEM/ARAC8C) exhibited high levels of resistance to cytarabine (1150-fold) and gemcitabine (432-fold) but only minimal resistance to troxacitabine (7-fold). Analysis of troxacitabine transportability by the five molecularly characterized human nucleoside transporters [human equilibrative nucleoside transporters 1 and 2, human concentrative nucleoside transporter (hCNT) 1, hCNT2, and hCNT3] revealed that short- and long-term uptake of 10-30 microM [(3)H]troxacitabine was low and unaffected by the presence of either nucleoside transport inhibitors or high concentrations of nonradioactive troxacitabine. These results, which suggested that the major route of cellular uptake of troxacitabine was passive diffusion, demonstrated that deficiencies in nucleoside transport were unlikely to impart resistance to troxacitabine. A troxacitabine-resistant prostate cancer subline (DU145(R); 6300-fold) that exhibited reduced uptake of troxacitabine was cross-resistant to both gemcitabine (350-fold) and cytarabine (300-fold). dCK activity toward deoxycytidine in DU145(R) cell lysates was &lt;20% of that in DU145 cell lysates, and no activity was detected toward troxacitabine. Sequence analysis of cDNAs encoding dCK revealed a mutation of a highly conserved amino acid (Trp(92)--&gt;Leu) in DU145(R) dCK, providing a possible explanation for the reduced phosphorylation of troxacitabine in DU145(R) lysates. Reduced deamination of deoxycytidine was also observed in DU145(R) relative to DU145 cells, and this may have contributed to the overall resistance phenotype. These results, which demonstrated a different resistance profile for troxacitabine, gemcitabine, and cytarabine, suggest that troxacitabine may have an advantage over gemcitabine and cytarabine in human malignancies that lack or have low nucleoside transport activities.

23618908	20130427	Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) inhibits p53-dependent apoptosis through the collaboration with HDAC6 in response to DNA damage.	Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) is the best known as an essential protein for osteoblast differentiation. In this study, we have found for the first time that RUNX2 acts as a negative regulator for p53 in response to DNA damage. On DNA damage mediated by adriamycin (ADR) exposure, p53 as well as RUNX2 was induced at protein and mRNA level in human osteosarcoma-derived U2OS cells in association with a significant upregulation of various p53-target genes. Indirect immunostaining and co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that RUNX2 colocalizes with p53 in cell nucleus and forms a complex with p53 following ADR treatment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that RUNX2/p53 complex is efficiently recruited onto p53-target promoters in response to ADR, suggesting that RUNX2 might be involved in the regulation of transcriptional activation mediated by p53. Indeed, forced expression of RUNX2 resulted in a remarkable downregulation of p53-target genes. Consistent with these observations, knockdown of RUNX2 enhanced ADR-mediated apoptosis and also elevated p53-target gene expression in response to ADR. On the other hand, depletion of RUNX2 in p53-deficient human lung carcinoma-derived H1299 cells had an undetectable effect on p53-target gene expression regardless of ADR treatment, indicating that RUNX2-mediated downregulation of p53-target genes is dependent on p53. Furthermore, RUNX2/p53 complex included histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and HDAC6 was also recruited onto p53-target promoters following ADR exposure. Of note, HDAC6-specific chemical inhibitor tubacin treatment enhanced ADR-mediated upregulation of p53-target gene expression, indicating that deacetylase activity of HDAC6 is required for RUNX2-mediated downregulation of p53-target gene. Taken together, our present findings strongly suggest that RUNX2 inhibits DNA damage-induced transcriptional as well as pro-apoptotic activity of p53 through the functional collaboration with HDAC6 and therefore might be an attractive therapeutic target for cancer treatment.

27459991	20160728	Galectin-8 promotes migration and proliferation and prevents apoptosis in U87 glioblastoma cells.	Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive cancers of the brain. Malignant traits of glioblastoma cells include elevated migration, proliferation and survival capabilities. Galectins are unconventionally secreted glycan-binding proteins that modulate processes of cell adhesion, migration, proliferation and apoptosis by interacting with beta-galactosides of cell surface glycoproteins and the extracellular matrix. Galectin-8 is one of the galectins highly expressed in glioblastoma cells. It has a unique selectivity for terminally sialylated glycans recently found enhanced in these highly malignant cells. A previous study in glioblastoma cell lines reported that Gal-8 coating a plastic surface stimulates two-dimensional motility. Because in other cells Gal-8 arrests proliferation and induces apoptosis, here we extend its study by analyzing all of these processes in a U87 glioblastoma cell model. We used immunoblot and RT-PCR for Gal-8 expression analysis, recombinant Gal-8 produced in a bacteria system for Gal-8 treatment of the cells, and shRNA in lentivirus transduction for Gal-8 silencing. Cell migration as assessed in transwell filters. Cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by FACS. Gal-8 as a soluble stimulus triggered chemotactic migration of U87 cells across the polycarbonate filter of transwell chambers, almost as intensively as fetal bovine serum. Unexpectedly, Gal-8 also enhanced U87 cell growth. Co-incubation of Gal-8 with lactose, which blocks galectin-glycan interactions, abrogated both effects. Immunoblot showed Gal-8 in conditioned media reflecting its secretion. U87 cells transduced with silencing shRNA in a lentiviral vector expressed and secreted 30-40?% of their normal Gal-8 levels. These cells maintained their migratory capabilities, but decreased their proliferation rate and underwent higher levels of apoptosis, as revealed by flow cytometry analysis of cell cycle, CFSE and activated caspase-3 staining. Proliferation seemed to be more sensitive than migration to Gal-8 expression levels. Gal-8, either secreted or exogenously enriched in the media, and acting through extracellular glycan interactions, constitutes a strong stimulus of directional migration in glioblastoma U87 cells and for the first time emerges as a factor that promotes proliferation and prevents apoptosis in cancerous cells. These properties could potentially contribute to the exaggerated malignancy of glioblastoma cells. 	Biol._Res.	D016428
22955671	20120908	Single nucleotide polymorphism detection by optical DNA-based sensing coupled with whole genomic amplification.	The work presented here deals with the optimization of a strategy for detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms based on surface plasmon resonance imaging. First, a sandwich-like assay was designed, and oligonucleotide sequences were computationally selected in order to study optimized conditions for the detection of the rs1045642 single nucleotide polymorphism in the gene ABCB1. Then the strategy was optimized on a surface plasmon resonance imaging biosensor using synthetic DNA sequences in order to evaluate the best conditions for the detection of a single mismatching base. Finally, the assay was tested on DNA extracted from human blood which was subsequently amplified using a whole genome amplification kit. The direct detection of the polymorphism was successfully achieved. The biochip was highly regenerable and reusable for up to 20 measurements. Furthermore, coupling these promising results with the multiarray assay, we can foresee applying this biosensor in clinical research extended to concurrent analysis of different polymorphisms.

26337516	20150905	New Insights into Active Site Conformation Dynamics of E. coli PNP Revealed by Combined H/D Exchange Approach and Molecular Dynamics Simulations.	The biologically active form of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) from Escherichia coli (EC 2.4.2.1) is a homohexamer unit, assembled as a trimer of dimers. Upon binding of phosphate, neighboring monomers adopt different active site conformations, described as open and closed. To get insight into the functions of the two distinctive active site conformations, virtually inactive Arg24Ala mutant is complexed with phosphate; all active sites are found to be in the open conformation. To understand how the sites of neighboring monomers communicate with each other, we have combined H/D exchange (H/DX) experiments with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Both methods point to the mobility of the enzyme, associated with a few flexible regions situated at the surface and within the dimer interface. Although H/DX provides an average extent of deuterium uptake for all six hexamer active sites, it was able to indicate the dynamic mechanism of cross-talk between monomers, allostery. Using this technique, it was found that phosphate binding to the wild type (WT) causes arrest of the molecular motion in backbone fragments that are flexible in a ligand-free state. This was not the case for the Arg24Ala mutant. Upon nucleoside substrate/inhibitor binding, some release of the phosphate-induced arrest is observed for the WT, whereas the opposite effects occur for the Arg24Ala mutant. MD simulations confirmed that phosphate is bound tightly in the closed active sites of the WT; conversely, in the open conformation of the active site of the WT phosphate is bound loosely moving towards the exit of the active site. In Arg24Ala mutant binary complex Pi is bound loosely, too. 	J._Am._Soc._Mass_Spectrom.	D016428 D013485
16757976	20060608	Ser18 and 23 phosphorylation is required for p53-dependent apoptosis and tumor suppression.	Mouse p53 is phosphorylated at Ser18 and Ser23 after DNA damage. To determine whether these two phosphorylation events have synergistic functions in activating p53 responses, we simultaneously introduced Ser18/23 to Ala mutations into the endogenous p53 locus in mice. While partial defects in apoptosis are observed in p53S18A and p53S23A thymocytes exposed to IR, p53-dependent apoptosis is essentially abolished in p53S18/23A thymocytes, indicating that these two events have critical and synergistic roles in activating p53-dependent apoptosis. In addition, p53S18/23A, but not p53S18A, could completely rescue embryonic lethality of Xrcc4(-/-) mice that is caused by massive p53-dependent neuronal apoptosis. However, certain p53-dependent functions, including G1/S checkpoint and cellular senescence, are partially retained in p53(S18/23A) cells. While p53(S18A) mice are not cancer prone, p53S18/23A mice developed a spectrum of malignancies distinct from p53S23A and p53(-/-) mice. Interestingly, Xrcc4(-/-)p53S18/23A mice fail to develop tumors like the pro-B cell lymphomas uniformly developed in Xrcc4(-/-) p53(-/-) animals, but exhibit developmental defects typical of accelerated ageing. Therefore, Ser18 and Ser23 phosphorylation is important for p53-dependent suppression of tumorigenesis in certain physiological context. 	EMBO_J.	D016428 D052061 D013485
26121691	20150630	SIRT3 Enhances Glycolysis and Proliferation in SIRT3-Expressing Gastric Cancer Cells.	SIRT3 is a key NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase in the mitochondria of mammalian cells, functioning to prevent cell aging and transformation via regulation of mitochondrial metabolic homeostasis. However, SIRT3 is also found to express in some human tumors; its role in these SIRT3-expressing tumor cells needs to be elucidated. This study demonstrated that the expression of SIRT3 was elevated in a group of gastric cancer cells compared to normal gastric epithelial cells. Although SIRT3 expression levels were increased in the gastric tumor tissues compared to the adjacent non-tumor tissues, SIRT3 positive cancer cells were more frequently detected in the intestinal type gastric cancers than the diffuse type gastric cancers, indicating that SIRT3 is linked with subtypes of gastric cancer. Overexpression of SIRT3 promoted cell proliferation and enhanced ATP generation, glucose uptake, glycogen formation, MnSOD activity and lactate production, which were inhibited by SIRT3 knockdown, indicating that SIRT3 plays a role in reprogramming the bioenergetics in gastric tumor cells. Further analysis revealed that SIRT3 interacted with and deacetylated the lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), a key protein in regulating anaerobic glycolysis, enhancing LDHA activity. In consistence, a cluster of glycolysis-associated genes was upregulated in the SIRT3-overexpressing gastric tumor cells. Thus, in addition to the well-documented SIRT3-mediated mitochondrial homeostasis in normal cells, SIRT3 may enhance glycolysis and cell proliferation in SIRT3-expressing cancer cells.

26257598	20150811	Antidepressant mechanism of ketamine: perspective from preclinical studies.	A debilitating mental disorder, major depressive disorder is a leading cause of global disease burden. Existing antidepressant drugs are not adequate for the majority of depressed patients, and large clinical studies have demonstrated their limited efficacy and slow response onset. Growing evidence of low-dose ketamine's rapid and potent antidepressant effects offers strong potential for future antidepressant agents. However, ketamine has considerable drawbacks such as its abuse potential, psychomimetic effects, and increased oxidative stress in the brain, thus limiting its widespread clinical use. To develop superior antidepressant drugs, it is crucial to better understand ketamine's antidepressant mechanism of action. Recent preclinical studies indicate that ketamine's antidepressant mechanism involves mammalian target of rapamycin pathway activation and subsequent synaptogenesis in the prefrontal cortex, as well as glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3?) inactivation. Adjunct GSK-3? inhibitors, such as lithium, can enhance ketamine's efficacy by augmenting and prolonging its antidepressant effects. Given the potential for depressive relapses, lithium in addition to ketamine is a promising solution for this clinical issue. 	Front_Neurosci	D016428 D016454
8706004	19960815	High prevalence of the 999del5 mutation in icelandic breast and ovarian cancer patients.	Studies on Icelandic breast cancer families have shown that most of them segregate a 999del5 BRCA2 mutation. Here, we report the frequency of the 999del5 BRCA2 mutation in an Icelandic control population and four different groups of cancer patients diagnosed with (a) breast cancer; (b) ovarian cancer; (c) prostate cancer (patients younger than 65 years); and (d) other cancer types. The proportions of individuals carrying the mutation were 0.4% in the control population and in the patient groups 8.5%, 7.9%, 2.7%, and 1.0%, respectively. Our results indicate that BRCA2 confers a very high risk of breast cancer and is responsible for a substantial fraction of breast and ovarian cancer in Iceland, but only a small proportion of other cancers.

25236687	20140920	Significant clinical impact of recurrent BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Mexico.	Frequent recurrent mutations in the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility (BRCA) genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 among Hispanics, including a large rearrangement Mexican founder mutation (BRCA1 exon 9-12 deletion [ex9-12del]), suggest that an ancestry-informed BRCA-testing strategy could reduce disparities and promote cancer prevention by enabling economic screening for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in Mexico. In a multistage approach, 188 patients with cancer who were unselected for family cancer history (92 with ovarian cancer and 96 with breast cancer) were screened for BRCA mutations using a Hispanic mutation panel (HISPANEL) of 115 recurrent mutations in a multiplex assay (114 were screened on a mass spectroscopy platform, and a polymerase chain reaction assay was used to screen for the BRCA1 ex9-12del mutation). This was followed by sequencing of all BRCA exons and adjacent intronic regions and a BRCA1 multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay (MLPA) for HISPANEL-negative patients. BRCA mutation prevalence was calculated and correlated with histology and tumor receptor status, and HISPANEL sensitivity was estimated. BRCA mutations were detected in 26 of 92 patients (28%) with ovarian cancer, in 14 of 96 patients (15%) with breast cancer overall, and in 9 of 33 patients (27%) who had tumors that were negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epithelial growth factor 2 (triple-negative breast cancer). Most patients with breast cancer were diagnosed with locally advanced disease. The Mexican founder mutation (BRCA1 ex9-12del) accounted for 35% of BRCA-associated ovarian cancers and 29% of BRCA-associated breast cancers. At 2% of the sequencing and MLPA cost, HISPANEL detected 68% of all BRCA mutations. In this study, a remarkably high prevalence of BRCA mutations was observed among patients with ovarian cancer and breast cancer who were not selected for family history, and the BRCA1 ex9-12del mutation explained 33% of the total. The remarkable frequency of BRCA1 ex9-12del in Mexico City supports a nearby origin of this Mexican founder mutation and may constitute a regional public health problem. The HISPANEL mutation panel presents a translational opportunity for cost-effective genetic testing to enable breast and ovarian cancer prevention. 	Cancer	D016428 D052061 D013485
23951268	20130817	SLC1A2 variant is associated with essential tremor in Taiwanese population.	Essential tremor (ET), which is one of the most common movement disorders, may lead to severe interference in quality of life. The first genome-wide association study (GWAS) has identified an association of the LINGO1 variant (rs9652490) with ET in Americans and Europeans. Recently, a second GWAS that was performed in a European population has discovered a new variant (rs3794087) of the main glial glutamate transporter (SLC1A2) that increases the risk of ET with an odds ratio of about 1.4. SLC1A2 encodes for the major glial high-affinity glutamate reuptake transporter in the brain and is a potential ET susceptibility gene. Because replication in a different ethnic population is important for validating a finding, we conducted a case-control study to investigate the SLC1A2 variant in an Asian cohort with ET in Taiwan. A total of 542 subjects (273 ET patients and 269 controls) were included. The results showed that rs3794087 was associated with ET among the Taiwanese. The odds ratio was 1.37. Our results were similar to those of the second GWAS of ET in Europeans, and this confirms that SLC1A2 may be a good functional candidate gene for ET. A replication study in another independent population is of importance to validate this association. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D013485

8799376	19960601	Intrafamilial variable expressivity of osteogenesis imperfecta due to mosaicism for a lethal G382R substitution in the COL1A1 gene.	Fibroblasts from a 23 week old fetus affected with lethal (type II) osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) produced normal and abnormal type I procollagen molecules. The abnormal molecules were shown to contain pro alpha 1(I) chains in which the glycine at position 382 of the triple helical domain was substituted by arginine, as the result of a G-to-C transversion at nucleotide 1797 of the pro alpha (I) coding sequence. Also fibroblasts from the apparently normal father produced abnormal type I collagen but the overmodified alpha 1(I) chains tended to disappear with increasing passage number. We determined that the mutant allele accounted for approximately 36% of the COL1A1 alleles in the father's skin fibroblasts. Upon careful clinical reexamination, the man appeared to be very mildly affected with OI. The most plausible explanation for such a phenotypic variation is that the father is a mosaic for a mutation that is lethal in the heterozygous son. This finding confirms previous observations that somatic mosaicism for new dominant mutations is responsible for extreme intrafamilial variability and poses some caveats in genetic counselling.

11796727	20020118	Essential hydrophilic carboxyl-terminal regions including cysteine residues of the yeast stretch-activated calcium-permeable channel Mid1.	The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae MID1 gene encodes a stretch-activated Ca(2+)-permeable nonselective cation channel composed of 548 amino acid residues. A physiological role of the Mid1 channel is known to maintain the viability of yeast cells exposed to mating pheromone, but its structural basis remains to be clarified. To solve this problem, we identified the mutation sites of mid1 mutant alleles generated by in vivo ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and found that two mid1 alleles have nonsense mutations at the codon for Trp(441), generating a truncated Mid1 protein lacking two-thirds of the intracellular carboxyl-terminal region from Asn(389) to Thr(548). In vitro random mutagenesis with hydroxylamine also showed that the carboxyl-terminal region is essential. To identify the functional portion of the carboxyl-terminal region in detail, we performed a progressive carboxyl-terminal truncation followed by functional analyses and found that the truncated protein produced from the mid1 allele bearing the amber mutation at the codon for Phe(522) (F522Am) complemented the mating pheromone-induced death phenotype of the mid1 mutant and increased its Ca(2+) uptake activity to a wild-type level, whereas N521Am did not. This result indicates that the carboxyl-terminal domain spanning from Asn(389) to Asn(521) is required for Mid1 function. Interestingly, this domain is cysteine-rich, and alanine-scanning mutagenesis revealed that seven out of 10 cysteine residues are unexchangeable. These results clearly indicate that the carboxyl-terminal domain including the cysteine residues is important for Mid1 function. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428 D013485
25720963	20150228	Lysosomal calcium signalling regulates autophagy through calcineurin and ?TFEB.	The view of the lysosome as the terminal end of cellular catabolic pathways has been challenged by recent studies showing a central role of this organelle in the control of cell function. Here we show that a lysosomal Ca2+ signalling mechanism controls the activities of the phosphatase calcineurin and of its substrate ?TFEB, a master transcriptional regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. Lysosomal Ca2+ release through ?mucolipin 1 (?MCOLN1) activates calcineurin, which binds and dephosphorylates ?TFEB, thus promoting its nuclear translocation. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin suppressed ?TFEB activity during starvation and physical exercise, while calcineurin overexpression and constitutive activation had the opposite effect. Induction of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis through ?TFEB required ?MCOLN1-mediated calcineurin activation. These data link lysosomal calcium signalling to both calcineurin regulation and autophagy induction and identify the lysosome as a hub for the signalling pathways that regulate cellular homeostasis.

Staphylococcal enterotoxin A is a single-chain polypeptide which consists of 233 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 27,078 and has the amino acid composition Cys2, Asp17, Asn19, Thr16, Ser13, Glu15, Gln12, Pro4, Gly15, Ala7, Val13, Met2, Ile10, Leu23, Tyr18, Phe8, His6, Lys24, Arg7, Trp2, with serine as both amino- and carboxyl-terminal amino acids. Automated sequence analysis of intact enterotoxin A, as well as characterization of the peptides obtained from cyanogen bromide treatment and trypsin and chymotrypsin digestion, led to the elucidation of the complete primary structure of this protein. Less structural homology is observed among staphylococcal enterotoxins A, B (Huang, I-Y., and Bergdoll, M. S. (1970) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 3518-3525), and C1 (Schmidt, J. J., and Spero, L. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6300-6306) than that seen between enterotoxins B and C1. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428
25009459	20140711	P2X4 receptors (P2X4Rs) represent a novel target for the development of drugs to prevent and/or treat alcohol use disorders.	Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) have a staggering socioeconomic impact. Few therapeutic options are available, and they are largely inadequate. These shortcomings highlight the urgent need to develop effective medications to prevent and/or treat AUDs. A critical barrier is the lack of information regarding the molecular target(s) by which ethanol (EtOH) exerts its pharmacological activity. This review highlights findings implicating P2X4 receptors (P2X4Rs) as a target for the development of therapeutics to treat AUDs and discusses the use of ivermectin (IVM) as a potential clinical tool for treatment of AUDs. P2XRs are a family of ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) activated by extracellular ATP. Of the P2XR subtypes, P2X4Rs are expressed the most abundantly in the CNS. Converging evidence suggests that P2X4Rs are involved in the development and progression of AUDs. First, in vitro studies report that pharmacologically relevant EtOH concentrations can negatively modulate ATP-activated currents. Second, P2X4Rs in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system are thought to play a role in synaptic plasticity and are located ideally to modulate brain reward systems. Third, alcohol-preferring (P) rats have lower functional expression of the p2rx4 gene than alcohol-non-preferring (NP) rats suggesting an inverse relationship between alcohol intake and P2X4R expression. Similarly, whole brain p2rx4 expression has been shown to relate inversely to innate 24 h alcohol preference across 28 strains of rats. Fourth, mice lacking the p2rx4 gene drink more EtOH than wildtype controls. Fifth, IVM, a positive modulator of P2X4Rs, antagonizes EtOH-mediated inhibition of P2X4Rs in vitro and reduces EtOH intake and preference in vivo. These findings suggest that P2X4Rs contribute to EtOH intake. The present review summarizes recent findings focusing on the P2X4R as a molecular target of EtOH action, its role in EtOH drinking behavior and modulation of its activity by IVM as a potential therapy for AUDs.

1976007	19900901	A 15N-n.m.r. study of cerebral, hepatic and renal nitrogen metabolism in hyperammonaemic rats.	1. Rats were infused with 15NH4+ or L-[15N]alanine to induce hyperammonaemia, a potential cause of hepatic encephalopathy. HClO4 extracts of freeze-clamped brain, liver and kidney were analysed by 15N-n.m.r. spectroscopy in combination with biochemical assays to investigate the effects of hyperammonaemia on tissue concentrations of ammonia, glutamine, glutamate and urea. 2. 15NH4+ infusion resulted in a 36-fold increase in the concentration of blood ammonia. Cerebral glutamine concentration increased, with 15NH4+ incorporated predominantly into the gamma-nitrogen atom of glutamine. Incorporation into glutamate was very low. Cerebral ammonia concentration increased 5-10-fold. The results suggest that the capacity of glutamine synthetase for ammonia detoxification was saturated. 3. Pretreatment with the glutamine synthetase inhibitor L-methionine DL-sulphoximine resulted in 84% inhibition of [gamma-15N]glutamine synthesis, but incorporation of 15N into other metabolites was not observed. The result suggests that no major alternative pathway for ammonia detoxification, other than glutamine synthetase, exists in rat brain. 4. In the liver 15NH4+ was incorporated into urea, glutamine, glutamate and alanine. The specific activity of 15N was higher in the gamma-nitrogen atom of glutamine than in urea. A similar pattern was observed when [15N]alanine was infused. The results are discussed in terms of the near-equilibrium states of the reactions involved in glutamate and alanine formation, heterogeneous distribution in the liver lobules of the enzymes involved in ammonia removal and their different affinities for ammonia. 5. Synthesis of glutamine, glutamate and hippurate de novo was observed in kidney. Hippurate, as well as 15NH4+, was contributed by co-extracted urine. 6. The potential utility and limitations of 15N n.m.r. for studies of mammalian metabolism in vivo are discussed. 	Biochem._J.	D016428 D013485
12457999	20021130	Establishing a control population to screen for the occurrence of nineteen unclassified variants in the BRCA1 gene by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.	Numerous missense mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are detected during clinical screening of breast and ovarian cancer patients. Because of the lack of a functional protein assay to determine the functional consequence of these mutations, patients are often frustrated by inconclusive results due to unclassified variants (UV). To determine whether a reported UV is also present in a control collective and therefore more likely be a rare polymorphism than a deleterious mutation, we collected a control population consisting of 95 females and 25 males aged over 60 years (mean 73 years) without a family history of BRCA associated cancers. The age of the control group is beyond the median onset of breast and ovarian cancer with a hereditary background. These controls were analysed for the presence of 19 known UVs in BRCA1 with the DHPLC technique. Only four of the 19 variants (R496H, R866C, S1040N and M1652I) were detected and can be considered polymorphims. However, no firm conclusion can be drawn about the functional relevance of the other 15 variants. 	J._Chromatogr._B_Analyt._Technol._Biomed._Life_Sci.	D016428
9122261	19970318	A surface on the G protein beta-subunit involved in interactions with adenylyl cyclases.	Receptor activation of heterotrimeric G proteins dissociates G alpha from the G betagamma complex, allowing both to regulate effectors. Little is known about the effector-interaction regions of G betagamma. We had used molecular modeling to dock a peptide encoding the region of residues 956-982 of adenylyl cyclase (AC) 2 onto Gbeta to identify residues on Gbeta that may interact with effectors. Based on predictions from the model, we synthesized peptides encoding sequences of residues 86-105 (Gbeta 86-105) and 115-135 (Gbeta 115-135) from Gbeta. The Gbeta 86-105 peptide inhibited G betagamma stimulation of AC2 and blocked G betagamma inhibition of AC1 and by itself inhibited calmodulin-stimulated AC1, thus displaying partial agonist activity. Substitution of Met-101 with Asn in this peptide resulted in the loss of both the inhibitory and partial agonist activities. Most activities of the Gbeta 115-135 peptide were similar to those of Gbeta 86-105 but Gbeta 115-135 was less efficacious in blocking G betagamma inhibition of AC1. Substitution of Tyr-124 with Val in the Gbeta 115-135 peptide diminished all of its activities. These results identify the region encoded by amino acids 84-143 of Gbeta as a surface that is involved in transmitting signals to effectors. 	Proc._Natl._Acad._Sci._U.S.A.	D016428 D013487
23805267	20130628	Germline Mutations in the Polyposis-Associated Genes BMPR1A, SMAD4, PTEN, MUTYH and GREM1 Are Not Common in Individuals with Serrated Polyposis Syndrome.	Recent reports have observed that individuals with serrated polyps, some of whom meet the clinical diagnostic criteria for Serrated Polyposis Syndrome (SPS), are among those who carry germline mutations in genes associated with polyposis syndromes including; (1) genes known to underlie hamartomatous polyposes (SMAD4, BMPR1A, and PTEN), (2) MUTYH-associated polyposis and (3) GREM1 in Hereditary Mixed Polyposis Syndrome (HMPS). The aim of this study was to characterise individuals fulfilling the current WHO criteria for SPS for germline mutations in these polyposis-associated genes. A total of 65 individuals with SPS (fulfilling WHO criteria 1 or 3), were recruited to the Genetics of Serrated Neoplasia study between 2000 and 2012, through multiple Genetics or Family Cancer Clinics within Australia, or from the New Zealand Familial Gastrointestinal Cancer Service. Individuals with SPS were tested for coding mutations and large deletions in the PTEN, SMAD4, and BMPR1A genes, for the MUTYH variants in exons 7 (Y179C) and 13 (G396D), and for the duplication upstream of GREM1. We found no variants that were likely to be deleterious germline mutations in the SPS cases in the PTEN, SMAD4, and BMPR1A genes. A novel variant in intron 2 (c.164+223T&gt;C) of PTEN was identified in one individual and was predicted by in silico analysis to have no functional consequences. One further individual with SPS was found to be mono-allelic for the MUTYH G396D mutation. No individuals carried the recently reported duplication within GREM1. Genes involved in the gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyposis, Hereditary Mixed Polyposis Syndrome and MUTYH-associated polyposis syndromes are not commonly altered in individuals with SPS.

25883525	20150418	Association of Dectin-1 and DC-SIGN gene single nucleotide polymorphisms with fungal keratitis in the northern Han Chinese population.	Dendritic cell-associated C-type lectin-1 (Dectin-1) and dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) play a crucial role in the early procedure of fungal pathogen defenses. The present study evaluated the associations between Dectin-1 and DC-SIGN gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and susceptibility to fungal keratitis (FK) in the northern Han Chinese population. The polymorphisms of Dectin-1 (rs17206002, rs3901533, rs11053613, and rs3901532) and DC-SIGN (rs4804803, rs2287886, rs735239, and rs735240) for 109 FK patients and 220 matched healthy controls were determined by PCR and DNA direct sequencing assay. Each SNP was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p&gt;0.05). The frequencies of genotypes and alleles for rs735239 and rs735240 (DC-SIGN) showed statistical differences between patients and control groups (p&lt;0.05). The wild G allele of rs735239 and the wild A allele of rs735240 were significantly higher in patients (p=0.003, OR=1.766, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.207-2.585; p=0.014, OR=1.609, 95% CI 1.100-2.355, respectively). No association with a risk of FK was found for the remaining SNPs (p&gt;0.05) even after ruling out clinical characteristics, such as severity degree and case history. Carriers of the haplotype TC (rs4804803 and rs2287886) had a higher risk of developing fungal keratitis (p=0.007, OR=1.710, 95% CI 1.154-2.534). The distribution of haplotypes AG and GA (rs735239 and rs735240) between the two groups also showed significant differences (p=0.014, p=0.003, respectively). Two SNPs of DC-SIGN (rs735239 and rs735240) are associated with susceptibility to FK in the northern Han Chinese population. The haplotypes of DC-SIGN may be susceptible to the risk of FK, whereas the analysis of Dectin-1 gene polymorphisms showed no significant association with FK risk. Further research with a larger sample is recommended. 	Mol._Vis.	D016428 D013485
17389332	20070329	Cell biology assessment of glucokinase mutations V62M and G72R in pancreatic beta-cells: evidence for cellular instability of catalytic activity.	Mutations in the glucokinase (GK) gene cause defects in blood glucose homeostasis. In some cases (V62M and G72R), the phenotype cannot be explained by altered enzyme kinetics or protein instability. We used transient and stable expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) GK chimaeras in MIN6 beta-cells to study the phenotype defect of V62M and G72R. GK activity in lysates of MIN6 cell lines stably expressing wild-type or mutant GFP GK showed the expected affinity for glucose and response to pharmacological activators, indicating the expression of catalytically active enzymes. MIN6 cells stably expressing GFP V62M or GFP G72R had a lower GK activity-to-GK immunoreactivity ratio and GK activity-to-GK mRNA ratio but not GK immunoreactivity-to-GK mRNA ratio than wild-type GFP GK. Heterologous expression of liver 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK2/FDP2) in cell lines increased GK activity for wild-type GK and V62M but not for G72R, whereas expression of liver GK regulatory protein (GKRP) increased GK activity for wild type but not V62M or G72R. Lack of interaction of these mutants with GKRP was also evident in hepatocyte transfections from the lack of nuclear accumulation. These results suggest that cellular loss of GK catalytic activity rather than impaired translation or enhanced protein degradation may account for the hyperglycemia in subjects with V62M and G72R mutations.

21845164	20110817	Alcohol consumption and oxidative DNA damage.	To examine the effects of alcohol consumption on cancer risk, we measured oxidative DNA damage and its repair activity in the livers and esophagi of rats fed with ethanol. Using our previously designed protocol for feeding rats with a high concentration of ethanol, we examined the effects of ethanol consumption on 8-oxo-Gua generation and repair activity in the livers and esophagi of rats. We found that a high concentration of ethanol accompanied with a vitamin-depleted diet increased 8-oxo-Gua and its repair activity. 8-Oxo-Gua is known to induce point mutations, leading to carcinogenesis. Therefore, these results suggested that a high concentration of ethanol and an irregular diet increased liver and esophageal cancer risk. On the other hand, we showed that a low concentration of ethanol decreased 8-oxo-Gua and its repair activity in the livers of mice treated with a carcinogen. Taken together, the effects of ethanol consumption on cancer risk depend on the ethanol concentration and the diet pattern. 	Int_J_Environ_Res_Public_Health	D016428
23233742	20121213	Admixture mapping of coronary artery calcified plaque in African Americans with type 2 diabetes mellitus.	The presence and severity of coronary artery calcified plaque (CAC) differs markedly between individuals of African and European descent, suggesting that admixture mapping may be informative for identifying genetic variants associated with subclinical cardiovascular disease. Admixture mapping of CAC was performed in 1040 unrelated African Americans with type 2 diabetes mellitus from the African American-Diabetes Heart Study, Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Family Heart Study using the Illumina custom ancestry informative marker panel. All cohorts obtained computed tomography scanning of the coronary arteries using identical protocols. For each ancestry informative marker, the probability of inheriting 0, 1, and 2 copies of a European-derived allele was determined. Linkage analysis was performed by testing for association between each ancestry informative marker using these probabilities and CAC, accounting for global ancestry, age, sex, and study. Markers on 1p32.3 in the GLIS1 gene (rs6663966, logarithm of odds [LOD]=3.7), 1q32.1 near CHIT1 (rs7530895, LOD=3.1), 4q21.2 near PRKG2 (rs1212373, LOD=3.0), and 11q25 in the OPCML gene (rs6590705, LOD=3.4) had statistically significant LOD scores, whereas markers on 8q22.2 (rs6994682, LOD=2.7), 9p21.2 (rs439314, LOD=2.7), and 13p32.1 (rs7492028, LOD=2.8) manifested suggestive evidence of linkage. These regions were uniformly characterized by higher levels of European ancestry associating with higher levels or odds of CAC. Findings were replicated in 1350 African Americans without diabetes mellitus and 2497 diabetic European Americans from Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and the Diabetes Heart Study. Fine mapping these regions will likely identify novel genetic variants that contribute to CAC and clarify racial differences in susceptibility to subclinical cardiovascular disease.

23320739	20130117	Hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma primarily diagnosed in a cervical lymph node: a case report of a 30-year-old woman with multiple metastases.	Papillary renal cell carcinoma is a rare cancer. Some cases can be attributed to individuals with hereditary renal cell carcinomas usually consisting of the clear cell subtype. In addition, two syndromes with hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma have been described. One is the hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma, which is characterized by cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas and renal cell carcinoma mostly consisting of the papillary renal cell carcinoma type II with a worse prognosis. We describe a case of a 30-year-old woman with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma syndrome with extensively metastasized papillary renal cell carcinoma, primarily diagnosed in a cervical lymph node lacking leiomyomas at any site. Papillary renal cell carcinoma in young patients should be further investigated for a hereditary variant like the hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma even if leiomyomas could not be detected. A detailed histological examination and search for mutations is essential for the survival of patients and relatives. 	BMC_Urol	D002363 D016428
27389125	20160709	Multigene Pathway Engineering with Regulatory Linkers (M-PERL).	Multigene pathway engineering usually needs amounts of part libraries on transcriptional and translational regulation as well as mutant enzymes to achieve the optimal part combinations of the target pathways. We report a new strategy for multigene pathway engineering with regulatory linkers (M-PERL) focusing on tuning the transcriptional start site (TSS) of yeast promoters. The regulatory linkers are composed of two homologous ends of two adjacent gene parts for assembly and a central regulatory region between them. We investigated the effect of the homologous end's length on multigene assembly, analyzed the influences of truncated, replaced, and elongated TSS and the adjacent region on promoters, and introduced 5 to 40 random bases of N (A/T/C/G) in the central regulatory region of the linkers which effectively varied the promoter's strengths. The distinct libraries of five regulatory linkers were used simultaneously to assemble and tune all five genes in the violacein synthesis pathway. The gene expressions affected the product profiles significantly, and the recombinants for enhanced single component synthesis and varied composition synthesis were obtained. This study offers an efficient tool to assemble and regulate multigene pathways. 	ACS_Synth_Biol	D016428 D013485
25596970	20150119	Association of DNMT1 Gene Polymorphisms with Congenital Heart Disease in Child Patients.	To reveal the association between DNMT1 polymorphisms and congenital heart disease (CHD) in child patients, a total of 224 CHD child patients as well as 199 healthy individuals were enrolled in the present study. The DNA was extracted from whole blood, and four SNPs including rs16999593, rs2228612, rs2288349 and rs10420321 were selected for the gene polymorphism investigation via ligase detection reaction (LDR) assay. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association. rs16999593 was associated with the CHD under the heterozygous (CT vs TT: OR 0.62; 95 % CI 0.41-0.95; p = 0.03), dominant (CT + CC vs TT: OR 0.63; 95 % CI 0.42-0.95; p = 0.03), and allele models (C vs T: OR 0.07; 95 % CI 0.50-1.00; p = 0.05). rs2228612 was related with the CHD under the heterozygous (AG vs AA: OR 0.42; 95 % CI 0.27-0.65; p = 0.0001), homozygous (GG vs AA: OR 0.43; 95 % CI 0.240-0.77; p = 0.004), dominant (AG + GG vs AA: OR 0.42; 95 % CI 0.28-0.64; p &lt; 0.0001), and allele models (G vs A: OR 0.62; 95 % CI 0.47-0.82; p = 0.0007). rs10420321 correlated with the CHD only under the recessive model (GG vs AG + AA: OR 0.61; 95 % CI 0.37-1.01, p = 0.05). However, no significant association between the rs2288349 polymorphisms and the risk of CHD was observed (p &gt; 0.05). DNMT1 polymorphisms might contribute to the risk of CHD, especially rs16999593 and rs2228612. 	Pediatr_Cardiol	D016428
24839392	20140520	Identification of Signaling Protein Complexes by Parallel Affinity Precipitation Coupled with Mass Spectrometry.	Protein-protein interactions play a pivotal role in both inter- and intra-cellular signaling. Identification of signaling protein complexes can thus shed important new insights into cell communications. We developed a parallel affinity precipitation protocol to overcome the disadvantages of the tandem affinity purification procedure, such as the potential disruption of target protein conformation, subcellular localization or function by epitope tags, the potential need of large amounts of cell culture or generation of stable cell lines, and relatively long duration the two-step precipitation takes. This new simplified assay of protein interaction is quick, economic and specific. This paper describes the details in the design and method of the assay. 	Cell_Commun_Insights	D016428
23403291	20130214	c-MYC-induced sebaceous gland differentiation is controlled by an androgen receptor/p53 axis.	Although the sebaceous gland (SG) plays an important role in skin function, the mechanisms regulating SG differentiation and carcinoma formation are poorly understood. We previously reported that c-MYC overexpression stimulates SG differentiation. We now demonstrate roles for the androgen receptor (AR) and p53. MYC-induced SG differentiation was reduced in mice lacking a functional AR. High levels of MYC triggered a p53-dependent DNA damage response, leading to accumulation of proliferative SG progenitors and inhibition of AR signaling. Conversely, testosterone treatment or p53 deletion activated AR signaling and restored MYC-induced differentiation. Poorly differentiated human sebaceous carcinomas exhibited high p53 and low AR expression. Thus, the consequences of overactivating MYC in the SG depend on whether AR or p53 is activated, as they form a regulatory axis controlling proliferation and differentiation.

19243785	20090227	Solubilization of n-alkylbenzene and n-perfluoroalkylbenzene in hydrogenated and fluorinated surfactants micelles.	The maximum solubilities of homologous series of n-alkylbenzene and n-perfluoroalkylbenzene in aqueous solutions of surfactants n-tetradecyltrimethylammonium chloride (TTAC) and N-(1,1-dihydroperfluorodecyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (C10F-TAC) were measured as a function of the surfactant concentration at 298.2 K. There are four solubilization systems in viewpoints of hydrocarbons and fluorocarbons. In general, in all systems, the maximum solubility decreased with an increase in the alkyl carbon length of the solubilizates. The homogeneous combinations of solubilizates and solubilizers have higher affinity than heterogeneous combinations. The affinity between a hydrocarbon and a fluorocarbon can be clarified by determining the Gibbs free energy (DeltaG(0)) on solubilization by thermodynamic analysis. The largest negative value of DeltaG(0) was obtained for the homogeneous system of n-perfluoroalkylbenzene and C10F-TAC, whereas the smallest value was obtained for the heterogeneous system of n-perfluoroalkylbenzene and TTAC. The contributions of methylene and perfluoromethylene to Gibbs energy, namely, DeltaG(CH(2)0)) and DeltaG(CF(2)(0)), were found to be -2.6 and -2.9 kJ mol(-1), respectively, for the TTAC solution, whereas the respective values for the C10F-TAC solution were -2.0 and -3.3 kJ mol(-1).

26327840	20150902	Obesity - should we revise indications for treatment with metformin?	Treatment of obesity with life style modifications often fails; therefore pharmacological treatment has become a very popular approach. Metformin is one of the examined possibilities. The aim of this study was to verify indications for metformin use in obese women based on metabolic and anthropometric parameters assessed by dual-X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), to establish the degree of insulin resistance and its correlations. Anthropometry, fat measurement by bioimpedance and metabolic profile, including lipids, and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with insulin (0 and 120 min) were performed in 50 female patients diagnosed with simple obesity, aged 18-40 years. Homeostatic model assessment HOMA-R was calculated for insulin resistance, and area under the curve (AUC) for insulin response. Total, android and gynoid fat distribution, and their ratio (A/G), were measured by DXA. From 50 women who entered the study, 33 were classified as insulin resistant (IR subgroup) and 17 as non-insulin resistant (non-IR subgroup), according to their HOMA-R indices. IR women presented higher waist circumference and DXA A/G ratio. The IR subgroup demonstrated elevated fasting triglycerides and glucose (but in the normal range) and a higher insulin response in OGTT (4.1-fold vs 2.5-fold). From different insulin measurements HOMA index turned out to have the strongest correlations with the metabolic parameters triglycerides and glucose. We found significant positive correlations between android fat and insulin: waist circumference and HOMA-R, WHR and HOMA-R, android fat and HOMA-R, A/G ratio and insulin after OGTT, and A/G ratio and HOMA-R. We found a strong correlation between WHR and A/R ratio. 67% of premenopausal obese women were insulin resistant. Measures of DXA visceral fat determined by android fat percentage and android/gynoid ratio were the strongest determinants of insulin resistance. Waist-to-hip ratio might be a simple method for determining the indications for metformin treatment. 	Prz_Menopauzalny	D016428

12811988	20030619	Neuropsychological study of familial Alzheimer's disease caused by mutation E280A in the presenilin 1 gene.	In Antioquia, Colombia, investigators have recently discovered the largest family with the E280A mutation in the presenilin 1 gene that causes one type of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). The current study compares two groups within this family: those diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its early stage (nine subjects) and relatives (carriers) who did not show any signs of dementia (nine subjects). A battery of the following neuropsychological tests was administered to subjects in both groups: the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD), a Phonological Verbal Fluency test, the Visual &quot;A&quot; Cancellation Test, memory of three phrases, the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure, and the Trail Making Test Part A. Statistical analyses of the average test scores of each group showed that the AD group scored significantly (p &lt; 0.01 or p &lt; 0.05) lower on 29 of the 43 neuropsychological variables measured (67 percent). Therefore, this specific battery was useful in discriminating subjects with AD from their healthy relatives who are carriers of the disease. The AD group as a whole presented slight dementia with predominant deficits in memory, language, praxis, and attention. This profile is similar to those reported in subjects with sporadic AD in its early stage and confirms the findings found in other neuropsychological studies of subjects with FAD linked to mutations in chromosome 14.

21880831	20110902	Monocyte/macrophage chemokine receptor CCR2 mediates diabetic renal injury.	Monocyte/macrophage recruitment correlates strongly with the progression of renal impairment in diabetic nephropathy (DN). C-C chemokine receptor (CCR)2 regulates monocyte/macrophage migration into injured tissues. However, the direct role of CCR2-mediated monocyte/macrophage recruitment in diabetic kidney disease remains unclear. We report that pharmacological blockade or genetic deficiency of CCR2 confers kidney protection in Ins2(Akita) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic kidney disease. Blocking CCR2 using the selective CCR2 antagonist RS504393 for 12 wk in Ins2(Akita) mice significantly attenuated albuminuria, the increase in blood urea nitrogen and plasma creatinine, histological changes, and glomerular macrophage recruitment compared with vehicle. Furthermore, mice lacking CCR2 (CCR2(-/-)) mimicked CCR2 blockade by reducing albuminuria and displaying less fibronectin mRNA expression and inflammatory cytokine production compared with CCR2(+/+) mice, despite comparable blood glucose levels. Bone marrow-derived monocytes from CCR2(+/+) or CCR2(-/-) mice adoptively transferred into CCR2(-/-) mice reversed the renal tissue-protective effect in diabetic CCR2(-/-) mice as evaluated by increased urinary albumin excretion and kidney macrophage recruitment, indicating that CCR2 is not required for monocyte migration from the circulation into diabetic kidneys.

22074130	20111115	An antisense transcript in the human cytomegalovirus UL87 gene region.	Rapid advances in research on antisense transcripts are gradually changing our comprehension of genomic and gene expression aspects of the Herpesviridae. One such herpesvirus is the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Although transcription of the HCMV UL87 gene has not been specifically investigated, cDNA clones of UL87 antisense transcripts were found in HCMV cDNA libraries previously. In this study, the transcription of the UL87 antisense strand was investigated in three clinically isolated HCMV strains. First, an 800 nucleotides transcript having an antisense orientation to the UL87 gene was found in a late HCMV cDNA library. Then, the UL87 antisense transcript was confirmed by Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and Northern blot in three HCMV clinical strains. Two ORFs were predicted in the antisense transcript. The putative protein of ORF 1 showed a high degree of conservation among HCMV and other CMV strains. An 800nt antisense transcript in the UL87 gene region exists in HCMV clinical strains. 	Virol._J.

18070359	20071212	An epigenetic vaccine model active in the prevention and treatment of melanoma.	Numerous immune genes are epigenetically silenced in tumor cells and agents such as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), which reverse these effects, could potentially be used to develop therapeutic vaccines. The conversion of cancer cells to antigen presenting cells (APCs) by HDACi treatment could potentially provide an additional pathway, together with cross-presentation of tumor antigens by host APCs, to establish tumor immunity. HDACi-treated B16 melanoma cells were used in a murine vaccine model, lymphocyte subset depletion, ELISpot and Cytotoxicity assays were employed to evaluate immunity. Antigen presentation assays, vaccination with isolated apoptotic preparations and tumorigenesis in MHC-deficient mice and radiation chimeras were performed to elucidate the mechanisms of vaccine-induced immunity. HDACi treatment enhanced the expression of MHC class II, CD40 and B7-1/2 on B16 cells and vaccination with HDACi-treated melanoma cells elicited tumor specific immunity in both prevention and treatment models. Cytotoxic and IFN-gamma-producing cells were identified in splenocytes and CD4+, CD8+ T cells and NK cells were all involved in the induction of immunity. Apoptotic cells derived from HDACi treatments, but not H2O2, significantly enhanced the effectiveness of the vaccine. HDACi-treated B16 cells become APCs in vitro and studies in chimeras defective in cross presentation demonstrate direct presentation in vivo and short-term but not memory responses and long-term immunity. The efficacy of this vaccine derives mainly from cross-presentation which is enhanced by HDACi-induced apoptosis. Additionally, epigenetic activation of immune genes may contribute to direct antigen presentation by tumor cells. Epigenetically altered cancer cells should be further explored as a vaccine strategy. 	J_Transl_Med	D016428 D052061
26543397	20151107	On the concept of sloped motion for free-floating wave energy converters.	A free-floating wave energy converter (WEC) concept whose power take-off (PTO) system reacts against water inertia is investigated herein. The main focus is the impact of inclining the PTO direction on the system performance. The study is based on a numerical model whose formulation is first derived in detail. Hydrodynamics coefficients are obtained using the linear boundary element method package WAMIT. Verification of the model is provided prior to its use for a PTO parametric study and a multi-objective optimization based on a multi-linear regression method. It is found that inclining the direction of the PTO at around 50? to the vertical is highly beneficial for the WEC performance in that it provides a high capture width ratio over a broad region of the wave period range.

18670133	20080802	Cloning and characterization of a tau glutathione S-transferase subunit encoding gene in Gossypium hirsutum.	A predicted tau Glutathione S-transferase (GST) subunit encoding gene, named GhGST, was isolated from Gossypium hirsutum with RACE method from SSH library based on Verticillium dahliae stress. The data revealed an open reading frame of 678 bp encoding a protein of 225 amino acids with a molecular weight of 25.821 kDa. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA of GhGST was expressed in root, stem and leaf. And the content of GhGST expression increased under Verticillium dahliae stress in root. The expression of GhGST gene was verified by transformation in E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain with the recombinant expression vector pET-32A. GST activity assay showed the crude GhGST protein had obvious activity to 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) substrate. 	Genes_Genet._Syst.	D016428 D013485
11748652	20011219	In vivo HIV-1 compartmentalisation: drug resistance-associated mutation distribution.	Four patients who had received highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and had postmortem samples stored, were tested for genotypic resistance using consensus sequencing. One patient was further investigated using single-copy sequencing. Patients 1, 3, and 4 showed a relatively uniform distribution of resistance-associated mutations, with only a small number (one to three) of protease mutations detectable. Patient 2 had a number of detectable mutations (four to eight, depending on the tissue) with similar distributions between the tissues. The exception was viruses detected in the esophagus, which were more diverse. Plasma was a moderately representative tissue of the viruses circulating in these individuals. However, some mutations detectable in some tissues were not seen in plasma (e.g., M46I and D30N in the protease). Single-copy sequencing revealed a wide distribution of quasi-species and a number of defective viruses in the proviral DNA and RNA. This study supports the concept that a wide variety of quasi-species circulate in each individual and that there may be viruses evolving independently in different body compartments. 	J._Med._Virol.

9174346	19970527	Recognition of the T stem-loop of a pre-tRNA substrate by the ribozyme from Bacillus subtilis ribonuclease P.	The ribozyme from bacterial ribonuclease P (denoted P RNA) specifically recognizes the coaxially stacked T stem-loop and the acceptor stem of a tRNA substrate. This recognition is mediated primarily through tertiary interactions. At least four 2'-OH groups in the T stem-loop region have been implicated as direct contacts with Bacillus subtilis P RNA [Pan, T., et al. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 92, 12510]. Effects of six single 2'-OH --&gt; 2'-H substitutions and two base mutants of the G19-C56 tertiary interaction in tRNA on substrate binding (Kd) and the chemical step of the reaction (k2) have been determined using a tRNA(Phe) substrate containing a 2'-deoxy residue at the cleavage site. Our results show that at least five functional groups in the T stem-loop of tRNA directly participate in P RNA binding. They include the 2'-OH groups of residues 54, 56, 61, and 62 and possibly the 4-amino group of the conserved C56. The 2'-OHs of residues 54, 61, and 62 are positioned within the same minor groove due to stacking of the reverse Hoogsteen U54-A58 pair on the G53-C61 Watson-Crick pair in the T stem. This groove is extended to the 4-amino group of C56 through the tertiary structure of tRNA. We use the term &quot;tertiary groove&quot; to describe alignment of functional groups through tertiary folding of an RNA. The binding also includes the 2'-OH of nucleotide C56 which is not located in this tertiary groove. Assuming additivity, these five interactions can contribute 7.4 kcal/mol or 10(5)-fold in binding but only -0.5 kcal/mol or approximately 2-fold in chemistry at 37 degrees C. The P RNA binding site for the T stem-loop includes at least the previously identified A230 as well as the A130 in B. subtilis P RNA. The Kd and k2 data from the A130G mutant of B. subtilis P RNA suggest that A130 may be proximal to residue 56 in tRNA. These results show how the highly structured T stem-loop region in a pre-tRNA substrate is bound by the B. subtilis P RNA. This is among the first examples of how a nonhelical RNA structure can be recognized by another RNA through tertiary interactions. 	Biochemistry	D016428 D013485 D013487
22690372	20120613	Type-I prenyl protease function is required in the male germline of Drosophila melanogaster.	Many proteins require the addition of a hydrophobic prenyl anchor (prenylation) for proper trafficking and localization in the cell. Prenyl proteases play critical roles in modifying proteins for membrane anchorage. The type I prenyl protease has a defined function in yeast (Ste24p/Afc1p) where it modifies a mating pheromone, and in humans (Zmpste24) where it has been implicated in a disease of premature aging. Despite these apparently very different biological processes, the type I prenyl protease gene is highly conserved, encoded by a single gene in a wide range of animal and plant groups. A notable exception is Drosophila melanogaster, where the gene encoding the type I prenyl protease has undergone an unprecedented series of duplications in the genome, resulting in five distinct paralogs, three of which are organized in a tandem array, and demonstrate high conservation, particularly in the vicinity of the active site of the enzyme. We have undertaken targeted deletion to remove the three tandem paralogs from the genome. The result is a male fertility defect, manifesting late in spermatogenesis. Our results also show that the ancestral type I prenyl protease gene in Drosophila is under strong purifying selection, while the more recent replicates are evolving rapidly. Our rescue data support a role for the rapidly evolving tandem paralogs in the male germline. We propose that potential targets for the male-specific type I prenyl proteases include proteins involved in the very dramatic cytoskeletal remodeling events required for spermatid maturation.

24143172	20131022	Recombinant AAV-mediated BEST1 transfer to the retinal pigment epithelium: analysis of serotype-dependent retinal effects.	Mutations in the BEST1 gene constitute an underlying cause of juvenile macular dystrophies, a group of retinal disorders commonly referred to as bestrophinopathies and usually diagnosed in early childhood or adolescence. The disease primarily affects macular and paramacular regions of the eye leading to major declines in central vision later in life. Currently, there is no cure or surgical management for BEST1-associated disorders. The recently characterized human disease counterpart, canine multifocal retinopathy (cmr), recapitulates a full spectrum of clinical and molecular features observed in human bestrophinopathies and offers a valuable model system for development and testing of therapeutic strategies. In this study, the specificity, efficiency and safety of rAAV-mediated transgene expression driven by the human VMD2 promoter were assessed in wild-type canine retinae. While the subretinal delivery of rAAV2/1 vector serotype was associated with cone damage in the retina when BEST1 and GFP were co-expressed, the rAAV2/2 vector serotype carrying either GFP reporter or BEST1 transgene under control of human VMD2 promoter was safe, and enabled specific transduction of the RPE cell monolayer that was stable for up to 6 months post injection. These encouraging studies with the rAAV2/2 vector lay the groundwork for development of gene augmentation therapy for human bestrophinopathies. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061 D013485
12740451	20030513	Sequence variants of the POMC gene and their associations with body composition in children.	We investigated POMC sequence variants in 242 overweight and nonoverweight African-American and white children and examined the associations between body composition and POMC polymorphisms. Three novel polymorphisms and two previously identified sequence variants were found: A7301G, A7429G, and C8246T were all in untranslated regions. A 9-bp (AGC AGC GGC) duplication/insertion was found between positions 7677 and 7678, and one normal-weight African-American girl had a 45-bp triple duplication/insertion at this location. Compared with whites, African-American children were significantly more likely to have polymorphisms A7301G, A7429G, and the 9-bp insertion. However, there were no significant associations between any of the polymorphisms and body composition. Five African-American subjects who were homozygous for A7429G had a trend (p = 0.08) for a greater BMI-SD score (5.3 +/- 5.3 kg/m(2)) compared with wild-type children (BMI-SD score, 2.4 +/- 3.2 kg/m(2)) or heterozygotes (BMI-SD score, 2.7 +/- 3.7 kg/m(2)). However, there were no differences in BMI-SD score for A7429G when African American subjects were studied separately and both gender and height were taken into account. The contribution of the POMC gene variants we studied to pediatric-onset obesity seems to be limited. 	Obes._Res.	D016428 D013487
1761521	19910801	Identification of a cross-linked peptide of a covalent complex between adrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin.	A cross-linked complex between bovine NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase (AR) and adrenodoxin (AD) was prepared with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and purified, as described previously [Hara, T. &amp; Kimura, T. (1989) J. Biochem. 105, 594-600]. The covalent complex was S-pyridylethylated and digested with lysylendopeptidase, and the resulting peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC to identify the cross-linked peptide. Comparison of the HPLC chromatograms of the peptides showed that (i) two tandem peptides (K-4 and K-5) from AD and a peptide (K-1) from AR were missing in the chromatogram of the peptides of the covalent complex and (ii) a single new peak was observed in the chromatogram of the peptides from the covalent complex. Amino acid composition and sequence analyses showed that the newly observed peptide was a covalently cross-linked peptide formed between a peptide K-4-K-5 (Ile-25-Lys-98) derived from AD and a peptide K-1 (Ser-1-Lys-27) derived from AR, in which an amide bond had been formed between the epsilon-amino group of Lys-66 in AD and the gamma-carboxyl group of Glu-4 in AR. These results indicate that the binding site of AR with AD is localized in the amino-terminal part of AR and that of AD with AR is localized around Lys-66 of AD. The six clustered basic amino acid residues (His-24, Lys-27, His-28, His-29, Arg-31, and His-33) present in the amino-terminal portion of AR and the eight clustered acidic amino acid residues (Glu-65, Glu-68, Asp-72, Glu-73, Glu-74, Asp-76, Asp-79, and Asp-86) present in the middle part of AD may play an important role in the complex formation.

22019847	20111025	Base excision repair pathway genes polymorphism in prostate and bladder cancer risk in North Indian population.	Carcinogens causes DNA damage, including oxidative lesions that are removed efficiently by the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Variations in BER genes may reduce DNA repair capacity, leading to development of urological cancers. This study included 195 prostate cancer (PCa) and 212 bladder cancer (BC) patients and 250 controls who had been frequency matched by age, sex, and ethnicity. We genotyped XRCC1 Exon 6 (C&gt;T), 9 (G&gt;A), 10 (G&gt;A), OGG1 Exon 7 (C&gt;G) and APE1 Exon 5 (T&gt;G) genes polymorphism using PCR-RFLP and ARMS. GA of XRCC1 Exon 9 demonstrated increased risk with PCa as well as in BC (p=0.001; p=0.006). Similarly variant containing genotype revealed association with PCa (p=0.031). Haplotype of XRCC1 also associated with significant risk for PCa and BC. The APE1 GG genotype showed a decreased risk of BC (OR=0.25; p=0.017). Variant genotype GG of OGG1 demonstrated significant risk with BC (p=0.028). Our observations suggested increased risk for PCa and BC in case of GA genotype for XRCC1, and variant GG in case of OGG1. However APE1 GG genotype conferred a protective association with BC susceptibility. Larger studies and the more SNPs in the same pathway are needed to verify these findings. 	Mech._Ageing_Dev.

26813412	20160128	Meta-analysis of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism in major depressive disorder: the role of gender.	Many studies have reported an association of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism and major depressive disorder (MDD), although with conflicting results. The role of gender is a possible modulator. To overcome the problem of poor sample size detecting genes of small effect, we perform a meta-analysis of the current literature, investigating the influence of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism on the pathogenesis of MDD, with a major focus on the effect of gender. Out of 977 retrieved articles, 21 included case-control studies allowed the analysis of 9005 patients with MDD and 12,095 controls. Allelic and genotypic pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated for the total sample and gender-subgroups. In the absence of publication bias, allelic and genotypic analyses showed no significant association in the total sample, as well as in gender-specific subgroups. Sensitivity analysis did not alter the ORs. The results imply a complex nature of the genotype ? phenotype interaction. Further studies of the COMT gene or the locus remain to be justified given the important positional and functional relevance and the plethora of gender-specific findings. A possible way to further dissect this topic is shifting the focus to gene-based or genome-wide analyses of intermediate phenotypes. 	World_J._Biol._Psychiatry	D016428 D017418
16086285	20050809	[Marker chromosome analysis in Chinese patients with Turner syndrome by fluorescence in situ hybridization].	To identify the origin of marker chromosome of patients with Turner syndrome, and to provide the information for genetic counseling and treatment. The karyotypes of 32 patients with Turner syndrome from 2001 to 2003 at the Center for Diagnosis of Genetic Metabolic Diseases were reviewed. Metaphase chromosome analyses of peripheral blood lymphocytes, G-band and C-band were performed using standard methods. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed to identify the origin of marker chromosome by using two probes: sex-determining region Y (SRY) for band region Yp11.3 and chromosome enumeration probe for X(CEPX) for band region Xp11.1-q11.1. 3/32(9.4%) patients with Turner syndrome had marker chromosome, the karyotype being 45,X/46,X,mar. Among the 3 marker chromosomes, 2 originated from chromosome X or Y, as identified by the FISH. The origin of the third marker chromosome could not be identified by CEPX and SRY probes. The presence of a marker chromosome in Turner syndrome generally implicates a sex chromosome origin. It may also originate from a non-sex chromosome. Therefore, it is necessary to apply X and Y probes simultaneously for marker chromosome detection in Turner patients with monosomy X. 	Zhonghua_Yi_Xue_Yi_Chuan_Xue_Za_Zhi	D004740 D016428 D013485
26839579	20160204	A modular toolbox for gRNA-Cas9 genome engineering in plants based on the GoldenBraid standard.	The efficiency, versatility and multiplexing capacity of RNA-guided genome engineering using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology enables a variety of applications in plants, ranging from gene editing to the construction of transcriptional gene circuits, many of which depend on the technical ability to compose and transfer complex synthetic instructions into the plant cell. The engineering principles of standardization and modularity applied to DNA cloning are impacting plant genetic engineering, by increasing multigene assembly efficiency and by fostering the exchange of well-defined physical DNA parts with precise functional information. Here we describe the adaptation of the RNA-guided Cas9 system to GoldenBraid (GB), a modular DNA construction framework being increasingly used in Plant Synthetic Biology. In this work, the genetic elements required for CRISPRs-based editing and transcriptional regulation were adapted to GB, and a workflow for gRNAs construction was designed and optimized. New software tools specific for CRISPRs assembly were created and incorporated to the public GB resources site. The functionality and the efficiency of gRNA-Cas9?GB tools were demonstrated in Nicotiana benthamiana using transient expression assays both for gene targeted mutations and for transcriptional regulation. The availability of gRNA-Cas9?GB toolbox will facilitate the application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to plant genome engineering. 	Plant_Methods	D016428
25253915	20140926	Pollution of Flooded Arable Soils with Heavy Metals and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs).	Soils that are exposed to floodwaters because of shallow groundwater and periodical wetlands are, to a large extent, exposed to contamination by organic and inorganic compounds. These are mainly compounds that have drifted along with the inflow of heavily laden floodwater and are produced within the soil profile by the anaerobic transformation of organic matter. Heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds are absorbed by the soil of the floodwaters, and moving in the soil profile, they pose a threat to groundwater. What is more, after a flood, they may be absorbed by the crops. This paper focuses on the effects of Odra River (Poland) floods, heavy metals, and PAHs on soil and the possibilities of the migration of these pollutants into the soil profile. In the tested sludge samples of floodwater and soil, there were no abnormal concentrations of heavy metals, but the flooding time positively affected the amount listed in the test samples. Concentrations of PAHs increased, but they also exceeded the standards for arable soils in the case of single compounds. 	Water_Air_Soil_Pollut	D016428
22689067	20120613	A 2D ??C-CEST experiment for studying slowly exchanging protein systems using methyl probes: an application to protein folding.	A 2D (13)C Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) experiment is presented for studying slowly exchanging protein systems using methyl groups as probes. The utility of the method is first established through studies of protein L, a small protein, for which chemical exchange on the millisecond time-scale is not observed. Subsequently the approach is applied to a folding exchange reaction of a G48M mutant Fyn SH3 domain, for which only cross-peaks derived from the folded ('ground') state are present in spectra. Fits of (15)N and methyl (13)C CEST profiles of the Fyn SH3 domain establish that the exchange reaction involves an interchange between folded and unfolded conformers, although elevated methyl (13)C transverse relaxation rates for some of the residues of the unfolded ('invisible, excited') state indicate that it likely exchanges with a third conformation as well. In addition to the kinetics of the exchange reaction, methyl carbon chemical shifts of the excited state are also obtained from analysis of the (13)C CEST data. 	J._Biomol._NMR	D016428 D013485
9792925	19981030	Functions of the N-glycans of rat leukemia inhibitory factor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells.	Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a pluripotent growth factor which acts in various cell systems. LIF is a glycoprotein containing six putative N-glycosylation sites. We established Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines to evaluate the biological roles of the N-glycosylation in rat LIF (rLIF). The bioactivity of rLIF was evaluated in two different bioassay systems using F9 and DA-1a cells. Employing site directed mutagenesis, six N-glycosylation-deficient LIF mutants were generated by replacing each asparagine residue (N) (at positions N9, N34, N63, N73, N96, and N116) by glutamine (Q). The resultant mutants showed similar activity in the bioassay using F9 cells. However, N34Q was about 3 times more potent than the wild-type rLIF in the assay using DA-1a cells. These findings suggest that the presence of N-glycan at N34 suppresses cell proliferation. In contrast, N63Q was about 2.5 times less potent than the wild-type rLIF indicating the pivotal role of N63 glycosylation for rLIF bioactivity. Taken together, our data suggest that the N-glycans of LIF play different roles depending on the cell line and that glycosylation of each specific residue contributes differently to its bioactivity.

25859246	20150411	Oxidative stress and starvation in Dinoroseobacter shibae: the role of extrachromosomal elements.	Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (AAP) are abundant in the photic zone of the marine environment. Dinoroseobacter shibae, a representative of the Roseobacter group, converts light into additional energy that enhances its survival especially under starvation. However, light exposure results in the production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species in AAPs. Here we investigated the response of D. shibae to starvation and oxidative stress, focusing on the role of extrachromosomal elements (ECRs). D. shibae possessing five ECRs (three plasmids and two chromids) was starved for 4 weeks either in the dark or under light/dark cycles and the survival was monitored. Transcriptomics showed that on the chromosome genes with a role in oxidative stress response and photosynthesis were differentially expressed during the light period. Most extrachromosomal genes in contrast showed a general loss of transcriptional activity, especially in dark-starved cells. The observed decrease of gene expression was not due to plasmid loss, as all five ECRs were maintained in the cells. Interestingly, the genes on the 72-kb chromid were the least downregulated, and one region with genes of the oxygen stress response and a light-dependent protochlorophyllide reductase of cyanobacterial origin was strongly activated under the light/dark cycle. A ?72-kb curing mutant lost the ability to survive under starvation in a light/dark cycle demonstrating the essential role of this chromid for adaptation to starvation and oxidative stress. Our data moreover suggest that the other four ECRs of D. shibae have no vital function under the investigated conditions and therefore were transcriptionally silenced. 	Front_Microbiol	D016428
27215094	20160525	Lactase Non-Persistence Genotyping: Comparison of Two Real-Time PCR Assays and Assessment of Concomitant Fructose/Sorbitol Malabsorption Rates.	Genetic testing is a standard technique for the diagnosis of primary adult-type hypolactasia, also referred to as lactase non-persistence. The aim of this study was to compare the lactase gene (LCT) C/T-13910 polymorphism genotyping results of two commercially available real-time (RT)-PCR assays in patients referred to our outpatient clinic for primary lactose malabsorption testing. Furthermore, concomitant conditions of fructose/sorbitol malabsorption were assessed. Samples obtained from 100 patients were tested in parallel using the LCT T-13910C ToolSet for Light Cycler (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) and the LCT-13910C&gt;T RealFast Assay (ViennaLab Diagnostics GmbH, Vienna, Austria). Additionally, patients were also screened for the presence of fructose/sorbitol malabsorption by functional hydrogen (H2)/methane (CH4) breath testing (HMBT). Cohen's Kappa (?) was used to calculate the agreement between the two genotyping methods. The exact Chi-Square test was performed to compare fructose/sorbitol HMBT with LCT genotyping results. Twenty-one (21.0%) patients had a LCT C/C-13910 genotype suggestive of lactase non-persistence, and 79 (79.0%) patients were identified with either a LCT T/C-13910 or T/T-13910 genotype (i.e., lactase persistence). In all genotype groups, concordance between the two RT-PCR assays was 100%. Cohen's ? demonstrated perfect observed agreement (p &lt; 0.001, ? = 1). Fructose and sorbitol malabsorption was observed in 13/100 (13.0%) and 25/100 (25.0%) individuals, respectively. Both RT-PCR assays are robust and reliable LCT genotyping tools in a routine clinical setting. Concomitant fructose and/or sorbitol malabsorption should be considered in individuals with suspected lactase-non-persistence. However, standardization of clinical interpretation of laboratory HMBT results is required. 	Clin._Lab.	D016428
2980779	19880901	Protein design using model synthetic peptides.	We have designed and synthesized a small, unique protein molecule with defined secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure. This 35-residue peptide, containing a cysteine residue at its N-terminal end, was oxidized to form a 70-residue disulfide-linked two-stranded alpha-helical coiled-coil with the two alpha-helices parallel and in-register. The major contribution to the formation and stabilization of the alpha-helical coiled-coil is hydrophobic interactions between positions 2 and 5 of the heptapeptide repeat (Lys-Leu-Glu-Ala-Leu-Glu-Gly). The protein (L-protein) contains nine leucine-leucine hydrophobic interactions between the alpha-helices of the coiled-coil. Circular dichroism studies demonstrated that this protein in its reduced ([L (r)] or oxidized (L (o)] state was essentially 100% alpha-helical ([theta]220 = -34,050 and -32,000 degrees respectively) at pH 2 (0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid). Our objective was to modify systematically the structure of L to delineate the contribution that various amino acid side chains make to the formation and stabilization of its three-dimensional structure. A-protein, which contains alanine instead of leucine at positions 16 and 19 of the hydrophobic repeat in each chain of the coiled-coil, was compared to the L-protein. At pH 2, the oxidized form of the A-protein [A (o)] was essentially 100% helical. However, the protein was much less stable to temperature denaturation compared to the L-protein. The replacement of two leucine-leucine interactions by two alanine-alanine interactions has a dramatic effect on the formation and stability of the two-stranded alpha-helical coiled-coil structure. The results of this study clearly demonstrate the validity of this synthetic model protein approach to understanding the molecular aspects responsible for the folding and stabilization of protein molecules.

22174034	20111217	Phosphorylation as a tool to modulate aggregation propensity and to predict fibril architecture.	Despite the importance of post-translational modifications in controlling the solubility and conformational properties of proteins and peptides, precisely how the aggregation propensity of different peptide sequences is modulated by chemical modification remains unclear. Here we have investigated the effect of phosphorylation on the aggregation propensity of a 13-residue synthetic peptide incorporating one or more phosphate groups at seven different sites at various pH values. Fibril formation was shown to be inhibited when a single phosphate group was introduced at all seven locations in the peptide sequence at pH 7.5, when the phosphate group is fully charged. By contrast, when the same peptides were analysed at pH 1.1, when the phosphate is fully protonated, fibrils from all seven peptide sequences form rapidly. At intermediate pH values (pH 3.6) when the phosphate group is mono-anionic, the aggregation propensity of the peptides was found to be highly dependent on the position of the phosphate group in the peptide sequence. Using this information, combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the peptide sequence, we provide evidence consistent with the peptide forming amyloid fibrils with a class 7 architecture. The results highlight the potential utility of phosphorylation as a method of reversibly controlling the aggregation kinetics of peptide sequences both during and after synthesis. Moreover, by exploiting the ability of the phosphate group to adopt different charge states as a function of pH, and combining experimental insights with atomistic information calculated from MD simulations as pH is varied, we show how the resulting information can be used to predict fibril structures consistent with both datasets, and use these to rationalise their sensitivity of fibrillation kinetics both to the location of the phosphate group and its charge state.

22222055	20120107	Distinct recycling of active and inactive ?1 integrins.	Integrin trafficking plays an important role in cellular motility and cytokinesis. Integrins undergo constant endo/exocytic shuttling to facilitate the dynamic regulation of cell adhesion. Integrin activity toward the components of the extracellular matrix is regulated by the ability of these receptors to switch between active and inactive conformations. Several cellular signalling pathways have been described in the regulation of integrin traffic under different conditions. However, the interrelationship between integrin activity conformations and their endocytic fate have remained incompletely understood. Here, we have investigated the endocytic trafficking of active and inactive ?1 integrins in cancer cells. Both conformers are endocytosed in a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent manner. The net endocytosis rate of the active ?1 integrins is higher, whereas endocytosis of the inactive ?1 integrin is counteracted by rapid recycling back to the plasma membrane via an ARF6- and early endosome antigen 1-positive compartment in an Rab4a- and actin-dependent manner. Owing to these distinct trafficking routes, the two receptor pools display divergent subcellular localization. At steady state, the inactive ?1 integrin is mainly on the plasma membrane, whereas the active receptor is predominantly intracellular. These data provide new insights into the endocytic traffic of integrins and imply the possibility of a previously unappreciated crosstalk between pathways regulating integrin activity and traffic.

27487915	20160805	Evolution of a G protein-coupled receptor response by mutations in regulatory network interactions.	All cellular functions depend on the concerted action of multiple proteins organized in complex networks. To understand how selection acts on protein networks, we used the yeast mating receptor Ste2, a pheromone-activated G protein-coupled receptor, as a model system. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ste2 is a hub in a network of interactions controlling both signal transduction and signal suppression. Through laboratory evolution, we obtained 21 mutant receptors sensitive to the pheromone of a related yeast species and investigated the molecular mechanisms behind this newfound sensitivity. While some mutants show enhanced binding affinity to the foreign pheromone, others only display weakened interactions with the network's negative regulators. Importantly, the latter changes have a limited impact on overall pathway regulation, despite their considerable effect on sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that a new receptor-ligand pair can evolve through network-altering mutations independently of receptor-ligand binding, and suggest a potential role for such mutations in disease.

21396369	20110315	A Klotho? variant mediates protein stability and associates with colon transit in irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea.	Bile acid (BA) malabsorption of moderate severity is reported in 32% of patients with chronic unexplained diarrhea, including diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). We hypothesized that variants of genes regulating hepatic BA synthesis play a role in IBS-D. In 435 IBS and 279 healthy subjects, we tested individual associations of 15 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 7 genes critical to BA homeostasis with symptom-based subgroups using dominant genetic models. In a subset of 238 participants, we tested association with colonic transit. SNP-SNP interactions were investigated based on known protein interactions in BA homeostasis. The function of SNP rs17618244 in Klotho? (KLB) was evaluated using a protein stability assay in HEK293 cells. SNP rs17618244 (Arg728Gln in KLB) is associated with colonic transit at 24 hours. G allele (Arg728) compared with A allele (Gln728) is associated with accelerated colonic transit (P=.0007) in the overall cohort; this association was restricted to IBS-D (P=.0018). Interaction tests of KLB rs17618244 with 3 nonsynonymous SNPs of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) revealed that rs1966265 (Val10Ile) and rs351855 (Gly388Arg) modulate rs1768244's association with colonic transit in IBS-D (P=.0025 and P=.0023, respectively). KLB Arg728 significantly reduced protein stability compared with KLB Gln728, demonstrating KLB rs17618244's functional significance. No significant associations with symptom-based subgroups of IBS were detected. A functional KLB gene variant mediating protein stability associates with colonic transit in IBS-D. This association is modulated by 2 genetic variants in FGFR4. The FGF19-FGFR4-KLB pathway links regulation of BA synthesis to colonic transit in IBS-D. 	Gastroenterology	D016428 D052061
11391716	20010608	A common mutation in the gene for coagulation factor XIII-A (VAL34Leu): a risk factor for primary intracerebral hemorrhage is protective against atherothrombotic diseases.	The role of a common polymorphism in the factor XIII A-subunit gene (FXIII Val34Leu) has been recently investigated as a protective genetic factor against arterial and venous thrombosis. In addition, the less frequent Leu34 allele has been described as a risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage. We evaluated the prevalence of this polymorphism by PCR in three case-control studies of patients diagnosed as having primary intracerebral hemorrhage (PCH, n = 130), coronary heart diseases (CHD, n = 240; myocardial infarction/no myocardial infarction, 120/120), and cerebrovascular diseases (CVD, n = 240; cerebral infarction/transient ischaemic attack, 120/120). The matched control groups consisted of patients admitted to the hospital without history of vascular disease. In addition, 200 healthy subjects were investigated. The frequency of the mutated allele (Leu34) was higher in patients with PCH than in controls (33.8% vs. 23.1%, P = 0.009) and lower in CHD and CVD patients compared to controls (18.1% vs. 25.2%, P = 0.010 and 17.3% vs. 24.2%, P = 0.011, respectively). Moreover, among the patients with CHD, the Leu34 allele was underrepresented in cases with myocardial infarction than without (12.9% vs. 23.3%, P = 0.004) and than in controls (12.9% vs. 25.2%, P &lt; 0.001). Similar findings were obtained in patients with CVD comparing the cases with cerebral infarction versus cases with transient ischaemic attack (12.5% vs. 22.1%, P = 0.008) and versus controls (12.5% vs. 24.2%, P &lt; 0.001). Finally, considering altogether the groups of ischaemic patients (CHD and CVD, n = 480), it was noted a trend towards a higher mean age of the clinical onset in homozygotes for the Leu allele than in the wild types (P = 0.078). This study indicates that in our population possession of the FXIII Val34Leu mutation predisposes to the occurrence of primary intracerebral hemorrhage and protects against cerebral and myocardial infarction. A wider modulatory role in the progression and onset of atherothrombotic diseases could be ascribed to FXIII Val34Leu. 	Am._J._Hematol.	D003160 D016428 D013485
23427157	20130222	Formation of covalently modified folding intermediates of simian virus 40 Vp1 in large T antigen-expressing cells.	The folding and pentamer assembly of the simian virus 40 (SV40) major capsid protein Vp1, which take place in the infected cytoplasm, have been shown to progress through disulfide-bonded Vp1 folding intermediates. In this report, we further demonstrate the existence of another category of Vp1 folding or assembly intermediates: the nonreducible, covalently modified mdVp1s. These species were present in COS-7 cells that expressed a recombinant SV40 Vp1, Vp1?C, through plasmid transfection. The mdVp1s persisted under cell and lysate treatment and SDS-PAGE conditions that are expected to have suppressed the formation of artifactual disulfide cross-links. As shown through a pulse-chase analysis, the mdVp1s were derived from the newly synthesized Vp1?C in the same time frame as Vp1's folding and oligomerization. The apparent covalent modifications occurred in the cytoplasm within the core region of Vp1 and depended on the coexpression of the SV40 large T antigen (LT) in the cells. Analogous covalently modified species were found with the expression of recombinant polyomavirus Vp1s and human papillomavirus L1s in COS-7 cells. Furthermore, the mdVp1s formed multiprotein complexes with LT, Hsp70, and Hsp40, and a fraction of the largest mdVp1, md4, was disulfide linked to the unmodified Vp1?C. Both mdVp1 formation and most of the multiprotein complex formation were blocked by a Vp1 folding mutation, C87A-C254A. Our observations are consistent with a role for LT in facilitating the folding process of SV40 Vp1 by stimulating certain covalent modifications of Vp1 or by recruiting certain cellular proteins.

25260852	20140928	Hypomorphic NOTCH3 mutation in an Italian family with CADASIL features.	The cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is because of NOTCH3 mutations affecting the number of cysteine residues. In this view, the role of atypical NOTCH3 mutations is still debated. Therefore, we investigated a family carrying a NOTCH3 nonsense mutation, with dominantly inherited recurrent cerebrovascular disorders. Among 7 family members, 4 received a clinical diagnosis of CADASIL. A heterozygous truncating mutation in exon 3 (c.307C&gt;T, p.Arg103X) was found in the 4 clinically affected subjects and in one 27-year old lady, only complaining of migraine with aura. Magnetic resonance imaging scans found typical signs of small-vessel disease in the 4 affected subjects, supporting the clinical diagnosis. Skin biopsies did not show the typical granular osmiophilic material, but only nonspecific signs of vascular damage, resembling those previously described in Notch3 knockout mice. Interestingly, messenger RNA (mRNA) analysis supports the hypothesis of an atypical NOTCH3 mutation, suggesting a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. In conclusion, the present study broadens the spectrum of CADASIL mutations, and, therefore, opens new insights about Notch3 signaling. 	Neurobiol._Aging	D016428
21712187	20110630	Inter-chromosomal variation in the pattern of human population genetic structure.	Emerging technologies now make it possible to genotype hundreds of thousands of genetic variations in individuals, across the genome. The study of loci at finer scales will facilitate the understanding of genetic variation at genomic and geographic levels. We examined global and chromosomal variations across HapMap populations using 3.7 million single nucleotide polymorphisms to search for the most stratified genomic regions of human populations and linked these regions to ontological annotation and functional network analysis. To achieve this, we used five complementary statistical and genetic network procedures: principal component (PC), cluster, discriminant, fixation index (FST) and network/pathway analyses. At the global level, the first two PC scores were sufficient to account for major population structure; however, chromosomal level analysis detected subtle forms of population structure within continental populations, and as many as 31 PCs were required to classify individuals into homogeneous groups. Using recommended population ancestry differentiation measures, a total of 126 regions of the genome were catalogued. Gene ontology and networks analyses revealed that these regions included the genes encoding oculocutaneous albinism II (OCA2), hect domain and RLD 2 (HERC2), ectodysplasin A receptor (EDAR) and solute carrier family 45, member 2 (SLC45A2). These genes are associated with melanin production, which is involved in the development of skin and hair colour, skin cancer and eye pigmentation. We also identified the genes encoding interferon-? (IFNG) and death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), which are associated with cell death, inflammatory and immunological diseases. An in-depth understanding of these genomic regions may help to explain variations in adaptation to different environments. Our approach offers a comprehensive strategy for analysing chromosome-based population structure and differentiation, and demonstrates the application of complementary statistical and functional network analysis in human genetic variation studies.

26944553	20160306	Assessment of microcrystal quality by transmission electron microscopy for efficient serial femtosecond crystallography.	Serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) employing high-intensity X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) sources has enabled structural studies on microcrystalline protein samples at non-cryogenic temperatures. However, the identification and optimization of conditions that produce well diffracting microcrystals remains an experimental challenge. Here, we report parallel SFX and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments using fragmented microcrystals of wild type (WT) homoprotocatechuate 2,3-dioxygenase (HPCD) and an active site variant (H200Q). Despite identical crystallization conditions and morphology, as well as similar crystal size and density, the indexing efficiency of the diffraction data collected using the H200Q variant sample was over 7-fold higher compared to the diffraction results obtained using the WT sample. TEM analysis revealed an abundance of protein aggregates, crystal conglomerates and a smaller population of highly ordered lattices in the WT sample as compared to the H200Q variant sample. While not reported herein, the 1.75?? resolution structure of the H200Q variant was determined from ?16?min of beam time, demonstrating the utility of TEM analysis in evaluating sample monodispersity and lattice quality, parameters critical to the efficiency of SFX experiments.

27828991	20161110	Loss of MeCP2 Causes Urological Dysfunction and Contributes to Death by Kidney Failure in Mouse Models of Rett Syndrome.	Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by loss of acquired skills during development, autonomic dysfunction, and an increased risk for premature lethality. Clinical experience identified a subset of individuals with RTT that present with urological dysfunction including individuals with frequent urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and urine retention requiring frequent catheterization for bladder voiding. To determine if urologic dysfunction is a feature of RTT, we queried the Rett Syndrome Natural History Study, a repository of clinical data from over 1000 individuals with RTT and found multiple instances of urological dysfunction. We then evaluated urological function in a mouse model of RTT and found an abnormal pattern of micturition. Both male and female mice possessing Mecp2 mutations show a decrease in urine output per micturition event. Furthermore, we identified signs of kidney failure secondary to urethral obstruction. Although genetic strain background significantly affects both survival and penetrance of the urethral obstruction phenotype, survival and penetrance of urethral obstruction do not directly correlate. We have identified an additional phenotype caused by loss of MeCP2, urological dysfunction. Furthermore, we urge caution in the interpretation of survival data as an endpoint in preclinical studies, especially where causes of mortality are poorly characterized. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428
11307814	20010420	Genetic predisposition to bleeding during oral anticoagulant therapy: evidence for common founder mutations (FIXVal-10 and FIXThr-10) and an independent CpG hotspot mutation (FIXThr-10).	The recent discovery of five patients with coumarin sensitive FIX-variants due to a missense mutation in the FIX propeptide, either Ala-10Val or Ala-10Thr, has highlighted a novel type of genetic predisposition to bleeding during oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT). In the present study, we report six additional patients with such FIX variants. Haplotype analysis of FIX polymorphisms revealed a founder effect in the five German and Swiss patients with the Val-10 variant. Also, four Thr-10 variants detected in Germany, Switzerland and Great Britain derived from a common founder. Two Thr-10 variants from USA showed an independent de novo origin at a CpG dinucleotide that in general represents a mutation hotspot. These findings implicate the existence of additional subjects with corresponding variants in the populations of various countries. Even though the rare occurrence of these variants does not justify a general aPTT screening during OAT, it is recommended to monitor each bleeding event during OAT in males in order to exclude a genetic predisposition to bleeding by means of the following testing strategy: a) aPTT-testing in each bleeding complication of male patients during OAT, b) if aPTT is disproportionately prolonged, determination of FIX:C, and c) if FIX:C is disproportionately decreased as compared to FII:C, FVII:C and FX:C, sequencing of exon 2 of the FIX gene. This strategy will provide a cost-effective and safe procedure to identify patients that carry the FIX variants. Moreover, such a strategy accumulates data about the prevalence of these FIX mutations in a given population. 	Thromb._Haemost.	D002363 D016428 D013485
11535547	20010906	A single nucleotide polymorphism in the 5' untranslated region of RAD51 and risk of cancer among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.	RAD51 colocalizes with both BRCA1 and BRCA2, and genetic variants in RAD51 would be candidate BRCA1/2 modifiers. We searched for RAD51 polymorphisms by sequencing 20 individuals. We compared the polymorphism allele frequencies between female BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with and without breast or ovarian cancer and between population-based ovarian cancer cases with BRCA1/2 mutations to cases and controls without mutations. We discovered two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at positions 135 g--&gt;c and 172 g--&gt;t of the 5' untranslated region. In an initial group of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, 14 (21%) of 67 breast cancer cases carried a &quot;c&quot; allele at RAD51:135 g--&gt;c, whereas 8 (7%) of 119 women without breast cancer carried this allele. In a second set of 466 mutation carriers from three centers, the association of RAD51:135 g--&gt;c with breast cancer risk was not confirmed. Analyses restricted to the 216 BRCA2 mutation carriers, however, showed a statistically significant association of the 135 &quot;c&quot; allele with the risk of breast cancer (adjusted odds ratio, 3.2; 95% confidence limit, 1.4-40). BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with ovarian cancer were only about one half as likely to carry the RAD51:135 g--&gt;c SNP. Analysis of the RAD51:135 g--&gt;c SNP in 738 subjects from an Israeli ovarian cancer case-control study was consistent with a lower risk of ovarian cancer among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with the &quot;c&quot; allele. We have identified a RAD51 5' untranslated region SNP that may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and a lower risk of ovarian cancer among BRCA2 mutation carriers. The biochemical basis of this risk modifier is currently unknown. 	Cancer_Epidemiol._Biomarkers_Prev.	D016428 D016448 D013485
24151159	20131024	Rare sequence variants in ANO3 and GNAL in a primary torsion dystonia series and controls.	Rare autosomal-dominant mutations in ANO3 and GNAL have been recently shown to represent novel genetic factors underlying primary torsion dystonia (PTD) with predominantly craniocervical involvement. We used high-resolution melting to screen all exons of ANO3 and GNAL for rare sequence variants in a population of 342 German individuals with mainly sporadic PTD and 376 general population controls. We identified 2 novel missense variants in ANO3 (p.Ile833Val and p.Gly973Arg) and 1 novel missense variant in GNAL (p.Val146Met) in three different nonfamilial cases. Variant carriers presented with adult-onset dystonia involving the neck and/or face. In controls, 3 rare ANO3 missense variants (p.Tyr235Cys, p.Asn256Ser, and p.Pro893Leu) but no rare nonsynonymous GNAL variants were present. GNAL variants seem to be a rare cause of PTD in our mainly sporadic German sample. Low frequency missense variants in ANO3 occur in both cases and controls, warranting further assessment of this gene in PTD pathogenesis. 	Mov._Disord.	D016428 D013485
22848035	20120801	Case report: Noonan syndrome with multiple giant cell lesions and review of the literature.	Noonan syndrome with multiple giant cell lesions (NS/MGCL) was recently shown to be a phenotypic variation within the syndromes of the Ras/MAPK pathway and not an independent entity as previously thought. Here we report on a 13-year-old boy with a typical phenotype of NS including atrial septal defect, pulmonic stenosis, short stature, and combined pectus carinatum/excavatum, pronounced MGCL of both jaws, and a de novo mutation in PTPN11, c.236A&gt;G (which predicts p.Q79R). Mutations in PTPN11 are the most frequent cause of NS and p.Q79R is a recurrent mutation in exon 3. Including this patient, 24 patients with molecularly confirmed NS, LEOPARD, or CFC/MGCL syndrome have been reported to date, of these 21 patients have PTPN11, SOS1, or RAF1 mutations and three have BRAF or MAP2K1 mutations, confirming that MGCL is a rare complication of the deregulated RAS/MAPK pathway. In all patients, the lesions of the mandible and to a lesser extent of the maxilla were first noted between ages 2 and 19 years (median 11 years), and were combined with enlargement of the jaws in 11/24 patients (46%). In this case and, with one exception (mutation not reported), all previous cases the NS/MGCL was caused by known mutations in the PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, BRAF1, and MAP2K1 genes that were previously reported with RASopathies without MGCL.

10211818	19990422	Dissection of the structural and functional role of a conserved hydration site in RNase T1.	The reoccurrence of water molecules in crystal structures of RNase T1 was investigated. Five waters were found to be invariant in RNase T1 as well as in six other related fungal RNases. The structural, dynamical, and functional characteristics of one of these conserved hydration sites (WAT1) were analyzed by protein engineering, X-ray crystallography, and (17)O and 2H nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion (NMRD). The position of WAT1 and its surrounding hydrogen bond network are unaffected by deletions of two neighboring side chains. In the mutant Thr93Gln, the Gln93N epsilon2 nitrogen replaces WAT1 and participates in a similar hydrogen bond network involving Cys6, Asn9, Asp76, and Thr91. The ability of WAT1 to form four hydrogen bonds may explain why evolution has preserved a water molecule, rather than a side-chain atom, at the center of this intricate hydrogen bond network. Comparison of the (17)O NMRD profiles from wild-type and Thr93Gln RNase T1 yield a mean residence time of 7 ns at 27 degrees C and an orientational order parameter of 0.45. The effects of mutations around WAT1 on the kinetic parameters of RNase T1 are small but significant and probably relate to the dynamics of the active site. 	Protein_Sci.	D016428 D013485
20190050	20100302	Kinetic characterization of the WalRKSpn (VicRK) two-component system of Streptococcus pneumoniae: dependence of WalKSpn (VicK) phosphatase activity on its PAS domain.	The WalRK two-component system plays important roles in maintaining cell wall homeostasis and responding to antibiotic stress in low-GC Gram-positive bacteria. In the major human pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae, phosphorylated WalR(Spn) (VicR) response regulator positively controls the transcription of genes encoding the essential PcsB division protein and surface virulence factors. WalR(Spn) is phosphorylated by the WalK(Spn) (VicK) histidine kinase. Little is known about the signals sensed by WalK histidine kinases. To gain information about WalK(Spn) signal transduction, we performed a kinetic characterization of the WalRK(Spn) autophosphorylation, phosphoryltransferase, and phosphatase reactions. We were unable to purify soluble full-length WalK(Spn). Consequently, these analyses were performed using two truncated versions of WalK(Spn) lacking its single transmembrane domain. The longer version (Delta35 amino acids) contained most of the HAMP domain and the PAS, DHp, and CA domains, whereas the shorter version (Delta195 amino acids) contained only the DHp and CA domains. The autophosphorylation kinetic parameters of Delta35 and Delta195 WalK(Spn) were similar [K(m)(ATP) approximately 37 microM; k(cat) approximately 0.10 min(-1)] and typical of those of other histidine kinases. The catalytic efficiency of the two versions of WalK(Spn) approximately P were also similar in the phosphoryltransfer reaction to full-length WalR(Spn). In contrast, absence of the HAMP-PAS domains significantly diminished the phosphatase activity of WalK(Spn) for WalR(Spn) approximately P. Deletion and point mutations confirmed that optimal WalK(Spn) phosphatase activity depended on the PAS domain as well as residues in the DHp domain. In addition, these WalK(Spn) DHp domain and DeltaPAS mutations led to attenuation of virulence in a murine pneumonia model. 	J._Bacteriol.	D016428 D052061
27273569	20160609	Ubiqutination via K27 and K29 chains signals aggregation and neuronal protection of LRRK2 by WSB1.	A common genetic form of Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by mutations in LRRK2. We identify WSB1 as a LRRK2 interacting protein. WSB1 ubiquitinates LRRK2 through K27 and K29 linkage chains, leading to LRRK2 aggregation and neuronal protection in primary neurons and a Drosophila model of G2019S LRRK2. Knocking down endogenous WSB1 exacerbates mutant LRRK2 neuronal toxicity in neurons and the Drosophila model, indicating a role for endogenous WSB1 in modulating LRRK2 cell toxicity. WSB1 is in Lewy bodies in human PD post-mortem tissue. These data demonstrate a role for WSB1 in mutant LRRK2 pathogenesis, and suggest involvement in Lewy body pathology in sporadic PD. Our data indicate a role in PD for ubiquitin K27 and K29 linkages, and suggest that ubiquitination may be a signal for aggregation and neuronal protection in PD, which may be relevant for other neurodegenerative disorders. Finally, our study identifies a novel therapeutic target for PD. 	Nat_Commun	D016428
11827517	20020206	X-ray crystal structures of D100E trichodiene synthase and its pyrophosphate complex reveal the basis for terpene product diversity.	The 2.4 A resolution X-ray crystal structure of D100E trichodiene synthase and the 2.6 A resolution structure of its complex with inorganic pyrophosphate are reported. The D100E amino acid substitution in the so-called &quot;aspartate-rich&quot; motif does not result in large changes to the overall structure of the enzyme. In the pyrophosphate complex, however, pyrophosphate coordinates two Mg(2+) ions at the mouth of the active site without causing large changes in the structure of the enzyme. This contrasts with pyrophosphate binding in the wild-type enzyme, where pyrophosphate coordinates three Mg(2+) ions and triggers a significant conformational change that closes the mouth of the active site and optimizes packing density in the enzyme-substrate complex. The attenuation of active site closure in D100E trichodiene synthase compromises enzyme-substrate packing density and confers additional spatial and conformational degrees of freedom on the substrate and carbocation intermediates, which in turn results in the formation of five alternate sesquiterpene products in addition to trichodiene. By extension, then, the diversity of terpene cyclases in biology may have evolved in part by amino acid substitutions that fine-tune structural changes dependent on metal-diphosphate complexation that govern the formation of the active site template and enzyme-substrate packing density.

17150839	20061208	Colorimetric allele analysis based on the DNA-directed cooperative formation of luminous lanthanide complexes.	We present the facile technique of colorimetric SNP analysis through DNA-templated cooperative complexation between a luminescent lanthanide ion (Ln(3+): Tb(3+) or Eu(3+)) and two ODN (oligodeoxyribonucleotide) conjugates carrying a metal chelator. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 1,10-phenanthrorine (phen) were covalently attached to ODNs to form the conjugate probes, capture and sensitizer probes, respectively. The sequences of the conjugates were designed so as to form a tandem duplex with a target with their auxiliary units facing each other, providing a microenvironment to accommodate Ln(3+). The capture probes for the wild-type (wt) and the mutant (mut) of thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene, were mixed with equimolar amounts of Tb(3+) and Eu(3+), respectively. Then both of the allele specific capture probe solutions and the sensitizer probe were added to three different solutions containing the targets, wt/wt (G/G), mut/mut (C/C), and wt/mut (G/C). The solutions emitted in green, red, and yellow, respectively; the colors were identified even by the naked eye. 	Nucleic_Acids_Symp_Ser_(Oxf)	D016428
16525586	20060310	Mutations in coagulation factor XIII A gene in eight unrelated Indians. Five novel mutations identified by a novel PCR-CSGE approach.	Factor XIII deficiency is a rare autosomal (1:2,000,000) recessive disorder of blood coagulation usually attributed to mutations in the coagulation factor XIII (FXIII) A gene. We have studied the molecular basis of FXIII deficiency in eight unrelated South Indian patients. Their diagnosis was based on clinical history, normal plasma clotting times and increased solubility of fibrin clot in 5 mol/l urea. Genomic DNA was screened for FXIII A gene defects by a novel PCR and CSGE strategy. Mutations were identified in all these patients. Five of these were novel mutations occurring in four patients. These included a novel c.210T &gt; G transversion in homozygosity in exon 3 predicting a Tyr69X in the beta-sandwich domain in one patient. Another patient was compound heterozygote for a novel c.791C &gt; T transition predicting a Ser263Phe in the core domain and a novel c.2045-1G &gt; A transition at the acceptor splice junction of intron 14. Two novel frame shifts were also identified in two patients in a homozygous condition. One of them resulted from a single base 'G' duplication (c.892_895dupG) at codons Ser290/Ala291fs affecting the core domain and the other was due to a single base 'A' duplication (c.1642_1644dupA) and at codonTyr547fs affecting barrel-1 domain. The remaining four patients had the previously reported Arg260His, Ser413Leu, and Val414Phe (n = 2) missense mutations in the core domain. The novel mutations identified were considered to be disease causative by studying the nature of mutation, the degree of conservation of the mutated aminoacid among transglutaminases of different species and by molecular modeling. Apart from describing a significant number of novel mutations, this report is the first study from Southern India to describe FXIII A gene mutations. 	Thromb._Haemost.	D016428 D013485
17586822	20070626	Selecton 2007: advanced models for detecting positive and purifying selection using a Bayesian inference approach.	Biologically significant sites in a protein may be identified by contrasting the rates of synonymous (K(s)) and non-synonymous (K(a)) substitutions. This enables the inference of site-specific positive Darwinian selection and purifying selection. We present here Selecton version 2.2 (http://selecton.bioinfo.tau.ac.il), a web server which automatically calculates the ratio between K(a) and K(s) (omega) at each site of the protein. This ratio is graphically displayed on each site using a color-coding scheme, indicating either positive selection, purifying selection or lack of selection. Selecton implements an assembly of different evolutionary models, which allow for statistical testing of the hypothesis that a protein has undergone positive selection. Specifically, the recently developed mechanistic-empirical model is introduced, which takes into account the physicochemical properties of amino acids. Advanced options were introduced to allow maximal fine tuning of the server to the user's specific needs, including calculation of statistical support of the omega values, an advanced graphic display of the protein's 3-dimensional structure, use of different genetic codes and inputting of a pre-built phylogenetic tree. Selecton version 2.2 is an effective, user-friendly and freely available web server which implements up-to-date methods for computing site-specific selection forces, and the visualization of these forces on the protein's sequence and structure.

23348582	20130126	Sequential Cdk1 and Plk1 phosphorylation of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B promotes mitotic cell death.	Mitotic cell death following prolonged arrest is an important death mechanism that is not completely understood. This study shows that Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) undergoes phosphorylation during mitotic arrest induced by microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) in chronic myeloid leukaemia cells. Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) or polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) during mitosis prevents PTP1B phosphorylation, implicating these kinases in PTP1B phosphorylation. In support of this, Cdk1 and Plk1 co-immunoprecipitate with endogenous PTP1B from mitotic cells. In addition, active recombinant Cdk1-cyclin B1 directly phosphorylates PTP1B at serine 386 in a kinase assay. Recombinant Plk1 phosphorylates PTP1B on serine 286 and 393 in vitro, however, it requires a priming phosphorylation by Cdk1 at serine 386 highlighting a novel co-operation between Cdk1 and Plk1 in the regulation of PTP1B. Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type PTP1B induced mitotic cell death, which is potentiated by MTAs. Moreover, mutation of serine 286 abrogates the cell death induced by PTP1B, whereas mutation of serine 393 does not, highlighting the importance of serine 286 phosphorylation in the execution of mitotic cell death. Finally, phosphorylation on serine 286 enhanced PTP1B phosphatase activity. Collectively, these data reveal that PTP1B activity promotes mitotic cell death and is regulated by the co-operative action of Cdk1 and Plk1 during mitotic arrest. 	Cell_Death_Dis	D016428 D013485

21510922	20110423	The 712A/G polymorphism of Brain-derived neurotrophic factor is associated with Parkinson's disease but not Major Depressive Disorder in a Chinese Han population.	Overlaps in clinical, pathological and molecular characteristics of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MD-D) have promoted association studies in search of common genetic risk factors that may predispose or modify this spectrum of disorders. Experimental and clinical data suggest that genetic variations in Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene may increase the risk for PD and MD-D. Two hundred and sixty-six PD, 83 MD-D and 400 controls were recruited for this study, assessed using a battery of neuropsychological tests, and genotyped for 11757C/G, 712A/G, 196A/G, and 270C/T in BDNF gene. 712A/G was associated with 2.50-fold time risk of PD. By combining genotypes AG/AA with 712 GG genotype as reference (OR=1) in stratification analysis, AG/AA genotypes were associated with PD (OR=2.94, 95% CI=1.88-4.61). Accordingly, the A allele was significantly overrepresented in PD compared with the G allele (OR=3.16, 95% CI=2.08-4.81). This distribution in females and males were similar. Our results suggested a novel association between BDNF 712A/G AG/AA genotypes and PD in a Chinese Han population. 	Biochem._Biophys._Res._Commun.	D016428 D013485

23720234	20130531	Ahsa1 and Hsp90 activity confers more severe craniofacial phenotypes in a zebrafish model of hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness and renal dysplasia (HDR).	The severity of most human birth defects is highly variable. Our ability to diagnose, treat and prevent defects relies on our understanding of this variability. Mutation of the transcription factor GATA3 in humans causes the highly variable hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness and renal dysplasia (HDR) syndrome. Although named for a triad of defects, individuals with HDR can also exhibit craniofacial defects. Through a forward genetic screen for craniofacial mutants, we isolated a zebrafish mutant in which the first cysteine of the second zinc finger of Gata3 is mutated. Because mutation of the homologous cysteine causes HDR in humans, these zebrafish mutants could be a quick and effective animal model for understanding the role of gata3 in the HDR disease spectrum. We demonstrate that, unexpectedly, the chaperone proteins Ahsa1 and Hsp90 promote severe craniofacial phenotypes in our zebrafish model of HDR syndrome. The strengths of the zebrafish system, including rapid development, genetic tractability and live imaging, make this an important model for variability. 	Dis_Model_Mech	D016428 D052061 D013485
15063389	20040406	Cyclin D1 gene polymorphism as a risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive system in non-alcoholics.	Squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) is associated with environmental factors, especially tobacco and alcohol consumption. Genetic factors, including cyclin D1 (CCND1) polymorphism have been suggested to play an important role in tumorigenesis and progression of UADT cancer. To investigate the relationship between CCND1 polymorphism on susceptibility for UADT cancers, 147 cancer and 135 non-cancer subjects were included in this study. CCND1 genotype at codon 242(G870A) in exon 4 was undertaken using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and DNA sequencing. Significant odds ratio (OR) of the AA+GA genotypes [OR=7.5 (95% CI: 1.4-39.7)] was observed in non-drinkers but for non-smokers a non-significant [OR=5.4 (95% CI: 0.9-31.4)] was found in the adjusted model. These results suggest that allele A may be a risk factor for UADT cancer, especially in non-alcoholics. However, further epidemiological studies are needed to establish the exact role of CCND1 polymorphism and the development of UADT cancers. 	Oral_Oncol.	D016428 D013485
24691054	20140403	Epithelial inflammation resulting from an inherited loss-of-function mutation in EGFR.	Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is fundamentally important for tissue homeostasis through EGFR/ligand interactions that stimulate numerous signal transduction pathways. Aberrant EGFR signaling has been reported in inflammatory and malignant diseases, but thus far no primary inherited defects in EGFR have been recorded. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous loss-of-function missense mutation in EGFR (c.1283?G&gt;A; p.Gly428Asp) in a male infant with lifelong inflammation affecting the skin, bowel, and lungs. During the first year of life, his skin showed erosions, dry scale, and alopecia. Subsequently, there were numerous papules and pustules--similar to the rash seen in patients receiving EGFR inhibitor drugs. Skin biopsy demonstrated an altered cellular distribution of EGFR in the epidermis with reduced cell membrane labeling, and in vitro analysis of the mutant receptor revealed abrogated EGFR phosphorylation and EGF-stimulated downstream signaling. Microarray analysis on the patient's skin highlighted disturbed differentiation/premature terminal differentiation of keratinocytes and upregulation of several inflammatory/innate immune response networks. The boy died at the age of 2.5 years from extensive skin and chest infections as well as electrolyte imbalance. This case highlights the major mechanism of epithelial dysfunction following EGFR signaling ablation and illustrates the broader impact of EGFR inhibition on other tissues. 	J._Invest._Dermatol.

11781320	20020110	Differential determinants for peptide and non-peptidyl ligand binding to the motilin receptor. Critical role of second extracellular loop for peptide binding and action.	The predicted second extracellular loop domain of the motilin receptor is of particular interest because it is a region that is quite distinct from the analogous regions in other family members that are most closely related and because the initial report of the photoaffinity labeling of a domain of this receptor included this region (Coulie, B. J., Matsuura, B., Dong, M., Hadac, E. M., Pinon, D. I., Feighner, S. D., Howard, A. D., and Miller, L. J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 35518-35522). In the current work, motilin receptor constructs were prepared that included sequential deletions ranging from single residues to twelve amino acid segments throughout this 67 amino acid domain. Each construct was expressed in COS cells and characterized for motilin radioligand binding and motilin-stimulated intracellular calcium responses. The only segments that had negative impact on motilin binding and biological activity included deletion constructs DeltaCys(235), Delta179-182, and Delta241-246. Cys(235) is likely involved in the highly conserved and functionally important disulfide bond linking the first and second loops of G protein-coupled receptors. Alanine replacements for each of the amino acid residues in the other two segments revealed that the perimembranous residues at both ends of this loop, Val(179) and Leu(245) and Arg(246), were responsible for the negative impact on motilin binding and biological activity. Of note, these mutants responded normally to the non-peptidyl agonist, erythromycin. These data support important functional roles for both amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal perimembranous regions of the second loop for responses to the natural agonist peptide, while supporting independent determinants for action of a non-peptidyl agonist ligand.

25659040	20150207	The alternative translated MDMX(p60) isoform regulates MDM2 activity.	Isoforms derived from alternative splicing, mRNA translation initiation or promoter usage extend the functional repertoire of the p53, p63 and p73 genes family and of their regulators MDM2 and MDMX. Here we show cap-independent translation of an N-terminal truncated isoform of hMDMX, hMDMX(p60), which is initiated at the 7th AUG codon downstream of the initiation site for full length hMDMX(FL) at position +384. hMDMX(p60) lacks the p53 binding motif but retains the RING domain and interacts with hMDM2 and hMDMX(FL). hMDMX(p60) shows higher affinity for hMDM2, as compared to hMDMX(FL). In vitro data reveal a positive cooperative interaction between hMDMX(p60) and hMDM2 and in cellulo data show that low levels of hMDMX(p60) promote degradation of hMDM2 whereas higher levels stabilize hMDM2 and prevent hMDM2-mediated degradation of hMDMX(FL). These results describe a novel alternatively translated hMDMX isoform that exhibits unique regulatory activity toward hMDM2 autoubiquitination. The data illustrate how the N-terminus of hMDMX regulates its C-terminal RING domain and the hMDM2 activity. 	Cell_Cycle	D016428 D013485
27638249	20160918	Pangenome and Phylogenomic Analysis of the Pathogenic Actinobacterium Rhodococcus equi.	We report a comparative study of 29 representative genomes of the animal pathogen Rhodococcus equi The analyses showed that R. equi is genetically homogeneous and clonal, with a large core genome accounting for ?80% of an isolates' gene content. An open pangenome, even distribution of accessory genes among the isolates, and absence of significant core-genome recombination, indicated that gene gain/loss is a main driver of R. equi genome evolution. Traits previously predicted to be important in R. equi physiology, virulence and niche adaptation were part of the core genome. This included the lack of a phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate transport system (PTS), unique among the rhodococci except for the closely related Rhodococcus defluvii, reflecting selective PTS gene loss in the R. equi-R. defluvii sublineage. Thought to be asaccharolytic, rbsCB and glcP non-PTS sugar permease homologues were identified in the core genome and, albeit inefficiently, R. equi utilized their putative substrates, ribose and (irregularly) glucose. There was no correlation between R. equi whole-genome phylogeny and host or geographical source, with evidence of global spread of genomovars. The distribution of host-associated virulence plasmid types was consistent with the exchange of the plasmids (and corresponding host shifts) across the R. equi population, and human infection being zoonotically acquired. Phylogenomic analyses demonstrated that R. equi occupies a central position in the Rhodococcus phylogeny, not supporting the recently proposed transfer of the species to a new genus.

20669401	20100730	Anti-inflammatory effects of black rice, cyanidin-3-O-beta-D-glycoside, and its metabolites, cyanidin and protocatechuic acid.	The anti-inflammatory effects of cyanidin-3-O-beta-D-glycoside (C3G), a major constituent of black rice (BR), and its metabolites, cyanidin and protocatechuic acid (PA), were assessed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells and carrageenan-induced inflammation in air pouches in BALB/c mice. BR, C3G and its metabolites suppressed the production of the proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, and the inflammatory mediators, NO and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), as well as the gene expression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in RAW 264.7 cells. These agents also inhibited the phosphorylation of I kappaB-alpha, the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Furthermore, these agents significantly inhibited the leukocyte number and the levels of TNF-alpha, PGE2, and protein in the exudates of the air pouch in carrageenan-treated mice, as well as COX-2 expression and NF-kappaB activation. Among the test agents, PA most potently inhibited these inflammatory mediators in vivo and in vitro. Based on these findings, if BR is orally administered, its main constituent, C3G, may be metabolized to cyanidin and/or PA, which express potent anti-inflammatory effects by regulating NF-kappaB and MAPK activation.

23319056	20130116	Microdystrophin ameliorates muscular dystrophy in the canine model of duchenne muscular dystrophy.	Dystrophin deficiency results in lethal Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Substituting missing dystrophin with abbreviated microdystrophin has dramatically alleviated disease in mouse DMD models. Unfortunately, translation of microdystrophin therapy has been unsuccessful in dystrophic dogs, the only large mammalian model. Approximately 70% of the dystrophin-coding sequence is removed in microdystrophin. Intriguingly, loss of ?50% dystrophin frequently results in severe disease in patients. To test whether the small gene size constitutes a fundamental design error for large mammalian muscle, we performed a comprehensive study using 22 dogs (8 normal and 14 dystrophic). We delivered the ?R2-15/?R18-19/?R20-23/?C microdystrophin gene to eight extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) muscles in six dystrophic dogs using Y713F tyrosine mutant adeno-associated virus (AAV)-9 (2.6 ? 10(13) viral genome (vg) particles/muscle). Robust expression was observed 2 months later despite T-cell infiltration. Major components of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DGC) were restored by microdystrophin. Treated muscle showed less inflammation, fibrosis, and calcification. Importantly, therapy significantly preserved muscle force under the stress of repeated cycles of eccentric contraction. Our results have established the proof-of-concept for microdystrophin therapy in dystrophic muscles of large mammals and set the stage for clinical trial in human patients. 	Mol._Ther.

22082563	20111116	A key cytochrome P450 hydroxylase in pradimicin biosynthesis.	Pradimicins A-C (1-3) are a group of antifungal and antiviral polyketides from Actinomadura hibisca. The sugar moieties in pradimicins are required for their biological activities. Consequently, the 5-OH that is used for glycosylation plays a critical role in pradimicin biosynthesis. A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase gene, pdmJ, was amplified from the genomic DNA of A. hibisca and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). PdmJ introduced a hydroxyl group to G-2A (4), a key pradimicin biosynthetic intermediate, at C-5 to form JX134 (5). A d-Ala-containing pradimicin analog, JX137a (6) was tested as an alternative substrate, but no product was detected by LC-MS, indicating that PdmJ has strict substrate specificity. Kinetic studies revealed a typical substrate inhibition of PdmJ activity. The optimal substrate concentration for the highest velocity is 115?M under the test conditions. Moreover, the conversion rate of 4 to 5 was reduced by the presence of 6, likely due to competitive inhibition. Coexpression of PdmJ and a glucose 1-dehydrogenase in E. coli BL21(DE3) provides an efficient method to produce the important intermediate 5 from 4. 	Bioorg._Med._Chem._Lett.	D016428 D052061
9488636	19980306	Erythrocytosis due to a mutation in the erythropoietin receptor gene.	Familial erythrocytosis, associated with high haemoglobin levels and low serum erythropoietin (Epo), has been shown to co-segregate with a sequence repeat polymorphism at the 5' region of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) in a large Finnish family. We have investigated the cause of erythrocytosis in an English boy. Sequencing of the cytoplasmic region of the EpoR detected a de novo transition mutation of G to A at nucleotide 6002. This mutation resulted in the formation of a stop codon at amino acid 439 with the loss of 70 amino acids from the carboxy terminus. The mutation (G6002A) has arisen independently in a Finnish family and de novo in this English boy. Patients with unexplained erythrocytosis and low serum Epo levels should be investigated for EpoR mutations. 	Br._J._Haematol.	D002363 D016428 D013485
10085295	19990323	Microtubule dynamics from mating through the first zygotic division in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	We have used time-lapse digital imaging microscopy to examine cytoplasmic astral microtubules (Mts) and spindle dynamics during the mating pathway in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mating begins when two cells of opposite mating type come into proximity. The cells arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and grow a projection towards one another forming a shmoo projection. Imaging of microtubule dynamics with green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions to dynein or tubulin revealed that the nucleus and spindle pole body (SPB) became oriented and tethered to the shmoo tip by a Mt-dependent search and capture mechanism. Dynamically unstable astral Mts were captured at the shmoo tip forming a bundle of three or four astral Mts. This bundle changed length as the tethered nucleus and SPB oscillated toward and away from the shmoo tip at growth and shortening velocities typical of free plus end astral Mts (approximately 0.5 micrometer/min). Fluorescent fiduciary marks in Mt bundles showed that Mt growth and shortening occurred primarily at the shmoo tip, not the SPB. This indicates that Mt plus end assembly/disassembly was coupled to pushing and pulling of the nucleus. Upon cell fusion, a fluorescent bar of Mts was formed between the two shmoo tip bundles, which slowly shortened (0.23 +/- 0.07 micrometer/min) as the two nuclei and their SPBs came together and fused (karyogamy). Bud emergence occurred adjacent to the fused SPB approximately 30 min after SPB fusion. During the first mitosis, the SPBs separated as the spindle elongated at a constant velocity (0.75 micrometer/min) into the zygotic bud. There was no indication of a temporal delay at the 2-micrometer stage of spindle morphogenesis or a lag in Mt nucleation by replicated SPBs as occurs in vegetative mitosis implying a lack of normal checkpoints. Thus, the shmoo tip appears to be a new model system for studying Mt plus end dynamic attachments and much like higher eukaryotes, the first mitosis after haploid cell fusion in budding yeast may forgo cell cycle checkpoints present in vegetative mitosis.

24443885	20140122	Evidence to support natural hybridization between Anopheles sinensis and Anopheles kleini (Diptera: Culicidae): possibly a significant mechanism for gene introgression in sympatric populations.	Malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax is still a public health problem in the Republic of Korea (ROK), particularly regarding the recent re-emergence of this malarial species near the demilitarized zone in northwestern Paju City, Gyeonggi-do Province. Currently, at least 4 species (An. kleini, An. pullus, An. belenrae and An. lesteri) of the Hyrcanus Group are reported as possible natural vectors of vivax malaria in the ROK, and An. sinensis, which is the most dominant species, has long been incriminated as an important natural vector of this P. vivax. However, An. sinensis was ranked recently as a low potential vector. According to the discovery of natural hybrids between An. sinensis (a low potential vector for P. vivax) and An. kleini (a high potential vector for P. vivax) in Paju City, intensive investigation of this phenomenon is warranted under laboratory conditions. Mosquitoes were collected during 2010-2012 from Paju City, ROK. Hybridization experiments used iso-female line colonies of these anophelines together with DNA analysis of ribosomal DNA [second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2)] and mitochondrial DNA [cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI)] of the parental colonies, F1-hybrids and repeated backcross progenies were performed intensively by using a PCR-based assay and pyrosequencing technology. The results from hybridization experiments and molecular investigations revealed that the mitochondrial COI gene was introgressed from An. sinensis into An. kleini. The An. sinensis progenies obtained from consecutive repeated backcrosses in both directions, i.e., F2-11 progeny [(An. sinensis x An. kleini) x An. sinensis] and F3-5 progeny [(An. kleini x An. sinensis) x An. kleini] provided good supportive evidence. This study revealed introgression of the mitochondrial COI gene between An. sinensis and An. kleini through consecutive repeated backcrosses under laboratory conditions. This new body of knowledge will be emphasized in reliable promising strategies in order to replace the population of An. kleini as a high potential vector for P. vivax, with that of a low potential vector, An. sinensis, through the mechanism of gene introgression in nature.

24062743	20130925	Pyrin- and CARD-only Proteins as Regulators of NLR Functions.	Upon activation Nod-like receptors (NLRs) assemble into multi-protein complexes such as the NODosome and inflammasome. This process relies upon homo domain interactions between the structurally related Pyrin and caspase-recruitment (CARD) domains and adaptor proteins, such as ASC, or effector proteins, such as caspase-1. Although a variety of NLRP and NLRC complexes have been described along with their activating stimuli and associated proteins, less familiar are processes limiting assembly and/or promoting dissociation of NLR complexes. Given the importance of limiting harmful, chronic inflammation, such regulatory mechanisms are significant and likely numerous. Proteins comprised of a solitary Pyrin domain (Pyrin-only) or CARD domain (CARD-only) posses an obvious potential ability to act as competitive inhibitors of NLR complexes. Indeed, both Pyrin-only proteins (POPs) and CARD-only proteins (COPs) have been described as regulators of caspase-1 and/or NLR-inflammasome activation and not surprisingly as factors mediating pathogenesis. Although clear examples of pathogen encoded POPs are currently limited to members of the poxviridae, the human genome likely encodes three POPs (POP1, POP2, and a potential POP3), of which only POP2 is known to prevent NLR:ASC interaction, and three COPs (COP/Pseudo-ICE, INCA, and ICEBERG), initially described for their ability to inhibit caspase-1 activity. Surprisingly, among eukaryotic species POPs and COPs appear to be evolutionarily recent and restricted to higher primates, suggesting strong selective pressures driving their emergence. Despite the importance of understanding the regulation of NLR functions, relatively little attention has been devoted to revealing the biological impact of these intriguing proteins. This review highlights the current state of our understanding of POPs and COPs with attention to protein interaction, functions, evolution, implications for health and disease, and outstanding questions.

22537113	20120428	Association between arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (ALOX5AP) and lung function in a Korean population.	Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (ALOX5AP) plays a role in the 5-lipoxygenase (LO) pathway, which includes the LTC(4), LTD(4), LTE(4) and LTB(4). These leukotrienes are known causative factors of asthma, allergy, atopy and cardiovascular diseases. ALOX5AP lacks enzyme activity and acts by helping 5-LO function. In this study, healthy and general subjects who live in rural and urban areas of Korea were tested for the association of ALOX5AP polymorphisms with lung function. Lung function was also estimated by calculating the predicted values for forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1) _%PRED) and the proportion of the forced vital capacity exhaled in the first second (FEV(1) /FVC_PRED). The linear regression was adjusted for residence area, gender, age, height and smoking status. The analysis revealed associations between FEV(1) and the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs9506352 and the haplotype TCAC (permuted P-value &lt; 0.05). The linkage disequilibrium block that included the significant SNPs overlapped with SNPs that were revealed previously to associate with myocardial infarction and asthma and to affect lung function.

Uracil N-glycosylase 2 (UNG2), the nuclear isoform of UNG, catalyzes the removal of uracil or 5-fluorouracil lesions that accumulate in DNA following treatment with the anticancer agents 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (floxuridine), a 5-fluorouracil metabolite. By repairing these DNA lesions before they can cause cell death, UNG2 promotes cancer cell survival and is therefore critically involved in tumor resistance to these agents. However, the mechanisms by which UNG2 is regulated remain unclear. Several phosphorylation sites within the N-terminal regulatory domain of UNG2 have been identified, although the effects of these modifications on UNG2 function have not been fully explored, nor have the identities of the kinases involved been determined. Here we show that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) interacts with and phosphorylates UNG2 at Thr60and that Thr60phosphorylation requires a Ser64priming phosphorylation event. We also show that mutating Thr60or Ser64to Ala increases the half-life of UNG2, reduces the rate of in vitro uracil excision, and slows UNG2 dissociation from chromatin after DNA replication. Using an UNG2-deficient ovarian cancer cell line that is hypersensitive to floxuridine, we show that GSK-3 phosphorylation facilitates UNG2-dependent repair of floxuridine-induced DNA lesions and promotes tumor cell survival following exposure to this agent. These data suggest that GSK-3 regulates UNG2 and promotes DNA damage repair. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428
19953340	20091203	SAGE analysis of genes differentially expressed in presymptomatic TgSOD1G93A transgenic mice identified cellular processes involved in early stage of ALS pathology.	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative condition in which motor neurons of the spinal cord and motor cortex degenerate, resulting in progressive paralysis. Transgenic mice expressing human mutant Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) present a pathology that is very similar to that seen in human ALS patients. Using serial analysis of gene expression, we investigated the effects of mutant human SOD1 protein on global gene expression in the spinal cord and lower brain stem of presymptomatic TgSOD1(G93A) transgenic mice. One hundred twenty transcripts were found to be significantly dysregulated in the presence of mutant SOD1 protein, 79 being down-regulated and 41 up-regulated. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to confirm the differential expression of nine of these genes. Immunohistochemistry analysis on spinal cord sections revealed that dysregulation of these mutant SOD1-induced molecular pathways are concomitant to the appearance of discrete signs of neuropathology including neuronal loss, elevated gliosis, and ubiquitin-positive deposits. Altogether, our data showed that early signs of neuropathology in the SOD1 mutant mice are accompanied by altered expression of genes involved in various biological processes including apoptosis, oxidative stress, ATP biosynthesis, myelination, and axonal transport.

26694751	20151224	PrimPol-deficient cells exhibit a pronounced G2 checkpoint response following UV damage.	PrimPol is a recently identified member of the archaeo-eukaryote primase (AEP) family of primase-polymerases. It has been shown that this mitochondrial and nuclear localized enzyme plays roles in the maintenance of both unperturbed replication fork progression and in the bypass of lesions after DNA damage. Here, we utilized an avian (DT40) knockout cell line to further study the consequences of loss of PrimPol (PrimPol(-/-)) on the downstream maintenance of cells after UV damage. We report that PrimPol(-/-) cells are more sensitive to UV-C irradiation in colony survival assays than Pol ?-deficient cells. Although this increased UV sensitivity is not evident in cell viability assays, we show that this discrepancy is due to an enhanced checkpoint arrest after UV-C damage in the absence of PrimPol. PrimPol(-/-) arrested cells become stalled in G2, where they are protected from UV-induced cell death. Despite lacking an enzyme required for the bypass and maintenance of replication fork progression in the presence of UV damage, we show that PrimPol(-/-) cells actually have an advantage in the presence of a Chk1 inhibitor due to their slow progression through S-phase.

22355288	20120223	Conductance-based neuron models and the slow dynamics of excitability.	In recent experiments, synaptically isolated neurons from rat cortical culture, were stimulated with periodic extracellular fixed-amplitude current pulses for extended durations of days. The neuron's response depended on its own history, as well as on the history of the input, and was classified into several modes. Interestingly, in one of the modes the neuron behaved intermittently, exhibiting irregular firing patterns changing in a complex and variable manner over the entire range of experimental timescales, from seconds to days. With the aim of developing a minimal biophysical explanation for these results, we propose a general scheme, that, given a few assumptions (mainly, a timescale separation in kinetics) closely describes the response of deterministic conductance-based neuron models under pulse stimulation, using a discrete time piecewise linear mapping, which is amenable to detailed mathematical analysis. Using this method we reproduce the basic modes exhibited by the neuron experimentally, as well as the mean response in each mode. Specifically, we derive precise closed-form input-output expressions for the transient timescale and firing rates, which are expressed in terms of experimentally measurable variables, and conform with the experimental results. However, the mathematical analysis shows that the resulting firing patterns in these deterministic models are always regular and repeatable (i.e., no chaos), in contrast to the irregular and variable behavior displayed by the neuron in certain regimes. This fact, and the sensitive near-threshold dynamics of the model, indicate that intrinsic ion channel noise has a significant impact on the neuronal response, and may help reproduce the experimentally observed variability, as we also demonstrate numerically. In a companion paper, we extend our analysis to stochastic conductance-based models, and show how these can be used to reproduce the details of the observed irregular and variable neuronal response.

20124734	20100204	A novel Thr56Met mutation of the autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia gene associated with hypercholesterolemia.	The autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH) gene is located on chromosome 1p35 and encodes a 308-amino acid protein containing a phosphotyrosine-binding domain. Several researchers have identified mutations of ARH that cause autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia; however, it remains unknown whether this gene is involved in common hypercholesterolemia. We searched for polymorphisms of the ARH gene by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing. We identified 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms of the gene, including 9 novel polymorphisms, and determined 2 haplotype blocks. No association was observed between common hypercholesterolemia and any polymorphisms or haplotypes of the ARH gene; however, we newly identified a rare Thr56Met missense mutation located in the phosphotyrosine-binding domain, which is the functional domain responsible for cholesterol metabolism. Among 1,800 Japanese individuals enrolled in the Suita study, only 4 were heterozygous for Thr56Met and all had hypercholesterolemia. The total cholesterol level and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of diabetic patients with the Thr56Met missense mutation was 276.3+/-13.8 mg/dL and 185.3+/-7.37 mg/dL, respectively. Because the Thr56Met missense mutation occurs in an orthologously conserved functional domain and all subjects with the mutation had hypercholesterolemia resembling familiar hypercholesterolemia, it may be a cause of familial hypercholesterolemia.

3384709	19880101	Hemoglobin Pierre-B?nite [beta 90(F6)Glu----Asp], a new high affinity variant found in a French family.	Hemoglobin Pierre-B?nite [beta 90(F6)Glu---Asp] is a new high affinity variant (P50 = 21.5 mm Hg), with normal heme-heme interaction, found in a French family. It was difficult to detect by conventional electrophoretic methods. However, the high performance liquid chromatography profile of its tryptic peptides contained an additional peak. Amino acid analysis of the corresponding peptide and determination of its sequence allowed us to identify the mutation. No instability was found. Mutations previously recorded in position 90 of the beta-chain display a positive charge shift and a reduced affinity for oxygen, whereas Hb Pierre-B?nite shows no charge shift and increased affinity for oxygen.

26758070	20160114	LOXL1 gene analysis in Turkish patients with exfoliation glaucoma.	The purpose of this study is to evaluate whole lysyl oxidase like 1 (LOXL1) gene by sequence analysis in Turkish patients with exfoliation glaucoma (XFG). A total of 48 (35 male, 13 female) patients with XFG were enrolled. Besides routine ophthalmological examination, peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) analysis with optic coherence tomography was performed. Blood samples of 2?ml with EDTA were obtained and sent to Medical Genetics Department, Molecular Genetics Laboratory for LOXL1 polymorphism (PCR and agarose gel imaging) analysis. The role of the detected changes on disease severity was evaluated. No LOXL1 gene mutations in any of the patients were detected. Three types of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including R141L(rs1048661), A320A(rs41435250), and F184F were detected in 17 (35.3?%) patients. When compared, SNP-positive patients had thinner RNFL than SNP-negative patients (64.5???17.6 and 66.1???20.4??, respectively), and SNP-positive patients had higher cupping/disc ratio than SNP-negative patients (0.76???0.2 and 0.70???0.3, respectively). However, both values were not statistically significant (p?=?0.966 and p?=?0.539, respectively). When compared, R141L-positive patients had significantly thinner cornea thickness (516.11???30.3??) than R141L-negative patients (556.69???27.2??) (p?=?0.004). There was not any statistical significant difference in the means of age, gender, BCVA, MD, PSD, IOP, number of hypotensive agents, and percent of glaucoma surgery (p?&gt;?0.05). In this study group of Turkish population, no LOXL1 mutations were found. No associations between the defined SNPs (A320A, R141L and F184F) and the severity of the disease were detected.

24119464	20131015	Sequential processing deficits in schizophrenia: relationship to neuropsychology and genetics.	Utilizing a combination of neuropsychological and cognitive neuroscience approaches may be essential for characterizing cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and eventually assessing cognitive outcomes. This study was designed to compare the stability of select exemplars for these approaches and their correlations in schizophrenia patients with stable treatment and clinical profiles. Reliability estimates for serial order processing were comparable to neuropsychological measures and indicate that experimental serial order processing measures may be less susceptible to practice effects than traditional neuropsychological measures. Correlations were moderate and consistent with a global cognitive factor. Exploratory analyses indicated a potentially critical role of the Met allele of the Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism in externally paced sequential recall. Experimental measures of serial order processing may reflect frontostriatal dysfunction and be a useful supplement to large neuropsychological batteries. 	Schizophr._Res.	D016428 D052061
23396399	20130212	Humoral responses to islet antigen-2 and zinc transporter 8 are attenuated in patients carrying HLA-A*24 alleles at the onset of type 1 diabetes.	The HLA-A*24 allele has shown negative associations with autoantibodies to islet antigen-2 (IA-2) and zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) in patients with established type 1 diabetes. Understanding how this HLA class I allele affects humoral islet autoimmunity gives new insights into disease pathogenesis. We therefore investigated the epitope specificity of associations between HLA-A*24 and islet autoantibodies at disease onset. HLA-A*24 genotype and autoantibody responses to insulin (IAA), glutamate decarboxylase (GADA), IA-2, IA-2?, and ZnT8 were analyzed in samples collected from patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes. After correction for age, sex, and HLA class II genotype, HLA-A*24 was shown to be a negative determinant of IA-2A and ZnT8A. These effects were epitope specific. Antibodies targeting the protein tyrosine phosphatase domains of IA-2 and IA-2?, but not the IA-2 juxtamembrane region, were less common in patients carrying HLA-A*24 alleles. The prevalence of ZnT8A specific or cross-reactive with the ZnT8 tryptophan-325 polymorphic residue, but not those specific to arginine-325, was reduced in HLA-A*24-positive patients. No associations were found between HLA-A*24 and IAA or GADA. Association of an HLA class I susceptibility allele with altered islet autoantibody phenotype at diagnosis suggests CD8 T-cell and/or natural killer cell-mediated killing modulates humoral autoimmune responses.

25734113	20150304	Nonencapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae Cause Acute Otitis Media in the Chinchilla That Is Enhanced by Pneumococcal Surface Protein K.	Use of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has led to serotype replacement of carriage and acute otitis media (AOM) pneumococcal isolates. Increases in nonencapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae (NESp) isolates have also occurred, and there are increasing reports of NESp-associated disease. Disease prevalence and virulence factors of NESp isolates have not been studied. A chinchilla model of pneumococcal AOM was utilized, and disease was assessed through bacterial enumeration along with scoring visible signs of pathology. An adhesion-invasion assay using a human epithelial cell line was performed. Nonencapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae strains containing pneumococcal surface protein K (PspK) were more likely to cause AOM and pathology upon infection. Deletion of PspK from an isolate significantly reduced bacterial loads. Increased epithelial cell adhesion correlated with increased virulence of NESp isolates naturally lacking PspK. Furthermore, expression of PspK by an avirulent NESp resulted in virulence. The presence of PspK increased the disease potential of NESp. Pneumococcal surface protein K is not the only virulence factor of NESp in AOM. Expression of PspK in an avirulent NESp mediated the progression to pneumococcal disease. Genetic exchange between pneumococci may allow dissemination of PspK, increasing the potential of NESp disease. The current study is the first report of a NESp-specific virulence factor.

Abdominal wall endometriosis in a Caesarean section scar (AEC) is an infrequent type of extrapelvic endometriosis which rarely transforms into a malignant lesion. A painful mass located in the scar of a Caesarean section is a typical sign of AEC. This condition is diagnosed preoperatively using imaging modalities such as computed tomography and ultrasonography, as well as fine-needle aspiration. Although AEC has typical signs, general surgeons often misdiagnose it due to its rarity. Herein, we report our experience of AEC in a single institution. 	Surg_Res_Pract	D016428
25503729	20141216	Effects of hydration in rats and mice with polycystic kidney disease.	Vasopressin and V2 receptor signaling promote polycystic kidney disease (PKD) progression, raising the question whether suppression of vasopressin release through enhanced hydration can delay disease advancement. Enhanced hydration by adding 5% glucose to the drinking water has proven protective in a rat model orthologous to autosomal recessive PKD. We wanted to exclude a glucose effect and explore the influence of enhanced hydration in a mouse model orthologous to autosomal dominant PKD. PCK rats were assigned to normal water intake (NWI) or high water intake (HWI) groups achieved by feeding a hydrated agar diet (HWI-agar) or by adding 5% glucose to the drinking water (HWI-glucose), with the latter group used to recapitulate previously published results. Homozygous Pkd1 R3277C (Pkd1(RC/RC)) mice were assigned to NWI and HWI-agar groups. To evaluate the effectiveness of HWI, kidney weight and histomorphometry were assessed, and urine vasopressin, renal cAMP levels, and phosphodiesterase activities were measured. HWI-agar, like HWI-glucose, reduced urine vasopressin, renal cAMP levels, and PKD severity in PCK rats but not in Pkd1(RC/RC) mice. Compared with rat kidneys, mouse kidneys had higher phosphodiesterase activity and lower cAMP levels and were less sensitive to the cystogenic effect of 1-deamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin, as previously shown for Pkd1(RC/RC) mice and confirmed here in Pkd2(WS25/-) mice. We conclude that the effect of enhanced hydration in rat and mouse models of PKD differs. More powerful suppression of V2 receptor-mediated signaling than achievable by enhanced hydration alone may be necessary to affect the development of PKD in mouse models.

25986478	20150520	Comparing the effectiveness of capecitabine versus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin therapy for elderly Taiwanese stage III colorectal cancer patients based on quality-of-life measures (QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR38) and a new cost assessment tool.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in developed countries and its incidence increases with age. Intravenous administration of bolus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) has been a standard treatment regime for stage III CRC. However, patients generally prefer oral therapy such as Capecitabine. Studies showed that combination of oxaliplatin and capecitabine demonstrated efficacy and safety on par with treatment involving various 5-FU/LV-based regimens in elderly patients as they are in younger ones. However, little is known regarding the cost of adjuvant therapy or the effect of therapy on HRQoL. Thus the aims of this study were to evaluate the influence of different adjuvant care for stage III CRC on the HRQoL of elderly patients and to compare the economic costs associated with capecitabine-based and 5-FU/LV-based adjuvant treatments from a societal perspective in Taiwan. A prospective, open-label, observational, multicenter study involving 123 patients aged 70 and over from 11 different centers was conducted between July 2008 and July 2011 in Taiwan. The adjusted monthly costs per patient and HRQoL were evaluated from individual-level data. The HRQoL of patients was assessed before and after adjuvant treatment. Direct and indirect costs of adjuvant treatment were estimated from a number of sources, and QoL scores were compared between groups. After correcting for baseline characteristics of patients, no significant differences were observed in the global HRQoL scores between treatment groups during the study period. According to QLQ-CR38 results, capecitabine-based therapy appeared to alleviate problems related to defecation (4.54 vs. 8.5; P?=?0.011); however, micturition problems increased (9.27 vs. 7.51; P?=?0.04), compared with 5-FU/LV-based treatment. The adjusted monthly treatment cost per patient was NT$27,300 for capecitabine-based treatment and NT$53,671 for 5-FU/LV-based treatment. The total cost of 5-FU/LV-based treatment was 59 % greater than that of capecitabine-based treatment. Analyzing from the societal perspective in Taiwan, capecitabine-based therapy incurred lower treatment costs than 5-FU/LV-based therapy and did not jeopardize HRQoL. Therefore, capecitabine, with or without oxaliplatin, could be considered as an alternative treatment option for elderly patients with stage III CRC.

27882096	20161125	Association between clusterin gene polymorphism rs11136000 and late-onset Alzheimer's disease susceptibility: A review and meta-analysis of case-control studies.	The present study aimed to evaluate the association between rs11136000 in clusterin (CLU) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) by meta-analysis. Several databases including PubMed, EMbase, CBMdisc and CMCC were searched for relevant case-control studies based on defined selection criteria. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the rs11136000 genotype and allele distribution were analyzed with RevMan and Stata software. The control population and heterogeneity between populations were examined in the selected studies using the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Overall OR among the frequencies of the genotype and allele in both patients with AD and controls was estimated using fixed or random effect models. The summary of the OR and 95% CI were then analyzed to obtain the effects across the studies. Publication bias was examined using a funnel plot, Egger's test and Begg's test, and a Fail-safe Number (Nfs). A total of 20 reports were used. The summary OR for studies in the Caucasian population with a frequency of TT+TC/CC genotype and T/C allele at rs11136000 locus inCLUwere 0.79 (95% CI, 0.73-0.86; P&lt;0.00001) and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.85-0.90; P&lt;0.00001). The summary OR for the studies conducted in the Asian population were 0.90 (95% CI, 0.81-0.99; P=0.04) and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.81-0.93; P&lt;0.0001). The summary OR in other mixed ethnic groups with regards to the frequency of T/C allele was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.68-0.99; P=0.04). These results demonstrated the presence of a statistically significant difference in LOAD susceptibility between individuals with the T alleleCLUrs11136000 polymorphism and those without. The studies conducted in populations of African descent or Hispanics showed no statistically significant difference. Negligible publication bias was present, with Nfsbeing 750.604. In summary, polymorphism rs11136000 in theCLUgene may contribute to susceptibility to LOAD, and the presence of the T allele may reduce the risk of LOAD in Caucasian and Asian populations. However, no definitive association was found between the presence of theCLUrs11136000 polymorphism and LOAD in populations of African or Hispanic descent. 	Exp_Ther_Med	D016428
23569135	20130410	9p21 polymorphisms increase the risk of peripheral artery disease in the Han Chinese population.	A case-control study to investigate the association of the 9p21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs10757274 and rs10757278 (known to be associated with coronary artery disease [CAD] risk) with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), in a Han Chinese population. The rs10757274 and rs10757278 genotypes of patients with PAD, and age- and sex-matched control subjects, were determined. Multivariate unconditional logistic regression analyses were performed, with adjustments for age, sex, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes and smoking status. The study included 420 patients with PAD and 418 control subjects. Variant forms of both SNPs were associated with increased risk of PAD in the total study population, when excluding patients with CAD or stroke (additive genetic model). The GG haplotype increased the risk of PAD, but this association did not remain significant after further sensitivity analysis. Both SNPs were associated with PAD risk in patients aged &lt;65 years, but not in those aged ? 65 years (additive model). 9p21 is associated with PAD. When stratified according to age, 9p21 increases PAD risk in individuals aged &lt;65 years, but not in those aged ? 65 years. 	J._Int._Med._Res.	D016428 D013485
20594349	20100703	Age modifies the genotype-phenotype relationship for the bitter receptor TAS2R38.	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of TAS2R38 haplotypes and age on human bitter taste perception. Children (3 to 10 yrs), adolescents (11 to 19 yrs) and adults (mostly mothers, 20 to 55 yrs (N = 980) were measured for bitter taste thresholds for 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) and genotyped for three polymorphisms of the AS2R38 gene (A49P, V262A, I296V). Subjects were grouped by haplotype and age, as well as sex and race/ethnicity, and compared for PROP thresholds. Subjects with the same haplotype were similar in bitter threshold regardless of race/ethnicity (all ages) or sex (children and adolescents; all p-values &gt; 0.05) but age was a modifier of the genotype-phenotype relationship. Specifically, AVI/PAV heterozygous children could perceive a bitter taste at lower PROP concentrations than could heterozygous adults, with the thresholds of heterozygous adolescents being intermediate (p &lt; 0.001). Similar age effects were not observed for subjects with the PAV/PAV or AVI/AVI homozygous haplotypes (p &gt; 0.05) perhaps because there is less variation in taste perception among these homozygotes. These data imply that the change in PROP bitter sensitivity which occurs over the lifespan (from bitter sensitive to less so) is more common in people with a particular haplotype combination, i.e., AVI/PAV heterozygotes.

18055562	20071207	A novel, putative gain-of-function haplotype at SLC6A4 associates with obsessive-compulsive disorder.	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling neuropsychiatric illness with strong segregation data indicative of major genetic contributions. Association analyses of common functional variants of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4), a long-standing OCD candidate, have so far been inconsistent. Here, we set out to investigate the role of additional functional SLC6A4 loci in OCD. We describe a common, functional C &gt; T single nucleotide polymorphism, rs25532, located less than 150 nucleotides centromeric of the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region indel known as 5-HTTLPR. The minor allele of rs25532 significantly decreased luciferase reporter gene expression levels by 15-80%, depending on 5-HTTLPR allele background and cell type. Haplotype-based testing of rs25532 and all other known non-coding functional SLC6A4 variants revealed a highly significant omnibus association with OCD in a large case-control sample. Remarkably, the haplotype significantly overrepresented in probands contained the higher-expressing allele at each locus, supporting the notion of increased serotonin transporter functioning being pathogenetically involved in OCD. Conditional haplotype analyses with the software WHAP revealed that this association is primarily driven by 5-HTTLPR, rs25532 and rs16965628. Our results contribute to a better understanding of SLC6A4 expression genetics and provide a functional haplotype framework for future serotonin-related studies. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D052060
3967761	19850121	Localization of the amino acid substitution site in a fast migrating variant of human serum albumin.	Albumin Mi/Fg is an Italian genetic variant of human serum albumin arising from a Lys----Glu substitution which has been located in a CNBr fragment (CNBr VII) corresponding to the -COOH terminal portion of the molecule [(1984) J. Chromatogr. 298, 336-344]. Tryptic peptides of CNBr VII from normal and Mi/Fg albumin have been purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and submitted to comparative structural studies. The amino acid sequence of the tryptic peptide of Mi/Fg variant that differs from the corresponding fragment of the normal serum albumin shows that the Lys----Glu substitution responsible for this variant is located at position 573. This region of the albumin molecule is involved in the binding of long chain fatty acids. 	FEBS_Lett.	D016428 D013485
22384405	20120303	Narrowing Down the Mapping of Plant Sex-Determination Regions Using New Y-Chromosome-Specific Markers and Heavy-Ion Beam Irradiation-Induced Y-Deletion Mutants in Silene latifolia.	Silene latifolia is a well-studied model system for plant XY sex determination. Three maleness factors are thought to function on the Y chromosome, gynoecium suppression factor (GSF), stamen-promoting factor (SPF), and male fertility factor (MFF), and their deletions result in hermaphrodites, anther defects, and pollen defects, respectively. Although a framework map of the Y chromosome exists, the sex determination genes have not been identified, and no markers close enough to potentially be used for BAC library screening are yet available. The analysis of Y deletion mutants by Y-chromosome-specific STS markers is an efficient way to isolate sex determination regions, but more Y-specific STS markers are needed to accelerate the exploration of sex determination factors. Herein, we report a marker design method that uses simple sequence repeats, which is especially effective on the Y chromosome of S. latifolia because it contains many simple sequence repeats. Six new Y-chromosome-specific STS markers were obtained, SmicSy1-6. These were used to detect relatively small Y deletion sites in heavy-ion beam irradiation-induced mutants. The mapping of male sex determination regions was narrowed down by using more markers and smaller-sized Y deletion mutants. One new marker, SmicSy6, is a proximal marker to SPF and, thus, a second index for SPF. The region including SPF is thought to be located between two SPF proximal markers. The flower phenotype correlates with the deletion size of SPF using SPF proximal markers. These findings represent new progress in isolating the sex determination factor, which has been studied for more than 50 years. 	G3_(Bethesda)	D016428
24965678	20140627	Examining the condition-specific antisense transcription in S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus.	Recent studies have demonstrated that antisense transcription is pervasive in budding yeasts and is conserved between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. paradoxus. While studies have examined antisense transcripts of S. cerevisiae for inverse expression in stationary phase and stress conditions, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis of the conditional specific evolutionary characteristics of antisense transcription between yeasts. Here we attempt to decipher the evolutionary relationship of antisense transcription of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus cultured in mid log, early stationary phase, and heat shock conditions. Massively parallel sequencing of sequence strand-specific cDNA library was performed from RNA isolated from S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus cells at mid log, stationary phase and heat shock conditions. We performed this analysis using a stringent set of sense ORF transcripts and non-coding antisense transcripts that were expressed in all the three conditions, as well as in both species. We found the divergence of the condition-specific anti-sense transcription levels is higher than that in condition-specific sense transcription levels, suggesting that antisense transcription played a potential role in adapting to different conditions. Furthermore, 43% of sense-antisense pairs demonstrated inverse expression in either stationary phase or heat shock conditions relative to the mid log conditions. In addition, a large part of sense-antisense pairs (67%), which demonstrated inverse expression, were highly conserved between the two species. Our results were also concordant with known functional analyses from previous studies and with the evidence from mechanistic experiments of role of individual genes. By performing a genome-scale computational analysis, we have tried to evaluate the role of antisense transcription in mediating sense transcription under different environmental conditions across and in two related yeast species. Our findings suggest that antisense regulation could control expression of the corresponding sense transcript via inverse expression under a range of different circumstances.

27153070	20160507	Rapid Multi-Damage Identification for Health Monitoring of Laminated Composites Using Piezoelectric Wafer Sensor Arrays.	Through the use of the wave reflection from any damage in a structure, a Hilbert spectral analysis-based rapid multi-damage identification (HSA-RMDI) technique with piezoelectric wafer sensor arrays (PWSA) is developed to monitor and identify the presence, location and severity of damage in carbon fiber composite structures. The capability of the rapid multi-damage identification technique to extract and estimate hidden significant information from the collected data and to provide a high-resolution energy-time spectrum can be employed to successfully interpret the Lamb waves interactions with single/multiple damage. Nevertheless, to accomplish the precise positioning and effective quantification of multiple damage in a composite structure, two functional metrics from the RMDI technique are proposed and used in damage identification, which are the energy density metric and the energy time-phase shift metric. In the designed damage experimental tests, invisible damage to the naked eyes, especially delaminations, were detected in the leftward propagating waves as well as in the selected sensor responses, where the time-phase shift spectra could locate the multiple damage whereas the energy density spectra were used to quantify the multiple damage. The increasing damage was shown to follow a linear trend calculated by the RMDI technique. All damage cases considered showed completely the developed RMDI technique potential as an effective online damage inspection and assessment tool. 	Sensors_(Basel)	D016428
22425018	20120320	Hemoglobin A1C is independently associated with severity and prognosis of brainstem infarctions.	To assess the association of Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) with acute brainstem infarctions (BSIs) and to determine whether HbA1c is an independent risk factor in BSIs patients. 96 only BSIs patients were categorized into four groups according to HbA1c as &lt;6%, ? 6% but &lt;7%, ? 7% but &lt;8%, or ? 8%, respectively. The association of the four HbA1c groups with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) infarct volumes (DIV), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and follow-up modified Rankin Scale (FmRS) scores were analyzed. Patients also were categorized into two groups according to HbA1c&lt;6% or ? 6%. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine independent risk factors. There was a significant correlation between HbA1c and DIV (Spearman ?=0.339, P=0.001), NIHSS scores (?=0.292, P=0.004) and FmRS scores (?=0.315, P=0.002). The incidence of pons infarction was highest in BSIs and patients with HbA1c ? 6% showed significantly more frequent isolated pontine infarction. Logistic regression analyses showed that only HbA1c was independently associated with larger DIV (P=0.025) and FmRS scores (P=0.026). These results suggest that elevated HbA1c level may be a potential serologic marker in the evaluation of the severity and prognosis of acute BSIs. There is an urgent need to study control of diabetes mellitus (DM) before and after BSIs. 	J._Neurol._Sci.	D016428 D013485
23532449	20130328	Limbic system associated membrane protein as a potential target for neuropsychiatric disorders.	The studies performed in laboratory animals and psychiatric patients suggest a possible role of limbic system-associated membrane protein (LAMP) in the mechanisms of psychiatric disorders. Stressful manipulations and genetic invalidation have revealed a role of the Lsamp gene in the regulation of anxiety in rodents. Besides that, Lsamp-deficient mice display reduced aggressiveness and impaired adaptation in novel and stressful environments. The behavioral effects of amphetamine were blunted in genetically modified mice. Recent pharmacological and biochemical studies point toward altered function of GABA-, 5-hydroxytryptamine-, and dopaminergic systems in Lsamp-deficient mice. Moreover, we found an association between the gene polymorphisms of LSAMP and major depressive disorder (MDD). Patients suffering from MDD had significantly increased ratio between risk and protective haplotypes of the LSAMP gene compared to healthy volunteers. However, the impact of these haplotypes for the function of LAMP is not clear and remains to be elucidated in future studies. 	Front_Pharmacol	D016428
16117772	20050825	Effects of splinted prosthesis supported a wide implant or two implants: a three-dimensional finite element analysis.	Three-dimensional finite element (FE) models of splinted prosthetic crowns were studied and stress analyses were evaluated with different types of implant support, including standard, wide or two implant(s) for partial, posterior edentulous restorations. The FE models were constructed based on a cadaver mandible containing the 2nd premolar and the 1st molar. The crowns of these two teeth were modeled as connected and disconnected to mimic the splinted and non-splinted designs, respectively. One standard implant was placed at the premolar region, while three types of implant support, one at a time (the standard implant, wide implant and two implants), were used to support the molar crown. A 100 N oblique load was applied to the buccal cusp on each crown. The FE simulation was validated experimentally via strain gauge measurement. The experimental data were well correlated with the FE predictions (r(2)=0.97). When compared with the standard implant used in the molar area, the wide implant and two implants reduced the peak stress in crestal bone by 29-37% for both splinted and non-splinted cases. Inserting the standard implant into both the premolar and molar area, the bone stresses were identical for splinted and non-splinted designs. However, splinting the adjacent crowns has shown to decrease the bone stresses at the premolar region by 25%, while the wide implant or two implants were placed at the molar region. The biomechanical advantages of using the wide implant or two implants are almost identical. The benefit of load sharing by the splinted crowns is notable only when the implants on the premolar and molar regions have different supporting ability.

8918601	19961101	Recognition of a surface loop of the lipoyl domain underlies substrate channelling in the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex.	In the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex of Bacillus stearothermophilus, the interaction between the pyruvate decarboxylase (E1p) component and the lipoyl domain of the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) component was investigated using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and NMR spectroscopy. Residues 11 to 15 (EGIHE) of the lipoyl domain, part of a surface loop close in space to the beta-turn containing the lipoyl-lysine residue (position 42), were deleted or replaced. The mutant domains all retained their three-dimensional structures and ability to become lipoylated, but in the absence of the loop the lipoyl-lysine residue could no longer be reductively acetylated by E1p. A mutation (N40A) in the N- terminal part of the lipoyl-lysine hairpin showed that it is involved in recognition of the domain by E1p but other mutations in the loop (E15A) and close to the lipoyl-lysine hairpin (V44S, V45S and E46A) were without effect. The heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence NMR spectra of 15N-labelled lipoyl domain in the presence and absence of B. stearothermophilus E1p were recorded. Of the 85 amino acid residues in the lipoyl domain, 13 exhibited significant differences in chemical shift. These differences, most of which were associated with residues in the surface loop between positions 8 and 15 and in, or close to, the lipoyl-lysine hairpin, indicate that E1p makes contact with the lipoyl domain in these areas. The combined results of directed mutagenesis and NMR spectroscopy point to the surface loop as a major determinant of the interaction of lipoyl domain with E1p. The specificity of this essential interaction provides the molecular basis of substrate channelling in this, the first committed, step of the enzyme reaction mechanism. 	J._Mol._Biol.

25210616	20140912	Nigrostriatal dynein changes in A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic mice.	The accumulation of misfolded a-synuclein is mechanistically linked to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other alpha-synucleinopathies. However, how alpha-synuclein causes neurodegeneration is unresolved. Several studies have supported the involvement of dynein, the major motor for retrograde axonal transport in alpha-synuclein-dependent neurodegeneration, especially in the nigrostriatal system. Therefore, we examined the nigrostriatal dyneins in transgenic mice that overexpress human A53T alpha-synuclein and recapitulate key features of a PD-like neuronal synucleinopathy. Age-matched nontransgenic littermates were used as controls. The results demonstrated that the protein level of dynein was decreased in the striatum, whereas it was elevated in the substantia nigra. Double immunostaining results revealed that the reduction in dynein level was associated with aggregation of A53T a-synuclein in the striatum. Furthermore, we performed a quantitative analysis of motor behaviors in A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic mice and controls using a modified open field test. We demonstrated that the protein level of dynein in the striatum was significantly correlated with the motor behaviors. Together, our data indicate that dynein changes in the nigrostriatal system of A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic mice may contribute to their severe movement disorder. 	F1000Res	D016428
27274463	20160609	Serum levels of appetite-regulating hormones and pro-inflammatory cytokines are ameliorated by a CLA diet and endurance exercise in rats fed a high-fat diet.	This study examined whether conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) supplementation and endurance exercise affect appetite-regulating hormones and pro-inflammatory cytokines in rats. Seven-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into the high-fat diet sedentary group (HS, n=8), the 1.0% CLA supplemented high-fat diet sedentary group (CS, n=8), and the 1.0% CLA supplemented high-fat diet exercise group (CE, n=8). Rats in the CE group swam 60 min/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks. Leptin and insulin levels in the CS and CE groups were significantly lower than those in the HS group (p&lt;0.001), whereas leptin (p&lt;0.01) and insulin (p&lt;0.05) levels decreased significantly in the CE compared to those in the CS group. Interleukin (IL)-1? (p&lt;0.001) and IL-6 (p&lt;0.01) levels in the CS and CE groups decreased significantly compared to those in the HS group. Leptin (IL-1?: r=0.835, p&lt;0.001), IL-6 (r=0.607, p&lt;0.05), insulin (IL-1?: r=0.797, p&lt;0.01), and IL-6 (r=0.827, p&lt;0.01) levels were positively related with pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Endurance exercise may play an important role during CLA supplementation of rats on a high-fat diet. 	J_Exerc_Nutrition_Biochem	D016428
15198841	20040617	A prospective, randomized, multicentered controlled trial to compare the annual glycemic and quality outcomes of patients with diabetes mellitus monitored with weekly fructosamine testing versus usual care.	Fructosamine is an indicator of overall glycemic control for a 10-14-day time frame, medium-term marker, versus the 90-day average indicated by the hemoglobin A1c (A1C) test. The utility of the home fructosamine test for management of persons with diabetes remains undefined. The primary objectives of this study were (1) to compare the annual A1C results of subjects monitoring weekly fructosamine with those receiving usual care, (2) to identify the number of subjects achieving goal A1C, and (3) to determine if the addition of a weekly fructosamine test changed a subject's quality of life. This was a prospective, randomized, multicenter, controlled trial. Subjects were recruited from three sites and randomly assigned to collect weekly fructosamine in addition to daily glucose (Group 1) or to receive usual care of daily glucose collection (Group 2). Follow-up occurred at 3-month intervals for a year. Baseline and quarterly A1C tests were collected. Quality of life assessment was conducted at baseline and at the final study visit. Seventy-two subjects were randomized. Demographic and whole blood assessments were similar between the two groups at baseline. The mean percent change of A1C from baseline to final study visit in Group 1 (-0.52 +/- 1.5) was not statistically different than Group 2 (-0.86 +/- 1.4) (P = 0.320). Seven subjects in each group achieved A1C of less than 7% (P = 0.532). No change in quality of life between or within the two groups was observed (P &gt; 0.05) for each area of concern. Blood glucose monitoring alone was shown to be superior to the additional fructosamine testing after 1 year of treatment; however, weekly fructosamine testing demonstrated a decrease in A1C earlier and more consistently throughout the study. Despite glycemic improvement, the number of subjects attaining American Diabetes Association-defined A1C goals was not different between the treatment groups. Quality of life did not change with the addition of a weekly fructosamine test. 	Diabetes_Technol._Ther.	D016430 D016428 D016448 D016449
24203243	20131109	The structure and mechanism of formation of C5H 9O (+) from ionized phytyl methyl ether.	The recent proposal that ionized phytyl methyl ether [C16H33(CH3)C=CHCH2OCH 3 (+?) ] undergoes an allylic rearrangement to ionized isophytyl methyl ether [CH2=CHC(C16H33)(CH3)OCH 3 (+?) ] before elimination of an alkyl radical is discussed. Both literature precedent and new results in which the structure of the [M-C16H 33 (?) ](+) fragment ion is established by comparison of its collision-induced dissociation mass spectrum with the spectra of isomeric C5H9O(+) ions of known structure are inconsistent with this proposal. The forma Hon of CH3CH=CHCH=O(+)CH3 by loss of a ?-alkyl substituent without skeletal isomerization rather than CH2=CHC(CH3)=O(+)CH3 after allylic rearrangement is explained in terms of a mechanism that involves two 1,2-H shifts, followed by ?-cleavage of the resultant ionized enol ether, C16H33(CH3)CH-CH=CHOCH 3 (+?) .

20169173	20100220	Macrophage migration inhibitory factor: critical role in obesity, insulin resistance, and associated comorbidities.	Obesity is associated with insulin resistance, disturbed glucose homeostasis, low grade inflammation, and comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an ubiquitously expressed protein that plays a crucial role in many inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that MIF also controls metabolic and inflammatory processes underlying the development of metabolic pathologies associated with obesity. This is a comprehensive summary of our current knowledge on the role of MIF in obesity and obesity-associated comorbidities, based on human clinical data as well as animal models of disease.

11929530	20020404	The nrfI gene is essential for the attachment of the active site haem group of Wolinella succinogenes cytochrome c nitrite reductase.	The cytochrome c nitrite reductase complex (NrfHA) is the terminal enzyme in the electron transport chain catalysing nitrite respiration of Wolinella succinogenes. The catalytic subunit NrfA is a pentahaem cytochrome c containing an active site haem group which is covalently bound via the cysteine residues of a unique CWTCK motif. The lysine residue serves as the axial ligand of the haem iron. The other four haem groups of NrfA are bound by conventional haem-binding motifs (CXXCH). The nrfHAIJ locus was restored on the genome of the W. succinogenes DeltanrfAIJ deletion mutant by integration of a plasmid, thus enabling the expression of modified alleles of nrfA and nrfI. A mutant (K134H) was constructed which contained a nrfA gene encoding a CWTCH motif instead of CWTCK. NrfA of strain K134H was found to be synthesized with five bound haem groups, as judged by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. Its nitrite reduction activity with reduced benzyl viologen was 40% of the wild-type activity. Ammonia was formed as the only product of nitrite reduction. The mutant did not grow by nitrite respiration and its electron transport activity from formate to nitrite was 5% of that of the wild-type strain. The predicted nrfI gene product is similar to proteins involved in system II cytochrome c biogenesis. A mutant of W. succinogenes (stopI) was constructed that contained a nrfHAIJ gene cluster with the nrfI codons 47 and 48 altered to stop codons. The NrfA protein of this mutant did not catalyse nitrite reduction and lacked the active site haem group, whereas the other four haem groups were present. Mutant (K134H/stopI) which contained the K134H modification in NrfA in addition to the inactivated nrfI gene had essentially the same properties as strain K134H. NrfA from strain K134H/stopI contained five haem groups. It is concluded that NrfI is involved in haem attachment to the CWTCK motif in NrfA but not to any of the CXXCH motifs. The nrfI gene is obviously dispensable for maturation of a modified NrfA protein containing a CWTCH motif instead of CWTCK. Therefore, NrfI might function as a specific haem lyase that recognizes the active site lysine residue of NrfA. A similar role has been proposed for NrfE, F and G of Escherichia coli, although these proteins share no overall sequence similarity to NrfI and belong to system I cytochrome c biogenesis, which differs fundamentally from system II.

23698091	20130524	Genetic markers of a Munc13 protein family member, BAIAP3, are gender specifically associated with anxiety and benzodiazepine abuse in mice and humans.	Anxiety disorders and substance abuse, including benzodiazepine use disorder, frequently occur together. Unfortunately, treatment of anxiety disorders still includes benzodiazepines, and patients with an existing comorbid benzodiazepine use disorder or a genetic susceptibility for benzodiazepine use disorder may be at risk of adverse treatment outcomes. The identification of genetic predictors for anxiety disorders, and especially for benzodiazepine use disorder, could aid the selection of the best treatment option and improve clinical outcomes. The brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor I-associated protein 3 (Baiap3) is a member of the mammalian uncoordinated 13 (Munc13) protein family of synaptic regulators of neurotransmitter exocytosis, with a striking expression pattern in amygdalae, hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray. Deletion of Baiap3 in mice leads to enhanced seizure propensity and increased anxiety, with the latter being more pronounced in female than in male animals. We hypothesized that genetic variation in human BAIAP3 may also be associated with anxiety. By using a phenotype-based genetic association study, we identified two human BAIAP3 single-nucleotide polymorphism risk genotypes (AA for rs2235632, TT for rs1132358) that show a significant association with anxiety in women and, surprisingly, with benzodiazepine abuse in men. Returning to mice, we found that male, but not female, Baiap3 knockout (KO) mice develop tolerance to diazepam more quickly than control animals. Analysis of cultured Baiap3 KO hypothalamus slices revealed an increase in basal network activity and an altered response to diazepam withdrawal. Thus, Baiap3/BAIAP3 is gender specifically associated with anxiety and benzodiazepine use disorder, and the analysis of Baiap3/BAIAP3-related functions may help elucidate mechanisms underlying the development of both disorders.

25275047	20141003	Activating mutations affecting the NF-kappa B pathway and EZH2-mediated epigenetic regulation are rare events in primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.	Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) is a distinct subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) frequently observed in young patients. High-dose immunochemotherapy constitutes the current therapeutic gold-standard, despite significant toxicity and serious late effects. Several hotspots harboring oncogenic gain-of-function mutations were recently shown to pose vital hallmarks in activated B-cell like (ABC-) (CD79B, CARD11 and MYD88) and germinal center like (GCB-) DLBCL (EZH2), respectively. Several promising targeted-therapy approaches, derived from these findings, are currently under development. We thoroughly characterized a cohort of 25 untreated patients with de novo PMBL by immunohistochemical and cytogenetic means and assessed the prevalence of activating mutations affecting EZH2, CD79B and CARD11 utilizing a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based capillary sequencing approach. Moreover, the MYD88 p. L265P status was assessed by employing a pyrosequencing approach. PMBLs included in this study did not harbor any of the reported hotspot mutations activating the nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B signaling cascade or the EZH2-mediated epigenetic deregulation of gene expression. Immunohistochemical characterization revealed an ABC phenotype in 44% (n=11) of cases. We report that genetic alterations of these genes are rare events in PMBL unlike other subtypes of DLBCL. Our findings suggest that a substantial subset of PMBL patients may benefit from treatment approaches targeting BCR-mediated activation of NF-kappa B. 	Anticancer_Res.	D016428
14757160	20040206	Site-directed mutagenesis at the human B2 receptor and molecular modelling to define the pharmacophore of non-peptide bradykinin receptor antagonists.	Combining site-directed mutagenesis with information obtained from molecular modelling of the bradykinin (BK) human B2 receptor (hB2R) as derived from the bovine rhodopsin crystal structure [Science 289 (2000) 739], we previously defined a putative binding mode for the non-peptide B2 receptor antagonists, FR173657 and LF16-0687 [Can J Physiol Pharmacol 80 (2002) 303]. The present work is aimed to define the specific role of the quinoline moiety in the pharmacophore of these non-peptide antagonists. The effect of the mutations I110A, L114A (TM, transmembrane 3), W256A (TM6), F292A, Y295A and Y295F (TM7) was evaluated. None of the mutations affected the binding interaction of peptide ligands: the agonist BK and the peptide antagonist MEN 11270. The affinities in competing for [3H]-BK binding and in blocking the BK-induced IP production by the non-peptide antagonists LF16-0687 and FR173657 at the wild type and mutant receptors were analysed. While the affinities of LF16-0687 and FR173657 were crucially decreased at the I110A, Y295A, and Y295F mutants, the W256A mutation affected the affinity of the LF16-0687 only. The important contribution of the quinoline moiety was shown by the inability of an analogue of LF16-0687, lacking this moiety, to affect BK binding at the wild type receptor. On the other hand, the benzamidine group did not interact with mutated residues, since LF16-0687 analogues without this group or with an oxidated benzamidine displayed pairwise loss of affinity on wild type and mutated receptors. Further differences between FR173657 and LF16-0687 were highlighted at the I110 and Y295 mutants when comparing binding (pK(i)) and functional antagonist (pKB) affinity. First, the I110A mutation similarly impaired their binding affinity (250-fold), but at a less extent the antagonist potency of FR173657 only. Second, both the hydroxyl and the phenyl moieties of the Y295 residue had a specific role in the LF16-0687 interaction with the receptor, as demonstrated at the Y295F and Y295A mutants, respectively, but not in that of FR173657. Present data identify a receptor binding pocket comprised among TM3, 6, and 7, which concerns the interaction of the non-peptide antagonists FR173657 and LF16-0687, but not that of the peptide agonist or antagonist. Results indicate the quinoline group as the involved pharmacophoric element, and that the studied residues are differently involved in the interaction. The analysis performed by means of the GRID software led us to propose different spatial orientations of the quinoline moieties and partially overlapping binding pockets for the two ligands: that of LF16-0687 is located in the lipophilic environment amongst I110 (TM3), W256 (TM6), and Y295 (TM7) residues, whereas that of FR173657 lies essentially between I110 and Y295.

11230457	20010307	Isolation and characterization of a Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi variant and its clinical and public health implications.	We report the isolation and characterization of a member of the family Enterobacteriaceae isolated from the gallbladder pus of a food handler. Conventional biochemical tests suggested Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, but the isolate agglutinated with poly(O), 2O, 9O, and Vi Salmonella antisera but not with poly(H) or any individual H Salmonella antisera. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that there were two base differences between the isolate and Salmonella enterica serotype Montevideo, four base differences between the isolate and serotype Typhi, five base differences between the isolate and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium, and six base differences between the isolate and Salmonella enterica serotype Dublin, indicating that the isolate was a strain of S. enterica. Electron microscopy confirmed that the isolate was aflagellated. The flagellin gene sequence of the isolate was 100% identical to that of the H1-d flagellin gene of serotype Typhi. Sequencing of the rfbE gene, which encoded the CDP-tyvelose epimerase of the isolate, showed that there was a point mutation at position +694 (G--&gt;T), leading to an amino acid substitution (Gly--&gt;Cys). This may have resulted in a protein of reduced catalytic activity and hence the presence of both 2O and 9O antigens. We therefore concluded that the isolate was a variant of serotype Typhi. Besides antibiotic therapy and cholecystectomy, removal of all stones in the biliary tree was performed for eradication of the carrier state. 	J._Clin._Microbiol.	D002363 D016428 D013485
8993332	19970107	Selective inhibition of the prothrombinase complex: factor Va alters macromolecular recognition of a tick anticoagulant peptide mutant by factor Xa.	The prothrombinase complex assembles through reversible interactions between the protease, factor Xa, the cofactor, factor Va, and acidic phospholipid membranes in the presence of calcium ions. Changes in macromolecular recognition by factor Xa which may result from its interaction with factor Va in the prothrombinase complex have been probed using a recombinant derivative of tick anticoagulant peptide where Arg3 has been replaced with Ala (R3A-TAP). In contrast to the wild type inhibitor, R3A-TAP was a weak competitive inhibitor of factor Xa (Ki = 794 nM). The inhibition of the prothrombinase complex by R3A-TAP was characterized by slow, tight-binding kinetics with an increased affinity of approximately 4000-fold (Ki* = 0.195 nM) relative to that of solution-phase factor Xa. Stopped-flow measurements using p-aminobenzamidine (PAB) demonstrated that the reaction between solution-phase factor Xa and R3A-TAP could be adequately described by a single reversible step with rate constants that were consistent with equilibrium binding measurements. The rate-limiting bimolecular combination of R3A-TAP and factor Xa was competitive with PAB binding of the protease. In contrast, the reaction of R3A-TAP with prothrombinase measured using PAB yielded biphasic stopped-flow traces, indicating a multistep pathway for the reaction of the inhibitor with the enzyme complex. The kinetic measurements were consistent with the initial formation of a ternary complex between R3A-TAP, prothrombinase, and PAB followed by two unimolecular steps which lead to PAB dissociation from the enzyme. In this case, prior occupation of the active site by PAB had no effect on the bimolecular reaction between R3A-TAP and prothrombinase. Thus, the interaction of factor Xa with factor Va on the membrane surface alters recognition of R3A-TAP by the protease, leading to changes in the thermodynamics as well as in the observed kinetic mechanism for the reaction. Therefore, a single amino acid substitution in TAP reveals large changes in macromolecular recognition by factor Xa as a consequence of its interaction with the cofactor within the prothrombinase complex.

9092542	19970411	Molecular cloning, characterization, and expression in Escherichia coli of full-length cDNAs of three human glutathione S-transferase Pi gene variants. Evidence for differential catalytic activity of the encoded proteins.	We report the isolation of three full-length cDNAs corresponding to the mRNAs of closely related glutathione S-transferase (GST) Pi genes, designated hGSTP1*A, hGSTP1*B, and hGSTP1*C, expressed in normal cells and malignant gliomas. The variant cDNAs result from A --&gt; G and C --&gt; T transitions at nucleotides +313 and +341, respectively. The transitions changed codon 104 from ATC (Ile) in hGSTP1*A to GTC (Val) in hGSTP1*B and hGSTP1*C and changed codon 113 from GCG (Ala) to GTG (Val) in hGSTP1*C. Both amino changes are in the electrophile-binding active site of the GST Pi peptide. Computer modeling of the deduced crystal structures of the encoded peptides showed significant deviations in the interatomic distances of critical electrophile-binding active site amino acids as a consequence of the amino acid changes. The encoded proteins expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by GSH affinity chromatography showed a 3-fold lower Km (CDNB) and a 3-4-fold higher Kcat/Km for the hGSTP1*A encoded protein than the proteins encoded by hGSTP1*B and hGSTP1*C. Analysis of 75 cases showed the relative frequency of hGSTP1*C to be 4-fold higher in malignant gliomas than in normal tissues. These data provide conclusive molecular evidence of allelopolymorphism of the human GST Pi gene locus, resulting in active, functionally different GST Pi proteins, and should facilitate studies of the role of this gene in xenobiotic metabolism, cancer, and other human diseases.

23524664	20130326	Influence of the CYP2B6 polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics of mitotane.	The aim of this study was to assess the potential impact of the pharmacogenetic variability of CYP2B6 and ABCB1 genes on the pharmacokinetics of mitotane. A retrospective analysis was carried out on 27 patients with adrenocortical carcinoma on postoperative adjunctive mitotane. CYP2B6 and ABCB1 polymorphisms were genotyped and tested for an association with plasma trough concentration after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of therapy. Patients with the GT/TT genotype had higher mitotane plasma concentrations compared with patients with GG at 3 months (14.80 vs. 8.01 ?g/ml; P=0.008) and 6 months (17.70 vs. 9.75 ?g/ml; P=0.015). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that only the CYP2B6 rs3745274GT/TT genotype (odds ratio=10.7; P=0.017) was a predictor of mitotane plasma concentrations of at least 14 ?g/ml after 3 months of treatment.

19934346	20091126	Naturally occurring glucokinase mutations are associated with defects in posttranslational S-nitrosylation.	Posttranslational activation of glucokinase (GCK) through S-nitrosylation has been recently observed in the insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cell; however, the function of this molecular mechanism in regulating the physiology of insulin secretion is not well understood. To more fully understand the function of posttranslational regulation of GCK, we examined two naturally occurring GCK mutations that map to residues proximal to the S-nitrosylated cysteine and cause mild fasting hyperglycemia (maturity-onset diabetes of the young; subtype glucokinase). The kinetics of recombinantly generated GCK-R369P and GCK-V367M were assessed in vitro. The GCK-R369P protein has greatly reduced catalytic activity (relative activity index 0.05 vs. 1.00 for wild type), whereas the GCK-V367M has near normal kinetics (relative activity index 1.26 vs. 1.00 for wild type). Quantitative imaging and biochemical assays were used to assess the effect of these mutants on the metabolic response to glucose, GCK activation, and S-nitrosylation of GCK in betaTC3 insulinoma cells. Expression of either mutant in betaTC3 cells did not affect the metabolic response to 5 mM glucose. However, expression of either mutant blocked the effects of insulin on glucose-stimulated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduction, suggesting defects in posttranslational regulation of GCK. Each of these mutations blocked GCK activation, and prevented posttranslational cysteine S-nitrosylation. Our findings link defects in hormone-regulated GCK S-nitrosylation to hyperglycemia and support a role for posttranslational regulation of GCK S-nitrosylation as a vital regulatory mechanism for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.

17983459	20071107	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene (VEGFA) polymorphism can predict the prognosis in acute myeloid leukaemia patients.	Increased angiogenesis, mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), was associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients. The current study investigated the impact of VEGF gene (VEGFA) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on treatment outcomes for AML. Four VEGFA SNPs were analysed for -2578C&gt;A (rs699947), -460T&gt;C (rs833061), +405G&gt;C (rs2010963) and +936 C&gt;T (rs3025039) loci in 138 AML patients. The +936 CC/CT genotype showed strong correlation with favourable leukaemia-free survival (LFS) at 2 years (51.3%) versus with +936 CC genotype (33.6%, P = 0.03). Strong linkage disequilibrium was noted among loci -2578, -460 and +405, but not with +936. Accordingly, four haplotypes were generated based on the genotypes of -2578, -460 and +405 as follows: CTC (40.2%), CTG (35.0%), ACG (22.0%) and ATC (1.2%). The LFS and event-free survival (EFS) inversely correlated with CTG haplotype (P = 0.03 for LFS; P = 0.05 for EFS). We scored the VEGFA polymorphism marker based on +936 C&gt;T genotype and CTG haplotype for -2578, -460 and +405, which demonstrated a good correlation with the treatment outcomes: LFS (P = 0.01), EFS (P = 0.03) and overall survival (P = 0.01). The VEGFA +936 C&gt;T genotype and CTG haplotype seemed to have an additive effect to predict the prognosis in AML patients. 	Br._J._Haematol.	D016428 D013485
7106563	19820401	Ribosomal protein genes of yeast contain intervening sequences.	From a colony bank of HindIII-generated yeast DNA fragments we have isolated a number of recombinant DNAs carrying genes for ribosomal proteins (e.g., S10, S16A, S20, S24, S31, S33, L16, L25 and L34) of the yeast Saccharomyces carlsbergensis. By electron microscopic analysis of the R-loops formed between various DNA fragments and yeast mRNA, we could locate the ribosomal protein genes on the physical maps of the cloned DNA fragments. The R-loop structures observed indicate that a number of the ribosomal protein genes contain an intervening sequence. 	Gene	D016428
11040971	20001021	[Effect of dipyridamole on recombination of photooxidized bacteriochlorophylla and photoreduced primary quinone in reactive centers of purple bacteria and degradation of form M412 of bacteriorhodopsin].	It is shown that the addition of dipyridamole (2,6-bis(diethanolamino)-4,8-dipiperidinopyrimido[5,4d]py rim idine) (up to 10(-4) M) leads to a drastic acceleration of the dark recombination reaction between photooxidized bacteriochlorophyll and photoreduced primary quinone in reaction centers of Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The value of the acceleration is similar to that registered under cryogenic temperatures. The extent of the effect of dipyridamole derivatives depended on their structure. In wild-type bacteriorhodopsin and D96N mutant, dipyridamole slowed down the Schiff base reprotonation (the kinetics of M412 form decay was registered). It is suggested that dipyridamole can influence the structural and dynamic state of membrane proteins by affecting the system of their hydrogen-bonds and thus modify electron and proton transport processes.

6871856	19830901	Ability of the immunomodulating dipeptide bestatin to activate cytotoxic mononuclear phagocytes.	The aminopeptidase inhibitor Bestatin [2S,3R-(3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutanoyl)-L-leucine] was tested for both in vitro and in vivo macrophage activation and antitumor activity in various experimental tumor systems including the metastasizing ESb lymphoma system. Cultures of resting macrophages were rendered nonspecifically tumoricidal for the two lymphoma sublines ESb and 721 (ESb-Cl 18.1), for the mastocytoma P815X, for LS lymphoma cells, and for proliferating lymphoblasts from DBA/2, C57BL/6J, and CBA mice by exposure to Bestatin at 50 micrograms/ml culture medium. Untreated mononuclear phagocytes and Bestatin alone were not directly cytotoxic. Treatment of mice parenterally with Bestatin also induced cytotoxic macrophages for several tumor cells when tested in vitro. Normal peritoneal mouse macrophages from untreated mice or from control mice given injections of phosphate-buffered saline were not cytotoxic. The macrophage activation to lyse tumor cells was sharply dependent on the Bestatin dose and appeared about 24 hr after injection of the dipeptide. Bestatin activates macrophages through a T-cell-independent process to lyse tumor target cells, inasmuch as macrophages from homozygous athymic nude (nu/nu) mice treated i.p. with the dipeptide were also stimulated and cytotoxic for tumor cells. We present evidence that the macrophage is the prominent host cell responsible for tumor cell destruction in animals treated with Bestatin and rule out the possibility that natural killer cells play a major role in the experiments described.

19772674	20090924	Saffron is a monomorphic species as revealed by RAPD, ISSR and microsatellite analyses.	Saffron (Crocus sativus) is considered the world's most expensive spice. Used mainly as a colorant for foodstuffs, it is highly appreciated for its aromatic and flavouring properties. Since no molecular markers for this species have been found in the literature, the objective of this study was to determine whether phenotypical differences found in C. sativus were supported by molecular analyses. Thirty primers from Operon Technologies were used in random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, forty eight primers were screened using intersimple sequence repeats (ISSR) method and fifteen primers derived from a microsatellites library flanking sequences with repeat motifs were assayed in forty three isolates of C. sativus from eleven different countries and a C. kotschyanus isolate was used as outgroup. No polymorphic bands were detected in any of the accessions combining the different approaches used in this study. According to our findings, all accessions appear identical clones, not only because morphological characters but also at a molecular level. These data strongly suggested that C. sativus is a monomorphic species. Thus, genome sequencing is needed to find molecular markers for saffron. 	BMC_Res_Notes	D016428
24312168	20131207	Detection of HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies in a human CD4?/CXCR4?/CCR5? T-lymphoblastoid cell assay system.	Sensitive assays are needed to meaningfully assess low levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that may be important for protection against the acquisition of HIV-1 infection in vaccine recipients. The current assay of choice uses a non-lymphoid cell line (TZM-bl) that may lack sensitivity owing to over expression of CD4 and CCR5. We used transfection of a human CD4+/CXCR4+/?4?7+ T-lymphoblastoid cell line (A3.01) with a CMV IE promoter-driven CCR5neo vector to stably express CCR5. The resulting line, designated A3R5, is permissive to a wide range of CCR5-tropic circulating strains of HIV-1, including HIV-1 molecular clones containing a Tat-inducible Renilla luciferase reporter gene and expressing multiple Env subtypes. Flow cytometric analysis found CCR5 surface expression on A3R5 cells to be markedly less than TZM-bl but similar to CD3.8 stimulated PBMC. More importantly, neutralization mediated by a diverse panel of monoclonal antibodies, HIV-1 positive polyclonal sera and sCD4 was consistently greater in A3R5 compared to TZM-bl cells. The A3R5 cell line provides a novel approach to guide the development and qualification of promising new HIV-1 vaccine immunogens. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D052061 D013485 D013486
12509295	20030102	Complementation between N-terminal Saccharomyces cerevisiae mre11 alleles in DNA repair and telomere length maintenance.	In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mre11p, Rad50p, and Xrs2p function as a multiprotein complex that has a central role in several DNA repair mechanisms. Though Mre11p has both single-stranded and double-stranded 3'-5' exonuclease activity in vitro, null mutants of MRE11, RAD50, and XRS2 exhibit reduced 5'-3' resection of HO-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) in vivo. In this study, we analyzed four mre11 mutants harboring changes in the N-terminus of Mre11p where the four phosphoesterase motifs specify the in vitro nuclease activities of Mre11p and its homologues. We find that the 5'-3' resection defects in vivo do not correlate with several mitotic phenotypes: non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), telomere length maintenance, and adaptation to the DNA damage-inducible G2/M checkpoint. Overexpression of the 5'-3' exonuclease Exo1p in a mre11Delta strain partially increased 5'-3' resection and partially suppressed both methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) hypersensitivity and adaptation phenotypes, but did not affect telomere length or NHEJ. Surprisingly, the co-expression of two alleles, mre11-58S and mre11-N113S, each of which confers MMS hypersensitivity and short telomeres, can fully complement the MMS sensitivity and shortened telomere length of mre11Delta cells. We propose that at least two separate activities associated with the N-terminus of Mre11p are required for its mitotic function. 	DNA_Repair_(Amst.)	D016428 D013485 D013486 D013487
2404763	19900126	Occurrence of S-(1,2-dicarboxyethyl)-cysteine at position 77 in mutant human lysozyme secreted by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	A mutant human lysozyme P110, in which Val110 was replaced with Pro, was secreted by Saccharomyces cerevisiae; modification of the cysteine residue at position 77 was found in a purified mutant protein (P110-B) upon primary structure analysis. A peptide fragment containing 15 amino acid residues from Thr70 to Leu84 was obtained by proteolytic digestion of the protein and subsequently isolated by reverse-phase HPLC. This fragment was analyzed by high-resolution fast-atom-bombardment (FAB) mass spectrometry, which showed that 1,2-dicarboxyethyl group was attached to the thiol group of Cys77. This modification was confirmed by comparing it with a sample of chemically synthesized S-(1,2-dicarboxyethyl)-L-cysteine. It was found that the modification caused a disruption of the disulfide bond Cys77-Cys95 in the mutant molecule. These observations, plus structural considerations, suggest that Cys77 and Cys95 either remain uncrosslinked or the disulfide bond Cys77-Cys95, once formed, is opened during the final step in the folding of human lysozyme in vivo.

25888363	20150419	Effectiveness of acupuncture for angina pectoris: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.	The purpose of this systematic review is to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture for angina pectoris. Eleven electronic databases were searched until January 2013. The study included randomized controlled trials that the effectiveness of acupuncture alone was compared to anti-angina medicines (in addition to conventional treatment) and the effectiveness of a combination of acupuncture plus anti-angina medicines was compared to anti-angina medicines alone. The trial selection, data extraction, quality assessment and data analytic procedures outlined in the 2011 Cochrane Handbook were involved. The study included 25 randomized controlled trials (involving 2,058 patients) that met our inclusion criteria. The pooled results showed that the number of patients with ineffectiveness of angina relief was less in the combined acupuncture-anti-angina treatment group than in the anti-angina medicines alone group (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.23-0.47, p &lt; 0.00001, I2 = 0%). Similarly, compared to the anti-angina medicines alone group, fewer patients in the combined treatment group showed no ECG improvement (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.40-0.62, p &lt; 0.00001, I2 = 0%). However, no differences were observed between acupuncture treatment alone and anti-angina medicines alone for both outcome measures. Only four trials mentioned adverse effects. One trial found no significant difference between acupuncture and Chinese medicine, and three reported no adverse events. The quality of the trials was found to be low. The findings showed very low evidence to support the use of acupuncture for improving angina symptoms and ECG of angina patients. However, the quality of the trials included in this study was low. Large and rigorously designed trials are needed to confirm the potential benefit and adverse events of acupuncture. 	BMC_Complement_Altern_Med	D016428 D016454
12454773	20021128	PTEN/MMAC1 expression in melanoma resection specimens.	PTEN/MMAC1, a tumour suppressor gene located on chromosome 10q23.3, has been found to be deleted in several types of human malignancies. As the chromosomal region 10q22-qter commonly is affected by losses in melanomas, we addressed this gene as tumour suppressor candidate in melanomas. Investigating PTEN/MMAC1 expression at mRNA level by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we did not find a statistically significant down-regulation in melanoma resection specimens in comparison to acquired melanocytic nevi from which melanomas quite often are known to arise. Upon immunohistochemistry, PTEN/MMAC1 protein expression in melanomas was not lost. Sequencing the PTEN/MMAC1 cDNAs in 26 melanoma resection specimens (21 primary melanomas, five metastases), we detected three point mutations and two nucleotide deletions which did not represent genetic polymorphisms. With respect to the predicted protein sequences, all three point mutations were silent whereas the two frame shifts at the extreme C-terminus resulted in a loss of the putative PDZ-targeting consensus sequence. As loss of this motif possibly impairs localization and function of PTEN/MMAC1 in the two corresponding primary tumours, alterations of this tumour suppressor protein may participate in some melanomas.

27323851	20160622	Phosphohistone H3 (pHH3) is a prognostic and epithelial to mesenchymal transition marker in diffuse gliomas.	The World Health Organization (WHO) grading of gliomas stratifies tumors by histology. However, the aggressiveness of tumors in each grade still shows great heterogeneity. Phosphohistone H3 (pHH3) has been reported as an accurate marker of cells within the mitotic phase of the cell cycle in many kinds of cancers. To evaluate the role of pHH3 in predicting patient outcome and to annotate the functions of pHH3 in WHO grade II-IV gliomas, we analyzed the expression pattern of pHH3 and pHH3 associated genes by IHC and mRNA expression profiling. Phosphohistone H3, mRNA enrichment of histone H3 and associated gene signature all showed prognostic value in adult diffuse gliomas. Gene set enrichment analysis suggested that the expression of pHH3 had positive correlation with both epithelial to mesenchymal transition and immune response. These findings suggest that subgroups of diffuse gliomas defined by pHH3 and pHH3 signatures possess distinctive prognostic and biological characteristics. 	Oncotarget	D016428
17599050	20070630	RET(MEN 2B) is active in the endoplasmic reticulum before reaching the cell surface.	MEN 2B (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B) is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome caused by an oncogenic form of the receptor tyrosine kinase REarranged during transfection (RET). The MEN 2B syndrome is associated with an abnormal autophosphorylation of the mutated receptor even without ligand-stimulation. Here, we characterize the activation of a RET(MEN 2B) variant carrying the point mutation Met918Thr, and show that the 150 kDa precursor of RET(MEN 2B) becomes phosphorylated already during synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). At least three different tyrosine residues (Tyr905, Tyr1062, Tyr1096) of the RET(MEN 2B) precursor are phosphorylated before the oncogenic receptor reaches the cell surface. We also demonstrate that the precursor of RET(MEN 2B) interacts with both growth factor receptor-bound protein and Src homology 2 domain-containing already in the ER, and that this interaction is dependent on the kinase activity of RET. With the aid of two RET mutants (RET(MEN 2B/S32L) and RET(MEN 2B/F393L)), which accumulate in the ER, we show that the oncogenic precursor of the receptor has the capacity to activate AKT, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 from the ER. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the oncogenic precursor of RET(MEN 2B) is phosphorylated, interacts with adapter proteins and induces downstream signalling from the ER.

18355413	20080322	Are fish oil omega-3 long-chain fatty acids and their derivatives peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists?	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARalpha, PPARgamma, and PPARdelta) are physiological sensors for glucose and lipid homeostasis. They are also the targets of synthetic drugs; such as fibrates as PPARalpha agonists which lower lipid level, and glitazones as PPARgamma agonists which lower glucose level. As diabetes and metabolic diseases are often associated with high blood glucose and lipid levels, drugs that activate both PPARalpha/gamma would be a logical approach. But synthetically developed PPARalpha/gamma dual agonists and glitazones are showing side effects such as weight gain and edema. Therefore, natural compounds and their close derivatives are focused as future drugs against metabolic diseases. Docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, which are the fatty acids abundant in fish oil, are traditionally used against metabolic diseases. These fatty acids act as PPAR agonists that transcript the genes involved in glucose and lipid homeostasis. Present hypothesis suggests that the derivatives of these fatty acids are stronger PPAR agonists than the parent compounds. X-ray structures of PPARs indicate that alpha or beta derivatives of fatty acids would fit into PPARalpha/gamma binding cavity. Therefore, the derivatives will exhibit stronger affinities and activities than the parent compounds. Ligand binding assays and gene transactivation assays should be performed to test the hypothesis. Fluorescence-based methods are advantageous in binding assays, because they were found more suitable for fatty acid binding assays. In transactivation assays, care should be taken to remove contaminants from recombinant proteins. Present hypothesis is framed on the basis of molecular structure of natural PPAR agonists. Small structural changes in the molecular structure of fatty acids have a great influence on activating different PPARs. Therefore, this hypothesis bridges the concept of natural PPAR agonists and the use of structural information in designing new drugs against diabetes and metabolic syndrome. The derivatives may also be used as anti-inflammatory and anticancer agents. 	Cardiovasc_Diabetol	D016428
12514343	20030107	Idiopathic synovial osteochondromatosis of the hip: radiographic and MR appearances in 15 patients.	To evaluate the radiographic and MR appearance of idiopathic synovial osteochondromatosis of the hip. Radiographs and MR images of 15 patients with idiopathic synovial osteochondromatosis of the hip were assessed. The former were analysed in terms of the presence of 1) juxta-articular calcified and/ or ossified bodies, 2) osteophytes, 3) bone erosion, 4) juxta-articular osteopenia, and 5) joint space narrowing, while for the latter, analysis focused on 1) the configuration of intra-articular bodies, 2) bone erosion, 3) synovial thickening, 4) conglomeration of intra-articular bodies, and 5) extra-articular extension. At hip radiography, juxta-articular calcified and/ or ossified bodies were seen in 12 of the 15 patients (80%), bone erosion in eight (53%), osteophytes in seven (47%), juxta-articular osteopenia in five (33%) and joint space narrowing in five (33%). In eight patients (53%), MR imaging depicted intra-articular bodies of focal low signal intensity at all pulse sequences, and areas of isointensity at T1WI and hyperintensity at T2WI. In three (20%), intra-articular bodies of focal low signal intensity and areas of hyperintensity at all pulse sequences were observed, with areas of iso-intensity at T1WI and hyperintensity at T2WI, while in four (27%), intra-articular bodies of only focal low signal intensity at all pulse sequences were apparent. Synovial thickening was present in 13 patients (87%), bone erosion in 11 (73%), conglomeration of the intra-articular bodies in 11 (73%), and an extra-articular herniation sac in six (40%). The most common radiographic finding of synovial osteochondromatosis of the hip was the presence of juxta-articular calcified and/ or ossified bodies. MR imaging depicted intra-articular bodies of focal low signal intensity at all pulse sequences, with areas of iso-intensity at T1WI and hyperintensity at T2WI. In addition, the presence of an extra-articular herniation sac was not uncommon. 	Korean_J_Radiol	D016428
20000479	20091217	Role of signature lysines in the deviant walker a motifs of the ArsA ATPase.	The ArsA ATPase belongs to the P-loop GTPase subgroup within the GTPase superfamily of proteins. Members of this subgroup have a deviant Walker A motif which contains a signature lysine that is predicted to make intermonomer contact with the bound nucleotides and to play a role in ATP hydrolysis. ArsA has two signature lysines located at positions 16 and 335. The role of Lys16 in the A1 half and Lys335 in the A2 half was investigated by altering the lysines individually to alanine, arginine, leucine, methionine, glutamate, and glutamine by site-directed mutagenesis. While Lys16 mutants show similar resistance phenotypes as the wild type, the Lys335 mutants are sensitive to higher concentrations of arsenite. K16Q ArsA shows 70% of wild-type ATPase activity while K335Q ArsA is inactive. ArsA is activated by binding of Sb(III), and both wild-type and mutant ArsAs bind Sb(III) with a 1:1 stoichiometry. Although each ArsA binds nucleotide, the binding affinity decreases in the order wild type &gt; K16Q &gt; K335Q. The results of limited trypsin digestion analysis indicate that both wild type and K16Q adopt a similar conformation during activated catalysis, whereas K335Q adopts a conformation that is resistant to trypsin cleavage. These biochemical data along with structural modeling suggest that, although Lys16 is not critical for ATPase activity, Lys335 is involved in intersubunit interaction and activation of ATPase activity in both halves of the protein. Taken together, the results indicate that Lys16 and Lys335, located in the A1 and A2 halves of the protein, have different roles in ArsA catalysis, consistent with our proposal that the nucleotide binding domains in these two halves are functionally nonequivalent.

17551043	20070607	Proposal of six species of moderately thermophilic, acidophilic, endospore-forming bacteria: Alicyclobacillus contaminans sp. nov., Alicyclobacillus fastidiosus sp. nov., Alicyclobacillus kakegawensis sp. nov., Alicyclobacillus macrosporangiidus sp. nov., Alicyclobacillus sacchari sp. nov. and Alicyclobacillus shizuokensis sp. nov.	Moderately thermophilic, acidophilic, spore-forming bacteria (146 strains) were isolated from various beverages and environments. Based on the results of sequence analysis of the hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene, eight of the strains represent novel species of the genus Alicyclobacillus. These strains were designated 3-A191(T), 4-A336(T), 5-A83J(T), 5-A167N, 5-A239-2O-A(T), E-8, RB718(T) and S-TAB(T). Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA and DNA gyrase B subunit (gyrB) nucleotide sequences confirmed that the eight strains belonged to the Alicyclobacillus clade. Cells of the eight strains were Gram-positive or Gram-variable, strictly aerobic and rod-shaped. The strains grew well under acidic and moderately thermal conditions, produced acid from various sugars, contained menaquinone 7 as the major isoprenoid quinone and did not produce guaiacol. omega-Alicyclic fatty acids were the predominant lipid component of strains 4-A336(T), 5-A83J(T), 5-A167N, RB718(T) and S-TAB(T). No omega-alicyclic fatty acids were detected in strains 3-A191(T), 5-A239-2O-A(T) or E-8, but iso- and anteiso-branched fatty acids and small amounts of straight-chain saturated fatty acids were detected instead. According to the DNA-DNA hybridization data and distinct morphological, physiological, chemotaxonomical and genetic traits, the eight strains represent six novel species within the genus Alicyclobacillus, for which the following names are proposed: Alicyclobacillus contaminans sp. nov. (type strain 3-A191(T)=DSM 17975(T)=IAM 15224(T)), Alicyclobacillus fastidiosus sp. nov. (type strain S-TAB(T)=DSM 17978(T)=IAM 15229(T)), Alicyclobacillus kakegawensis sp. nov.

27571165	20160830	Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 is a novel regulator of MYCN in neuroblastoma.	Amplification or overexpression of MYCN is associated with poor prognosis of human neuroblastoma. We have recently defined a MYCN-dependent transcriptional signature, including protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), which identifies a subgroup of patients with high-risk disease. Here we provide several lines of evidence demonstrating PRMT1 as a novel regulator of MYCN and implicating PRMT1 as a potential therapeutic target in neuroblastoma pathogenesis. First, we observed a strong correlation between MYCN and PRMT1 protein levels in primary neuroblastoma tumors. Second, MYCN physically associates with PRMT1 by direct protein-protein interaction. Third, depletion of PRMT1 through siRNA knockdown reduced neuroblastoma cell viability and MYCN expression. Fourth, we showed that PRMT1 regulates MYCN stability and identified MYCN as a novel substrate of PRMT1. Finally, we demonstrated that mutation of putatively methylated arginine R65 to alanine decreased MYCN stability by altering phosphorylation at residues serine 62 and threonine 58. These results provide mechanistic insights into the modulation of MYCN oncoprotein by PRMT1, and suggest that targeting PRMT1 may have a therapeutic impact on MYCN-driven oncogenesis.

23314101	20130115	Analysis of genetic and predisposing factors in Japanese patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.	Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal impairment. Approximately 10% of cases are classified as atypical due to the absence of Shiga toxin-producing bacteria as a trigger. Uncontrolled activation of the complement system plays a role in the pathogenesis of atypical HUS (aHUS). Although many genetic studies on aHUS have been published in recent years, only limited data has been gathered in Asian countries. We analyzed the genetic variants of 6 candidate genes and the gene deletion in complement factor H (CFH) and CFH-related genes, examined the prevalence of CFH autoantibodies and evaluated the genotype-phenotype relationship in 10 Japanese patients with aHUS. We identified 7 causative or potentially causative mutations in CFH (p.R1215Q), C3 (p.R425C, p.S562L, and p.I1157T), membrane cofactor protein (p.Y189D and p.A359V) and thrombomodulin (p.T500M) in 8 out of 10 patients. All 7 of the mutations were heterozygous and four of them were novel. Two patients carried CFH p.R1215Q and 3 other patients carried C3 p.I1157T. One patient had 2 causative mutations in different genes. One patient was a compound heterozygote of the 2 MCP mutations. The patients carrying mutations in CFH or C3 had a high frequency of relapse and a worse prognosis. One patient had CFH autoantibodies. The present study identified the cause of aHUS in 9 out of 10 Japanese patients. Since the phenotype-genotype correlation of aHUS has clinical significance in predicting renal recovery and transplant outcome, a comprehensively accurate assessment of molecular variation would be necessary for the proper management of aHUS patients in Japan.

The initial coordinates of heavy atoms were taken from the structure from the Protein Data Bank archive corresponding to the dark-adapted state of the Ala143 --&gt; Gly mutant of asFP595. Optimization of geometry parameters was performed for all internal coordinates in the QM part composed of the chromophore unit and the side chains of His197, Glu215, and Arg92 as well as for positions of effective fragments constituting the MMpart. The structures corresponding to the anion trans, anion cis, and zwitterion trans moieties were considered among various alternatives for the chromophore unit inside the protein matrix. The QM/MM simulations show that the protein environment provides stabilization for the trans-zwitterion isomer compared to the gas-phase conditions. By using the multiconfigurational CASSCF and the time-dependent density functional theory calculations, we estimated positions of spectral bands corresponding to vertical S(0)-S(1) transitions. The results of simulations support the assumption that the dark state of asFP595 corresponds to the anionic or zwitterionic trans-conformation, while the kindled state corresponds to the anionic cis-conformation.

22340303	20120221	The use of digital photographs for the diagnosis of hand osteoarthritis: the AGES-Reykjavik study.	The objective of the study was to standardize a method using digital photographs to diagnose and grade hand osteoarthritis (HOA), to compare it with radiographs and clinical examination with regard to prevalence and relation to symptoms, and finally to construct a simple shortened version suitable for use in very large studies, where a global estimate may be preferable. High quality photographs with standard distance and hand positioning were analysed for the presence of HOA and subsequently compared with standard radiographs and clinical examination in 381 random participants in the AGES-Reykjavik Study, a large population study. The mean age of the participants was 76 years. Using the photographic method, the most commonly affected joints were the second DIP joints followed by the third DIP joints and second and third PIP joints. Both interobserver (ICC = 0.83) and intraobserver reading agreements (ICC = 0.89) were acceptable. On comparison with radiography and clinical examination, aggregate scores were significantly correlated (R(s) 0.35-0.69), more so in females (R(s) 0.53-0.72) than males. Hand pain in males showed very little association with HOA findings by the three methods but all methods showed a comparable moderate association with hand pain in females. The performance of photography in predicting pain on most days for at least a month in females was comparable to that of radiography and clinical examination (AUC 0.63 p = 0.004). Analysis of intermittent pain yielded similar results for in the DIP and PIP joints (OR 3.2-3.3, p &lt; 0.01), but for the CMC1 joints, both radiography (OR 9.0, p &lt; 0.0001), and clinical examination (OR 9.8, p &lt; 0.0001), had higher predictive odds ratios for pain than photography (OR 3.6, p &lt; 0.0001)., A shortened, rapidly performed form of reading photographs also showed a high degree of correlation with the other methods (R(s) 0.56-0.82). High quality hand photographs can be used to diagnose and grade hand osteoarthritis. The method has the advantage of being inexpensive and easy to perform. By using a slightly simplified method of reading, it appears to be highly suitable for use in large studies. 	BMC_Musculoskelet_Disord	D016428 D016449 D052061 D052060 D013485 D023361
10842287	20000608	Three novel TBX5 mutations in Chinese patients with Holt-Oram syndrome.	Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS) is an autosomal dominant syndrome that comprises upper limb and cardiac defects. The gene responsible for HOS, TBX5, was isolated and many mutations have been identified in HOS patients. We analyzed 11 Chinese HOS patients (7 from three families and 4 sporadic cases) for TBX5 mutation by single strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCPs). Three SSCP changes were detected in two of the three familial cases and one sporadic case. Sequence analysis identified three novel, heterozygous mutations in TBX5: a frameshift mutation caused by one base deletion [C416del] in one family, a mis-sense mutation (Gln49Lys) induced by a base substitution (C145A) in another family, and the other mis-sense mutation (Ile54Thr) by T161C in one sporadic case. The patients with the frameshift mutations had severer clinical manifestations that involved aplasia/hypoplasia of the arm and thumbs, while those with the mis-sense mutations presented with milder anomalies such as absent or hypoplastic thumbs but without arm abnormalities. These observations may support a genotype-phenotype correlation in HOS patients with TBX5 mutation. 	Am._J._Med._Genet.	D016428 D013485
21475449	20110409	Association of cytokine gene polymorphism with susceptibility and clinical types of leprosy.	Both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are implicated in development and prognosis of leprosy so the genetic regulation of such cytokines could play an important role. . This study was planned for testing the association of cytokine gene polymorphisms with susceptibility and clinical types of leprosy among Egyptian cases. This study included 47 cases (29 men, 18 females, mean age = 46.3 years) with leprosy in addition to 98 healthy unrelated controls (52 males, 46 females, mean age = 44.9 years). Cases were recruited from Leprosy Clinics, Delta region of Egypt. Cases were classified into paucibacillary (PB) (n = 17; 10 males, 7 females; mean age 42.6 years) and multibacillary (MB) (n = 29; 19 males, 10 females; mean age 43.9 years). For all cases and controls, DNA was extracted and amplified using polymerase chain reaction with sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP) for detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes, TNF-?-308 (G/A), IL-10-1082(G/A), IL-6-174(G/C) as well as IL-1RaVNTR in intron 2 of the gene. COMPARED TO CONTROLS, ALL CASES HAVE SHOWN INCREASED FREQUENCY OF HOMOZYGOUS GENOTYPES : IL-10-1082 (GG) (Odds ratio 6.6, P &lt;0.05), homozygous TNF-?-308 (GG) (Odds ratio =3.23), and homozygous IL-1Ra (11) (Odds ratio = 3.6, P&lt;0.05) with increased frequency of IL10 G and ILRa 1 alleles (P&lt;0.05). BP subgroup showed increased frequency of homozygous IL-10-1082 (GG) (Odds ratio = 18.6, P&lt;0.05) with increased frequency of IL10 G allele (P&lt;0.05). On the other hand, MB subgroup showed increased frequency of homozygous TNF-?-308 (GG) (Odds ratio = 5.84, P&lt;0.05) and homozygous IL-1Ra (11) (Odds ratio = 4, P&lt;0.05) with increased frequency of IL-1Ra 1 allele (P&lt;0.05). There is predominance for heterozygous IL-6-174 (G/C) polymorphism in all studies patient subgroups as well as controls with no significant difference among them. Genetic polymorphisms related to TNF-?-308 and IL-10-1082 and IL-1Ra may be used as genetic markers for susceptibility and clinical outcome of leprosy among Egyptian cases from the Nile Delta.

26682577	20151220	Angiostrongylus cantonensis cathepsin B-like protease (Ac-cathB-1) is involved in host gut penetration.	Although the global spread of the emerging zoonosis, human angiostrongyliasis, has attracted increasing attention, understanding of specific gene function has been impeded by the inaccessibility of genetic manipulation of the pathogen nematode causing this disease, Angiostrongylus cantonensis. Many parasitic proteases play key roles in host-parasite interactions, but those of A. cantonensis are always expressed as the inactive form in prokaryotic expression systems, thereby impeding functional studies. Hence, a lentiviral system that drives secreted expression of target genes fused to a Myc-His tag was used to obtain recombinant Ac-cathB-1 with biological activity. Although this class of proteases was always reported to function in nutrition and immune evasion in parasitic nematodes, recombinant Ac-cathB-1 was capable of hydrolysis of fibronectin and laminin as well as the extracellular matrix of IEC-6 monolayer, so that the intercellular space of the IEC-6 monolayer increased 5.15 times as compared to the control, while the shape of the adherent cells partly rounded up. This suggests a probable role for this protease in intestinal epithelial penetration. The inhibition of Ac-cathB-1 enzymatic activity with antiserum partly suppressed larval penetration ability in the isolated intestine. Thus, an effective system for heterologous expression of parasite proteases is presented for studying gene function in A. cantonensis; and Ac-cathB-1 was related to larval penetration ability in the host small intestine.

17881652	20070921	Disruption of neurofilament network with aggregation of light neurofilament protein: a common pathway leading to motor neuron degeneration due to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-linked mutations in NFL and HSPB1.	Mutations in neurofilament light (NFL) subunit and small heat-shock protein B1 (HSPB1) cause autosomal-dominant axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2E (CMT2E) and type 2F (CMT2F). Previous studies have shown that CMT mutations in NFL and HSPB1 disrupt NF assembly and cause aggregation of NFL protein. In this study, we investigate the role of aggregation of NFL protein in the neurotoxicity of CMT mutant NFL and CMT mutant HSPB1 in motor neurons. We find that expression of CMT mutant NFL leads to progressive degeneration and loss of neuronal viability of cultured motor neurons. Degenerating motor neurons show fragmentation and loss of neuritic processes associated with disruption of NF network and aggregation of NFL protein. Co-expression of wild-type HSPB1 diminishes aggregation of CMT mutant NFL, induces reversal of CMT mutant NFL aggregates and reduces CMT mutant NFL-induced loss of motor neuron viability. Like CMT mutant NFL, expression of S135F CMT mutant HSPB1 also leads to progressive degeneration of motor neurons with disruption of NF network and aggregation of NFL protein. Further studies show that wild-type and S135F mutant HSPB1 associate with wild-type and CMT mutant NFL and that S135F mutant HSPB1 has dominant effect on disruption of NF assembly and aggregation of NFL protein. Finally, we show that deletion of NFL markedly reduces degeneration and loss of motor neuron viability induced by S135F mutant HSPB1. Together, our data support the view that disruption of NF network with aggregation of NFL is a common triggering event of motor neuron degeneration in CMT2E and CMT2F disease. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.

19478089	20090530	A sonic hedgehog missense mutation associated with holoprosencephaly causes defective binding to GAS1.	Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a common birth defect predominantly affecting the forebrain and face and has been linked to mutations in the sonic hedgehog (SHH) gene. HPE is genetically heterogeneous, and clinical presentation represents a spectrum of phenotypes. We have previously shown that Gas1 encodes a cell-autonomous Hedgehog signaling enhancer. Combining cell surface binding, in vitro activity, and explant culture assays, we provide evidence that SHH contains a previously unknown unique binding surface for its interaction with GAS1 and that this surface is also important for maximal signaling activity. Within this surface, the Asn-115 residue of human SHH has been documented to associate with HPE when mutated to lysine (N115K). We provide evidence that HPE associated with this mutation can be mechanistically explained by a severely reduced binding of SHH to GAS1, and we predict a similar result if a mutation were to occur at Tyr-80. Our data should encourage future searches for mutations in GAS1 as possible modifiers contributing to the wide spectrum of HPE. 	J._Biol._Chem.	D016428
26914876	20160226	New trends in articular cartilage repair.	Damage to the articular cartilage is an important, prevalent, and unsolved clinical issue for the orthopaedic surgeon. This review summarizes innovative basic research approaches that may improve the current understanding of cartilage repair processes and lead to novel therapeutic options. In this regard, new aspects of cartilage tissue engineering with a focus on the choice of the best-suited cell source are presented. The importance of non-destructive cartilage imaging is highlighted with the recent availability of adapted experimental tools such as Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) imaging. Novel insights into cartilage pathophysiology based on the involvement of the infrapatellar fat pad in osteoarthritis are also described. Also, recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors are discussed as clinically adapted, efficient tools for potential gene-based medicines in a variety of articular cartilage disorders. Taken as a whole, such advances in basic research in diverse fields of articular cartilage repair may lead to the development of improved therapies in the clinics for an improved, effective treatment of cartilage lesions in a close future.

7781265	19950601	Phenotyping and genotyping of S-mephenytoin hydroxylase (cytochrome P450 2C19) in a Shona population of Zimbabwe.	The S-mephenytoin hydroxylase has recently been identified as cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19). This enzyme metabolizes mephenytoin, diazepam, omeprazole, and citalopram and has been shown to be polymorphically distributed. One clinical implication of CYP2C19-dependent drug metabolism for persons who reside in tropical regions is in the use of the antimalarial drug chloroguanide hydrochloride, which is apparently biotransformed to its active metabolite by this isozyme. In this investigation we studied mephenytoin metabolism in 103 black Zimbabwean Shona subjects. Four were identified as poor metabolizers (4%). This prevalence is comparable to that in white subjects (2% to 5%) but lower than the 15% to 20% incidence of poor metabolizers among Oriental subjects. Of the subjects phenotyped, 84 were genotyped for the G--&gt;A mutation in exon 5 of CYP2C19, which creates a cryptic splice site, causing the production of a nonfunctional protein. Three of the four poor metabolizers were homozygous for this mutation, whereas the fourth one was heterozygous. The G--&gt;A mutation has been shown to predict the incidence more than 60% of poor metabolizers among white subjects and Japanese subjects, and in the current investigation we also obtained a similar relationship in the black population.

16142859	20050906	Anemia in rheumatoid arthritis: association with polymorphism in the tumor necrosis factor receptor I and II genes.	To investigate whether polymorphisms in the tumor necrosis factor receptor I (TNFRSF1A) and receptor II (TNFRSF1B) genes are associated with the anemia observed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We studied a group of Caucasian patients (n = 160) with established RA on whom longitudinal data of hemoglobin (Hb) levels over 5 years were recorded. A second group of patients (n = 102) with early RA was used for a confirmation study. Polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was used to genotype patients for the A36G polymorphism in the TNFRSF1A gene, and the T676G polymorphism in TNFRSF1B. Serum levels of ferritin were determined by ELISA and used to differentiate between iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance and logistic regression analysis. The TNFRSF1A GG genotype was associated with lower 5-year mean area under the curve Hb levels compared with other genotypes (p = 0.01). Analysis of anemic status showed an increased frequency of anemia in patients carrying a G allele, with the highest frequency in GG homozygotes. The TNFRSF1A GG genotype was significantly associated with IDA in established RA (OR 4.3, p = 0.01), and this was confirmed in a group of patients with early RA (OR 4.8, p = 0.04). Analysis of the combined groups also showed a weak association of the G allele with ACD (OR 2.2, p = 0.04). No association was found between TNFRSF1B variants and anemia when the cohorts were analyzed separately, but an association between carriage of the T allele and ACD was found when the 2 groups were combined (OR 11.5, p = 0.01). Our data suggest that polymorphisms within the TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B genes are associated with IDA and/or ACD in patients with RA. 	J._Rheumatol.	D003160 D016428 D013485
20333191	20100325	Exploring repetitive DNA landscapes using REPCLASS, a tool that automates the classification of transposable elements in eukaryotic genomes.	Eukaryotic genomes contain large amount of repetitive DNA, most of which is derived from transposable elements (TEs). Progress has been made to develop computational tools for ab initio identification of repeat families, but there is an urgent need to develop tools to automate the annotation of TEs in genome sequences. Here we introduce REPCLASS, a tool that automates the classification of TE sequences. Using control repeat libraries, we show that the program can classify accurately virtually any known TE types. Combining REPCLASS to ab initio repeat finding in the genomes of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster allowed us to recover the contrasting TE landscape characteristic of these species. Unexpectedly, REPCLASS also uncovered several novel TE families in both genomes, augmenting the TE repertoire of these model species. When applied to the genomes of distant Caenorhabditis and Drosophila species, the approach revealed a remarkable conservation of TE composition profile within each genus, despite substantial interspecific covariations in genome size and in the number of TEs and TE families. Lastly, we applied REPCLASS to analyze 10 fungal genomes from a wide taxonomic range, most of which have not been analyzed for TE content previously. The results showed that TE diversity varies widely across the fungi &quot;kingdom&quot; and appears to positively correlate with genome size, in particular for DNA transposons. Together, these data validate REPCLASS as a powerful tool to explore the repetitive DNA landscapes of eukaryotes and to shed light onto the evolutionary forces shaping TE diversity and genome architecture.

25510197	20141217	Dopamine and cognitive control: sex-by-genotype interactions influence the capacity to switch attention.	Cognitive performance in healthy persons varies widely between individuals. Sex differences in cognition are well reported, and there is an emerging body of evidence suggesting that the relationship between dopaminergic neurotransmission, implicated in many cognitive functions, is modulated by sex. Here, we examine the influence of sex and genetic variations along the dopaminergic pathway on aspects of cognitive control. A total of 415 healthy individuals, selected from an international consortium linked to Brain Research and Integrative Neuroscience Network (BRAINnet), were genotyped for two common and functional genetic variations of dopamine regulating genes: the catechol-O-methyltransferase [COMT] gene (rs4680) and the dopamine receptor D2 [DRD2] gene (rs6277). Cognitive measures were selected to explore sustained attention (using a continuous performance task), switching of attention (using a Trails B adaptation) and working memory (a visual computerised adaptation of digit span). While there were no main effects for genotype across any tasks, analyses revealed significant sex by genotype interactions for the capacity to switch attention. In relation to COMT, superior performance was noted in females with the Val/Val genotype and for DRD2, superior performance was seen for TT females and CC males. These findings highlight the importance of considering genetic variation in baseline dopamine levels in addition to sex, when considering the impact of dopamine on cognition in healthy populations. These findings also have important implications for the many neuropsychiatric disorders that implicate dopamine, cognitive changes and sex differences. 	Behav._Brain_Res.	D016428 D013485
22146392	20111208	The evolution of sensory divergence in the context of limited gene flow in the bumblebee bat.	The sensory drive theory of speciation predicts that populations of the same species inhabiting different environments can differ in sensory traits, and that this sensory difference can ultimately drive speciation. However, even in the best-known examples of sensory ecology driven speciation, it is uncertain whether the variation in sensory traits is the cause or the consequence of a reduction in levels of gene flow. Here we show strong genetic differentiation, no gene flow and large echolocation differences between the allopatric Myanmar and Thai populations of the world's smallest mammal, Craseonycteris thonglongyai, and suggest that geographic isolation most likely preceded sensory divergence. Within the geographically continuous Thai population, we show that geographic distance has a primary role in limiting gene flow rather than echolocation divergence. In line with sensory-driven speciation models, we suggest that in C. thonglongyai, limited gene flow creates the suitable conditions that favour the evolution of sensory divergence via local adaptation.

25371775	20141106	Nonalcoholic Fatty liver disease: pathogenesis and therapeutics from a mitochondria-centric perspective.	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) describes a spectrum of disorders characterized by the accumulation of triglycerides within the liver. The global prevalence of NAFLD has been increasing as the obesity epidemic shows no sign of relenting. Mitochondria play a central role in hepatic lipid metabolism and also are affected by upstream signaling pathways involved in hepatic metabolism. This review will focus on the role of mitochondria in the pathophysiology of NAFLD and touch on some of the therapeutic approaches targeting mitochondria as well as metabolically important signaling pathways. Mitochondria are able to adapt to lipid accumulation in hepatocytes by increasing rates of beta-oxidation; however increased substrate delivery to the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) leads to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and eventually ETC dysfunction. Decreased ETC function combined with increased rates of fatty acid beta-oxidation leads to the accumulation of incomplete products of beta-oxidation, which combined with increased levels of ROS contribute to insulin resistance. Several related signaling pathways, nuclear receptors, and transcription factors also regulate hepatic lipid metabolism, many of which are redox sensitive and regulated by ROS.

26530702	20151105	Time series analysis of reported cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease from 2010 to 2013 in Wuhan, China.	Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is an infectious disease caused by a group of enteroviruses, including Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) and Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71). In recent decades, Asian countries have experienced frequent and widespread HFMD outbreaks, with deaths predominantly among children. In several Asian countries, epidemics usually peak in the late spring/early summer, with a second small peak in late autumn/early winter. We investigated the possible underlying association between the seasonality of HFMD epidemics and meteorological variables, which could improve our ability to predict HFMD epidemics. We used a time series analysis composed of a spectral analysis based on the maximum entropy method (MEM) in the frequency domain and the nonlinear least squares method in the time domain. The time series analysis was applied to three kinds of monthly time series data collected in Wuhan, China, where high-quality surveillance data for HFMD have been collected: (i) reported cases of HFMD, (ii) reported cases of EV-A71 and CVA16 detected in HFMD patients, and (iii) meteorological variables. In the power spectral densities for HFMD and EV-A71, the dominant spectral lines were observed at frequency positions corresponding to 1-year and 6-month cycles. The optimum least squares fitting (LSF) curves calculated for the 1-year and 6-month cycles reproduced the bimodal cycles that were clearly observed in the HFMD and EV-A71 data. The peak months on the LSF curves for the HFMD data were consistent with those for the EV-A71 data. The risk of infection was relatively high at 10 ?C ? t &lt; 15 ?C (t, temperature [?C]) and 15 ?C???t?&lt; 20 ?C, and peaked at 20 ?C???t?&lt; 25 ?C. In this study, the HFMD infections occurring in Wuhan showed two seasonal peaks, in summer (June) and winter (November or December). The results obtained with a time series analysis suggest that the bimodal seasonal peaks in HFMD epidemics are attributable to EV-A71 epidemics. Our results suggest that controlling the spread of EV-A71 infections when the temperature is approximately 20-25 ?C should be considered to prevent HFMD infections in Wuhan, China. 	BMC_Infect._Dis.

12475991	20021212	The structure of a cold-adapted family 8 xylanase at 1.3 A resolution. Structural adaptations to cold and investgation of the active site.	Enzymes from psychrophilic organisms differ from their mesophilic counterparts in having a lower thermostability and a higher specific activity at low and moderate temperatures. The current consensus is that they have an increased flexibility, enhancing accommodation and transformation of the substrates at low energy costs. Here we describe the structure of the xylanase from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis at 1.3 A resolution. Xylanases are usually grouped into glycosyl hydrolase families 10 and 11, but this enzyme belongs to family 8. The fold differs from that of other known xylanases and can be described as an (alpha/alpha)(6) barrel. Various parameters that may explain the cold-adapted properties were examined and indicated that the protein has a reduced number of salt bridges and an increased exposure of hydrophobic residues. The crystal structures of a complex with xylobiose and of mutant D144N were obtained at 1.2 and 1.5 A resolution, respectively. Analysis of the various substrate binding sites shows that the +3 and -3 subsites are rearranged as compared to those of a family 8 homolog, while the xylobiose complex suggests the existence of a +4 subsite. A decreased acidity of the substrate binding cleft and an increased flexibility of aromatic residues lining the subsites may enhance the rate at which substrate is bound. 	J._Biol._Chem.

22987200	20120919	Enhanced enantioselectivity of a carboxyl esterase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides by directed evolution.	The present work created an esterase variant from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (RspE) with enhanced selectivity in hydrolytic kinetic resolutions by directed evolution. A &quot;model&quot; substrate, methyl mandelate, was introduced in the high-throughput screening procedure. E values of a variant CH (Asn62Cys/Leu145His) for six different esters were 10-83, which were a relative improvement compared to 2-20 for the wild type. Our subsequent crystal structure interpretation and molecular dynamics simulations helped shed light on the source of enantioselectivity modified by directed evolution. Though mutations displayed no &quot;direct&quot; interaction with the substrate, they were hypothesized to strengthen the intramolecular interaction in the catalytic cavity of variant. Conformation analysis revealed that the enhanced enantioselectivity of variant CH for the seven substrates applied in this study was derived from the decrease in size of the substrate binding pocket.

22089615	20111118	Past, present &amp; future scenario of thalassaemic care &amp; control in India.	The first case of thalassaemia, described in a non-Mediterranean person, was from India. Subsequently, cases of thalassaemia were documented in all parts of India. Centres for care of thalassaemics were started in the mid-1970s in Mumbai and Delhi, and then in other cities. The parent's associations, with the help of International Thalassemia Federation, greatly helped in improving the care of thalassaemics. Obtaining blood for transfusion was difficult, but the Indian Red Cross Society and the parent's associations played a crucial role in arranging voluntary donations of blood. Chelation with deferoxamine was used sparingly due to the high cost. The Indian physicians conducted trials with deferiprone, and the drug was first approved and marketed in India. Deferasirox is also now being administered. Studies of physical and pubertal growth documented significant retardation, suggesting that generally patients receive inadequate chelation and transfusions. Bone marrow transplantation is available at a number of centres, and cord blood stem cell storage facilities have been established. Information about mutations in different parts of India is available, and ThalInd, an Indian database has been set up. There is a need to set up preimplantation genetic diagnosis and non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. It is argued that too much emphasis should not be placed on premarital screening. The focus should be on screening pregnant women to yield immediate results in reducing the burden of this disorder. Care of thalassaemia has been included in the 12 th 5-year Plan of the Government of India. Many States now provide blood transfusions and chelation free of cost. Although inadequacies in care of thalassaemia remain, but the outlook is bright, and the stage is set for initiating a control programme in the high risk States. 	Indian_J._Med._Res.	D016428 D016454
20981289	20101029	Adhesion of Pathogenic Bacteria to Food Contact Surfaces: Influence of pH of Culture.	The adhesion of Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Staphylococcus aureus to hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces in cultures with different pHs (6, 7, and 8) was studied. The results indicated that the type of material had no effect on the attachment capacity of microorganisms, while environmental pH influenced the adhesion of A. hydrophila, E. coli, and S. aureus to both solid substrates. The attachment of S. Enteritidis (P &gt; .05) was not affected by the type of substrate or the culture pH, whereas E. coli displayed the weakest affinity for both polystyrene and glass surfaces. No correlation was established between the physicochemical properties of the materials, or the bacterial and the rate of bacterial adhesion, except for S. aureus. Photomicrographs have shown that surfaces were contaminated by small clusters of S. Enteritidis while S. aureus invaded the food contact surfaces in the form of small chains or cell aggregates.

26060748	20150611	Haplotype Frequency of G691S/S904S in the RET Proto-Onco-gene in Patients with Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma.	Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs in both sporadic (75%) and hereditary (25%) forms. The missense mutations of the REarranged during Transfection (RET) proto-oncogene in MTC development have been well demonstrated. The aim of this study was to investigate frequency of G691S/S904S haplotype in MTC patients and their relatives. In this research 293 participants were studied, including 181 patients (102 female, 79 male) and 112 their relatives (58 female, 54 male). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes using the standard Salting Out/Proteinase K method. Nucleotide change detection was performed using PCR and direct DNA sequencing methods. According to DNA sequencing results, 159 individuals (104 patients, 55 relatives) had both G691S (rs1799939) missense mutation in exon11 and S904S (rs1800863) synonymous mutation in exon 15 of RET proto-oncogene. The allele frequency of G691S/S904S haplotype was 21.15% in patients and 10.75% in their relatives. The obtained data showed the frequency of G691S/S904S RET gene haplotype among Iranian MTC patients and their relatives. The G691S and S904S nucleotide changes were in complete linkage disequilibrium, so the results were grouped together and referred to as G691S/S904S haplotype. Further analysis is need to demonstrate the association between this haplotype and MTC development. 	Iran._J._Public_Health	D016428
17476213	20070504	Alp7/TACC is a crucial target in Ran-GTPase-dependent spindle formation in fission yeast.	Microtubules are essential intracellular structures involved in several cellular phenomena, including polarity establishment and chromosome segregation. Because the nuclear envelope persists during mitosis (closed mitosis) in fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), cytoplasmic microtubules must be reorganized into the spindle in the compartmentalized nucleus on mitotic entry. An ideal mechanism might be to take advantage of an evolutionarily conserved microtubule formation system that uses the Ran-GTPase nuclear transport machinery, but no targets of Ran for spindle formation have been identified in yeast. Here we show that a microtubule-associated protein, Alp7, which forms a complex with Alp14, is a target of Ran in yeast for spindle formation. The Ran-deficient pim1 mutant (pim1-F201S) failed to show mitosis-specific nuclear accumulation of Alp7. Moreover, this mutant exhibited compromised spindle formation and early mitotic delay. Importantly, these defects were suppressed by Alp7 that was artificially targeted to the nucleus by a Ran-independent and importin-alpha-mediated system. Thus, Ran targets Alp7-Alp14 to achieve nuclear spindle formation, and might differentiate its targets depending on whether the organism undergoes closed or open mitosis. 	Nature	D016428 D013485
3902841	19851125	Replacement by site-directed mutagenesis indicates a role for histidine 170 in the glutamine amide transfer function of anthranilate synthase.	Anthranilate synthase is a glutamine amidotransferase that catalyzes the first reaction in tryptophan biosynthesis. Conserved amino acid residues likely to be essential for glutamine-dependent activity were identified by alignment of the glutamine amide transfer domains in four different enzymes: anthranilate synthase component II (AS II), p-aminobenzoate synthase component II, GMP synthetase, and carbamoyl-P synthetase. Conserved amino acids were mainly localized in three clusters. A single conserved histidine, AS II His-170, was replaced by tyrosine using site-directed mutagenesis. Glutamine-dependent enzyme activity was undetectable in the Tyr-170 mutant, whereas the NH3-dependent activity was unchanged. Affinity labeling of AS II active site Cys-84 by 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine was used to distinguish whether His-170 has a role in formation or in breakdown of the covalent glutaminyl-Cys-84 intermediate. The data favor the interpretation that His-170 functions as a general base to promote glutaminylation of Cys-84. Reversion analysis was consistent with a proposed role of His-170 in catalysis as opposed to a structural function. These experiments demonstrate the application of combining sequence analyses to identify conserved, possibly functional amino acids, site-directed mutagenesis to replace candidate amino acids, and protein chemistry for analysis of mutationally altered proteins, a regimen that can provide new insights into enzyme function.

19096846	20081220	Hydroxyurea (HU) is effective in reducing JAK2V617F mutated clone size in the peripheral blood of essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) patients.	Ph-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders (Ph(neg)cMPD) are treated according to the estimated vascular risk. The recent discovery of V617F point mutation of the JAK2 kinase, which frequently occurs in these diseases, has not changed their management so far. However, emerging data tend to support a prothrombotic role for the mutation, along with a better response of JAK2V617F mutated patients to hydroxyurea treatment. Our data further support this notion. 	Ann._Hematol.	D016430 D016428
23642306	20130507	Using a new odour-baited device to explore options for luring and killing outdoor-biting malaria vectors: a report on design and field evaluation of the Mosquito Landing Box.	Mosquitoes that bite people outdoors can sustain malaria transmission even where effective indoor interventions such as bednets or indoor residual spraying are already widely used. Outdoor tools may therefore complement current indoor measures and improve control. We developed and evaluated a prototype mosquito control device, the 'Mosquito Landing Box' (MLB), which is baited with human odours and treated with mosquitocidal agents. The findings are used to explore technical options and challenges relevant to luring and killing outdoor-biting malaria vectors in endemic settings. Field experiments were conducted in Tanzania to assess if wild host-seeking mosquitoes 1) visited the MLBs, 2) stayed long or left shortly after arrival at the device, 3) visited the devices at times when humans were also outdoors, and 4) could be killed by contaminants applied on the devices. Odours suctioned from volunteer-occupied tents were also evaluated as a potential low-cost bait, by comparing baited and unbaited MLBs. There were significantly more Anopheles arabiensis, An. funestus, Culex and Mansonia mosquitoes visiting baited MLB than unbaited controls (P?0.028). Increasing sampling frequency from every 120 min to 60 and 30 min led to an increase in vector catches of up to 3.6 fold (P?0.002), indicating that many mosquitoes visited the device but left shortly afterwards. Outdoor host-seeking activity of malaria vectors peaked between 7:30 and 10:30 pm, and between 4:30 and 6:00 am, matching durations when locals were also outdoors. Maximum mortality of mosquitoes visiting MLBs sprayed or painted with formulations of candidate mosquitocidal agent (pirimiphos-methyl) was 51%. Odours from volunteer occupied tents attracted significantly more mosquitoes to MLBs than controls (P&lt;0.001). While odour-baited devices such as the MLBs clearly have potential against outdoor-biting mosquitoes in communities where LLINs are used, candidate contaminants must be those that are effective at ultra-low doses even after short contact periods, since important vector species such as An. arabiensis make only brief visits to such devices. Natural human odours suctioned from occupied dwellings could constitute affordable sources of attractants to supplement odour baits for the devices. The killing agents used should be environmentally safe, long lasting, and have different modes of action (other than pyrethroids as used on LLINs), to curb the risk of physiological insecticide resistance.

19875604	20091031	Association of A1C and fasting plasma glucose levels with diabetic retinopathy prevalence in the U.S. population: Implications for diabetes diagnostic thresholds.	To examine the association of A1C levels and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) with diabetic retinopathy in the U.S. population and to compare the ability of the two glycemic measures to discriminate between people with and without retinopathy. This study included 1,066 individuals aged &gt;or=40 years from the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A1C, FPG, and 45 degrees color digital retinal images were assessed. Retinopathy was defined as a level &gt;or=14 on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study severity scale. We used joinpoint regression to identify linear inflections of prevalence of retinopathy in the association between A1C and FPG. The overall prevalence of retinopathy was 11%, which is appreciably lower than the prevalence in people with diagnosed diabetes (36%). There was a sharp increase in retinopathy prevalence in those with A1C &gt;or=5.5% or FPG &gt;or=5.8 mmol/l. After excluding 144 people using hypoglycemic medication, the change points for the greatest increase in retinopathy prevalence were A1C 5.5% and FPG 7.0 mmol/l. The coefficients of variation were 15.6 for A1C and 28.8 for FPG. Based on the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves, A1C was a stronger discriminator of retinopathy (0.71 [95% CI 0.66-0.76]) than FPG (0.65 [0.60 - 0.70], P for difference = 0.009). The steepest increase in retinopathy prevalence occurs among individuals with A1C &gt;or=5.5% and FPG &gt;or=5.8 mmol/l. A1C discriminates prevalence of retinopathy better than FPG.

21169561	20101221	Role of Pax3 acetylation in the regulation of Hes1 and Neurog2.	Pax3 plays a role in regulating Hes1 and Neurog2 activity and thereby stem cell maintenance and neurogenesis. A mechanism for Pax3 regulation of these two opposing events, during caudal neural tube development, is examined in this study. Pax3 acetylation on C-terminal lysine residues K437 and K475 may be critical for proper regulation of Hes1 and Neurog2. Removal of these lysine residues increased Hes1 but decreased Neurog2 promoter activity. SIRT1 deacetylase may be a key component in regulating Pax3 acetylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that SIRT1 is associated with Hes1 and Neurog2 promoters during murine embryonic caudal neural tube development at E9.5, but not at E12.5. Overexpression of SIRT1 decreased Pax3 acetylation, Neurog2 and Brn3a positive staining. Conversely, siRNA-mediated silencing of SIRT1 increased these factors. These studies suggest that Pax3 acetylation results in decreased Hes1 and increased Neurog2 activity, thereby promoting sensory neuron differentiation. 	Mol._Biol._Cell	D016428 D013485
20689700	20100807	Glucose regulation of thrombospondin and its role in the modulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation.	Smooth muscle cells (SMC) maintained in high glucose are more responsive to IGF-I than those in normal glucose. There is significantly more thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) in extracellular matrix surrounding SMC grown in 25 mM glucose. In this study we investigated 1) the mechanism by which glucose regulates TSP-1 levels and 2) the mechanism by which TS-1 enhances IGF-I signaling. The addition of TSP-1 to primary SMC was sufficient to enhance IGF-I responsiveness in normal glucose. Reducing TSP-1 protein levels inhibited IGF-I signaling in SMC maintained in high glucose. We determined that TSP-1 protected IAP/CD47 from cleavage and thereby facilitated its association with SHP substrate-1 (SHPS-1). We have shown previously that the hyperglycemia induced protection of IAP from cleavage is an important component of the ability of hyperglycemia to enhance IGF-I signaling. Furthermore we determined that TSP-1 also enhanced phosphorylation of the beta3 subunit of the alphaVbeta3 integrin, another molecular event that we have shown are critical for SMC response to IGF-I in high glucose. Our studies also revealed that the difference in the amount of TSP-1 in the two different glucose conditions was due, at least in part, to a difference in the cellular uptake and degradation of TSP-1.

28330168	20170324	Metabolism of waste engine oil by Pseudomonas species.	Two bacterial strains phylogenetically identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains RM1 and SK1 displayed extensive degradation ability on waste engine oil (SAE 40W) in batch cultures. Spectrophotometric analysis revealed the presence of various heavy metals such as lead, chromium and nickel in the waste engine oil. The rate of degradation of waste engine oil by the isolates, for the first 12?days and the last 9?days were 66.3, 31.6 mg?l-1?day-1? and 69.6, 40.0?mg?l-1?day-1for strains RM1 and SK1, respectively. Gas chromatographic (GC) analyses of residual waste engine oil, revealed that 66.58, 89.06?% and 63.40, 90.75?% of the initial concentration of the waste engine oil were degraded by strains RM1 and SK1 within 12 and 21?days. GC fingerprints of the waste engine oil after 12?days of incubation of strains RM1 and SK1 showed total disappearance of C15, C23, C24, C25and C26hydrocarbon fractions as well as drastic reductions of C13, C14, C16and PAHs fractions such as C19-anthracene and C22-pyrene. At the end of 21?days incubation, total disappearance of C17-pristane, C22-pyrene, one of the C19-anthracene and significant reduction of C18-phytane (97.2?%, strain RM1; 95.1?%, strain SK1) fractions were observed. In addition, &lt;10?% of Day 0 values of medium fraction ranges C13, and C16were discernible after 21?days. This study has established the potentials of P. aeruginosa strains RM1 and SK1 in the degradation of aliphatic, aromatic and branched alkane components of waste engine oils. 	3_Biotech	D016428
9565562	19980613	Pre-steady state of reaction of nucleoside diphosphate kinase with anti-HIV nucleotides.	The pre-steady-state reaction of Dictyostelium nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase with dideoxynucleotide triphosphates (ddNTP) and AZT triphosphate was studied by quenching of protein fluorescence after manual mixing or by stopped flow. The fluorescence signal, which is correlated with the phosphorylation state of the catalytic histidine in the enzyme active site, decreases upon ddNTP addition according to a monoexponential time course. The pseudo-first order rate constant was determined for different concentrations of the various ddNTPs and was found to be saturable. The data are compatible with a two-step reaction scheme, where fast association of the enzyme with the dideoxynucleotide is followed by a rate-limiting phosphorylation step. The rate constants and dissociation equilibrium constants determined for each dideoxynucleotide were correlated with the steady-state kinetic parameters measured in the enzymatic assay in the presence of the two substrates. It is shown that ddNTPs and AZT triphosphate are poor substrates for NDP kinase with a rate of phosphate transfer of 0.02 to 3.5 s-1 and a KS of 1-5 mM. The equilibrium dissociation constants for ADP, GDP, ddADP, and ddGDP were also determined by fluorescence titration of a mutant F64W NDP kinase, where the introduction of a tryptophan at the nucleotide binding site provides a direct spectroscopic probe. The lack of the 3'-OH in ddNTP causes a 10-fold increase in KD. Contrary to &quot;natural&quot; NTPs, NDP kinase discriminates between various ddNTPs, with ddGTP the more efficient and ddCTP the least efficient substrate within a range of 100 in kcat values.

22996371	20120922	Inhibition of RelA-Ser536 phosphorylation by a competing peptide reduces mouse liver fibrosis without blocking the innate immune response.	Phosphorylation of the RelA subunit at serine 536 (RelA-P-Ser536) is important for hepatic myofibroblast survival and is mechanistically implicated in liver fibrosis. Here, we show that a cell-permeable competing peptide (P6) functions as a specific targeted inhibitor of RelA-P-Ser536 in vivo and exerts an antifibrogenic effect in two progressive liver disease models, but does not impair hepatic inflammation or innate immune responses after lipopolysaccharide challenge. Using kinase assays and western blotting, we confirm that P6 is a substrate for the inhibitory kappa B kinases (IKKs), IKK? and IKK?, and, in human hepatic myofibroblasts, P6 prevents RelA-P-Ser536, but does not affect IKK activation of I?B?. We demonstrate that RelA-P-Ser536 is a feature of human lung and skin fibroblasts, but not lung epithelial cells, in vitro and is present in sclerotic skin and diseased lungs of patients suffering from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. RelA-P-Ser536 may be a core fibrogenic regulator of fibroblast phenotype. 	Hepatology	D016428 D013485
