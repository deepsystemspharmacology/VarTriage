28067912	20170110	Genome-wide association study identifies distinct genetic contributions to prognosis and susceptibility in Crohn's disease.	For most immune-mediated diseases, the main determinant of patient well-being is not the diagnosis itself but instead the course that the disease takes over time (prognosis). Prognosis may vary substantially between patients for reasons that are poorly understood. Familial studies support a genetic contribution to prognosis, but little evidence has been found for a proposed association between prognosis and the burden of susceptibility variants. To better characterize how genetic variation influences disease prognosis, we performed a within-cases genome-wide association study in two cohorts of patients with Crohn's disease. We identified four genome-wide significant loci, none of which showed any association with disease susceptibility. Conversely, the aggregated effect of all 170 disease susceptibility loci was not associated with disease prognosis. Together, these data suggest that the genetic contribution to prognosis in Crohn's disease is largely independent of the contribution to disease susceptibility and point to a biology of prognosis that could provide new therapeutic opportunities.

28181694	20170210	A Genomewide Association Study Identifies Two Sex-Specific Loci, at SPTB and IZUMO3, Influencing Pediatric Bone Mineral Density at Multiple Skeletal Sites.	Failure to achieve optimal bone mineral accretion during childhood and adolescence results in subsequent suboptimal peak bone mass, contributing to osteoporosis risk later in life. To identify novel genetic factors that influence pediatric bone mass at discrete skeletal sites, we performed a sex-stratified genomewide association study of areal bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the 1/3 distal radius, spine, total hip, and femoral neck in a cohort of 933 healthy European American children. We took forward signals with p?&lt;?5?×?10-5and minor allele frequency (MAF) &gt;5% into an independent cohort of 486 European American children in search of replication. In doing so, we identified five loci that achieved genome wide significance in the combined cohorts (nearest genes: CPED1, IZUMO3, RBFOX1, SPBT, and TBPL2), of which the last four were novel and two were sex-specific (SPTB in females and IZUMO3 in males), with all of them yielding associations that were particularly strong at a specific skeletal site. Annotation of potential regulatory function, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) effects and pathway analyses identified several potential target genes at these associated loci. This study highlights the importance of sex-stratified analyses at discrete skeletal sites during the critical period of bone accrual, and identifies novel loci for further functional follow-up to pinpoint key genes and better understand the regulation of bone development in children. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

28386217	20170408	Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) between Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).	 Objective: The aim of this study was to identify any potential genetic overlap between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). We hypothesized that since these disorders share a sub-phenotype, they may share common risk alleles. In this manuscript, we report the overlap found between these two disorders.Methods:A meta-analysis was conducted between ADHD and OCD, and polygenic risk scores (PRS) were calculated for both disorders. In addition, a protein-protein analysis was completed in order to examine the interactions between proteins;p-values for the protein-protein interaction analysis was calculated using permutation.Conclusion:None of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reached genome wide significance and there was little evidence of genetic overlap between ADHD and OCD.

28163062	20170207	Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies TLL1 Variant Associated With Development of Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Eradication of Hepatitis C Virus Infection.	There is still a risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development after eradication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with antiviral agents. We investigated genetic factors associated with the development of HCC in patients with a sustained virologic response (SVR) to treatment for chronic HCV infection. We obtained genomic DNA from 457 patients in Japan with a SVR to interferon-based treatment for chronic HCV infection from 2007 through 2015. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS), followed by a replication analysis of 79 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an independent set of 486 patients in Japan. The study end point was HCC diagnosis or confirmation of lack of HCC (at follow-up examinations until December 2014 in the GWAS cohort, and until January 2016 in the replication cohort). We collected clinical and laboratory data from all patients. We analyzed expression levels of candidate gene variants in human hepatic stellate cells, rats with steatohepatitis caused by a choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined diet, and a mouse model of liver injury caused by administration of carbon tetrachloride. We also analyzed expression levels in liver tissues of patients with chronic HCV infection with different stages of fibrosis or tumors vs patients without HCV infection (controls). We found a strong association between the SNP rs17047200, located within the intron of the tolloid like 1 gene (TLL1) on chromosome 4, and development of HCC; there was a genome-wide level of significance when the results of the GWAS and replication study were combined (odds ratio, 2.37; P = 2.66 × 10-8). Multivariate analysis showed rs17047200 AT/TT to be an independent risk factor for HCC (hazard ratio, 1.78; P = .008), along with male sex, older age, lower level of albumin, advanced stage of hepatic fibrosis, presence of diabetes, and higher post-treatment level of ?-fetoprotein. Combining the rs17047200 genotype with other factors, we developed prediction models for HCC development in patients with mild or advanced hepatic fibrosis. Levels of TLL1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in human hepatic stellate cells increased with activation. Levels of Tll1 mRNA increased in liver tissues of rodents with hepatic fibrogenesis compared with controls. Levels of TLL1 mRNA increased in liver tissues of patients with progression of fibrosis. Gene expression levels of TLL1 short variants, including isoform 2, were higher in patients with rs17047200 AT/TT. In a GWAS, we identified the association between the SNP rs17047200, within the intron of TLL1, and development of HCC in patients who achieved an SVR to treatment for chronic HCV infection. We found levels of Tll1/TLL1 mRNA to be increased in rodent models of liver injury and liver tissues of patients with fibrosis, compared with controls. We propose that this SNP might affect splicing of TLL1 mRNA, yielding short variants with high catalytic activity that accelerates hepatic fibrogenesis and carcinogenesis. Further studies are needed to determine how rs17047200 affects TLL1 mRNA levels, splicing, and translation, as well as the prevalence of this variant among other patients with HCC. Tests for the TLL1 SNP might be used to identify patients at risk for HCC after an SVR to treatment of HCV infection. 	Gastroenterology	D016428
28165464	20170207	Genome-wide association analysis implicates dysregulation of immunity genes in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.	Several chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) susceptibility loci have been reported; however, much of the heritable risk remains unidentified. Here we perform a meta-analysis of six genome-wide association studies, imputed using a merged reference panel of 1,000 Genomes and UK10K data, totalling 6,200 cases and 17,598 controls after replication. We identify nine risk loci at 1p36.11 (rs34676223, P=5.04 × 10-13), 1q42.13 (rs41271473, P=1.06 × 10-10), 4q24 (rs71597109, P=1.37 × 10-10), 4q35.1 (rs57214277, P=3.69 × 10-8), 6p21.31 (rs3800461, P=1.97 × 10-8), 11q23.2 (rs61904987, P=2.64 × 10-11), 18q21.1 (rs1036935, P=3.27 × 10-8), 19p13.3 (rs7254272, P=4.67 × 10-8) and 22q13.33 (rs140522, P=2.70 × 10-9). These new and established risk loci map to areas of active chromatin and show an over-representation of transcription factor binding for the key determinants of B-cell development and immune response.

28672053	20170704	A genome-wide association study suggests that MAPK14 is associated with diabetic foot ulcers.	Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a devastating complication of diabetes. To identify genetic contributors to the development of DFUs in the presence of peripheral neuropathy in a Scottish cohort with diabetes using a genome-wide association study. A genome-wide association approach was applied. A case was defined as a person with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) who had ever had a foot ulcer (current or previous) in at least one foot, as well as a positive monofilament test result (i.e. evidence of peripheral neuropathy) recorded in their longitudinal e-health records. A control was defined as an individual with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) who has never been recorded as having a foot ulcer in either foot but who had a positive monofilament test result recorded in either foot in their longitudinal e-health records. There were 699 DFU cases and 2695 controls in the Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside Scotland (GoDARTS) dataset. The single-nucleotide polymorphism rs80028505 (Chr6p21·31) in MAPK14 reached genome-wide significance with a lowest P-value of 2·45 × 10-8. The narrow-sense heritability of this phenotype is 0·06. We suggest that MAPK14 is associated with DFUs. 	Br._J._Dermatol.	D016428
28253294	20170303	Adult onset asthma and interaction between genes and active tobacco smoking: The GABRIEL consortium.	Genome-wide association studies have identified novel genetic associations for asthma, but without taking into account the role of active tobacco smoking. This study aimed to identify novel genes that interact with ever active tobacco smoking in adult onset asthma. We performed a genome-wide interaction analysis in six studies participating in the GABRIEL consortium following two meta-analyses approaches based on 1) the overall interaction effect and 2) the genetic effect in subjects with and without smoking exposure. We performed a discovery meta-analysis including 4,057 subjects of European descent and replicated our findings in an independent cohort (LifeLines Cohort Study), including 12,475 subjects. First approach: 50 SNPs were selected based on an overall interaction effect at p&lt;10-4. The most pronounced interaction effect was observed for rs9969775 on chromosome 9 (discovery meta-analysis: ORint = 0.50, p = 7.63*10-5, replication: ORint = 0.65, p = 0.02). Second approach: 35 SNPs were selected based on the overall genetic effect in exposed subjects (p &lt;10-4). The most pronounced genetic effect was observed for rs5011804 on chromosome 12 (discovery meta-analysis ORint = 1.50, p = 1.21*10-4; replication: ORint = 1.40, p = 0.03). Using two genome-wide interaction approaches, we identified novel polymorphisms in non-annotated intergenic regions on chromosomes 9 and 12, that showed suggestive evidence for interaction with active tobacco smoking in the onset of adult asthma.

28265120	20170308	A genome-wide gene-by-trauma interaction study of alcohol misuse in two independent cohorts identifies PRKG1 as a risk locus.	Traumatic life experiences are associated with alcohol use problems, an association that is likely to be moderated by genetic predisposition. To understand these interactions, we conducted a gene-by-environment genome-wide interaction study (GEWIS) of alcohol use problems in two independent samples, the Army STARRS (STARRS, N=16?361) and the Yale-Penn (N=8084) cohorts. Because the two cohorts were assessed using different instruments, we derived separate dimensional alcohol misuse scales and applied a proxy-phenotype study design. In African-American subjects, we identified an interaction of PRKG1 rs1729578 with trauma exposure in the STARRS cohort and replicated its interaction with trauma exposure in the Yale-Penn cohort (discovery-replication meta-analysis: z=5.64, P=1.69 × 10-8). PRKG1 encodes cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase 1, which is involved in learning, memory and circadian rhythm regulation. Considering the loci identified in stage-1 that showed same effect directions in stage-2, the gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed several significant results, including calcium-activated potassium channels (GO:0016286; P=2.30 × 10-5), cognition (GO:0050890; P=1.90 × 10-6), locomotion (GO:0040011; P=6.70 × 10-5) and Stat3 protein regulation (GO:0042517; P=6.4 × 10-5). To our knowledge, this is the largest GEWIS performed in psychiatric genetics, and the first GEWIS examining risk for alcohol misuse. Our results add to a growing body of literature highlighting the dynamic impact of experience on individual genetic risk. 	Mol._Psychiatry	D016428
28533516	20170524	ASD restricted and repetitive behaviors associated at 17q21.33: genes prioritized by expression in fetal brains.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a behaviorally defined condition that manifests in infancy or early childhood as deficits in communication skills and social interactions. Often, restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) accompany this disorder. ASD is polygenic and genetically complex, so we hypothesized that focusing analyses on intermediate core component phenotypes, such as RRBs, can reduce genetic heterogeneity and improve statistical power. Applying this approach, we mined Caucasian genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data from two of the largest ASD family cohorts, the Autism Genetics Resource Exchange and Autism Genome Project (AGP). Of the 12 RRBs measured by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, seven were found to be significantly familial and substantially variable, and hence, were tested for genome-wide association in 3104 ASD-affected children from 2045 families. Using a stringent significance threshold (P&lt;7.1 × 10-9), GWAS in the AGP revealed an association between 'the degree of the repetitive use of objects or interest in parts of objects' and rs2898883 (P&lt;6.8 × 10-9), which resides within the sixth intron of PHB. To identify the candidate target genes of the associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms at that locus, we applied chromosome conformation studies in developing human brains and implicated three additional genes: SLC35B1, CALCOCO2 and DLX3. Gene expression, brain imaging and fetal brain expression quantitative trait locus studies prioritize SLC35B1 and PHB. These analyses indicate that GWAS of single heritable features of genetically complex disorders followed by chromosome conformation studies in relevant tissues can be successful in revealing novel risk genes for single core features of ASD.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 23 May 2017; doi:10.1038/mp.2017.114.

28566273	20170602	An Expanded Genome-Wide Association Study of Type 2 Diabetes in Europeans.	To characterize type 2 diabetes (T2D)-associated variation across the allele frequency spectrum, we conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association data from 26,676 T2D case and 132,532 control subjects of European ancestry after imputation using the 1000 Genomes multiethnic reference panel. Promising association signals were followed up in additional data sets (of 14,545 or 7,397 T2D case and 38,994 or 71,604 control subjects). We identified 13 novel T2D-associated loci (P&lt; 5 × 10-8), including variants near theGLP2R,GIP, andHLA-DQA1genes. Our analysis brought the total number of independent T2D associations to 128 distinct signals at 113 loci. Despite substantially increased sample size and more complete coverage of low-frequency variation, all novel associations were driven by common single nucleotide variants. Credible sets of potentially causal variants were generally larger than those based on imputation with earlier reference panels, consistent with resolution of causal signals to common risk haplotypes. Stratification of T2D-associated loci based on T2D-related quantitative trait associations revealed tissue-specific enrichment of regulatory annotations in pancreatic islet enhancers for loci influencing insulin secretion and in adipocytes, monocytes, and hepatocytes for insulin action-associated loci. These findings highlight the predominant role played by common variants of modest effect and the diversity of biological mechanisms influencing T2D pathophysiology. 	Diabetes	D016428 D052061 D013485
28743860	20170727	Bivariate genome-wide association meta-analysis of pediatric musculoskeletal traits reveals pleiotropic effects at the SREBF1/TOM1L2 locus.	Bone mineral density is known to be a heritable, polygenic trait whereas genetic variants contributing to lean mass variation remain largely unknown. We estimated the shared SNP heritability and performed a bivariate GWAS meta-analysis of total-body lean mass (TB-LM) and total-body less head bone mineral density (TBLH-BMD) regions in 10,414 children. The estimated SNP heritability is 43% (95% CI: 34-52%) for TBLH-BMD, and 39% (95% CI: 30-48%) for TB-LM, with a shared genetic component of 43% (95% CI: 29-56%). We identify variants with pleiotropic effects in eight loci, including seven established bone mineral density loci: WNT4, GALNT3, MEPE, CPED1/WNT16, TNFSF11, RIN3, and PPP6R3/LRP5. Variants in the TOM1L2/SREBF1 locus exert opposing effects TB-LM and TBLH-BMD, and have a stronger association with the former trait. We show that SREBF1 is expressed in murine and human osteoblasts, as well as in human muscle tissue. This is the first bivariate GWAS meta-analysis to demonstrate genetic factors with pleiotropic effects on bone mineral density and lean mass.Bone mineral density and lean skeletal mass are heritable traits. Here, Medina-Gomez and colleagues perform bivariate GWAS analyses of total body lean mass and bone mass density in children, and show genetic loci with pleiotropic effects on both traits.

28394258	20170411	Large-scale genome-wide analysis identifies genetic variants associated with cardiac structure and function.	Understanding the genetic architecture of cardiac structure and function may help to prevent and treat heart disease. This investigation sought to identify common genetic variations associated with inter-individual variability in cardiac structure and function. A GWAS meta-analysis of echocardiographic traits was performed, including 46,533 individuals from 30 studies (EchoGen consortium). The analysis included 16 traits of left ventricular (LV) structure, and systolic and diastolic function. The discovery analysis included 21 cohorts for structural and systolic function traits (n = 32,212) and 17 cohorts for diastolic function traits (n = 21,852). Replication was performed in 5 cohorts (n = 14,321) and 6 cohorts (n = 16,308), respectively. Besides 5 previously reported loci, the combined meta-analysis identified 10 additional genome-wide significant SNPs: rs12541595 near MTSS1 and rs10774625 in ATXN2 for LV end-diastolic internal dimension; rs806322 near KCNRG, rs4765663 in CACNA1C, rs6702619 near PALMD, rs7127129 in TMEM16A, rs11207426 near FGGY, rs17608766 in GOSR2, and rs17696696 in CFDP1 for aortic root diameter; and rs12440869 in IQCH for Doppler transmitral A-wave peak velocity. Findings were in part validated in other cohorts and in GWAS of related disease traits. The genetic loci showed associations with putative signaling pathways, and with gene expression in whole blood, monocytes, and myocardial tissue. The additional genetic loci identified in this large meta-analysis of cardiac structure and function provide insights into the underlying genetic architecture of cardiac structure and warrant follow-up in future functional studies.

28588231	20170608	Genome-wide association study of 1,5-anhydroglucitol identifies novel genetic loci linked to glucose metabolism.	1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) is a biomarker of hyperglycemic excursions associated with diabetic complications. Because of its structural similarity to glucose, genetic studies of 1,5-AG can deliver complementary insights into glucose metabolism. We conducted genome-wide association studies of serum 1,5-AG concentrations in 7,550 European ancestry (EA) and 2,030 African American participants (AA) free of diagnosed diabetes from the ARIC Study. Seven loci in/near EFNA1/SLC50A1, MCM6/LCT, SI, MGAM, MGAM2, SLC5A10, and SLC5A1 showed genome-wide significant associations (P?&lt;?5?×?10-8) among EA participants, five of which were novel. Six of the seven loci were successfully replicated in 8,790 independent EA individuals, and MCM6/LCT and SLC5A10 were also associated among AA. Most of 1,5-AG-associated index SNPs were not associated with the clinical glycemic markers fasting glucose or the  HbA1c, and vice versa. Only the index variant in SLC5A1 showed a significant association with fasting glucose in the expected opposing direction. Products of genes in all 1,5-AG-associated loci have known roles in carbohydrate digestion and enteral or renal glucose transport, suggesting that genetic variants associated with 1,5-AG influence its concentration via effects on glucose metabolism and handling.

28203683	20170217	Identification of unique venous thromboembolism-susceptibility variants in African-Americans.	To identify novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE) in African-Americans (AAs), we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of VTE in AAs using the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, comprised of seven sites each with DNA biobanks (total ~39,200 unique DNA samples) with genome-wide SNP data (imputed to 1000 Genomes Project cosmopolitan reference panel) and linked to electronic health records (EHRs). Using a validated EHR-driven phenotype extraction algorithm, we identified VTE cases and controls and tested for an association between each SNP and VTE using unconditional logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, stroke, site-platform combination and sickle cell risk genotype. Among 393 AA VTE cases and 4,941 AA controls, three intragenic SNPs reached genome-wide significance: LEMD3 rs138916004 (OR=3.2; p=1.3E-08), LY86 rs3804476 (OR=1.8; p=2E-08) and LOC100130298 rs142143628 (OR=4.5; p=4.4E-08); all three SNPs validated using internal cross-validation, parametric bootstrap and meta-analysis methods. LEMD3 rs138916004 and LOC100130298 rs142143628 are only present in Africans (1000G data). LEMD3 showed a significant differential expression in both NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and the Mayo Clinic gene expression data, LOC100130298 showed a significant differential expression only in the GEO expression data, and LY86 showed a significant differential expression only in the Mayo expression data. LEMD3 encodes for an antagonist of TGF-?-induced cell proliferation arrest. LY86 encodes for MD-1 which down-regulates the pro-inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide; LY86 variation was previously associated with VTE in white women; LOC100130298 is a non-coding RNA gene with unknown regulatory activity in gene expression and epigenetics.

27612410	20160911	1</sub>/FVC ratio in never-smokers identifies HHIP and FAM13A.	Although a striking proportion (25% to 45%) of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are never-smokers, most genetic susceptibility studies have not focused on this group exclusively. The aim of this study was to identify common genetic variants associated with FEV1and its ratio to forced vital capacity (FVC) in never-smokers. Genome-wide association studies were performed in 5070 never-smokers of the identification cohort LifeLines, and results (P &lt; 10-5) were verified by using a meta-analysis of the Vlagtwedde-Vlaardingen study and the Rotterdam Study I-III (total n = 1966). Furthermore, we aimed to assess the effects of the replicated variants in more detail by performing genetic risk score, expression quantitative trait loci, and variant*ever-smoking interaction analyses. We identified associations between the FEV1/FVC ratio and 5 common genetic variants in the identification cohort, and 2 of these associations were replicated. The 2 variants annotated to the genes hedgehog interacting protein (HHIP) and family with sequence similarity 13 member A (FAM13A) were shown to have an additive effect on FEV1/FVC levels in the genetic risk score analysis; were associated with gene expression of HHIP and FAM13A in lung tissue, respectively; and were genome-wide significant in a meta-analysis including both identification and 4 verification cohorts (P &lt; 2.19 × 10-7). Finally, we did not identify significant interactions between the variants and ever smoking. Results of the FEV1identification analysis were not replicated. The genes HHIP and FAM13A confer a risk for airway obstruction in general that is not driven exclusively by cigarette smoking, which is the main risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

28073367	20170112	No convincing association between genetic markers and respiratory symptoms: results of a GWA study.	Respiratory symptoms are associated with accelerated lung function decline, and increased hospitalization and mortality rates in the general population. Although several environmental risk factors for respiratory symptoms are known, knowledge on genetic risk factors is lacking. We aim to identify genetic variants associated with respiratory symptoms by genome-wide association (GWA) analyses. We conducted the first GWA study on cough, dyspnea and phlegm among 7,976 participants in the LifeLines I cohort and used the LifeLines II cohort (n?=?5,260) and the Vlagtwedde-Vlaardingen cohort (n?=?1,529) for replication. We identified 50 SNPs that were assessed for replication. Rs16918212, located in the alpha-2-macroglobulin pseudogene 1 (A2MP1), was associated with cough in both the identification (odds ratio (OR)?=?0.72, p?=?5.41?×?10-5) and the meta-analyzed replication cohorts (OR?=?0.83, p?= 0.033). No other significant replicated associations were found. Given that only 1 out of 50 SNPs showed significant replication (i.e. 2%) we conclude that we did not find a convincing association between genetic markers and respiratory symptoms. Since, environmental exposures are important risk factors for respiratory symptoms, the next step is to perform a genome-wide interaction (GWI) study to identify genetic susceptibility loci for respiratory symptoms in interaction with known harmful environmental exposures.

27927641	20161209	Genetic architecture distinguishes systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis from other forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: clinical and therapeutic implications.	Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a heterogeneous group of conditions unified by the presence of chronic childhood arthritis without an identifiable cause. Systemic JIA (sJIA) is a rare form of JIA characterised by systemic inflammation. sJIA is distinguished from other forms of JIA by unique clinical features and treatment responses that are similar to autoinflammatory diseases. However, approximately half of children with sJIA develop destructive, long-standing arthritis that appears similar to other forms of JIA. Using genomic approaches, we sought to gain novel insights into the pathophysiology of sJIA and its relationship with other forms of JIA. We performed a genome-wide association study of 770 children with sJIA collected in nine countries by the International Childhood Arthritis Genetics Consortium. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were tested for association with sJIA. Weighted genetic risk scores were used to compare the genetic architecture of sJIA with other JIA subtypes. The major histocompatibility complex locus and a locus on chromosome 1 each showed association with sJIA exceeding the threshold for genome-wide significance, while 23 other novel loci were suggestive of association with sJIA. Using a combination of genetic and statistical approaches, we found no evidence of shared genetic architecture between sJIA and other common JIA subtypes. The lack of shared genetic risk factors between sJIA and other JIA subtypes supports the hypothesis that sJIA is a unique disease process and argues for a different classification framework. Research to improve sJIA therapy should target its unique genetics and specific pathophysiological pathways. 	Ann._Rheum._Dis.	D016428
28100913	20170120	Genome-wide association study using the ethnicity-specific Japonica array: identification of new susceptibility loci for cold medicine-related Stevens-Johnson syndrome with severe ocular complications.	A genome-wide association study (GWAS) for cold medicine-related Stevens-Johnson syndrome (CM-SJS) with severe ocular complications (SOC) was performed in a Japanese population. A recently developed ethnicity-specific array with genome-wide imputation that was based on the whole-genome sequences of 1070 unrelated Japanese individuals was used. Validation analysis with additional samples from Japanese individuals and replication analysis using samples from Korean individuals identified two new susceptibility loci on chromosomes 15 and 16. This study might suggest the usefulness of GWAS using the ethnicity-specific array and genome-wide imputation based on large-scale whole-genome sequences. Our findings contribute to the understanding of genetic predisposition to CM-SJS with SOC. 	J._Hum._Genet.	D016428
27333618	20160623	Genetic risk variants for membranous nephropathy: extension of and association with other chronic kidney disease aetiologies.	Membranous nephropathy (MN) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 300 000 genotyped variants identified MN-associated loci at HLA-DQA1 and PLA2R1. We used a combined approach of genotype imputation, GWAS, human leucocyte antigen (HLA) imputation and extension to other aetiologies of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to investigate genetic MN risk variants more comprehensively. GWAS using 9 million high-quality imputed genotypes and classical HLA alleles were conducted for 323 MN European-ancestry cases and 345 controls. Additionally, 4960 patients with different CKD aetiologies in the German Chronic Kidney Disease (GCKD) study were genotyped for risk variants at HLA-DQA1 and PLA2R1. In GWAS, lead variants in known loci [rs9272729, HLA-DQA1, odds ratio (OR) = 7.3 per risk allele, P = 5.9 × 10-27and rs17830558, PLA2R1, OR = 2.2, P = 1.9 × 10-8] were significantly associated with MN. No novel signals emerged in GWAS of X-chromosomal variants or in sex-specific analyses. Classical HLA alleles (DRB1*0301-DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 haplotype) were associated with MN but provided little additional information beyond rs9272729. Associations were replicated in 137 GCKD patients with MN (HLA-DQA1: P = 6.4 × 10-24; PLA2R1: P = 5.0 × 10-4). MN risk increased steeply for patients with high-risk genotype combinations (OR &gt; 79). While genetic variation in PLA2R1 exclusively associated with MN across 19 CKD aetiologies, the HLA-DQA1 risk allele was also associated with lupus nephritis (P = 2.8 × 10-6), type 1 diabetic nephropathy (P = 6.9 × 10-5) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (P = 5.1 × 10-5), but not with immunoglobulin A nephropathy. PLA2R1 and HLA-DQA1 are the predominant risk loci for MN detected by GWAS. While HLA-DQA1 risk variants show an association with other CKD aetiologies, PLA2R1 variants are specific to MN.

28800603	20170812	Genetic variants specific to aging-related verbal memory: Insights from GWASs in a population-based cohort.	Verbal memory is typically studied using immediate recall (IR) and delayed recall (DR) scores, although DR is dependent on IR capability. Separating these components may be useful for deciphering the genetic variation in age-related memory abilities. This study was conducted to (a) construct individual trajectories in IR and independent aspects of delayed recall, or residualized-DR (rDR), across older adulthood; and (b) identify genetic markers that contribute to four estimated phenotypes: IR and rDR levels and changes after age 60. A cognitively intact sample (N = 20,650 with 125,164 observations) was drawn from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative study of adults aged 50 and older. Mixed effects regression models were constructed using repeated measures from data collected every two years (1996-2012) to estimate level at age 60 and change in memory post-60 in IR and rDR. Genome-wide association scans (GWAS) were conducted in the genotypic subsample (N = 7,486) using ~1.2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). One SNP (rs2075650) in TOMM40 associated with rDR level at the genome-wide level (p = 5.0x10-08), an effect that replicated in an independent sample from the English Longitudinal Study on Ageing (N = 6,898 with 41,328 observations). Meta-analysis of rDR level confirmed the association (p = 5.0x10-11) and identified two others in TOMM40 (rs71352238 p = 1.0x10-10; rs157582 p = 7.0x10-09), and one in APOE (rs769449 p = 3.1 x10-12). Meta-analysis of IR change identified associations with three of the same SNPs in TOMM40 (rs157582 p = 8.3x10-10; rs71352238 p = 1.9x10-09) and APOE (rs769449 p = 2.2x10-08). Conditional analyses indicate GWAS signals on rDR level were driven by APOE, whereas signals on IR change were driven by TOMM40. Additionally, we found that TOMM40 had effects independent of APOE e4 on both phenotypes. Findings from this first U.S. population-based GWAS study conducted on both age-related immediate and delayed verbal memory merit continued examination in other samples and additional measures of verbal memory.

27997041	20161221	Genetic variation at 16q24.2 is associated with small vessel stroke.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful at identifying associations with stroke and stroke subtypes, but have not yet identified any associations solely with small vessel stroke (SVS). SVS comprises one quarter of all ischemic stroke and is a major manifestation of cerebral small vessel disease, the primary cause of vascular cognitive impairment. Studies across neurological traits have shown that younger-onset cases have an increased genetic burden. We leveraged this increased genetic burden by performing an age-at-onset informed GWAS meta-analysis, including a large younger-onset SVS population, to identify novel associations with stroke. We used a three-stage age-at-onset informed GWAS to identify novel genetic variants associated with stroke. On identifying a novel locus associated with SVS, we assessed its influence on other small vessel disease phenotypes, as well as on messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of nearby genes, and on DNA methylation of nearby CpG sites in whole blood and in the fetal brain. We identified an association with SVS in 4,203 cases and 50,728 controls on chromosome 16q24.2 (odds ratio [OR; 95% confidence interval {CI}]?=?1.16 [1.10-1.22]; p?=?3.2?×?10-9). The lead single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs12445022) was also associated with cerebral white matter hyperintensities (OR [95% CI]?=?1.10 [1.05-1.16]; p?=?5.3?×?10-5; N?=?3,670), but not intracerebral hemorrhage (OR [95% CI]?=?0.97 [0.84-1.12]; p?=?0.71; 1,545 cases, 1,481 controls). rs12445022 is associated with mRNA expression of ZCCHC14 in arterial tissues (p?=?9.4?×?10-7) and DNA methylation at probe cg16596957 in whole blood (p?=?5.3?×?10-6). 16q24.2 is associated with SVS. Associations of the locus with expression of ZCCHC14 and DNA methylation suggest the locus acts through changes to regulatory elements. Ann Neurol 2017;81:383-394. 	Ann._Neurol.	D016428
27770449	20161023	Polymorphic variation in TPMT is the principal determinant of TPMT phenotype: A meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies.	Thiopurine-related hematotoxicity in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and inflammatory bowel diseases has been linked to genetically defined variability in thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity. While gene testing of TPMT is being clinically implemented, it is unclear if additional genetic variation influences TPMT activity with consequences for thiopurine-related toxicity. To examine this possibility, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of red blood cell TPMT activity in 844 Estonian individuals and 245 pediatric ALL cases. Additionally, we correlated genome-wide genotypes to human hepatic TPMT activity in 123 samples. Only genetic variants mapping to chromosome 6, including the TPMT gene region, were significantly associated with TPMT activity (P &lt; 5.0 × 10-8) in each of the three GWAS and a joint meta-analysis of 1,212 cases (top hit P = 1.2 × 10-72). This finding is consistent with TPMT genotype being the primary determinant of TPMT activity, reinforcing the rationale for genetic testing of TPMT alleles in routine clinical practice to individualize mercaptopurine dosage.

28598419	20170610	Genome-wide approach identifies a novel gene-maternal pre-pregnancy BMI interaction on preterm birth.	Preterm birth (PTB) contributes significantly to infant mortality and morbidity with lifelong impact. Few robust genetic factors of PTB have been identified. Such 'missing heritability' may be partly due to gene × environment interactions (G × E), which is largely unexplored. Here we conduct genome-wide G × E analyses of PTB in 1,733 African-American women (698 mothers of PTB; 1,035 of term birth) from the Boston Birth Cohort. We show that maternal COL24A1 variants have a significant genome-wide interaction with maternal pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity on PTB risk, with rs11161721 (PG × E=1.8 × 10-8; empirical PG × E=1.2 × 10-8) as the top hit. This interaction is replicated in African-American mothers (PG × E=0.01) from an independent cohort and in meta-analysis (PG × E=3.6 × 10-9), but is not replicated in Caucasians. In adipose tissue, rs11161721 is significantly associated with altered COL24A1 expression. Our findings may provide new insight into the aetiology of PTB and improve our ability to predict and prevent PTB. 	Nat_Commun	D016428
28073927	20170112	New insights into the genetics of primary open-angle glaucoma based on meta-analyses of intraocular pressure and optic disc characteristics.	Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common optic neuropathy, is a heritable disease. Siblings of POAG cases have a ten-fold increased risk of developing the disease. Intraocular pressure (IOP) and optic nerve head characteristics are used clinically to predict POAG risk. We conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of IOP and optic disc parameters and validated our findings in multiple sets of POAG cases and controls. Using imputation to the 1000 genomes (1000G) reference set, we identified 9 new genomic regions associated with vertical cup-disc ratio (VCDR) and 1 new region associated with IOP. Additionally, we found 5 novel loci for optic nerve cup area and 6 for disc area. Previously it was assumed that genetic variation influenced POAG either through IOP or via changes to the optic nerve head; here we present evidence that some genomic regions affect both IOP and the disc parameters. We characterized the effect of the novel loci through pathway analysis and found that pathways involved are not entirely distinct as assumed so far. Further, we identified a novel association between CDKN1A and POAG. Using a zebrafish model we show that six6b (associated with POAG and optic nerve head variation) alters the expression of cdkn1a. In summary, we have identified several novel genes influencing the major clinical risk predictors of POAG and showed that genetic variation in CDKN1A is important in POAG risk. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.

27915449	20161205	Common variants in CLDN14 are associated with differential excretion of magnesium over calcium in urine.	The nature and importance of genetic factors regulating the differential handling of Ca2+and Mg2+by the renal tubule in the general population are poorly defined. We conducted a genome-wide meta-analysis of urinary magnesium-to-calcium ratio to identify associated common genetic variants. We included 9320 adults of European descent from four genetic isolates and three urban cohorts. Urinary magnesium and calcium concentrations were measured centrally in spot urine, and each study conducted linear regression analysis of urinary magnesium-to-calcium ratio on ~2.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using an additive model. We investigated, in mouse, the renal expression profile of the top candidate gene and its variation upon changes in dietary magnesium. The genome-wide analysis evidenced a top locus (rs172639, p = 1.7 × 10-12), encompassing CLDN14, the gene coding for claudin-14, that was genome-wide significant when using urinary magnesium-to-calcium ratio, but not either one taken separately. In mouse, claudin-14 is expressed in the distal nephron segments specifically handling magnesium, and its expression is regulated by chronic changes in dietary magnesium content. A genome-wide approach identified common variants in the CLDN14 gene exerting a robust influence on the differential excretion of Mg2+over Ca2+in urine. These data highlight the power of urinary electrolyte ratios to unravel genetic determinants of renal tubular function. Coupled with mouse experiments, these results support a major role for claudin-14, a gene associated with kidney stones, in the differential paracellular handling of divalent cations by the renal tubule.

28373160	20170405	Genetic Analysis of Venous Thromboembolism in UK Biobank Identifies the ZFPM2 Locus and Implicates Obesity as a Causal Risk Factor.	UK Biobank is the world's largest repository for phenotypic and genotypic information for individuals of European ancestry. Here, we leverage UK Biobank to understand the inherited basis for venous thromboembolism (VTE), a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality. We identified 3290 VTE cases and 116?868 controls through billing code-based phenotyping. We performed a genome-wide association study for VTE with ?9?000?000 imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We performed a phenome-wide association study for a genetic risk score of 10 VTE-associated variants. To assess whether obesity is a causal factor for VTE, we performed Mendelian randomization analysis using a genetic risk score instrument composed of 68 body mass index-associated variants. The genome-wide association study for VTE replicated previous findings at theF5,F2,ABO,F11, andFGGloci. We identified 1 new locus-ZFPM2rs4602861-at genome-wide significance (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.15;P=4.9×10-10) and a new independent variant at theF2locus (rs3136516; odds ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.13;P=7.60×10-9). In a phenome-wide association study, a 10 single-nucleotide polymorphism VTE genetic risk score was associated with coronary artery disease (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.10 per unit increase in VTE odds;P=1.08×10-9). In a Mendelian randomization analysis, genetically elevated body mass index (a 1 SD increase) was associated with 57% higher risk of VTE (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.97;P=0.003). For common diseases such as VTE, biobanks provide potential to perform genetic discovery, explore the phenotypic consequences for disease-associated variants, and test causal inference.

27519822	20160814	Genome-wide Association for Major Depression Through Age at Onset Stratification: Major Depressive Disorder Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium.	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a disabling mood disorder, and despite a known heritable component, a large meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies revealed no replicable genetic risk variants. Given prior evidence of heterogeneity by age at onset in MDD, we tested whether genome-wide significant risk variants for MDD could be identified in cases subdivided by age at onset. Discovery case-control genome-wide association studies were performed where cases were stratified using increasing/decreasing age-at-onset cutoffs; significant single nucleotide polymorphisms were tested in nine independent replication samples, giving a total sample of 22,158 cases and 133,749 control subjects for subsetting. Polygenic score analysis was used to examine whether differences in shared genetic risk exists between earlier and adult-onset MDD with commonly comorbid disorders of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's disease, and coronary artery disease. We identified one replicated genome-wide significant locus associated with adult-onset (&gt;27 years) MDD (rs7647854, odds ratio: 1.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.11-1.21, p = 5.2 × 10-11). Using polygenic score analyses, we show that earlier-onset MDD is genetically more similar to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder than adult-onset MDD. We demonstrate that using additional phenotype data previously collected by genetic studies to tackle phenotypic heterogeneity in MDD can successfully lead to the discovery of genetic risk factor despite reduced sample size. Furthermore, our results suggest that the genetic susceptibility to MDD differs between adult- and earlier-onset MDD, with earlier-onset cases having a greater genetic overlap with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

28295283	20170316	Novel colon cancer susceptibility variants identified from a genome-wide association study in African Americans.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in ethnic/racial minority populations can help to fine-map previously identified risk regions or discover new risk loci because of the genetic diversity in these populations. We conducted a GWAS of colorectal cancer (CRC) in 6,597 African Americans (1,894 cases and 4,703 controls) (Stage 1) and followed up the most promising markers in a replication set of 2,041 participants of African descent (891 cases and 1,150 controls) (Stage 2). We identified a novel variant, rs56848936 in the gene SYMPK at 19q13.3, associated with colon cancer risk (odds ratio 0.61 for the risk allele G, p?=?2.4?×?10-8). The frequency of the G allele was 0.06 in African Americans, compared to &lt;0.01 in Europeans, Asians and Amerindians in the 1000 Genomes project. In addition, a variant previously identified through fine-mapping in this GWAS in the region 19q13.1, rs7252505, was confirmed to be more strongly associated with CRC in the African American replication set than the variant originally reported in Europeans (rs10411210). The association between rs7252505 and CRC was of borderline significance (p?=?0.05) in a Hispanic population GWAS with 1,611 CRC cases and 4,330 controls. With the three datasets combined, the odds ratio was 0.84 for the risk allele A (95% confidence interval 0.79-0.89, p?=?3.7?×?10-8). This study further highlights the importance of conducting GWAS studies in diverse ancestry populations. 	Int._J._Cancer	D016428 D052060 D052061 D013486 D013485
28540843	20170526	Genome-Wide Significance for PCLO as a Gene for Major Depressive Disorder.	In 2009, the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) for major depressive disorder (MDD) highlighted an association with PCLO locus on chromosome 7, although not reaching genome-wide significance level. In the present study, we revisited the original GWAS after increasing the overall sample size and the number of interrogated SNPs. In an analysis comparing 1,942 cases with lifetime diagnosis of MDD and 4,565 controls, PCLO showed a genome-wide significant association with MDD at SNP (rs2715157, p = 2.91 × 10-8) and gene-based (p = 1.48 × 10-7) level. Our results confirm the potential role of the PCLO gene in MDD, which is worth further replication and functional studies. 	Twin_Res_Hum_Genet	D016428 D052061 D013485
28744025	20170727	Genetic loci associated with an earlier age at onset in multiplex schizophrenia.	An earlier age at onset (AAO) has been associated with greater genetic loadings in schizophrenia. This study aimed to identify modifier loci associated with an earlier AAO of schizophrenia. A genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) was conducted in 94 schizophrenia probands with the earliest AAO and 91 with the latest AAO. Candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were then genotyped in the co-affected siblings and unrelated probands. Multi-SNP genetic risk scores (GRS) composed of the candidate loci were used to distinguish patients with an early or late AAO. The 14-SNP GRS could distinguish the co-affected siblings (n?=?90) of the earliest probands from those (n?=?91) of the latest probands. When 132 patients with an earlier AAO and 158 patients with a later AAO were included, a significant trend in the 14-SNP GRS was detected among those unrelated probands from 4 family groups with the earliest, earlier, later, and latest AAO. The overall effect of the 14 SNPs on an AAO in schizophrenia was verified using co-affected siblings of the GWAS probands and trend effect across unrelated patients. Preliminary network analysis of these loci revealed the involvement of PARK2, a gene intensively reported in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia research. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
28139761	20170201	Genome-Wide Association Study of Polymorphisms Predisposing to Bronchiolitis.	Bronchiolitis is a major cause of hospitalization among infants. Severe bronchiolitis is associated with later asthma, suggesting a common genetic predisposition. Genetic background of bronchiolitis is not well characterized. To identify polymorphisms associated with bronchiolitis, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in which 5,300,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for association in a Finnish-Swedish population of 217 children hospitalized for bronchiolitis and 778 controls. The most promising SNPs (n?=?77) were genotyped in a Dutch replication population of 416 cases and 432 controls. Finally, we used a set of 202 Finnish bronchiolitis cases to further investigate candidate SNPs. We did not detect genome-wide significant associations, but several suggestive association signals (p?&lt;?10-5) were observed in the GWAS. In the replication population, three SNPs were nominally associated (p?&lt;?0.05). Of them, rs269094 was an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for KCND3, previously shown to be associated with occupational asthma. In the additional set of Finnish cases, the association for another SNP (rs9591920) within a noncoding RNA locus was further strengthened. Our results provide a first genome-wide examination of the genetics underlying bronchiolitis. These preliminary findings require further validation in a larger sample size. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
28355232	20170330	A genome-wide trans-ethnic interaction study links the PIGR-FCAMR locus to coronary atherosclerosis via interactions between genetic variants and residential exposure to traffic.	Air pollution is a worldwide contributor to cardiovascular disease mortality and morbidity. Traffic-related air pollution is a widespread environmental exposure and is associated with multiple cardiovascular outcomes such as coronary atherosclerosis, peripheral arterial disease, and myocardial infarction. Despite the recognition of the importance of both genetic and environmental exposures to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, studies of how these two contributors operate jointly are rare. We performed a genome-wide interaction study (GWIS) to examine gene-traffic exposure interactions associated with coronary atherosclerosis. Using race-stratified cohorts of 538 African-Americans (AA) and 1562 European-Americans (EA) from a cardiac catheterization cohort (CATHGEN), we identify gene-by-traffic exposure interactions associated with the number of significantly diseased coronary vessels as a measure of chronic atherosclerosis. We found five suggestive (P&lt;1x10-5) interactions in the AA GWIS, of which two (rs1856746 and rs2791713) replicated in the EA cohort (P &lt; 0.05). Both SNPs are in the PIGR-FCAMR locus and are eQTLs in lymphocytes. The protein products of both PIGR and FCAMR are implicated in inflammatory processes. In the EA GWIS, there were three suggestive interactions; none of these replicated in the AA GWIS. All three were intergenic; the most significant interaction was in a regulatory region associated with SAMSN1, a gene previously associated with atherosclerosis and B cell activation. In conclusion, we have uncovered several novel genes associated with coronary atherosclerosis in individuals chronically exposed to increased ambient concentrations of traffic air pollution. These genes point towards inflammatory pathways that may modify the effects of air pollution on cardiovascular disease risk. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428
28781888	20170808	CLPTM1L</i>locus.	Uveal melanoma, a rare malignant tumor of the eye, is predominantly observed in populations of European ancestry. A genome-wide association study of 259 uveal melanoma patients compared to 401 controls all of European ancestry revealed a candidate locus at chromosome 5p15.33 (region rs421284: OR = 1.7, CI 1.43-2.05). This locus was replicated in an independent set of 276 cases and 184 controls. In addition, risk variants from this region were positively associated with higher expression ofCLPTM1L. In conclusion, theCLPTM1Lregion contains risk alleles for uveal melanoma susceptibility, suggesting thatCLPTM1Lcould play a role in uveal melanoma oncogenesis. 	NPJ_Genom_Med	D016428
28415562	20170419	Genome-wide association study of high-altitude pulmonary edema in a Han Chinese population.	A two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed to identify and analyze genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) in a Han Chinese patient population. In the first stage, DNA samples from 68 patients with recurrent HAPE were scanned using Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 Chips, and allele frequencies were compared to those of 84 HapMap CHB samples to identify candidate SNPs. In the second stage, the 77 identified candidate SNPs were examined in an independent cohort of samples from 199 HAPE patients and 304 controls. Associations between SNPs and HAPE risk were tested using various genetic models. Of the 77 original SNPs, 7 were found to be associated with HAPE susceptibility in the second stage of the study. GO and pathway enrichment analysis of the 7 SNPs revealed 5 adjacent genes involved in various processes, including regulation of nucleoside diphosphate metabolism, thyroid hormone catabolism, and low-density lipoprotein receptor activity. These results suggest the identified SNPs and genes may contribute to the physiopathology of HAPE. 	Oncotarget	D016428
28502801	20170516	Genome-Wide Association Shows that Pigmentation Genes Play a Role in Skin Aging.	Loss of fine skin patterning is a sign of both aging and photoaging. Studies investigating the genetic contribution to skin patterning offer an opportunity to better understand a trait that influences both physical appearance and risk of keratinocyte skin cancer. We undertook a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of a measure of skin pattern (microtopography score) damage in 1,671 twin pairs and 1,745 singletons (N = 5,087) drawn from three independent cohorts. We identified that rs185146 near SLC45A2 is associated with a skin aging trait at genome-wide significance (P = 4.1 × 10-9); to our knowledge this is previously unreported. We also confirm previously identified loci, rs12203592 near IRF4 (P = 8.8 × 10-13) and rs4268748 near MC1R (P = 1.2 × 10-15). At all three loci we highlight putative functionally relevant SNPs. There are a number of red hair/low pigmentation alleles of MC1R; we found that together these MC1R alleles explained 4.1% of variance in skin pattern damage. We also show that skin aging and reported experience of sunburns was proportional to the degree of penetrance for red hair of alleles of MC1R. Our work has uncovered genetic contributions to skin aging and confirmed previous findings, showing that pigmentation is a critical determinant of skin aging. 	J._Invest._Dermatol.

28757204	20170801	Low-Frequency Synonymous Coding Variation in CYP2R1 Has Large Effects on Vitamin D Levels and Risk of Multiple Sclerosis.	Vitamin D insufficiency is common, correctable, and influenced by genetic factors, and it has been associated with risk of several diseases. We sought to identify low-frequency genetic variants that strongly increase the risk of vitamin D insufficiency and tested their effect on risk of multiple sclerosis, a disease influenced by low vitamin D concentrations. We used whole-genome sequencing data from 2,619 individuals through the UK10K program and deep-imputation data from 39,655 individuals genotyped genome-wide. Meta-analysis of the summary statistics from 19 cohorts identified in CYP2R1 the low-frequency (minor allele frequency = 2.5%) synonymous coding variant g.14900931G&gt;A (p.Asp120Asp) (rs117913124[A]), which conferred a large effect on 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels (-0.43 SD of standardized natural log-transformed 25OHD per A allele; p value = 1.5 × 10-88). The effect on 25OHD was four times larger and independent of the effect of a previously described common variant near CYP2R1. By analyzing 8,711 individuals, we showed that heterozygote carriers of this low-frequency variant have an increased risk of vitamin D insufficiency (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.78-2.78, p = 1.26 × 10-12). Individuals carrying one copy of this variant also had increased odds of multiple sclerosis (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.19-1.64, p = 2.63 × 10-5) in a sample of 5,927 case and 5,599 control subjects. In conclusion, we describe a low-frequency CYP2R1 coding variant that exerts the largest effect upon 25OHD levels identified to date in the general European population and implicates vitamin D in the etiology of multiple sclerosis.

27941131	20161213	HORMAD2</i>associated with tonsillectomy.	Inflammation of the tonsils is a normal response to infection, but some individuals experience recurrent, severe tonsillitis and massive hypertrophy of the tonsils in which case surgical removal of the tonsils may be considered. To identify common genetic variants associated with tonsillectomy. We used tonsillectomy information from Danish health registers and carried out a genome-wide association study comprising 1464 patients and 12?019 controls of Northwestern European ancestry, with replication in an independent sample set of 1575 patients and 1367 controls. The variant rs2412971, intronic inHORMAD2at chromosome 22q12.2, was robustly associated with tonsillectomy (OR=1.22; p=1.48×10-9) and is highly correlated with SNPs previously found to be associated with IgA nephropathy, Crohn's disease (CD) and early onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The risk allele for tonsillectomy corresponded to increased risk of IgA nephropathy and decreased risk of CD and IBD. We further performed lookup analyses of the top SNP for outcomes related to tonsillectomy in the combined discovery and replication sample and found that rs2412971 was associated with acute tonsillitis (OR=1.19; p=7.82×10-4), chronic disease of the tonsils (OR=1.19; p=2.32×10-6) and appendectomy (OR=1.18; p=1.13×10-3). We identified and replicated a genetic association at 22q12.2 with tonsillectomy. Further functional investigation is required to illuminate whether the molecular mechanisms underlying the genetic association involve general lymphoid hyper-reaction throughout the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue system.

28232668	20170225	Genome-wide analyses of non-syndromic cleft lip with palate identify 14 novel loci and genetic heterogeneity.	Non-syndromic cleft lip with palate (NSCLP) is the most serious sub-phenotype of non-syndromic orofacial clefts (NSOFC), which are the most common craniofacial birth defects in humans. Here we conduct a GWAS of NSCLP with multiple independent replications, totalling 7,404 NSOFC cases and 16,059 controls from several ethnicities, to identify new NSCLP risk loci, and explore the genetic heterogeneity between sub-phenotypes of NSOFC. We identify 41 SNPs within 26 loci that achieve genome-wide significance, 14 of which are novel (RAD54B, TMEM19, KRT18, WNT9B, GSC/DICER1, PTCH1, RPS26, OFCC1/TFAP2A, TAF1B, FGF10, MSX1, LINC00640, FGFR1 and SPRY1). These 26 loci collectively account for 10.94% of the heritability for NSCLP in Chinese population. We find evidence of genetic heterogeneity between the sub-phenotypes of NSOFC and among different populations. This study substantially increases the number of genetic susceptibility loci for NSCLP and provides important insights into the genetic aetiology of this common craniofacial malformation.

28046027	20170104	Genome-Wide Association Study Reveals Four Loci for Lipid Ratios in the Korean Population and the Constitutional Subgroup.	Circulating lipid ratios are considered predictors of cardiovascular risks and metabolic syndrome, which cause coronary heart diseases. One constitutional type of Korean medicine prone to weight accumulation, the Tae-Eum type, predisposes the consumers to metabolic syndrome, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, etc. Here, we aimed to identify genetic variants for lipid ratios using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and followed replication analysis in Koreans and constitutional subgroups. GWASs in 5,292 individuals of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study and replication analyses in 2,567 subjects of the Korea medicine Data Center were performed to identify genetic variants associated with triglyceride (TG) to HDL cholesterol (HDLC), LDL cholesterol (LDLC) to HDLC, and non-HDLC to HDLC ratios. For subgroup analysis, a computer-based constitution analysis tool was used to categorize the constitutional types of the subjects. In the discovery stage, seven variants in four loci, three variants in three loci, and two variants in one locus were associated with the ratios of log-transformed TG:HDLC (log[TG]:HDLC), LDLC:HDLC, and non-HDLC:HDLC, respectively. The associations of the GWAS variants with lipid ratios were replicated in the validation stage: for the log[TG]:HDLC ratio, rs6589566 near APOA5 and rs4244457 and rs6586891 near LPL; for the LDLC:HDLC ratio, rs4420638 near APOC1 and rs17445774 near C2orf47; and for the non-HDLC:HDLC ratio, rs6589566 near APOA5. Five of these six variants are known to be associated with TG, LDLC, and/or HDLC, but rs17445774 was newly identified to be involved in lipid level changes in this study. Constitutional subgroup analysis revealed effects of variants associated with log[TG]:HDLC and non-HDLC:HDLC ratios in both the Tae-Eum and non-Tae-Eum types, whereas the effect of the LDLC:HDLC ratio-associated variants remained only in the Tae-Eum type. In conclusion, we identified three log[TG]:HDLC ratio-associated variants, two LDLC:HDLC ratio-associated variants, and one non-HDLC:HDLC-associated variant in Koreans and the constitutional subgroups.

28076899	20170112	Genome-Wide Association Analysis Reveals Genetic Heterogeneity of Sjögren's Syndrome According to Ancestry.	The Sjögren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) is an international data registry and biorepository derived from a multisite observational study of participants in whom genotyping was performed on the Omni2.5M platform and who had undergone deep phenotyping using common protocol-directed methods. The aim of this study was to examine the genetic etiology of Sjögren's syndrome (SS) across ancestry and disease subsets. We performed genome-wide association study analyses using SICCA subjects and external controls obtained from dbGaP data sets, one using all participants (1,405 cases, 1,622 SICCA controls, and 3,125 external controls), one using European participants (585, 966, and 580, respectively), and one using Asian participants (460, 224, and 901, respectively) with ancestry adjustments via principal components analyses. We also investigated whether subphenotype distributions differ by ethnicity, and whether this contributes to the heterogeneity of genetic associations. We observed significant associations in established regions of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), IRF5, and STAT4 (P?=?3 × 10-42, P?=?3 × 10-14, and P?=?9 × 10-10, respectively), and several novel suggestive regions (those with 2 or more associations at P?&lt;?1 × 10-5). Two regions have been previously implicated in autoimmune disease: KLRG1 (P?=?6 × 10-7[Asian cluster]) and SH2D2A (P?=?2 × 10-6[all participants]). We observed striking differences between the associations in Europeans and Asians, with high heterogeneity especially in the MHC; representative single-nucleotide polymorphisms from established and suggestive regions had highly significant differences in the allele frequencies in the study populations. We showed that SSA/SSB autoantibody production and the labial salivary gland focus score criteria were associated with the first worldwide principal component, indicative of higher non-European ancestry (P?=?4 × 10-15and P?=?4 × 10-5, respectively), but that subphenotype differences did not explain most of the ancestry differences in genetic associations. Genetic associations with SS differ markedly according to ancestry; however, this is not explained by differences in subphenotypes. 	Arthritis_&amp;_rheumatology_(Hoboken,_N.J.)

28298293	20170317	Discovery and fine-mapping of loci associated with MUFAs through trans-ethnic meta-analysis in Chinese and European populations.	MUFAs are unsaturated FAs with one double bond and are derived from endogenous synthesis and dietary intake. Accumulating evidence has suggested that plasma and erythrocyte MUFA levels are associated with cardiometabolic disorders, including CVD, T2D, and metabolic syndrome (MS). Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified seven loci for plasma and erythrocyte palmitoleic and oleic acid levels in populations of European origin. To identify additional MUFA-associated loci and the potential functional variant at each locus, we performed ethnic-specific GWAS meta-analyses and trans-ethnic meta-analyses in more than 15,000 participants of Chinese and European ancestry. We identified novel genome-wide significant associations for vaccenic acid atFADS1/2andPKD2L1[log10(Bayes factor) ? 8.07] and for gondoic acid atFADS1/2andGCKR[log10(Bayes factor) ? 6.22], and also observed improved fine-mapping resolutions atFADS1/2andGCKRloci. The greatest improvement was observed atGCKR, where the number of variants in the 99% credible set was reduced from 16 (covering 94.8 kb) to 5 (covering 19.6 kb, including a missense variant rs1260326) after trans-ethnic meta-analysis. We also confirmed the previously reported associations ofPKD2L1,FADS1/2,GCKR, andHIF1ANwith palmitoleic acid and ofFADS1/2andLPCAT3with oleic acid in the Chinese-specific GWAS and the trans-ethnic meta-analyses. Pathway-based analyses suggested that the identified loci were in unsaturated FA metabolism and signaling pathways. Our findings provide novel insight into the genetic basis relevant to MUFA metabolism and biology. 	J._Lipid_Res.	D016428 D017418
28084903	20170114	Genetic variants associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough: a genome-wide association study in a Swedish population.	We conducted a genome-wide association study on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough and used our dataset to replicate candidate genes identified in previous studies. A total of 124 patients and 1345 treated controls were genotyped using Illumina arrays. The genome-wide significance level was set to p &lt; 5 × 10-8. We identified nearly genome-wide significant associations in CLASP1, PDE11A, KCNMB2, TGFA, SLC38A6 and MMP16. The strongest association was with rs62151109 in CLASP1 (odds ratio: 3.97; p = 9.44 × 10-8). All top hits except two were located in intronic or noncoding DNA regions. None of the candidate genes were significantly associated in our study. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough is potentially associated with genes that are independent of bradykinin pathways. 	Pharmacogenomics	D016428
28000841	20161222	Genome-wide association scans for idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head in a Korean population.	Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a multifactorial disease and is associated with genetic predisposition, and exposure to certain risk factors. In particular, idiopathic ONFH in twins and the clustering of cases in families have indicated that genetic factors are involved. However, the majority of cases of ONFH are sporadic and various studies have demonstrated that differences in the study design and/or the ethnic groups analyzed leads to different results. The present study performed one of the first genome?wide association studies to identify genetic loci that may increase the risk of idiopathic ONFH. In total, 217 patients with idiopathic ONFH and 217 control samples, without ONFH, were genotyped using Axiom chips. Following quality control, 509,886 single?nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were included in the association analysis to identify genetic variants that may influence susceptibility to idiopathic ONFH. The lowest P?value identified by the current study was for an association with rs220324 (P=3.57x10?7), an SNP that is located near to the uromodulin?like 1 gene region on chromosome 21q22.3, although none of the SNPs reached the traditional genome?wide significance level of 5x10?8. However, the DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C6 (DNAJC6) locus, a region between 65.37 and 65.67 Mb located on chromosome 1p31.3, harbored a cluster of SNPs that were associated with idiopathic ONFH at a significance level of P&lt;1x10?5. Four variants, rs10493374, rs12032616, rs17127529 and rs6679032, with marginal associations were located in and around the DNAJC6 locus and were in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other. In conclusion, the current study did not identify any SNPs that were associated with idiopathic ONFH at a genome?wide significance level, however, the results suggest that future studies should investigate the effects of SNPs in the DNAJC6 gene on the idiopathic ONFH risk.

28090653	20170117	Genome-Wide Study Links PNPLA3 Variant With Elevated Hepatic Transaminase After Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Therapy.	Remission induction therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) includes medications that may cause hepatotoxicity, including asparaginase. We used a genome-wide association study to identify loci associated with elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) levels after induction therapy in children with ALL enrolled on St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) protocols. Germline DNA was genotyped using arrays and exome sequencing. Adjusting for age, body mass index, ancestry, asparaginase preparation, and dosage, the PNPLA3 rs738409 (C&gt;G) I148M variant, previously associated with fatty liver disease risk, had the strongest genetic association with ALT (P = 2.5 × 10-8). The PNPLA3 rs738409 variant explained 3.8% of the variability in ALT, and partly explained race-related differences in ALT. The PNPLA3 rs738409 association was replicated in an independent cohort of 2,285 patients treated on Children's Oncology Group protocol AALL0232 (P = 0.024). This is an example of a pharmacogenetic variant overlapping with a disease risk variant. 	Clin._Pharmacol._Ther.	D016428
27883235	20161125	Genomewide association study of peanut allergy reproduces association with amino acid polymorphisms in HLA-DRB1.	Genetic variants for IgE-mediated peanut allergy are yet to be fully characterized and to date only one genomewide association study (GWAS) has been published. To identify genetic variants associated with challenge-proven peanut allergy. We carried out a GWAS comparing 73 infants with challenge-proven IgE-mediated peanut allergy against 148 non-allergic infants (all ~ 1 year old). We tested a total of 3.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, as well as imputed HLA alleles and amino acids. Replication was assessed by de novo genotyping in a panel of additional 117 cases and 380 controls, and in silico testing in two independent GWAS cohorts. We identified 21 independent associations at P ? 5 × 10-5but were unable to replicate these. The most significant HLA association was the previously reported amino acid variant located at position 71, within the peptide-binding groove of HLA-DRB1 (P = 2 × 10-4). Our study therefore reproduced previous findings for the association between peanut allergy and HLA-DRB1 in this Australian population. Genetic determinants for challenge-proven peanut allergy include alleles at the HLA-DRB1 locus. 	Clin._Exp._Allergy	D016428
28056976	20170107	A novel approach to genome-wide association analysis identifies genetic associations with primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis in Polish patients.	Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are forms of hepatic autoimmunity, and risk for both diseases has a strong genetic component. This study aimed to define the genetic architecture of PBC and PSC within the Polish population. Subjects were 443 women with PBC, 120 patients with PSC, and 934 healthy controls recruited from Gastroenterology Departments in various Polish hospitals. Allelotyping employed a pooled-DNA sample-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach, using Illumina Human Omni2.5-Exome BeadChips and the following novel selection criteria for risk loci: blocks of at least 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in strong linkage disequilibrium, where the distance between each adjacent SNP pair in the block was less than 30 kb, and each SNP was associated with disease at a significance level of P &lt; 0.005. A selected index SNP from each block was validated using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. Nineteen and twenty-one SNPs were verified as associated with PBC and PSC, respectively, by individual genotyping; 19 (10/9, PBC/PSC) SNPs reached a stringent (corrected) significance threshold and a further 21 (9/12, PBC/PSC) reached a nominal level of significance (P &lt; 0.05 with odds ratio (OR) &gt; 1.2 or &lt; 0.83), providing suggestive evidence of association. The SNPs mapped to seven (1p31.3, 3q13, 6p21, 7q32.1, 11q23.3, 17q12, 19q13.33) and one (6p21) chromosome region previously associated with PBC and PSC, respectively. The SNP, rs35730843, mapping to the POLR2G gene promoter (P = 1.2 × 10-5, OR = 0.39) demonstrated the highest effect size, and was protective for PBC, whereas for PSC respective SNPs were: rs13191240 in the intron of ADGRB3 gene (P = 0.0095, OR = 0.2) and rs3822659 (P = 0.0051, OR = 0.236) along with rs9686714 (P = 0.00077, OR = 0.2), both located in the WWC1 gene. Our cost-effective GWAS approach followed by individual genotyping confirmed several previously identified associations and discovered new susceptibility loci associated with PBC and/or PSC in Polish patients. However, further functional studies are warranted to understand the roles of these newly identified variants in the development of the two disorders. 	BMC_Med_Genomics	D016428 D013485
28449029	20170428	A genome-wide association study identifies nucleotide variants at SIGLEC5 and DEFA1A3 as risk loci for periodontitis.	Periodontitis is one of the most common inflammatory diseases, with a prevalence of 11% worldwide for the severe forms and an estimated heritability of 50%. The disease is characterized by destruction of the alveolar bone due to an aberrant host inflammatory response to a dysbiotic oral microbiome. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported several suggestive susceptibility loci. Here, we conducted a GWAS using a German and Dutch case-control sample of aggressive periodontitis (AgP, 896 cases, 7,104 controls), a rare but highly severe and early-onset form of periodontitis, validated the associations in a German sample of severe forms of the more moderate phenotype chronic periodontitis (CP) (993 cases, 1,419 controls). Positive findings were replicated in a Turkish sample of AgP (223 cases, 564 controls). A locus at SIGLEC5 (sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin 5) and a chromosomal region downstream of the DEFA1A3 locus (defensin alpha 1-3) showed association with both disease phenotypes and were associated with periodontitis at a genome-wide significance level in the pooled samples, with P?=?1.09E-08 (rs4284742,-G; OR?=?1.34, 95% CI?=?1.21-1.48) and P?=?5.48E-10 (rs2738058,-T; OR?=?1.28, 95% CI?=?1.18-1.38), respectively. SIGLEC5 is expressed in various myeloid immune cells and classified as an inhibitory receptor with the potential to mediate tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1/-2 dependent signaling. Alpha defensins are antimicrobial peptides with expression in neutrophils and mucosal surfaces and a role in phagocyte-mediated host defense. This study identifies the first shared genetic risk loci of AgP and CP with genome-wide significance and highlights the role of innate and adaptive immunity in the etiology of periodontitis.

27899376	20161201	GWAS of clinically defined gout and subtypes identifies multiple susceptibility loci that include urate transporter genes.	A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of gout and its subtypes was performed to identify novel gout loci, including those that are subtype-specific. Putative causal association signals from a GWAS of 945 clinically defined gout cases and 1213 controls from Japanese males were replicated with 1396 cases and 1268 controls using a custom chip of 1961 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We also first conducted GWASs of gout subtypes. Replication with Caucasian and New Zealand Polynesian samples was done to further validate the loci identified in this study. In addition to the five loci we reported previously, further susceptibility loci were identified at a genome-wide significance level (p&lt;5.0×10-8): urate transporter genes (SLC22A12andSLC17A1) andHIST1H2BF-HIST1H4Efor all gout cases, andNIPAL1andFAM35Afor the renal underexcretion gout subtype. WhileNIPAL1encodes a magnesium transporter, functional analysis did not detect urate transport via NIPAL1, suggesting an indirect association with urate handling. Localisation analysis in the human kidney revealed expression of NIPAL1 and FAM35A mainly in the distal tubules, which suggests the involvement of the distal nephron in urate handling in humans. Clinically ascertained male patients with gout and controls of Caucasian and Polynesian ancestries were also genotyped, andFAM35Awas associated with gout in all cases. A meta-analysis of the three populations revealedFAM35Ato be associated with gout at a genome-wide level of significance (p meta =3.58×10-8). Our findings including novel gout risk loci provide further understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of gout and lead to a novel concept for the therapeutic target of gout/hyperuricaemia.

27611488	20160910	Identification of Four Novel Loci in Asthma in European American and African American Populations.	Despite significant advances in knowledge of the genetic architecture of asthma, specific contributors to the variability in the burden between populations remain uncovered. To identify additional genetic susceptibility factors of asthma in European American and African American populations. A phenotyping algorithm mining electronic medical records was developed and validated to recruit cases with asthma and control subjects from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics network. Genome-wide association analyses were performed in pediatric and adult asthma cases and control subjects with European American and African American ancestry followed by metaanalysis. Nominally significant results were reanalyzed conditioning on allergy status. The validation of the algorithm yielded an average of 95.8% positive predictive values for both cases and control subjects. The algorithm accrued 21,644 subjects (65.83% European American and 34.17% African American). We identified four novel population-specific associations with asthma after metaanalyses: loci 6p21.31, 9p21.2, and 10q21.3 in the European American population, and the PTGES gene in African Americans. TEK at 9p21.2, which encodes TIE2, has been shown to be involved in remodeling the airway wall in asthma, and the association remained significant after conditioning by allergy. PTGES, which encodes the prostaglandin E synthase, has also been linked to asthma, where deficient prostaglandin E2synthesis has been associated with airway remodeling. This study adds to understanding of the genetic architecture of asthma in European Americans and African Americans and reinforces the need to study populations of diverse ethnic backgrounds to identify shared and unique genetic predictors of asthma.

28167095	20170208	Genome-wide interaction study of dust mite allergen on lung function in children with asthma.	Childhood asthma is likely the result of gene-by-environment (G × E) interactions. Dust mite is a known risk factor for asthma morbidity. Yet, there have been no genome-wide G × E studies of dust mite allergen on asthma-related phenotypes. We sought to identify genetic variants whose effects on lung function in children with asthma are modified by the level of dust mite allergen exposure. A genome-wide interaction analysis of dust mite allergen level and lung function was performed in a cohort of Puerto Rican children with asthma (Puerto Rico Genetics of Asthma and Lifestyle [PRGOAL]). Replication was attempted in 2 independent cohorts, the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) and the Genetics of Asthma in Costa Rica Study. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs117902240 showed a significant interaction effect on FEV1with dust mite allergen level in PRGOAL (interaction P = 3.1 × 10-8), and replicated in the same direction in CAMP white children and CAMP Hispanic children (combined interaction P = .0065 for replication cohorts and 7.4 × 10-9for all cohorts). Rs117902240 was positively associated with FEV1in children exposed to low dust mite allergen levels, but negatively associated with FEV1in children exposed to high levels. This SNP is on chromosome 8q24, adjacent to a binding site for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta, a transcription factor that forms part of the IL-17 signaling pathway. None of the SNPs identified for FEV1/forced vital capacity replicated in the independent cohorts. Dust mite allergen exposure modifies the estimated effect of rs117902240 on FEV1in children with asthma. Analysis of existing data suggests that this SNP may have transcription factor regulatory functions. 	J._Allergy_Clin._Immunol.	D016428
27485664	20160804	A meta-analysis of reflux genome-wide association studies in 6750 Northern Europeans from the general population.	Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the regurgitation of gastric acids often accompanied by heartburn, affects up to 20% of the general population. Genetic predisposition is suspected from twin and family studies but gene-hunting efforts have so far been scarce and no conclusive genome-wide study has been reported. We exploited data available from general population samples, and studied self-reported reflux symptoms in relation to genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes. We performed a GWAS meta-analysis of three independent population-based cohorts from Sweden, Finland, and UK. GERD cases (n=2247) and asymptomatic controls (n=4503) were identified using questionnaire-derived symptom data. Upon stringent quality controls, genotype data for more than 2.5M markers were used for association testing. Bioinformatic characterization of genomic regions associated with GERD included gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA), in silico prediction of genetic risk effects on gene expression, and computational analysis of drug-induced gene expression signatures using Connectivity Map (cMap). We identified 30 GERD suggestive risk loci (P?5×10-5), with concordant risk effects in all cohorts, and predicted functional effects on gene expression in relevant tissues. GSEA revealed involvement of GERD risk genes in biological processes associated with the regulation of ion channel and cell adhesion. From cMap analysis, omeprazole had significant effects on GERD risk gene expression, while antituberculosis and anti-inflammatory drugs scored highest among the repurposed compounds. We report a large-scale genetic study of GERD, and highlight genes and pathways that contribute to further our understanding of its pathogenesis and therapeutic opportunities.

28322246	20170322	Genetic correlation between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and schizophrenia.	We have previously shown higher-than-expected rates of schizophrenia in relatives of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), suggesting an aetiological relationship between the diseases. Here, we investigate the genetic relationship between ALS and schizophrenia using genome-wide association study data from over 100,000 unique individuals. Using linkage disequilibrium score regression, we estimate the genetic correlation between ALS and schizophrenia to be 14.3% (7.05-21.6; P=1 × 10-4) with schizophrenia polygenic risk scores explaining up to 0.12% of the variance in ALS (P=8.4 × 10-7). A modest increase in comorbidity of ALS and schizophrenia is expected given these findings (odds ratio 1.08-1.26) but this would require very large studies to observe epidemiologically. We identify five potential novel ALS-associated loci using conditional false discovery rate analysis. It is likely that shared neurobiological mechanisms between these two disorders will engender novel hypotheses in future preclinical and clinical studies. 	Nat_Commun	D016428
28112199	20170124	Genome-wide association analysis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma identifies pleiotropic risk loci.	B-cell malignancies (BCM) originate from the same cell of origin, but at different maturation stages and have distinct clinical phenotypes. Although genetic risk variants for individual BCMs have been identified, an agnostic, genome-wide search for shared genetic susceptibility has not been performed. We explored genome-wide association studies of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL, N?=?1,842), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL, N?=?1,465) and multiple myeloma (MM, N?=?3,790). We identified a novel pleiotropic risk locus at 3q22.2 (NCK1, rs11715604, P?=?1.60?×?10-9) with opposing effects between CLL (P?=?1.97?×?10-8) and HL (P?=?3.31?×?10-3). Eight established non-HLA risk loci showed pleiotropic associations. Within the HLA region, Ser37?+?Phe37 in HLA-DRB1 (P?=?1.84?×?10-12) was associated with increased CLL and HL risk (P?=?4.68?×?10-12), and reduced MM risk (P?=?1.12?×?10-2), and Gly70 in HLA-DQB1 (P?=?3.15?×?10-10) showed opposing effects between CLL (P?=?3.52?×?10-3) and HL (P?=?3.41?×?10-9). By integrating eQTL, Hi-C and ChIP-seq data, we show that the pleiotropic risk loci are enriched for B-cell regulatory elements, as well as an over-representation of binding of key B-cell transcription factors. These data identify shared biological pathways influencing the development of CLL, HL and MM. The identification of these risk loci furthers our understanding of the aetiological basis of BCMs. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
28273873	20170310	Interaction between Single Nucleotide Polymorphism and Urinary Sodium, Potassium, and Sodium-Potassium Ratio on the Risk of Hypertension in Korean Adults.	Hypertension is a complex disease explained with diverse factors including environmental factors and genetic factors. The objectives of this study were to determine the interaction effects between gene variants and 24 h estimated urinary sodium and potassium excretion and sodium-potassium excretion ratios on the risk of hypertension. A total of 8839 participants were included in the genome-wide association study (GWAS) to find genetic factors associated with hypertension. Tanaka and Kawasaki formulas were applied to estimate 24 h urinary sodium and potassium excretion. A total of 4414 participants were included in interaction analyses to identify the interaction effects of gene variants according to 24 h estimated urinary factors on the risk of hypertension. CSK rs1378942 and CSK-MIR4513 rs3784789 were significantly modified by urinary sodium-potassium excretion ratio. In addition, MKLN rs1643270 with urinary potassium excretion, LOC101929750 rs7554672 with urinary sodium and potassium excretion, and TENM4 rs10466739 with urinary sodium-potassium excretion ratio showed significant interaction effects. The present study results indicated that the mutant alleles of CSK rs1378942 and CSK-MIR4513 rs3784789 had the strongest protective effects against hypertension in the middle group of 24 h estimated urinary sodium-potassium excretion ratio.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. We performed a genetic association study in 15,256 cases and 47,936 controls, with replication of select top results (P &lt; 5 × 10-6) in 9,498 cases and 9,748 controls. In the combined meta-analysis, we identified 22 loci associated at genome-wide significance, including 13 new associations with COPD. Nine of these 13 loci have been associated with lung function in general population samples, while 4 (EEFSEC, DSP, MTCL1, and SFTPD) are new. We noted two loci shared with pulmonary fibrosis (FAM13A and DSP) but that had opposite risk alleles for COPD. None of our loci overlapped with genome-wide associations for asthma, although one locus has been implicated in joint susceptibility to asthma and obesity. We also identified genetic correlation between COPD and asthma. Our findings highlight new loci associated with COPD, demonstrate the importance of specific loci associated with lung function to COPD, and identify potential regions of genetic overlap between COPD and other respiratory diseases.

28492228	20170512	Association between a common immunoglobulin heavy chain allele and rheumatic heart disease risk in Oceania.	The indigenous populations of the South Pacific experience a high burden of rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Here we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of RHD susceptibility in 2,852 individuals recruited in eight Oceanian countries. Stratifying by ancestry, we analysed genotyped and imputed variants in Melanesians (607 cases and 1,229 controls) before follow-up of suggestive loci in three further ancestral groups: Polynesians, South Asians and Mixed or other populations (totalling 399 cases and 617 controls). We identify a novel susceptibility signal in the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus centring on a haplotype of nonsynonymous variants in the IGHV4-61 gene segment corresponding to the IGHV4-61*02 allele. We show each copy of IGHV4-61*02 is associated with a 1.4-fold increase in the risk of RHD (odds ratio 1.43, 95% confidence intervals 1.27-1.61, P=4.1 × 10-9). These findings provide new insight into the role of germline variation in the IGH locus in disease susceptibility. 	Nat_Commun	D016428
28627999	20170620	Heritability and genome-wide associations studies of cerebral blood flow in the general population.	Cerebral blood flow is an important process for brain functioning and its dysregulation is implicated in multiple neurological disorders. While environmental risk factors have been identified, it remains unclear to what extent the flow is regulated by genetics. Here we performed heritability and genome-wide association analyses of cerebral blood flow in a population-based cohort study. We included 4472 persons free of cortical infarcts who underwent genotyping and phase-contrast magnetic resonance flow imaging (mean age 64.8?±?10.8 years). The flow rate, cross-sectional area of the vessel, and flow velocity through the vessel were measured in the basilar artery and bilateral carotids. We found that the flow rate of the basilar artery is most heritable (h2 (SE)?=?24.1 (9.8), p-value?=?0.0056), and this increased over age. The association studies revealed two significant loci for the right carotid artery area (rs12546630, p-value?=?2.0?×?10-8) and velocity (rs2971609, p-value?=?1.4?×?10-8), with the latter showing a concordant effect in an independent sample (N?=?1350, p-value?=?0.057, meta-analyzed p-value?=?2.5?×?10-9). These loci were also associated with other cerebral blood flow parameters below genome-wide significance, and rs2971609 lies in a known migraine locus. These findings establish that cerebral blood flow is under genetic control with potential relevance for neurological diseases. 	J._Cereb._Blood_Flow_Metab.	D016428
28296344	20170316	Genome-wide analysis identifies an african-specific variant in SEMA4D associated with body mass index.	The prevalence of obesity varies between ethnic groups. No genome-wide association study (GWAS) for body mass index (BMI) has been conducted in continental Africans. We performed a GWAS for BMI in 1,570 West Africans (WA). Replication was conducted in independent samples of WA (n?=?1,411) and African Americans (AA) (n?=?9,020). We identified a novel genome-wide significant African-specific locus for BMI (SEMA4D, rs80068415; minor allele frequency?=?0.008, P?=?2.10 × 10-8). This finding was replicated in independent samples of WA (P?=?0.013) and AA (P?=?0.017). Individuals with obesity had higher serum SEMA4D levels compared to those without obesity (P?&lt;?0.0001), and elevated levels of serum SEMA4D were associated with increased obesity risk (OR?=?4.2, P?&lt;?1 × 10-4). The prevalence of obesity was higher in individuals with the CT versus TT genotypes (55.6% vs. 22.9%). A novel variant in SEMA4D was significantly associated with BMI. Carriers of the C allele were 4.6 BMI units heavier than carriers of the T allele (P?=?0.0007). This variant is monomorphic in Europeans and Asians, highlighting the importance of studying diverse populations. While there is evidence for the involvement of SEMA4D in inflammatory processes, this study is the first to implicate SEMA4D in obesity pathophysiology. 	Obesity_(Silver_Spring)	D016428
28696415	20170712	Genome-wide association studies of placebo and duloxetine response in major depressive disorder.	We investigated variants associated with treatment response in depressed patients treated with either the antidepressant duloxetine or placebo using a genome-wide approach. Our sample (N=391) included individuals aged 18-75 years, diagnosed with major depressive disorder and treated with either duloxetine or placebo for up to 8 weeks. We conducted genome-wide associations for treatment response as operationalized by percentage change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score from baseline, as well as mixed models analyses across five time points. In the placebo-treated subsample (N=205), we observed a genome-wide association with rs76767803 (?=0.69, P=1.25 × 10-8) upstream of STAC1. STAC1 rs76767803 was also associated with response using mixed model analysis (?2=3.95; P=0.001). In the duloxetine-treated subsample (N=186), we observed suggestive associations with ZNF385D (rs4261893; ?=-0.46, P=1.55 × 10-5), NCAM1 (rs2303377; ?=0.45, P=1.76 × 10-5) and MLL5 (rs117986340; ?=0.91, P=3.04 × 10-5). Our findings suggest that a variant upstream of STAC1 is associated with placebo response, which might have implications for treatment optimization, clinical trial design and drug development.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 11 July 2017; doi:10.1038/tpj.2017.29.

28093568	20170118	GWAS meta-analysis reveals novel loci and genetic correlates for general cognitive function: a report from the COGENT consortium.	The complex nature of human cognition has resulted in cognitive genomics lagging behind many other fields in terms of gene discovery using genome-wide association study (GWAS) methods. In an attempt to overcome these barriers, the current study utilized GWAS meta-analysis to examine the association of common genetic variation (~8M single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with minor allele frequency ?1%) to general cognitive function in a sample of 35?298 healthy individuals of European ancestry across 24 cohorts in the Cognitive Genomics Consortium (COGENT). In addition, we utilized individual SNP lookups and polygenic score analyses to identify genetic overlap with other relevant neurobehavioral phenotypes. Our primary GWAS meta-analysis identified two novel SNP loci (top SNPs: rs76114856 in the CENPO gene on chromosome 2 and rs6669072 near LOC105378853 on chromosome 1) associated with cognitive performance at the genome-wide significance level (P&lt;5 × 10-8). Gene-based analysis identified an additional three Bonferroni-corrected significant loci at chromosomes 17q21.31, 17p13.1 and 1p13.3. Altogether, common variation across the genome resulted in a conservatively estimated SNP heritability of 21.5% (s.e.=0.01%) for general cognitive function. Integration with prior GWAS of cognitive performance and educational attainment yielded several additional significant loci. Finally, we found robust polygenic correlations between cognitive performance and educational attainment, several psychiatric disorders, birth length/weight and smoking behavior, as well as a novel genetic association to the personality trait of openness. These data provide new insight into the genetics of neurocognitive function with relevance to understanding the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric illness.

27901618	20161201	Genome-Wide Interaction Analysis of Air Pollution Exposure and Childhood Asthma with Functional Follow-up.	The evidence supporting an association between traffic-related air pollution exposure and incident childhood asthma is inconsistent and may depend on genetic factors. To identify gene-environment interaction effects on childhood asthma using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and air pollution exposure. Identified loci were further analyzed at epigenetic and transcriptomic levels. We used land use regression models to estimate individual air pollution exposure (represented by outdoor NO2levels) at the birth address and performed a genome-wide interaction study for doctors' diagnoses of asthma up to 8 years in three European birth cohorts (n?=?1,534) with look-up for interaction in two separate North American cohorts, CHS (Children's Health Study) and CAPPS/SAGE (Canadian Asthma Primary Prevention Study/Study of Asthma, Genetics and Environment) (n?=?1,602 and 186 subjects, respectively). We assessed expression quantitative trait locus effects in human lung specimens and blood, as well as associations among air pollution exposure, methylation, and transcriptomic patterns. In the European cohorts, 186 SNPs had an interaction P?&lt;?1?×?10-4and a look-up evaluation of these disclosed 8 SNPs in 4 loci, with an interaction P?&lt;?0.05 in the large CHS study, but not in CAPPS/SAGE. Three SNPs within adenylate cyclase 2 (ADCY2) showed the same direction of the interaction effect and were found to influence ADCY2 gene expression in peripheral blood (P?=?4.50?×?10-4). One other SNP with P?&lt;?0.05 for interaction in CHS, rs686237, strongly influenced UDP-Gal:betaGlcNAc ?-1,4-galactosyltransferase, polypeptide 5 (B4GALT5) expression in lung tissue (P?=?1.18?×?10-17). Air pollution exposure was associated with differential discs, large homolog 2 (DLG2) methylation and expression. Our results indicated that gene-environment interactions are important for asthma development and provided supportive evidence for interaction with air pollution for ADCY2, B4GALT5, and DLG2.

28224759	20170223	Genomic variants at 20p11 associated with body fat mass in the European population.	Body fat mass (BFM) is more homogeneous and accurate than body total mass in measuring obesity but has rarely been studied. Aiming to uncover the genetic basis of fat-induced obesity, a genome-wide association meta-analysis of BFM, after adjustment by body lean mass, was performed in the European population. Three samples of European ancestry were included in the meta-analysis: the Framingham Heart Study (N?=?6,004), the Kansas City osteoporosis study (N?=?2,207), and the Omaha osteoporosis study (N?=?968). At the genome-wide significance level (??=?5.0×10-8), a cluster of 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at chromosomal region 20p11 that were associated with BFM (lead SNP rs2069126, P?=?1.82×10-9, closest gene SLC24A3) was identified in 9,179 subjects. One of the top SNPs, rs6046308 (P?=?3.74×10-8), was found to be nominally significant for body fat percentage in another independent study (P = 0.03, N?=?75,888) and was reported to transregulate the expression of the MPZ gene at 1q23.3 (unadjusted P?=?9.78×10-6, N?=?1,490). Differential gene expression analysis demonstrated that SLC24A3 and CFAP61 at the identified locus were differentially expressed in tissues of people with versus without obesity (P = 3.40×10-5and 8.72×10-4, N?=?126 and 70), implying their potential role in fat development. These results may provide new insights into the biological mechanism that underlies fat-induced obesity pathology. 	Obesity_(Silver_Spring)	D016428 D017418
27918534	20161206	Multiethnic genome-wide meta-analysis of ectopic fat depots identifies loci associated with adipocyte development and differentiation.	Variation in body fat distribution contributes to the metabolic sequelae of obesity. The genetic determinants of body fat distribution are poorly understood. The goal of this study was to gain new insights into the underlying genetics of body fat distribution by conducting sample-size-weighted fixed-effects genome-wide association meta-analyses in up to 9,594 women and 8,738 men of European, African, Hispanic and Chinese ancestry, with and without sex stratification, for six traits associated with ectopic fat (hereinafter referred to as ectopic-fat traits). In total, we identified seven new loci associated with ectopic-fat traits (ATXN1, UBE2E2, EBF1, RREB1, GSDMB, GRAMD3 and ENSA; P &lt; 5 × 10-8; false discovery rate &lt; 1%). Functional analysis of these genes showed that loss of function of either Atxn1 or Ube2e2 in primary mouse adipose progenitor cells impaired adipocyte differentiation, suggesting physiological roles for ATXN1 and UBE2E2 in adipogenesis. Future studies are necessary to further explore the mechanisms by which these genes affect adipocyte biology and how their perturbations contribute to systemic metabolic disease. 	Nat._Genet.

28319091	20170321	Whole-genome sequencing identifies rare genotypes in COMP and CHADL associated with high risk of hip osteoarthritis.	We performed a genome-wide association study of total hip replacements, based on variants identified through whole-genome sequencing, which included 4,657 Icelandic patients and 207,514 population controls. We discovered two rare signals that strongly associate with osteoarthritis total hip replacement: a missense variant, c.1141G&gt;C (p.Asp369His), in the COMP gene (allelic frequency = 0.026%, P = 4.0 × 10-12, odds ratio (OR) = 16.7) and a frameshift mutation, rs532464664 (p.Val330Glyfs*106), in the CHADL gene that associates through a recessive mode of inheritance (homozygote frequency = 0.15%, P = 4.5 × 10-18, OR = 7.71). On average, c.1141G&gt;C heterozygotes and individuals homozygous for rs532464664 had their hip replacement operation 13.5 years and 4.9 years earlier than others (P = 0.0020 and P = 0.0026), respectively. We show that the full-length CHADL transcript is expressed in cartilage. Furthermore, the premature stop codon introduced by the CHADL frameshift mutation results in nonsense-mediated decay of the mutant transcripts. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428

The pathogenic relevance in Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a decrease of cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-ß42(Aß42) burden and an increase in cerebrospinal fluid total tau (T-tau) levels. In this work, we performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) and genome-wide interaction study of T-tau/Aß42ratio as an AD imaging quantitative trait on 843 subjects and 563,980 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADNI cohort. We aim to identify not only SNPs with significant main effects but also SNPs with interaction effects to help explain &quot;missing heritability&quot;. Linear regression method was used to detect SNP-SNP interactions among SNPs with uncorrected p-value ?0.01 from the GWAS. Age, gender, and diagnosis were considered as covariates in both studies. The GWAS results replicated the previously reported AD-related genes APOE, APOC1, and TOMM40, as well as identified 14 novel genes, which showed genome-wide statistical significance. Genome-wide interaction study revealed 7 pairs of SNPs meeting the cell-size criteria and with bonferroni-corrected p-value ?0.05. As we expect, these interaction pairs all had marginal main effects but explained a relatively high-level variance of T-tau/Aß42, demonstrating their potential association with AD pathology.

28300201	20170317	Identification of a novel locus associated with skin colour in African-admixed populations.	Skin pigmentation is a complex trait that varies largely among populations. Most genome-wide association studies of this trait have been performed in Europeans and Asians. We aimed to uncover genes influencing skin colour in African-admixed individuals. We performed a genome-wide association study of melanin levels in 285 Hispanic/Latino individuals from Puerto Rico, analyzing 14 million genetic variants. A total of 82 variants with p-value ?1?×?10-5were followed up in 373 African Americans. Fourteen single nucleotide polymorphisms were replicated, of which nine were associated with skin colour at genome-wide significance in a meta-analysis across the two studies. These results validated the association of two previously known skin pigmentation genes, SLC24A5 (minimum p?=?2.62?×?10-14, rs1426654) and SLC45A2 (minimum p?=?9.71?×?10-10, rs16891982), and revealed the intergenic region of BEND7 and PRPF18 as a novel locus associated with this trait (minimum p?=?4.58?×?10-9, rs6602666). The most significant variant within this region is common among African-descent populations but not among Europeans or Native Americans. Our findings support the advantages of analyzing African-admixed populations to discover new genes influencing skin pigmentation. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
28421636	20170420	Leveraging cell type specific regulatory regions to detect SNPs associated with tissue factor pathway inhibitor plasma levels.	Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) regulates the formation of intravascular blood clots, which manifest clinically as ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, and venous thromboembolism (VTE). TFPI plasma levels are heritable, but the genetics underlying TFPI plasma level variability are poorly understood. Herein we report the first genome-wide association scan (GWAS) of TFPI plasma levels, conducted in 251 individuals from five extended French-Canadian Families ascertained on VTE. To improve discovery, we also applied a hypothesis-driven (HD) GWAS approach that prioritized single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in (1) hemostasis pathway genes, and (2) vascular endothelial cell (EC) regulatory regions, which are among the highest expressers of TFPI. Our GWAS identified 131 SNPs with suggestive evidence of association (P-value &lt; 5 × 10-8), but no SNPs reached the genome-wide threshold for statistical significance. Hemostasis pathway genes were not enriched for TFPI plasma level associated SNPs (global hypothesis test P-value = 0.147), but EC regulatory regions contained more TFPI plasma level associated SNPs than expected by chance (global hypothesis test P-value = 0.046). We therefore stratified our genome-wide SNPs, prioritizing those in EC regulatory regions via stratified false discovery rate (sFDR) control, and reranked the SNPs by q-value. The minimum q-value was 0.27, and the top-ranked SNPs did not show association evidence in the MARTHA replication sample of 1,033 unrelated VTE cases. Although this study did not result in new loci for TFPI, our work lays out a strategy to utilize epigenomic data in prioritization schemes for future GWAS studies. 	Genet._Epidemiol.	D016428 D013485
28424481	20170421	The first genome-wide association study identifying new susceptibility loci for obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome.	Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is the most important treatable cause of recurrent pregnancy loss. The live birth rate is limited to only 70-80% in patients with APS undergoing established anticoagulant therapy. Lupus anticoagulant (LA), but not anticardiolipin antibody (aCL), was found to predict adverse pregnancy outcome. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of APS focusing on aCL have shown that several molecules may be involved. This is the first GWAS for obstetric APS focusing on LA. A GWAS was performed to compare 115 Japanese patients with obstetric APS, diagnosed according to criteria of the International Congress on APS, and 419 healthy individuals. Allele or genotype frequencies were compared in a total of 426?344 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Imputation analyses were also performed for the candidate regions detected by the GWAS. One SNP (rs2288493) located on the 3'-UTR of TSHR showed an experiment-wide significant APS association (P=7.85E-08, OR=6.18) under a recessive model after Bonferroni correction considering the number of analyzed SNPs. Another SNP (rs79154414) located around the C1D showed a genome-wide significant APS association (P=4.84E-08, OR=6.20) under an allelic model after applying the SNP imputation. Our findings demonstrate that a specific genotype of TSHR and C1D genes can be a risk factor for obstetric APS. 	J._Hum._Genet.	D016428
28642124	20170624	Identification of genetic variants associated with Huntington's disease progression: a genome-wide association study.	Huntington's disease is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene, HTT. Age at onset has been used as a quantitative phenotype in genetic analysis looking for Huntington's disease modifiers, but is hard to define and not always available. Therefore, we aimed to generate a novel measure of disease progression and to identify genetic markers associated with this progression measure. We generated a progression score on the basis of principal component analysis of prospectively acquired longitudinal changes in motor, cognitive, and imaging measures in the 218 indivduals in the TRACK-HD cohort of Huntington's disease gene mutation carriers (data collected 2008-11). We generated a parallel progression score using data from 1773 previously genotyped participants from the European Huntington's Disease Network REGISTRY study of Huntington's disease mutation carriers (data collected 2003-13). We did a genome-wide association analyses in terms of progression for 216 TRACK-HD participants and 1773 REGISTRY participants, then a meta-analysis of these results was undertaken. Longitudinal motor, cognitive, and imaging scores were correlated with each other in TRACK-HD participants, justifying use of a single, cross-domain measure of disease progression in both studies. The TRACK-HD and REGISTRY progression measures were correlated with each other (r=0·674), and with age at onset (TRACK-HD, r=0·315; REGISTRY, r=0·234). The meta-analysis of progression in TRACK-HD and REGISTRY gave a genome-wide significant signal (p=1·12?×?10-10) on chromosome 5 spanning three genes: MSH3, DHFR, and MTRNR2L2. The genes in this locus were associated with progression in TRACK-HD (MSH3 p=2·94?×?10-8DHFR p=8·37?×?10-7MTRNR2L2 p=2·15?×?10-9) and to a lesser extent in REGISTRY (MSH3 p=9·36?×?10-4DHFR p=8·45?×?10-4MTRNR2L2 p=1·20?×?10-3). The lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in TRACK-HD (rs557874766) was genome-wide significant in the meta-analysis (p=1·58?×?10-8), and encodes an aminoacid change (Pro67Ala) in MSH3. In TRACK-HD, each copy of the minor allele at this SNP was associated with a 0·4 units per year (95% CI 0·16-0·66) reduction in the rate of change of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) Total Motor Score, and a reduction of 0·12 units per year (95% CI 0·06-0·18) in the rate of change of UHDRS Total Functional Capacity score. These associations remained significant after adjusting for age of onset. The multidomain progression measure in TRACK-HD was associated with a functional variant that was genome-wide significant in our meta-analysis. The association in only 216 participants implies that the progression measure is a sensitive reflection of disease burden, that the effect size at this locus is large, or both. Knockout of Msh3 reduces somatic expansion in Huntington's disease mouse models, suggesting this mechanism as an area for future therapeutic investigation.

28520984	20170519	Genome-Wide Association Study of Heavy Smoking and Daily/Nondaily Smoking in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL).	Genetic variants associated with nicotine dependence have previously been identified, primarily in European-ancestry populations. No genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been reported for smoking behaviors in Hispanics/Latinos in the United States and Latin America, who are of mixed ancestry with European, African, and American Indigenous components. We examined genetic associations with smoking behaviors in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) (N = 12 741 with smoking data, 5119 ever-smokers), using ~2.3 million genotyped variants imputed to the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3. Mixed logistic regression models accounted for population structure, sampling, relatedness, sex, and age. The known region of CHRNA5, which encodes the ?5 cholinergic nicotinic receptor subunit, was associated with heavy smoking at genome-wide significance (p ? 5 × 10-8) in a comparison of 1929 ever-smokers reporting cigarettes per day (CPD) &gt; 10 versus 3156 reporting CPD ? 10. The functional variant rs16969968 in CHRNA5 had a p value of 2.20 × 10-7 and odds ratio (OR) of 1.32 for the minor allele (A); its minor allele frequency was 0.22 overall and similar across Hispanic/Latino background groups (Central American = 0.17; South American = 0.19; Mexican = 0.18; Puerto Rican = 0.22; Cuban = 0.29; Dominican = 0.19). CHRNA4 on chromosome 20 attained p &lt; 10-4, supporting prior findings in non-Hispanics. For nondaily smoking, which is prevalent in Hispanic/Latino smokers, compared to daily smoking, loci on chromosomes 2 and 4 achieved genome-wide significance; replication attempts were limited by small Hispanic/Latino sample sizes. Associations of nicotinic receptor gene variants with smoking, first reported in non-Hispanic European-ancestry populations, generalized to Hispanics/Latinos despite different patterns of smoking behavior. We conducted the first large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of smoking behavior in a US Hispanic/Latino cohort, and the first GWAS of daily/nondaily smoking in any population. Results show that the region of the nicotinic receptor subunit gene CHRNA5, which in non-Hispanic European-ancestry smokers has been associated with heavy smoking as well as cessation and treatment efficacy, is also significantly associated with heavy smoking in this Hispanic/Latino cohort. The results are an important addition to understanding the impact of genetic variants in understudied Hispanic/Latino smokers. 	Nicotine_Tob._Res.	D016428
28371326	20170404	Susceptibility loci for metabolic syndrome and metabolic components identified in Han Chinese: a multi-stage genome-wide association study.	Metabolic syndrome (MetS), a cluster of metabolic disturbances that increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes, was because of genetic susceptibility and environmental risk factors. To identify the genetic variants associated with MetS and metabolic components, we conducted a genome-wide association study followed by replications in totally 12,720 participants from the north, north-eastern and eastern China. In combined analyses, independent of the top known signal at rs651821 on APOA5, we newly identified a secondary triglyceride-associated signal at rs180326 on BUD13 (Pcombined= 2.4 × 10-8). Notably, by an integrated analysis of the genotypes and the serum levels of APOA5, BUD13 and triglyceride, we observed that BUD13 was another potential mediator, besides APOA5, of the association between rs651821 and serum triglyceride. rs671 (ALDH2), an east Asian-specific common variant, was found to be associated with MetS (Pcombined= 9.7 × 10-22) in Han Chinese. The effects of rs671 on metabolic components were more prominent in drinkers than in non-drinkers. The replicated loci provided information on the genetic basis and mechanisms of MetS and metabolic components in Han Chinese. 	J._Cell._Mol._Med.	D016428
28470677	20170505	Genetic polymorphisms associated with pancreatic cancer survival: a genome-wide association study.	Previous findings on the association of genetic factors and pancreatic cancer survival are limited and inconsistent. In a two-stage study, we analyzed the existing genome-wide association study dataset of 868 pancreatic cancer patients from MD Anderson Cancer Center in relation to overall survival using Cox regression. Top hits were selected for replication in another 820 patients from the same institution using the Taqman genotyping method. Functional annotation, pathway analysis and gene expression analysis were conducted using existing software and databases. We discovered genome-wide significant associations of patient survival with three imputed SNPs which, in complete LD (r2?=?1), were intronic SNPs of the PAIP2B (rs113988120) and DYSF genes (rs112493246 and rs138529893) located on Chromosome 2. The variant alleles were associated with a 3.06-fold higher risk of death [95% confidence interval (CI)?=?2.10-4.47, p=6.4 × 10-9] after adjusting for clinical factors. Eleven SNPs were tested in the replication study and the association of rs113988120 with survival was confirmed (hazard ratio: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.13-2.20,  p=0.008). In silico analysis found rs1139988120 might lead to altered motif. This locus is in LD (D'?=?0.77) with three eQTL SNPs near or belong to the NAGK and MCEE genes. According to The Cancer Genome Atlas data and our previous RNA-sequencing data, the mRNA expression level of PAIP2B but not NAGK, MCEE or DYSF was significantly lower in pancreatic tumors than in normal adjacent tissues. Additional validation efforts and functional studies are warranted to demonstrate whether PAIP2B is a novel tumor suppressor gene and a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.

27922604	20161207	Common variants on 2p16.1, 6p22.1 and 10q24.32 are associated with schizophrenia in Han Chinese population.	Many schizophrenia susceptibility loci have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in European populations. However, until recently, schizophrenia GWASs in non-European populations were limited to small sample sizes and have yielded few loci associated with schizophrenia. To identify genetic risk variations for schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population, we performed a two-stage GWAS of schizophrenia comprising 4384 cases and 5770 controls, followed by independent replications of 13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in an additional 4339 schizophrenia cases and 7043 controls of Han Chinese ancestry. Furthermore, we conducted additional analyses based on the results in the discovery stage. The combined analysis confirmed evidence of genome-wide significant associations in the Han Chinese population for three loci, at 2p16.1 (rs1051061, in an exon of VRK2, P=1.14 × 10-12, odds ratio (OR)=1.17), 6p22.1 (rs115070292 in an intron of GABBR1, P=4.96 × 10-10, OR=0.77) and 10q24.32 (rs10883795 in an intron of AS3MT, P=7.94 × 10-10, OR=0.87; rs10883765 at an intron of ARL3, P=3.06 × 10-9, OR=0.87). The polygenic risk score based on Psychiatric Genomics Consortium schizophrenia GWAS data modestly predicted case-control status in the Chinese population (Nagelkerke R2: 1.7% ~5.7%). Our pathway analysis suggested that neurological biological pathways such as GABAergic signaling, dopaminergic signaling, cell adhesion molecules and myelination pathways are involved in schizophrenia. These findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population. Further studies are needed to establish the biological context and potential clinical utility of these findings. 	Mol._Psychiatry	D016428
28322352	20170322	Gene-based genome-wide association study identified 19p13.3 for lean body mass.	Lean body mass (LBM) is a complex trait for human health. To identify genomic loci underlying LBM, we performed a gene-based genome-wide association study of lean mass index (LMI) in 1000 unrelated Caucasian subjects, and replicated in 2283 unrelated Caucasians subjects. Gene-based association analyses highlighted the significant associations of three genes UQCR, TCF3 and MBD3 in one single locus 19p13.3 (discovery p?=?6.10?×?10-5, 1.65?×?10-4and 1.10?×?10-4; replication p?=?2.21?×?10-3, 1.84?×?10-3and 6.95?×?10-3; combined p?=?2.26?×?10-6, 4.86?×?10-6and 1.15?×?10-5, respectively). These results, together with the known functional relevance of the three genes to LMI, suggested that the 19p13.3 region containing UQCR, TCF3 and MBD3 genes was a novel locus underlying lean mass variation.

28061514	20170107	A Genome-Wide Association Study of Vertical Cup-Disc Ratio in a Latino Population.	Vertical cup-disc ratio (VCDR) is used as a clinical assessment measure to identify and monitor glaucomatous damage to the optic nerve. Previous genetic studies conducted in European and Asian populations have identified many loci associated with VCDR. The genetic factors in other ethnic populations, such as Latino, influencing VCDR remain to be determined. Here, we describe the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) on VCDR in Latino individuals. We conducted this GWAS on VCDR using 4537 Latino individuals who were genotyped by using either the Illumina OmniExpress BeadChip (?730K markers) or the Illumina Hispanic/SOL BeadChip (?2.5 million markers). Study subjects were 40 years of age and older. Linear regression, adjusting for age, sex, and principal components of genetic ancestry, was conducted to assess the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and VCDR. We imputed SNPs from the 1000 Genomes Project to integrate additional SNPs not directly genotyped. We replicated two previously reported SNPs that reached GWAS significance, rs1900005 and rs7916697, in the ATOH7-PBLD region, as well as identified two suggestive associations in the CDC7-TGFBR3 region on chromosome 1p22.1 and in the ZNF770-DPH6 region on chromosome 15q14. We discovered a novel SNP, rs56238729 (P = 1.22 × 10-13), in the ATOH7-PBLD region that is significantly associated with VCDR in Latino individuals. We replicated eight previously reported regions, including COL8A1, CDKN2B-CDKN2BAS, BMP2, and CHEK2 (P &lt; 2.17 × 10-3). Our results discovered a novel SNP that is significantly associated with VCDR in Latino individuals and confirmed previously reported loci, providing further insight into the genetic architecture of VCDR.

28714907	20170718	Genetic Contribution to Alcohol Dependence: Investigation of a Heterogeneous German Sample of Individuals with Alcohol Dependence, Chronic Alcoholic Pancreatitis, and Alcohol-Related Cirrhosis.	The present study investigated the genetic contribution to alcohol dependence (AD) using genome-wide association data from three German samples. These comprised patients with: (i) AD; (ii) chronic alcoholic pancreatitis (ACP); and (iii) alcohol-related liver cirrhosis (ALC). Single marker, gene-based, and pathway analyses were conducted. A significant association was detected for theADH1Blocus in a gene-based approach (puncorrected= 1.2 × 10-6;pcorrected= 0.020). This was driven by the AD subsample. No association withADH1Bwas found in the combined ACP + ALC sample. On first inspection, this seems surprising, sinceADH1Bis a robustly replicated risk gene for AD and may therefore be expected to be associated also with subgroups of AD patients. The negative finding in the ACP + ALC sample, however, may reflect genetic stratification as well as random fluctuation of allele frequencies in the cases and controls, demonstrating the importance of large samples in which the phenotype is well assessed.

28043905	20170104	Association of Liver Injury From Specific Drugs, or Groups of Drugs, With Polymorphisms in HLA and Other Genes in a Genome-Wide Association Study.	We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic risk factors for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) from licensed drugs without previously reported genetic risk factors. We performed a GWAS of 862 persons with DILI and 10,588 population-matched controls. The first set of cases was recruited before May 2009 in Europe (n = 137) and the United States (n = 274). The second set of cases were identified from May 2009 through May 2013 from international collaborative studies performed in Europe, the United States, and South America. For the GWAS, we included only cases with patients of European ancestry associated with a particular drug (but not flucloxacillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate). We used DNA samples from all subjects to analyze HLA genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms. After the discovery analysis was concluded, we validated our findings using data from 283 European patients with diagnosis of DILI associated with various drugs. We associated DILI with rs114577328 (a proxy for A*33:01 a HLA class I allele; odds ratio [OR], 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-3.8; P = 2.4 × 10-8) and with rs72631567 on chromosome 2 (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.6-2.5; P = 9.7 × 10-9). The association with A*33:01 was mediated by large effects for terbinafine-, fenofibrate-, and ticlopidine-related DILI. The variant on chromosome 2 was associated with DILI from a variety of drugs. Further phenotypic analysis indicated that the association between DILI and A*33:01 was significant genome wide for cholestatic and mixed DILI, but not for hepatocellular DILI; the polymorphism on chromosome 2 was associated with cholestatic and mixed DILI as well as hepatocellular DILI. We identified an association between rs28521457 (within the lipopolysaccharide-responsive vesicle trafficking, beach and anchor containing gene) and only hepatocellular DILI (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6-2.7; P = 4.8 × 10-9). We did not associate any specific drug classes with genetic polymorphisms, except for statin-associated DILI, which was associated with rs116561224 on chromosome 18 (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 3.0-9.5; P = 7.1 × 10-9). We validated the association between A*33:01 terbinafine- and sertraline-induced DILI. We could not validate the association between DILI and rs72631567, rs28521457, or rs116561224. In a GWAS of persons of European descent with DILI, we associated HLA-A*33:01 with DILI due to terbinafine and possibly fenofibrate and ticlopidine. We identified polymorphisms that appear to be associated with DILI from statins, as well as 2 non-drug-specific risk factors. 	Gastroenterology	D016428
27770636	20161023	Two novel loci, COBL and SLC10A2, for Alzheimer's disease in African Americans.	African Americans' (AAs) late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) genetic risk profile is incompletely understood. Including clinical covariates in genetic analyses using informed conditioning might improve study power. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in AAs employing informed conditioning in 1825 LOAD cases and 3784 cognitively normal controls. We derived a posterior liability conditioned on age, sex, diabetes status, current smoking status, educational attainment, and affection status, with parameters informed by external prevalence information. We assessed association between the posterior liability and a genome-wide set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), controlling for APOE and ABCA7, identified previously in a LOAD GWAS of AAs. Two SNPs at novel loci, rs112404845 (P = 3.8 × 10-8), upstream of COBL, and rs16961023 (P = 4.6 × 10-8), downstream of SLC10A2, obtained genome-wide significant evidence of association with the posterior liability. An informed conditioning approach can detect LOAD genetic associations in AAs not identified by traditional GWAS. 	Alzheimers_Dement	D016428
28840121	20170826	A Pilot Genome-Wide Association Study in Postmenopausal Mexican-Mestizo Women Implicates the RMND1/CCDC170 Locus Is Associated with Bone Mineral Density.	To identify genetic variants influencing bone mineral density (BMD) in the Mexican-Mestizo population, we performed a GWAS for femoral neck (FN) and lumbar spine (LS) in Mexican-Mestizo postmenopausal women. In the discovery sample, 300,000 SNPs were genotyped in a cohort of 411 postmenopausal women and seven SNPs were analyzed in the replication cohort (n= 420). The combined results of a meta-analysis from the discovery and replication samples identified two loci,RMND1(rs6904364,P= 2.77 × 10-4) andCCDC170(rs17081341,P= 1.62 × 10-5), associated with FN BMD. We also compared our results with those of the Genetic Factors for Osteoporosis (GEFOS) Consortium meta-analysis. The comparison revealed two loci previously reported in the GEFOS meta-analysis:SOX6(rs7128738) andPKDCC(rs11887431) associated with FN and LS BMD, respectively, in our study population. Interestingly, rs17081341 rare in Caucasians (minor allele frequency?&lt;?0.03) was found in high frequency in our population, which suggests that this association could be specific to non-Caucasian populations. In conclusion, the first pilot Mexican GWA study of BMD confirmed previously identified loci and also demonstrated the importance of studying variability in diverse populations and/or specific populations.

27021820	20160330	Genome-wide interaction study of brain beta-amyloid burden and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease.	The lack of strong association between brain beta-amyloid deposition and cognitive impairment has been a challenge for the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field. Although beta-amyloid is necessary for the pathologic diagnosis of AD, it is not sufficient to make the pathologic diagnosis or cause dementia. We sought to identify the genetic modifiers of the relation between cortical beta-amyloid burden (measured using [18F]Florbetapir-PET) and cognitive dysfunction (measured using ADAS-cog) by conducting a genome-wide interaction study on baseline data from participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) phases GO/2 (n=678). Near genome-wide significant interaction effect was observed for rs73069071 within the IAPP (amylin) and SLCO1A2 genes (P=6.2 × 10-8). Congruent results were found using data from participants followed up from ADNI-1 (Pone-tailed=0.028, n=165). Meta-analysis across ADNI-GO/2 and ADNI-1 revealed a genome-wide significant interaction effect (P=1.1 × 10-8). Our results were further supported by similar interaction effects on temporal lobe cortical thickness (whole-brain voxelwise analysis: familywise error corrected P=0.013) and longitudinal changes in ADAS-cog score and left middle temporal thickness and amygdalar volume (Pone-tailed=0.026, 0.019 and 0.003, respectively). Using postmortem beta-amyloid immunohistochemistry data from 243 AD participants in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project, we also observed similar rs73069071-by-beta-amyloid deposition interaction effect on global cognitive function (Pone-tailed=0.005). Our findings provide insight into the complexity of the relationship between beta-amyloid burden and AD-related cognitive impairment. Although functional studies are required to elucidate the role of rs73069071 in AD pathophysiology, our results support the recently growing evidence on the role of amylin in AD.

26422391	20151001	Candidate Loci are Revealed by an Initial Genome-wide Association Study of Juvenile Osteochondritis Dissecans.	Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a condition that oftentimes causes significant knee pain in pediatric patient populations. If left untreated, OCD significantly increases the risk of developing degenerative osteoarthritis along with its associated consequences and costs. Although a genetic component has been suggested to play a role in this disorder, few studies have been carried out in order to determine the underlying genetic etiology of this relatively common complex trait. The goal of our study was to perform an initial genome-wide association study (GWAS) to uncover candidate loci associated with the pathogenesis of OCD. Blood samples were acquired from 2 cohorts, aged 0 to 18 years old, consisting of 209 OCD cases and 1855 population-matched controls. Agencourt Genfind DNA isolation technology was used to isolate high-quality DNA from each sample. Genotype data was then generated utilizing the Illumina Infinium BeadChip array to examine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In an initial GWAS analysis of our cohort, where a SNP was excluded if the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium test P&lt;0.0001, the minor allele frequency&lt;5%, and the genotyping call rate&lt;90%, we obtained our first results for OCD. Although there was no SNP strictly reaching the threshold for genome-wide significance at this early stage, multiple SNPs (35) at several loci revealed evidence of suggestive association with OCD (P&lt;5.0×10). The results from our preliminary study are encouraging. Herein we not only discuss the relevance and applicability of GWAS in studying a genetic basis for OCD, but have also identified top signals that may suggest loci involved in coordinated expression as well as a transcription factor involved in development that may be highly relevant to this trait. If genetic predispositions for OCD are detected early enough in life, attempts at activity modification, counseling, and orthopaedic monitoring may successfully reduce progression of this condition, which may lead to progressive osteoarthritis in the third to fourth decade in at-risk patients.

28060188	20170107	PROX1 gene CC genotype as a major determinant of early onset of type 2 diabetes in slavic study participants from Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation study.	The prevalence of diabetic nephropathy varies according to ethnicity. Environmental as well as genetic factors contribute to the heterogeneity in the presentation of diabetic nephropathy. Our objective was to evaluate this heterogeneity within the Caucasian population. The geo-ethnic origin of the 3409 genotyped Caucasian type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients of Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation was determined using principal component analysis. Genome-wide association studies analyses of age of onset of T2D were performed for geo-ethnic groups separately and combined. The first principal component separated the Caucasian study participants into Slavic and Celtic ethnic origins. Age of onset of diabetes was significantly lower in Slavic patients (P?=?7.3?×?10), whereas the prevalence of hypertension (P?=?4.9?×?10) and albuminuria (5.1?×?10) were significantly higher. Age of onset of T2D and albuminuria appear to have an important genetic component as the values of these traits were also different between Slavic and Celtic individuals living in the same countries. Common and geo-ethnic-specific loci were found to be associated to age of onset of diabetes. Among the latter, the PROX1/PROX1-AS1 genes (rs340841) had the highest impact. Single-nucleotide polymorphism rs340841 CC genotype was associated with a 4.4 year earlier onset of T2D in Slavic patients living or not in countries with predominant Slavic populations. These results reveal the presence of distinct genetic architectures between Caucasian ethnic groups that likely have clinical relevance, among them PROX1 gene is a strong candidate of early onset of diabetes with variations depending on ethnicity.

28187132	20170211	GWAS for serum galactose-deficient IgA1 implicates critical genes of the O-glycosylation pathway.	Aberrant O-glycosylation of serum immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) represents a heritable pathogenic defect in IgA nephropathy, the most common form of glomerulonephritis worldwide, but specific genetic factors involved in its determination are not known. We performed a quantitative GWAS for serum levels of galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) in 2,633 subjects of European and East Asian ancestry and discovered two genome-wide significant loci, in C1GALT1 (rs13226913, P = 3.2 x 10-11) and C1GALT1C1 (rs5910940, P = 2.7 x 10-8). These genes encode molecular partners essential for enzymatic O-glycosylation of IgA1. We demonstrated that these two loci explain approximately 7% of variability in circulating Gd-IgA1 in Europeans, but only 2% in East Asians. Notably, the Gd-IgA1-increasing allele of rs13226913 is common in Europeans, but rare in East Asians. Moreover, rs13226913 represents a strong cis-eQTL for C1GALT1 that encodes the key enzyme responsible for the transfer of galactose to O-linked glycans on IgA1. By in vitro siRNA knock-down studies, we confirmed that mRNA levels of both C1GALT1 and C1GALT1C1 determine the rate of secretion of Gd-IgA1 in IgA1-producing cells. Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic regulation of O-glycosylation and are relevant not only to IgA nephropathy, but also to other complex traits associated with O-glycosylation defects, including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic disease, and cancer.

28240269	20170228	Connecting genetic risk to disease end points through the human blood plasma proteome.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with intermediate phenotypes, like changes in metabolite and protein levels, provide functional evidence to map disease associations and translate them into clinical applications. However, although hundreds of genetic variants have been associated with complex disorders, the underlying molecular pathways often remain elusive. Associations with intermediate traits are key in establishing functional links between GWAS-identified risk-variants and disease end points. Here we describe a GWAS using a highly multiplexed aptamer-based affinity proteomics platform. We quantify 539 associations between protein levels and gene variants (pQTLs) in a German cohort and replicate over half of them in an Arab and Asian cohort. Fifty-five of the replicated pQTLs are located in trans. Our associations overlap with 57 genetic risk loci for 42 unique disease end points. We integrate this information into a genome-proteome network and provide an interactive web-tool for interrogations. Our results provide a basis for novel approaches to pharmaceutical and diagnostic applications. 	Nat_Commun	D016428
28448500	20170428	Genome-wide physical activity interactions in adiposity - A meta-analysis of 200,452 adults.	Physical activity (PA) may modify the genetic effects that give rise to increased risk of obesity. To identify adiposity loci whose effects are modified by PA, we performed genome-wide interaction meta-analyses of BMI and BMI-adjusted waist circumference and waist-hip ratio from up to 200,452 adults of European (n = 180,423) or other ancestry (n = 20,029). We standardized PA by categorizing it into a dichotomous variable where, on average, 23% of participants were categorized as inactive and 77% as physically active. While we replicate the interaction with PA for the strongest known obesity-risk locus in the FTO gene, of which the effect is attenuated by ~30% in physically active individuals compared to inactive individuals, we do not identify additional loci that are sensitive to PA. In additional genome-wide meta-analyses adjusting for PA and interaction with PA, we identify 11 novel adiposity loci, suggesting that accounting for PA or other environmental factors that contribute to variation in adiposity may facilitate gene discovery.

28017375	20161227	Genome-wide Trans-ethnic Meta-analysis Identifies Seven Genetic Loci Influencing Erythrocyte Traits and a Role for RBPMS in Erythropoiesis.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified loci for erythrocyte traits in primarily European ancestry populations. We conducted GWAS meta-analyses of six erythrocyte traits in 71,638 individuals from European, East Asian, and African ancestries using a Bayesian approach to account for heterogeneity in allelic effects and variation in the structure of linkage disequilibrium between ethnicities. We identified seven loci for erythrocyte traits including a locus (RBPMS/GTF2E2) associated with mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume. Statistical fine-mapping at this locus pointed to RBPMS at this locus and excluded nearby GTF2E2. Using zebrafish morpholino to evaluate loss of function, we observed a strong in vivo erythropoietic effect for RBPMS but not for GTF2E2, supporting the statistical fine-mapping at this locus and demonstrating that RBPMS is a regulator of erythropoiesis. Our findings show the utility of trans-ethnic GWASs for discovery and characterization of genetic loci influencing hematologic traits. 	Am._J._Hum._Genet.	D016428 D017418

28130311	20170129	Genome-wide association study identi?es HLA-DR variants conferring risk of HBV-related acute-on-chronic liver failure.	Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is an extreme condition after severe acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B; however, the underlying genetic factors involved in its onset and progression are currently unclear. We carried out a genome-wide association study among 399 HBV-related ACLFs (cases) and 401 asymptomatic HBV carriers (AsCs, as controls) without antiviral treatment. The initial findings were replicated in four independent case-control sets (a total of 901 ACLFs and 1686 AsCs). The roles of risk variants on clinical traits of ACLF were also analysed. Among 1300 ACLFs and 2087 AsCs, we identified rs3129859 at human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II region (chromosome 6p21.32) associated with HBV-related ACLF (combined P dominant =2.64×10-20, OR=1.83). Analysis identi?edHLA-DRB1*12:02as the top susceptible HLA allele associated with ACLF (p=3.94×10-6, OR=2.05). The association of rs3129859 was robust in ACLF subgroups (ACLFs with liver cirrhosis, p=1.36×10-16; ACLFs without liver cirrhosis, p=1.52×10-7), and patients at low-replicative phase (p=6.36×10-11, OR=2.29) or HBV e antigen-negative chronic hepatitis B phase (p=1.51×10-14, OR=1.86). Clinical traits analysis in patients with ACLF showed that the risky rs3129859*C allele was also associated with prolonged prothrombin time, faster progression to ascites development and higher 28-day mortality. Our genome-wide association study identifiedHLA-DRas the major locus for susceptibility to HBV-related ACLF. Our findings highlight the importance of HLA class II restricted CD4+ T-cell pathway on the immunopathogenesis of HBV-related ACLF. 	Gut	D016428
28333195	20170324	Genome-wide genetic analyses highlight mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.	Do genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for endometriosis provide insight into novel biological pathways associated with its pathogenesis? GWAS analysis uncovered multiple pathways that are statistically enriched for genetic association signals, analysis of Stage A disease highlighted a novel variant in MAP3K4, while top pathways significantly associated with all endometriosis and Stage A disease included several mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-related pathways. Endometriosis is a complex disease with an estimated heritability of 50%. To date, GWAS revealed 10 genomic regions associated with endometriosis, explaining &lt;4% of heritability, while half of the heritability is estimated to be due to common risk variants. Pathway analyses combine the evidence of single variants into gene-based measures, leveraging the aggregate effect of variants in genes and uncovering biological pathways involved in disease pathogenesis. Pathway analysis was conducted utilizing the International Endogene Consortium GWAS data, comprising 3194 surgically confirmed endometriosis cases and 7060 controls of European ancestry with genotype data imputed up to 1000 Genomes Phase three reference panel. GWAS was performed for all endometriosis cases and for Stage A (revised American Fertility Society (rAFS) I/II, n = 1686) and B (rAFS III/IV, n = 1364) cases separately. The identified significant pathways were compared with pathways previously investigated in the literature through candidate association studies. The most comprehensive biological pathway databases, MSigDB (including BioCarta, KEGG, PID, SA, SIG, ST and GO) and PANTHER were utilized to test for enrichment of genetic variants associated with endometriosis. Statistical enrichment analysis was performed using the MAGENTA (Meta-Analysis Gene-set Enrichment of variaNT Associations) software. The first genome-wide association analysis for Stage A endometriosis revealed a novel locus, rs144240142 (P = 6.45 × 10-8, OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.23-2.37), an intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within MAP3K4. This SNP was not associated with Stage B disease (P = 0.086). MAP3K4 was also shown to be differentially expressed in eutopic endometrium between Stage A endometriosis cases and controls (P = 3.8 × 10-4), but not with Stage B disease (P = 0.26). A total of 14 pathways enriched with genetic endometriosis associations were identified (false discovery rate (FDR)-P &lt; 0.05). The pathways associated with any endometriosis were Grb2-Sos provides linkage to MAPK signaling for integrins pathway (P = 2.8 × 10-5, FDR-P = 3.0 × 10-3), Wnt signaling (P = 0.026, FDR-P = 0.026) and p130Cas linkage to MAPK signaling for integrins pathway (P = 6.0 × 10-4, FDR-P = 0.029); with Stage A endometriosis: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1 ERK2 MAPK (P = 5.0 × 10-4, FDR-P = 5.0 × 10-4) and with Stage B endometriosis: two overlapping pathways that related to extracellular matrix biology-Core matrisome (P = 1.4 × 10-3, FDR-P = 0.013) and ECM glycoproteins (P = 1.8 × 10-3, FDR-P = 7.1 × 10-3). Genes arising from endometriosis candidate gene studies performed to date were enriched for Interleukin signaling pathway (P = 2.3 × 10-12), Apoptosis signaling pathway (P = 9.7 × 10-9) and Gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor pathway (P = 1.2 × 10-6); however, these pathways did not feature in the results based on GWAS data. Not applicable. The analysis is restricted to (i) variants in/near genes that can be assigned to pathways, excluding intergenic variants; (ii) the gene-based pathway definition as registered in the databases; (iii) women of European ancestry. The top ranked pathways associated with overall and Stage A endometriosis in particular involve integrin-mediated MAPK activation and intracellular ERK/MAPK acting downstream in the MAPK cascade, both acting in the control of cell division, gene expression, cell movement and survival. Other top enriched pathways in Stage B disease include ECM glycoprotein pathways important for extracellular structure and biochemical support. The results highlight the need for increased efforts to understand the functional role of these pathways in endometriosis pathogenesis, including the investigation of the biological effects of the genetic variants on downstream molecular processes in tissue relevant to endometriosis. Additionally, our results offer further support for the hypothesis of at least partially distinct causal pathophysiology for minimal/mild (rAFS I/II) vs. moderate/severe (rAFS III/IV) endometriosis.

28044437	20170104	Body mass index change in gastrointestinal cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with Dedicator of Cytokinesis 1.	There have been a number of candidate gene association studies of cancer cachexia-related traits, but no genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been published to date. Cachexia presents in patients with a number of complex traits, including both cancer and COPD. The objective of the current investigation was to search for a shared genetic aetiology for change in body mass index (?BMI) among cancer and COPD by using GWAS data in the Framingham Heart Study. A linear mixed effects model accounting for age, sex, and change in smoking status was used to calculate ?BMI in participants over 40?years of age with three consecutive BMI time points (n?=?4162). Four GWAS of ?BMI using generalized estimating equations were performed among 1085 participants with a cancer diagnosis, 204 with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer, 112 with lung cancer, and 237 with COPD to test for association with 418?365 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Two SNPs reached a level of genome-wide significance (P?&lt;?5?×?10-8) with ?BMI: (i) rs41526344 within the CNTN4 gene, among COPD cases (??=?0.13, P?=?4.3?×?10-8); and (ii) rs4751240 in the gene Dedicator of Cytokinesis 1 (DOCK1) among GI cancer cases (??=?0.10, P?=?1.9?×?10-8). The DOCK1 SNP association replicated in the ?BMI GWAS among COPD cases (?meta-analyis?=?0.10, Pmeta-analyis?=?9.3?×?10-10). The DOCK1 gene codes for the dedicator of cytokinesis 1 protein, which has a role in myoblast fusion. In sum, one statistically significant common variant in the DOCK1 gene was associated with ?BMI in GI cancer and COPD cases providing support for at least partially shared aetiology of ?BMI in complex diseases.

28360221	20170401	NFAT5 and SLC4A10 Loci Associate with Plasma Osmolality.	Disorders of water balance, an excess or deficit of total body water relative to body electrolyte content, are common and ascertained by plasma hypo- or hypernatremia, respectively. We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study meta-analysis on plasma sodium concentration in 45,889 individuals of European descent (stage 1 discovery) and 17,637 additional individuals of European descent (stage 2 replication), and a transethnic meta-analysis of replicated single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 79,506 individuals (63,526 individuals of European descent, 8765 individuals of Asian Indian descent, and 7215 individuals of African descent). In stage 1, we identified eight loci associated with plasma sodium concentration atP&lt;5.0 × 10-6Of these, rs9980 atNFAT5replicated in stage 2 meta-analysis (P=3.1 × 10-5), with combined stages 1 and 2 genome-wide significance ofP=5.6 × 10-10Transethnic meta-analysis further supported the association at rs9980 (P=5.9 × 10-12). Additionally, rs16846053 atSLC4A10showed nominally, but not genome-wide, significant association in combined stages 1 and 2 meta-analysis (P=6.7 × 10-8).NFAT5encodes a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that coordinates the intracellular response to hypertonic stress but was not previously implicated in the regulation of systemic water balance.SLC4A10encodes a sodium bicarbonate transporter with a brain-restricted expression pattern, and variant rs16846053 affects a putative intronic NFAT5 DNA binding motif. The lead variants forNFAT5andSLC4A10arecisexpression quantitative trait loci in tissues of the central nervous system and relevant to transcriptional regulation. Thus, genetic variation inNFAT5andSLC4A10expression and function in the central nervous system may affect the regulation of systemic water balance. 	J._Am._Soc._Nephrol.	D016428
28352666	20170330	LRRK2 but notATG16L1 is associated with Paneth cell defect in Japanese Crohn's disease patients.	 BACKGROUND. Morphological patterns of Paneth cells are a prognostic biomarker in Western Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and are associated with autophagy-associatedATG16L1andNOD2variants. We hypothesized that genetic determinants of Paneth cell phenotype in other ethnic CD cohorts are distinct but also involved in autophagy.METHODS.We performed a hypothesis-driven analysis of 56 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with CD susceptibility or known to affect Paneth cell function in 110 Japanese CD patients who underwent ileal resection. We subsequently performed a genome-wide association analysis. Paneth cell phenotype was determined by defensin-5 immunofluorescence. Selected genotype-Paneth cell defect correlations were compared to a Western CD cohort (n= 164).RESULTS.The average percentage of abnormal Paneth cells in Japanese CD was similar to Western CD (P= 0.87), and abnormal Paneth cell phenotype was also associated with early recurrence (P= 0.013). In contrast to Western CD,ATG16L1T300A was not associated with Paneth cell defect in Japanese CD (P= 0.20). Among the 56 selected SNPs, onlyLRRK2M2397T showed significant association with Paneth cell defect (P= 3.62 × 10-4), whereas in the Western CD cohort it was not (P= 0.76). Pathway analysis ofLRRK2and other candidate genes withPless than 5 × 10-4showed connections with known CD susceptibility genes and links to autophagy and TNF-? networks.CONCLUSIONS.We found dichotomous effects ofATG16L1andLRRK2on Paneth cell defect between Japanese and Western CD. Genes affecting Paneth cell phenotype in Japanese CD were also associated with autophagy. Paneth cell phenotype also predicted prognosis in Japanese CD.FUNDING.Helmsley Charitable Trust, Doris Duke Foundation (grant 2014103), Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI grants JP15H04805 and JP15K15284), Crohn's and Colitis Foundation grant 274415, NIH (grants 1R56DK095820, K01DK109081, and UL1 TR000448).

28334814	20170324	Genome-wide association study identifies novel susceptible loci and highlights Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in the development of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.	The genetic architecture of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) remains poorly understood. Here we present the result of a 4-stage genome-wide association study composed of 5,953 AIS patients and 8,137 controls. Overall, we identified three novel susceptible loci including rs7593846 at 2p14 near MEIS1 (Pcombined?=?1.19 × 10-13, OR?=?1.21, 95% CI?=?1.10-1.32), rs7633294 at 3p14.1 near MAGI1 (Pcombined?=?1.85 × 10-12, OR?=?1.20, 95% CI?=?1.09-1.32), and rs9810566 at 3q26.2 near TNIK (Pcombined?=?1.14 × 10-11, OR?=?1.19, 95% CI?=?1.08-1.32). We also confirmed a recently reported region associated with AIS at 20p11.22 (Pcombined?=?1.61 × 10-15, OR?=?1.22, 95% CI?=?1.12-1.34). Furthermore, we observed significantly asymmetric expression of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in the bilateral paraspinal muscle of AIS patients, including beta-catenin, TNIK, and LBX1. This is the first study that unveils the potential role of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in the development of AIS, and our findings may shed new light on the etiopathogenesis of AIS. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.

28334899	20170324	Association analyses of East Asian individuals and trans-ancestry analyses with European individuals reveal new loci associated with cholesterol and triglyceride levels.	Large-scale meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified?&gt;175 loci associated with fasting cholesterol levels, including total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG). With differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure and allele frequencies between ancestry groups, studies in additional large samples may detect new associations. We conducted staged GWAS meta-analyses in up to 69,414 East Asian individuals from 24 studies with participants from Japan, the Philippines, Korea, China, Singapore, and Taiwan. These meta-analyses identified (P?&lt;?5?×?10-8) three novel loci associated with HDL-C near CD163-APOBEC1 (P?=?7.4?×?10-9), NCOA2 (P?=?1.6?×?10-8), and NID2-PTGDR (P?=?4.2?×?10-8), and one novel locus associated with TG near WDR11-FGFR2 (P?=?2.7?×?10-10). Conditional analyses identified a second signal near CD163-APOBEC1. We then combined results from the East Asian meta-analysis with association results from up to 187,365 European individuals from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium in a trans-ancestry meta-analysis. This analysis identified (log10Bayes Factor??6.1) eight additional novel lipid loci. Among the twelve total loci identified, the index variants at eight loci have demonstrated at least nominal significance with other metabolic traits in prior studies, and two loci exhibited coincident eQTLs (P?&lt;?1?×?10-5) in subcutaneous adipose tissue for BPTF and PDGFC. Taken together, these analyses identified multiple novel lipid loci, providing new potential therapeutic targets. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D017418 D052061 D013485
28525603	20170520	Genome-Wide Association Study of Psychosis Proneness in the Finnish Population.	The current study examined quantitative measures of psychosis proneness in a nonpsychotic population, in order to elucidate their underlying genetic architecture and to observe if there is any commonality to that already detected in the studies of individuals with overt psychotic conditions, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Heritability, univariate and multivariate genome-wide association (GWAs) tests, including a series of comprehensive gene-based association analyses, were developed in 4269 nonpsychotic persons participating in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 study with information on the following psychometric measures: Hypomanic Personality, Perceptual Aberration, Physical and Social Anhedonia (also known as Chapman's Schizotypia scales), and Schizoidia scale. Genome-wide genetic data was available for ~9.84 million SNPs. Heritability estimates ranged from 16% to 27%. Phenotypic, genetic and environmental correlations ranged from 0.04-0.43, 0.25-0.73, and 0.12-0.43, respectively. Univariate GWAs tests revealed an intronic SNP (rs12449097) at the TMC7 gene (16p12.3) that significantly associated (P = 3.485 × 10-8) with the hypomanic scale. Bivariate GWAs tests including the hypomanic and physical anhedonia scales suggested a further borderline significant SNP (rs188320715; P-value = 5.261 × 10-8, ~572 kb downstream the ARID1B gene at 6q25.3). Gene-based tests highlighted 20 additional genes of which 5 had previously been associated to schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder: CSMD1, CCDC141, SLC1A2, CACNA1C, and SNAP25. Altogether the findings explained from 3.7% to 14.1% of the corresponding trait heritability. In conclusion, this study provides preliminary genomic evidence suggesting that qualitatively similar biological factors may underlie different psychosis proneness measures, some of which could further predispose to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

28452372	20170429	1000 Genomes-based meta-analysis identifies 10 novel loci for kidney function.	HapMap imputed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed &gt;50 loci at which common variants with minor allele frequency &gt;5% are associated with kidney function. GWAS using more complete reference sets for imputation, such as those from The 1000 Genomes project, promise to identify novel loci that have been missed by previous efforts. To investigate the value of such a more complete variant catalog, we conducted a GWAS meta-analysis of kidney function based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in 110,517 European ancestry participants using 1000 Genomes imputed data. We identified 10 novel loci with p-value?&lt;?5?×?10-8previously missed by HapMap-based GWAS. Six of these loci (HOXD8, ARL15, PIK3R1, EYA4, ASTN2, and EPB41L3) are tagged by common SNPs unique to the 1000 Genomes reference panel. Using pathway analysis, we identified 39 significant (FDR?&lt;?0.05) genes and 127 significantly (FDR?&lt;?0.05) enriched gene sets, which were missed by our previous analyses. Among those, the 10 identified novel genes are part of pathways of kidney development, carbohydrate metabolism, cardiac septum development and glucose metabolism. These results highlight the utility of re-imputing from denser reference panels, until whole-genome sequencing becomes feasible in large samples. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
26856250	20160210	The GRM7 gene, early response to risperidone, and schizophrenia: a genome-wide association study and a confirmatory pharmacogenetic analysis.	The search for biomarkers of response to antipsychotic medications is hindered by difficulties inherent in the topic or related to persistent methodological difficulties, such as high rates of anticipated discontinuation and consequent distortions in the imputation of missing data. Because early response to antipsychotics represents a sufficiently reliable index of the subsequent treatment response in patients with schizophrenia, we undertook a real-world, genome-wide association study (GWAS) with the aim of identifying genetic predictors of response to risperidone after 2 weeks in 86 patients with schizophrenia. Limited to the associations reaching significance in the GWAS, confirmatory analysis relative to risperidone response over 9 months was also designed involving 97 patients (European only) enroled in the CATIE (Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness) genetic substudy. The GWAS revealed a significant association (false discovery rate 0.02) of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2133450 inside the GRM7 gene with Emsley's positive domain derived from the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). Patients with the rs2133450 CC genotype presented poorer improvement in the positive domain over 2 weeks, with odds ratios of 12.68 (95% CI, 3.51-45.76) and 6.95 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.37-20.37) compared with patients with the AA and AC genotypes, respectively. Compared with A homozygotes, rs2133450 C homozygotes enroled in the CATIE-derived confirmatory analysis showed less improvement in Emsley's positive, excited and depression domains, positive and general PANSS subtypes, and total PANSS after 9 months of treatment with risperidone. The original GWAS and the CATIE-derived confirmatory analysis support the proposal that the rs2133450 may have translational relevance as a predictor of response to risperidone. 	Pharmacogenomics_J.

28040410	20170102	A genome wide association study of fast beta EEG in families of European ancestry.	Differences in fast beta (20-28Hz) electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillatory activity distinguish some individuals with psychiatric and substance use disorders, suggesting that it may be a useful endophenotype for studying the genetics of disorders characterized by neural hyper-excitability. Despite the high heritability estimates provided by twin and family studies, there have been relatively few genetic studies of beta EEG, and to date only one genetic association finding has replicated (i.e., GABRA2). In a sample of 1564 individuals from 117 families of European Ancestry (EA) drawn from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA), we performed a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) on resting-state fronto-central fast beta EEG power, adjusting regression models for family relatedness, age, sex, and ancestry. To further characterize genetic findings, we examined the functional and behavioral significance of GWAS findings. Three intronic variants located within DSE (dermatan sulfate epimerase) on 6q22 were associated with fast beta EEG at a genome wide significant level (p&lt;5×10-8). The most significant SNP was rs2252790 (p&lt;2.6×10-8; MAF=0.36; ?=0.135). rs2252790 is an eQTL for ROS1 expressed most robustly in the temporal cortex (p=1.2×10-6) and for DSE/TSPYL4 expressed most robustly in the hippocampus (p=7.3×10-4; ?=0.29). Previous studies have indicated that DSE is involved in a network of genes integral to membrane organization; gene-based tests indicated that several variants within this network (i.e., DSE, ZEB2, RND3, MCTP1, and CTBP2) were also associated with beta EEG (empirical p&lt;0.05), and of these genes, ZEB2 and CTBP2 were associated with DSM-V Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD; empirical p&lt;0.05).' In this sample of EA families enriched for AUDs, fast beta EEG is associated with variants within DSE on 6q22; the most significant SNP influences the mRNA expression of DSE and ROS1 in hippocampus and temporal cortex, brain regions important for beta EEG activity. Gene-based tests suggest evidence of association with related genes, ZEB2, RND3, MCTP1, CTBP2, and beta EEG. Converging data from GWAS, gene expression, and gene-networks presented in this study provide support for the role of genetic variants within DSE and related genes in neural hyperexcitability, and has highlighted two potential candidate genes for AUD and/or related neurological conditions: ZEB2 and CTBP2. However, results must be replicated in large, independent samples. 	Int_J_Psychophysiol	D016428 D052061
28292921	20170316	Genetic Determinants of 1,3-Butadiene Metabolism and Detoxification in Three Populations of Smokers with Different Risks of Lung Cancer.	 Background: 1,3-Butadiene (BD) is an important carcinogen in tobacco smoke that undergoes metabolic activation to DNA-reactive epoxides. These species can be detoxified via glutathione conjugation and excreted in urine as the corresponding N-acetylcysteine conjugates. We hypothesize that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BD-metabolizing genes may change the balance of BD bioactivation and detoxification in White, Japanese American, and African American smokers, potentially contributing to ethnic differences in lung cancer risk.Methods:We measured the levels of BD metabolites, 1- and 2-(N-acetyl-L-cysteine-S-yl)-1-hydroxybut-3-ene (MHBMA) andN-acetyl-S-(3,4-dihydroxybutyl)-L-cysteine (DHBMA), in urine samples from a total of 1,072 White, Japanese American, and African American smokers and adjusted these values for body mass index, age, batch, and total nicotine equivalents. We also conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic determinants of BD metabolism.Results:We found that mean urinary MHBMA concentrations differed significantly by ethnicity (P= 4.0 × 10-25). African Americans excreted the highest levels of MHBMA followed by Whites and Japanese Americans. MHBMA levels were affected byGSTT1gene copy number (P&lt; 0.0001); conditional onGSTT1, no other polymorphisms showed a significant association. Urinary DHBMA levels also differed between ethnic groups (P= 3.3 × 10-4), but were not affected byGSTT1copy number (P= 0.226).Conclusions:GSTT1gene deletion has a strong effect on urinary MHBMA levels, and therefore BD metabolism, in smokers.Impact:Our results show that the order of MHBMA levels among ethnic groups is consistent with their respective lung cancer risk and can be partially explained byGSTT1genotype.Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(7); 1034-42. ©2017 AACR.

28416818	20170419	Large-scale analyses of common and rare variants identify 12 new loci associated with atrial fibrillation.	Atrial fibrillation affects more than 33 million people worldwide and increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, and death. Fourteen genetic loci have been associated with atrial fibrillation in European and Asian ancestry groups. To further define the genetic basis of atrial fibrillation, we performed large-scale, trans-ancestry meta-analyses of common and rare variant association studies. The genome-wide association studies (GWAS) included 17,931 individuals with atrial fibrillation and 115,142 referents; the exome-wide association studies (ExWAS) and rare variant association studies (RVAS) involved 22,346 cases and 132,086 referents. We identified 12 new genetic loci that exceeded genome-wide significance, implicating genes involved in cardiac electrical and structural remodeling. Our results nearly double the number of known genetic loci for atrial fibrillation, provide insights into the molecular basis of atrial fibrillation, and may facilitate the identification of new potential targets for drug discovery.

28098162	20170119	Novel genetic loci associated with hippocampal volume.	The hippocampal formation is a brain structure integrally involved in episodic memory, spatial navigation, cognition and stress responsiveness. Structural abnormalities in hippocampal volume and shape are found in several common neuropsychiatric disorders. To identify the genetic underpinnings of hippocampal structure here we perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 33,536 individuals and discover six independent loci significantly associated with hippocampal volume, four of them novel. Of the novel loci, three lie within genes (ASTN2, DPP4 and MAST4) and one is found 200?kb upstream of SHH. A hippocampal subfield analysis shows that a locus within the MSRB3 gene shows evidence of a localized effect along the dentate gyrus, subiculum, CA1 and fissure. Further, we show that genetic variants associated with decreased hippocampal volume are also associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (rg=-0.155). Our findings suggest novel biological pathways through which human genetic variation influences hippocampal volume and risk for neuropsychiatric illness. 	Nat_Commun	D016428
27671502	20160928	Genome-wide association study of working memory brain activation.	In a population-based genome-wide association (GWA) study of n-back working memory task-related brain activation, we extracted the average percent BOLD signal change (2-back minus 0-back) from 46 regions-of-interest (ROIs) in functional MRI scans from 863 healthy twins and siblings. ROIs were obtained by creating spheres around group random effects analysis local maxima, and by thresholding a voxel-based heritability map of working memory brain activation at 50%. Quality control for test-retest reliability and heritability of ROI measures yielded 20 reliable (r&gt;0.7) and heritable (h2&gt;20%) ROIs. For GWA analysis, the cohort was divided into a discovery (n=679) and replication (n=97) sample. No variants survived the stringent multiple-testing-corrected genome-wide significance threshold (p&lt;4.5×10-9), or were replicated (p&lt;0.0016), but several genes were identified that are worthy of further investigation. A search of 529,379 genomic markers resulted in discovery of 31 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BOLD signal change at a discovery level of p&lt;1×10-5. Two SNPs (rs7917410 and rs7672408) were associated at a significance level of p&lt;1×10-7. Only one, most strongly affecting BOLD signal change in the left supramarginal gyrus (R2=5.5%), had multiple SNPs associated at p&lt;1×10-5in linkage disequilibrium with it, all located in and around the BANK1 gene. BANK1 encodes a B-cell-specific scaffold protein and has been shown to negatively regulate CD40-mediated AKT activation. AKT is part of the dopamine-signaling pathway, suggesting a mechanism for the involvement of BANK1 in the BOLD response to working memory. Variants identified here may be relevant to (the susceptibility to) common disorders affecting brain function. 	Int_J_Psychophysiol	D016428 D018486 D052061 D013485
28560309	20170601	Single-nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with cognitive decline at Alzheimer's disease conversion within mild cognitive impairment patients.	The growing public threat of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has raised the urgency to quantify the degree of cognitive decline during the conversion process of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD and its underlying genetic pathway. The aim of this article was to test genetic common variants associated with accelerated cognitive decline after the conversion of MCI to AD. In 583 subjects with MCI enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; ADNI-1, ADNI-Go, and ADNI-2), 245 MCI participants converted to AD at follow-up. We tested the interaction effects between individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms and AD diagnosis trajectory on the longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition scores. Our findings reveal six genes, includingBDH1,ST6GAL1,RAB20,PDS5B,ADARB2, andSPSB1, which are directly or indirectly related to MCI conversion to AD. This genome-wide association study sheds light on a genetic mechanism of longitudinal cognitive changes during the transition period from MCI to AD. 	Alzheimers_Dement_(Amst)	D016428
28577822	20170605	Genome-wide association study of language performance in Alzheimer's disease.	Language impairment is common in prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and progresses over time. However, the genetic architecture underlying language performance is poorly understood. To identify novel genetic variants associated with language performance, we analyzed brain MRI and performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a composite measure of language performance from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n=1560). The language composite score was associated with brain atrophy on MRI in language and semantic areas. GWAS identified GLI3 (GLI family zinc finger 3) as significantly associated with language performance (p&lt;5×10-8). Enrichment of GWAS association was identified in pathways related to nervous system development and glutamate receptor function and trafficking. Our results, which warrant further investigation in independent and larger cohorts, implicate GLI3, a developmental transcription factor involved in patterning brain structures, as a putative gene associated with language dysfunction in AD.

28107422	20170121	Comparison of HapMap and 1000 Genomes Reference Panels in a Large-Scale Genome-Wide Association Study.	An increasing number of genome-wide association (GWA) studies are now using the higher resolution 1000 Genomes Project reference panel (1000G) for imputation, with the expectation that 1000G imputation will lead to the discovery of additional associated loci when compared to HapMap imputation. In order to assess the improvement of 1000G over HapMap imputation in identifying associated loci, we compared the results of GWA studies of circulating fibrinogen based on the two reference panels. Using both HapMap and 1000G imputation we performed a meta-analysis of 22 studies comprising the same 91,953 individuals. We identified six additional signals using 1000G imputation, while 29 loci were associated using both HapMap and 1000G imputation. One locus identified using HapMap imputation was not significant using 1000G imputation. The genome-wide significance threshold of 5×10-8 is based on the number of independent statistical tests using HapMap imputation, and 1000G imputation may lead to further independent tests that should be corrected for. When using a stricter Bonferroni correction for the 1000G GWA study (P-value &lt; 2.5×10-8), the number of loci significant only using HapMap imputation increased to 4 while the number of loci significant only using 1000G decreased to 5. In conclusion, 1000G imputation enabled the identification of 20% more loci than HapMap imputation, although the advantage of 1000G imputation became less clear when a stricter Bonferroni correction was used. More generally, our results provide insights that are applicable to the implementation of other dense reference panels that are under development. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428
28282560	20170311	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies novel loci of plaque burden in carotid artery.	Carotid artery plaque is an established marker of subclinical atherosclerosis and common patho-mechanisms with coronary artery disease (CAD) are hypothesized. We aimed to identify genetic variants associated with carotid plaque and to examine the potential shared genetic basis with CAD. After investigating the reliability of plaque detection, we performed a genome-wide meta-association study in two independent cohorts (LIFE-Adult, n = 4037 and LIFE-Heart, n = 3152) for carotid plaque score (PS), defined as the sum of the plaque load of common carotid artery and carotid bulb. Further, we analyzed whether previously reported CAD and stroke loci were also associated with PS. We identified two loci with genome-wide significance for PS. One locus is the known CAD-locus at chromosome 9p21 (lead SNP rs9644862, p = 8.73 × 10-12). We also describe a novel locus on chromosome 10q24 within the SFXN2 gene as the most probable candidate (lead SNP rs2902548, p = 1.97 × 10-8). In addition, 17 out of 58 known CAD loci and six of 17 known stroke loci were associated with PS at a nominal level of significance. We showed that PS is a reliable trait to analyze genetics of atherosclerosis. Two new loci of genome-wide significant association with PS were found. The observed non-random overlap of CAD and PS associations strengthens the hypothesis of a shared genetic basis for these atherosclerotic manifestations. 	Atherosclerosis	D016428 D017418
28194004	20170215	Genetic contributions to self-reported tiredness.	Self-reported tiredness and low energy, often called fatigue, are associated with poorer physical and mental health. Twin studies have indicated that this has a heritability between 6 and 50%. In the UK Biobank sample (N=108?976), we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of responses to the question, 'Over the last two weeks, how often have you felt tired or had little energy?' Univariate GCTA-GREML found that the proportion of variance explained by all common single-nucleotide polymorphisms for this tiredness question was 8.4% (s.e.=0.6%). GWAS identified one genome-wide significant hit (Affymetrix id 1:64178756_C_T; P=1.36 × 10-11). Linkage disequilibrium score regression and polygenic profile score analyses were used to test for shared genetic aetiology between tiredness and up to 29 physical and mental health traits from GWAS consortia. Significant genetic correlations were identified between tiredness and body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, forced expiratory volume, grip strength, HbA1c, longevity, obesity, self-rated health, smoking status, triglycerides, type 2 diabetes, waist-hip ratio, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, neuroticism, schizophrenia and verbal-numerical reasoning (absolute rgeffect sizes between 0.02 and 0.78). Significant associations were identified between tiredness phenotypic scores and polygenic profile scores for BMI, HDL cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, coronary artery disease, C-reactive protein, HbA1c, height, obesity, smoking status, triglycerides, type 2 diabetes, waist-hip ratio, childhood cognitive ability, neuroticism, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and schizophrenia (standardised ?'s had absolute values&lt;0.03). These results suggest that tiredness is a partly heritable, heterogeneous and complex phenomenon that is phenotypically and genetically associated with affective, cognitive, personality and physiological processes.

28472463	20170505	Genome-wide association study meta-analysis for quantitative ultrasound parameters of bone identifies five novel loci for broadband ultrasound attenuation.	Osteoporosis is a common and debilitating bone disease that is characterised by low bone mineral density, typically assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Quantitative ultrasound (QUS), commonly utilising the two parameters velocity of sound (VOS) and broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), is an alternative technology used to assess bone properties at peripheral skeletal sites. The genetic influence on the bone qualities assessed by QUS remains an under-studied area. We performed a comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) including low-frequency variants (minor allele frequency ?0.005) for BUA and VOS using a discovery population of individuals with whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from the UK10K project (n?=?1268). These results were then meta-analysed with those from two deeply imputed GWAS replication cohorts (n?=?1610 and 13?749). In the gender-combined analysis, we identified eight loci associated with BUA and five with VOS at the genome-wide significance level, including three novel loci for BUA at 8p23.1 (PPP1R3B), 11q23.1 (LOC387810) and 22q11.21 (SEPT5) (P?=?2.4?×?10-8 to 1.6?×?10-9). Gene-based association testing in the gender-combined dataset revealed eight loci associated with BUA and seven with VOS after correction for multiple testing, with one novel locus for BUA at FAM167A (8p23.1) (P?=?1.4?×?10-6). An additional novel locus for BUA was seen in the male-specific analysis at DEFB103B (8p23.1) (P?=?1.8?×?10-6). Fracture analysis revealed significant associations between variation at the WNT16 and RSPO3 loci and fracture risk (P?=?0.004 and 4.0?×?10-4, respectively). In conclusion, by performing a large GWAS meta-analysis for QUS parameters of bone using a combination of WGS and deeply imputed genotype data, we have identified five novel genetic loci associated with BUA.

28542097	20170526	Genome-wide association and pathway analysis of left ventricular function after anthracycline exposure in adults.	Anthracyclines are important chemotherapeutic agents, but their use is limited by cardiotoxicity. Candidate gene and genome-wide studies have identified putative risk loci for overt cardiotoxicity and heart failure, but there has been no comprehensive assessment of genomic variation influencing the intermediate phenotype of anthracycline-related changes in left ventricular (LV) function. The purpose of this study was to identify genetic factors influencing changes in LV function after anthracycline chemotherapy. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of change in LV function after anthracycline exposure in 385 patients identified from BioVU, a resource linking DNA samples to de-identified electronic medical record data. Variants with P values less than 1×10 were independently tested for replication in a cohort of 181 anthracycline-exposed patients from a prospective clinical trial. Pathway analysis was performed to assess combined effects of multiple genetic variants. Both cohorts were middle-aged adults of predominantly European descent. Among 11 candidate loci identified in discovery GWAS, one single nucleotide polymorphism near PR domain containing 2, with ZNF domain (PRDM2), rs7542939, had a combined P value of 6.5×10 in meta-analysis. Eighteen Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes pathways showed strong enrichment for variants associated with the primary outcome. Identified pathways related to DNA repair, cellular metabolism, and cardiac remodeling. Using genome-wide association we identified a novel candidate susceptibility locus near PRDM2. Variation in genes belonging to pathways related to DNA repair, metabolism, and cardiac remodeling may influence changes in LV function after anthracycline exposure. 	Pharmacogenet._Genomics	D016428
28346442	20170328	Identification of 12 new susceptibility loci for different histotypes of epithelial ovarian cancer.	To identify common alleles associated with different histotypes of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), we pooled data from multiple genome-wide genotyping projects totaling 25,509 EOC cases and 40,941 controls. We identified nine new susceptibility loci for different EOC histotypes: six for serous EOC histotypes (3q28, 4q32.3, 8q21.11, 10q24.33, 18q11.2 and 22q12.1), two for mucinous EOC (3q22.3 and 9q31.1) and one for endometrioid EOC (5q12.3). We then performed meta-analysis on the results for high-grade serous ovarian cancer with the results from analysis of 31,448 BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, including 3,887 mutation carriers with EOC. This identified three additional susceptibility loci at 2q13, 8q24.1 and 12q24.31. Integrated analyses of genes and regulatory biofeatures at each locus predicted candidate susceptibility genes, including OBFC1, a new candidate susceptibility gene for low-grade and borderline serous EOC.

28644415	20170624	Genome-Wide Association Study of Dietary Pattern Scores.	Dietary patterns, representing global food supplies rather than specific nutrients or food intakes, have been associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and mortality. The contribution of genetic factors in the determination of food intakes, preferences and dietary patterns has been previously established. The current study aimed to identify novel genetic factors associated with reported dietary pattern scores. Reported dietary patterns scores were derived from reported dietary intakes for the preceding month and were obtained through a food frequency questionnaire and genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted in a study sample of 141 individuals. Reported Prudent and Western dietary patterns demonstrated nominal associations (p&lt; 1 × 10-5) with 78 and 27 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), respectively. Among these, SNPs annotated to genes previously associated with neurological disorders, CVD risk factors and obesity were identified. Further assessment of SNPs demonstrated an impact on gene expression levels in blood for SNPs located within/nearBCKDHB(p= 0.02) and the hypothalamic glucosensorPFKFB3(p= 0.0004) genes, potentially mediated through an impact on the binding of transcription factors (TFs). Overrepresentations of glucose/energy homeostasis and hormone response TFs were also observed from SNP-surrounding sequences. Results from the current GWAS study suggest an interplay of genes involved in the metabolic response to dietary patterns on obesity, glucose metabolism and food-induced response in the brain in the adoption of dietary patterns.

28039263	20170101	WFS1 and Other Mendelian Deafness Genes Are Associated with Cisplatin-Associated Ototoxicity.	 Purpose: Cisplatin is one of the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs worldwide and one of the most ototoxic. We sought to identify genetic variants that modulate cisplatin-associated ototoxicity (CAO).Experimental Design:We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of CAO using quantitative audiometry (4-12 kHz) in 511 testicular cancer survivors of European genetic ancestry. We performed polygenic modeling and functional analyses using a variety of publicly available databases. We used an electronic health record cohort to replicate our top mechanistic finding.Results:One SNP, rs62283056, in the first intron of Mendelian deafness geneWFS1(wolframin ER transmembrane glycoprotein) and an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) forWFS1met genome-wide significance for association with CAO (P= 1.4 × 10-8). A significant interaction between cumulative cisplatin dose and rs62283056 genotype was evident, indicating that higher cisplatin doses exacerbate hearing loss in patients with the minor allele (P= 0.035). The association between decreasedWFS1expression and hearing loss was replicated in an independent BioVU cohort (n= 18,620 patients, Bonferroni adjustedP&lt; 0.05). Beyond this top signal, we show CAO is a polygenic trait and that SNPs in and near 84 known Mendelian deafness genes are significantly enriched for lowPvalues in the GWAS (P= 0.048).Conclusions:We show for the first time the role ofWFS1in CAO and document a statistically significant interaction between increasing cumulative cisplatin dose and rs62283056 genotype. Our clinical translational results demonstrate that pretherapy patient genotyping to minimize ototoxicity could be useful when deciding between cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens of comparable efficacy with different cumulative doses.Clin Cancer Res; 23(13); 3325-33. ©2016 AACR.

28195142	20170215	A genome-wide association study yields five novel thyroid cancer risk loci.	The great majority of thyroid cancers are of the non-medullary type. Here we report findings from a genome-wide association study of non-medullary thyroid cancer, including in total 3,001 patients and 287,550 controls from five study groups of European descent. Our results yield five novel loci (all with Pcombined&lt;3 × 10-8): 1q42.2 (rs12129938 in PCNXL2), 3q26.2 (rs6793295 a missense mutation in LRCC34 near TERC), 5q22.1 (rs73227498 between NREP and EPB41L4A), 10q24.33 (rs7902587 near OBFC1), and two independently associated variants at 15q22.33 (rs2289261 and rs56062135; both in SMAD3). We also confirm recently published association results from a Chinese study of a variant on 5p15.33 (rs2736100 near the TERT gene) and present a stronger association result for a moderately correlated variant (rs10069690; OR=1.20, P=3.2 × 10-7) based on our study of individuals of European ancestry. In combination, these results raise several opportunities for future studies of the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer. 	Nat_Commun	D016428
27193031	20160520	A combined large-scale meta-analysis identifies COG6 as a novel shared risk locus for rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.	During the last years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified a number of common genetic risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the genetic overlap between these two immune-mediated diseases has not been thoroughly examined so far. The aim of the present study was to identify additional risk loci shared between RA and SLE. We performed a large-scale meta-analysis of GWAS data from RA (3911 cases and 4083 controls) and SLE (2237 cases and 6315 controls). The top-associated polymorphisms in the discovery phase were selected for replication in additional datasets comprising 13?641 RA cases and 31?921 controls and 1957 patients with SLE and 4588 controls. The rs9603612 genetic variant, located nearby the COG6 gene, an established susceptibility locus for RA, reached genome-wide significance in the combined analysis including both discovery and replication sets (p value=2.95E-13). In silico expression quantitative trait locus analysis revealed that the associated polymorphism acts as a regulatory variant influencing COG6 expression. Moreover, protein-protein interaction and gene ontology enrichment analyses suggested the existence of overlap with specific biological processes, specially the type I interferon signalling pathway. Finally, genetic correlation and polygenic risk score analyses showed cross-phenotype associations between RA and SLE. In conclusion, we have identified a new risk locus shared between RA and SLE through a meta-analysis including GWAS datasets of both diseases. This study represents the first comprehensive large-scale analysis on the genetic overlap between these two complex disorders. 	Ann._Rheum._Dis.	D016428 D017418
28439531	20170426	Genome- and CD4+ T-cell methylome-wide association study of circulating trimethylamine-N-oxide in the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN).	Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), an atherogenic metabolite species, has emerged as a possible new risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Animal studies have shown that circulating TMAO levels are regulated by genetic and environmental factors. However, large-scale human studies have failed to replicate the observed genetic associations, and epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation have never been examined in relation to TMAO levels. We used data from the family-based Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN) to investigate the heritable determinants of plasma TMAO in humans. TMAO was not associated with other plasma markers of cardiovascular disease, e.g. lipids or inflammatory cytokines. We first estimated TMAO heritability at 27%, indicating a moderate genetic influence. We used 1000 Genomes imputed data (n=626) to estimate genome-wide associations with TMAO levels, adjusting for age, sex, family relationships, and study site. The genome-wide study yielded one significant hit at the genome-wide level, located in an intergenic region on chromosome 4. We subsequently quantified epigenome-wide DNA methylation using the Illumina Infinium array on CD4+ T-cells. We tested for association of methylation loci with circulating TMAO (n=847), adjusting for age, sex, family relationships, and study site as the genome-wide study plus principal components capturing CD4+ T-cell purity. Upon adjusting for multiple testing, none of the epigenetic findings were statistically significant. Our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence suggesting that neither genetic nor epigenetic factors play a critical role in establishing circulating TMAO levels in humans.

28029757	20161229	Identification of Functional and Expression Polymorphisms Associated With Risk for Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Autoantibody-Associated Vasculitis.	To identify risk alleles relevant to the causal and biologic mechanisms of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV). A genome-wide association study and subsequent replication study were conducted in a total cohort of 1,986 cases of AAV (patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis [Wegener's] [GPA] or microscopic polyangiitis [MPA]) and 4,723 healthy controls. Meta-analysis of these data sets and functional annotation of identified risk loci were performed, and candidate disease variants with unknown functional effects were investigated for their impact on gene expression and/or protein function. Among the genome-wide significant associations identified, the largest effect on risk of AAV came from the single-nucleotide polymorphism variants rs141530233 and rs1042169 at the HLA-DPB1 locus (odds ratio [OR] 2.99 and OR 2.82, respectively) which, together with a third variant, rs386699872, constitute a triallelic risk haplotype associated with reduced expression of the HLA-DPB1 gene and HLA-DP protein in B cells and monocytes and with increased frequency of complementary proteinase 3 (PR3)-reactive T cells relative to that in carriers of the protective haplotype. Significant associations were also observed at the SERPINA1 and PTPN22 loci, the peak signals arising from functionally relevant missense variants, and at PRTN3, in which the top-scoring variant correlated with increased PRTN3 expression in neutrophils. Effects of individual loci on AAV risk differed between patients with GPA and those with MPA or between patients with PR3-ANCAs and those with myeloperoxidase-ANCAs, but the collective population attributable fraction for these variants was substantive, at 77%. This study reveals the association of susceptibility to GPA and MPA with functional gene variants that explain much of the genetic etiology of AAV, could influence and possibly be predictors of the clinical presentation, and appear to alter immune cell proteins and responses likely to be key factors in the pathogenesis of AAV.

27769005	20161022	A genome wide association study suggests the association of muskelin with early onset bipolar disorder: Implications for a GABAergic epileptogenic neurogenesis model.	Although multiple genes have been implicated in bipolar disorder (BD), they explain only a small proportion of its heritability. Identifying additional BD risk variants may be impaired by phenotypic heterogeneity, which is usually not taken into account in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). BD with early age at onset is a more homogeneous familial form of the disorder associated with greater symptom severity. We conducted a GWAS of early-onset BD (onset of mania/hypomania ?19 years old) in a discovery sample of 419 cases and 1034 controls and a replication sample of 181 cases and 777 controls. These two samples were meta-analyzed, followed by replication of one signal in a third independent sample of 141 cases and 746 controls. No single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations were genome-wide significant in the discovery sample. Of the top 15 SNPs in the discovery analysis, rs114034759 in the muskelin (MKLN1) gene was nominally significant in the replication analysis, and was among the top associations in the meta-analysis (p=2.63E-06, OR=1.9). In the third sample, this SNP was again associated with early-onset BD (p=0.036, OR=1.6). Gene expression analysis showed that the rs114034759 risk allele is associated with decreased hippocampal MKLN1 expression. The sample sizes of the early-onset BD subgroups were relatively small. Our results suggest MKLN1 is associated with early-onset BD. MKLN1 regulates cellular trafficking of GABA-A receptors, which is involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity, and is implicated in the mechanism of action of a group of antiepileptic mood stabilizers. These results therefore indicate that GABAergic neurotransmission may be implicated in early-onset BD. We propose that an increase in GABA-A receptors in the hippocampus in BD patients due to lower MKLN1 expression might increase the excitability during the GABA-excited early phase of young neurons, leading to an increased risk of developing a manic/hypomanic episode. Further studies are needed to test this model. 	J_Affect_Disord	D016428 D017418
27899403	20161201	Meta-Analysis of Genome-Wide Association Studies for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Identifies Four New Disease-Specific Risk Loci.	Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a complex disease with both genetic and environmental risk factors. Together, 6 previously identified risk loci only explain a small proportion of the heritability of AAA. To identify additional AAA risk loci using data from all available genome-wide association studies. Through a meta-analysis of 6 genome-wide association study data sets and a validation study totaling 10?204 cases and 107?766 controls, we identified 4 new AAA risk loci: 1q32.3 (SMYD2), 13q12.11 (LINC00540), 20q13.12 (near PCIF1/MMP9/ZNF335), and 21q22.2 (ERG). In various database searches, we observed no new associations between the lead AAA single nucleotide polymorphisms and coronary artery disease, blood pressure, lipids, or diabetes mellitus. Network analyses identified ERG, IL6R, and LDLR as modifiers of MMP9, with a direct interaction between ERG and MMP9. The 4 new risk loci for AAA seem to be specific for AAA compared with other cardiovascular diseases and related traits suggesting that traditional cardiovascular risk factor management may only have limited value in preventing the progression of aneurysmal disease.

27993963	20161221	Genome-Wide Association Study for Anthracycline-Induced Congestive Heart Failure.	Anthracycline-induced congestive heart failure (CHF) is a rare but serious toxicity associated with this commonly employed anticancer therapy. The ability to predict which patients might be at increased risk prior to exposure would be valuable to optimally counsel risk-to-benefit ratio for each patient. Herein, we present a genome-wide approach for biomarker discovery with two validation cohorts to predict CHF from adult patients planning to receive anthracycline. We performed a genome-wide association study in 3,431 patients from the randomized phase III adjuvant breast cancer trial E5103 to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes associated with an increased risk of anthracycline-induced CHF. We further attempted candidate validation in two independent phase III adjuvant trials, E1199 and BEATRICE. When evaluating for cardiologist-adjudicated CHF, 11 SNPs had a P value &lt;10-5, of which nine independent chromosomal regions were associated with increased risk. Validation of the top two SNPs in E1199 revealed one SNP rs28714259 that demonstrated a borderline increased CHF risk (P = 0.04, OR = 1.9). rs28714259 was subsequently tested in BEATRICE and was significantly associated with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (P = 0.018, OR = 4.2). rs28714259 represents a validated SNP that is associated with anthracycline-induced CHF in three independent, phase III adjuvant breast cancer clinical trials.

28087736	20170115	Imputation of orofacial clefting data identifies novel risk loci and sheds light on the genetic background of cleft lip ± cleft palate and cleft palate only.	Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (nsCL/P) is among the most common human birth defects with multifactorial etiology. Here, we present results from a genome-wide imputation study of nsCL/P in which, after adding replication cohort data, four novel risk loci for nsCL/P are identified (at chromosomal regions 2p21, 14q22, 15q24 and 19p13). On a systematic level, we show that the association signals within this high-density dataset are enriched in functionally-relevant genomic regions that are active in both human neural crest cells (hNCC) and mouse embryonic craniofacial tissue. This enrichment is also detectable in hNCC regions primed for later activity. Using GCTA analyses, we suggest that 30% of the estimated variance in risk for nsCL/P in the European population can be attributed to common variants, with 25.5% contributed to by the 24 risk loci known to date. For each of these, we identify credible SNPs using a Bayesian refinement approach, with two loci harbouring only one probable causal variant. Finally, we demonstrate that there is no polygenic component of nsCL/P detectable that is shared with nonsyndromic cleft palate only (nsCPO). Our data suggest that, while common variants are strongly contributing to risk for nsCL/P, they do not seem to be involved in nsCPO which might be more often caused by rare deleterious variants. Our study generates novel insights into both nsCL/P and nsCPO etiology and provides a systematic framework for research into craniofacial development and malformation. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428
28179588	20170210	TP53-based interaction analysis identifies cis-eQTL variants for TP53BP2, FBXO28, and FAM53A that associate with survival and treatment outcome in breast cancer.	TP53 overexpression is indicative of somatic TP53 mutations and associates with aggressive tumors and poor prognosis in breast cancer. We utilized a two-stage SNP association study to detect variants associated with breast cancer survival in a TP53-dependent manner. Initially, a genome-wide study (n = 575 cases) was conducted to discover candidate SNPs for genotyping and validation in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). The SNPs were then tested for interaction with tumor TP53 status (n = 4,610) and anthracycline treatment (n = 17,828). For SNPs interacting with anthracycline treatment, siRNA knockdown experiments were carried out to validate candidate genes.In the test for interaction between SNP genotype and TP53 status, we identified one locus, represented by rs10916264 (p(interaction) = 3.44 × 10-5; FDR-adjusted p = 0.0011) in estrogen receptor (ER) positive cases. The rs10916264 AA genotype associated with worse survival among cases with ER-positive, TP53-positive tumors (hazard ratio [HR] 2.36, 95% confidence interval [C.I] 1.45 - 3.82). This is a cis-eQTL locus for FBXO28 and TP53BP2; expression levels of these genes were associated with patient survival specifically in ER-positive, TP53-mutated tumors. Additionally, the SNP rs798755 was associated with survival in interaction with anthracycline treatment (p(interaction) = 9.57 × 10-5, FDR-adjusted p = 0.0130). RNAi-based depletion of a predicted regulatory target gene, FAM53A, indicated that this gene can modulate doxorubicin sensitivity in breast cancer cell lines.If confirmed in independent data sets, these results may be of clinical relevance in the development of prognostic and predictive marker panels for breast cancer.

28355295	20170330	Risk prediction of pulmonary tuberculosis using genetic and conventional risk factors in adult Korean population.	A complex interplay among host, pathogen, and environmental factors is believed to contribute to the risk of developing pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). The lack of replication of published genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings limits the clinical utility of reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We conducted a GWAS using 467 PTB cases and 1,313 healthy controls obtained from two community-based cohorts in Korea. We evaluated the performance of PTB risk models based on different combinations of genetic and nongenetic factors and validated the results in an independent Korean population comprised of 179 PTB cases and 500 healthy controls. We demonstrated the polygenic nature of PTB and nongenetic factors such as age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) were strongly associated with PTB risk. None of the SNPs achieved genome-wide significance; instead, we were able to replicate the associations between PTB and ten SNPs near or in the genes, CDCA7, GBE1, GADL1, SPATA16, C6orf118, KIAA1432, DMRT2, CTR9, CCDC67, and CDH13, which may play roles in the immune and inflammatory pathways. Among the replicated SNPs, an intergenic SNP, rs9365798, located downstream of the C6orf118 gene showed the most significant association under the dominant model (OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.32-1.92, P = 2.1×10-6). The performance of a risk model combining the effects of ten replicated SNPs and six nongenetic factors (i.e., age, sex, BMI, cigarette smoking, systolic blood pressure, and hemoglobin) were validated in the replication set (AUC = 0.80, 95% CI 0.76-0.84). The strategy of combining genetic and nongenetic risk factors ultimately resulted in better risk prediction for PTB in the adult Korean population. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428

The international Testicular Cancer Consortium (TECAC) combined five published genome-wide association studies of testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT; 3,558 cases and 13,970 controls) to identify new susceptibility loci. We conducted a fixed-effects meta-analysis, including, to our knowledge, the first analysis of the X chromosome. Eight new loci mapping to 2q14.2, 3q26.2, 4q35.2, 7q36.3, 10q26.13, 15q21.3, 15q22.31, and Xq28 achieved genome-wide significance (P &lt; 5 × 10-8). Most loci harbor biologically plausible candidate genes. We refined previously reported associations at 9p24.3 and 19p12 by identifying one and three additional independent SNPs, respectively. In aggregate, the 39 independent markers identified to date explain 37% of father-to-son familial risk, 8% of which can be attributed to the 12 new signals reported here. Our findings substantially increase the number of known TGCT susceptibility alleles, move the field closer to a comprehensive understanding of the underlying genetic architecture of TGCT, and provide further clues to the etiology of TGCT.

28100725	20170120	MAPT</i>locus influencing human plasma tau levels.	To identify genetic loci associated with plasma tau concentrations in healthy elders and individuals with Alzheimer disease. Four hundred sixty-three non-Hispanic white individuals exceeding quality control criteria were included from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) cohort. Association of plasma tau with genetic polymorphisms was performed with a linear regression model. Significant associations were validated in an independent replication cohort consisting of 431 healthy elders or individuals with mild cognitive impairment recruited from the University of California, San Francisco Memory and Aging Center. The minor allele (A) of rs242557 in the microtubule-associated protein tau gene (MAPT) was associated with higher plasma tau levels at genome-wide significance (p= 4.85 × 10-9, empiric family-wise error correctedp= 0.0024) in a dose-dependent fashion. This association was also observed in the replication cohort (p= 1.0 × 10-5; joint analysisp= 1.2 × 10-12). Single nucleotide polymorphisms nearPARK2(rs2187213) (p= 6.15 × 10-6),IL2RA(rs7072793, rs7073236) (p= 7.89 × 10-6), and an intergenic locus on 9p21.3 (rs7047280) (p= 8.13 × 10-6) were identified as suggestive loci associated with plasma tau levels. MAPT H1c haplotype (rs242557) has previously been identified as a genetic risk factor for progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. The current findings suggest that plasma tau concentration could be an endophenotype for identifying risk for 4-repeat tauopathies in older individuals. 	Neurology	D016428
28608620	20170614	Genome-wide association study of facial emotion recognition in children and association with polygenic risk for mental health disorders.	Emotion recognition is disrupted in many mental health disorders, which may reflect shared genetic aetiology between this trait and these disorders. We explored genetic influences on emotion recognition and the relationship between these influences and mental health phenotypes. Eight-year-old participants (n?=?4,097) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) completed the Diagnostic Analysis of Non-Verbal Accuracy (DANVA) faces test. Genome-wide genotype data was available from the Illumina HumanHap550 Quad microarray. Genome-wide association studies were performed to assess associations with recognition of individual emotions and emotion in general. Exploratory polygenic risk scoring was performed using published genomic data for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, autism spectrum disorder, anorexia, and anxiety disorders. No individual genetic variants were identified at conventional levels of significance in any analysis although several loci were associated at a level suggestive of significance. SNP-chip heritability analyses did not identify a heritable component of variance for any phenotype. Polygenic scores were not associated with any phenotype. The effect sizes of variants influencing emotion recognition are likely to be small. Previous studies of emotion identification have yielded non-zero estimates of SNP-heritability. This discrepancy is likely due to differences in the measurement and analysis of the phenotype. 	Am._J._Med._Genet._B_Neuropsychiatr._Genet.	D016428
27629369	20160916	Genome-Wide Association Study of Loneliness Demonstrates a Role for Common Variation.	Loneliness is a complex biological trait that has been associated with numerous negative health outcomes. The measurement and environmental determinants of loneliness are well understood, but its genetic basis is not. Previous studies have estimated the heritability of loneliness between 37 and 55% using twins and family-based approaches, and have explored the role of specific candidate genes. We used genotypic and phenotypic data from 10?760 individuals aged ?50 years that were collected by the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to perform the first genome-wide association study of loneliness. No associations reached genome-wide significance (p&gt;5 × 10-8). Furthermore, none of the previously published associations between variants within candidate genes (BDNF, OXTR, RORA, GRM8, CHRNA4, IL-1A, CRHR1, MTHFR, DRD2, APOE) and loneliness were replicated (p&gt;0.05), despite our much larger sample size. We estimated the chip heritability of loneliness and examined coheritability between loneliness and several personality and psychiatric traits. Our estimates of chip heritability (14-27%) support a role for common genetic variation. We identified strong genetic correlations between loneliness, neuroticism, and a scale of 'depressive symptoms.' We also identified weaker evidence for coheritability with extraversion, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. We conclude that loneliness, as defined in this study, is a modestly heritable trait that has a highly polygenic genetic architecture. The coheritability between loneliness and neuroticism may reflect the role of negative affectivity that is common to both traits. Our results also reflect the value of studies that probe the common genetic basis of salutary social bonds and clinically defined psychiatric disorders. 	Neuropsychopharmacology	D016428
28135244	20170131	Genome-wide association analysis identifies novel blood pressure loci and offers biological insights into cardiovascular risk.	Elevated blood pressure is the leading heritable risk factor for cardiovascular disease worldwide. We report genetic association of blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, pulse pressure) among UK Biobank participants of European ancestry with independent replication in other cohorts, and robust validation of 107 independent loci. We also identify new independent variants at 11 previously reported blood pressure loci. In combination with results from a range of in silico functional analyses and wet bench experiments, our findings highlight new biological pathways for blood pressure regulation enriched for genes expressed in vascular tissues and identify potential therapeutic targets for hypertension. Results from genetic risk score models raise the possibility of a precision medicine approach through early lifestyle intervention to offset the impact of blood pressure-raising genetic variants on future cardiovascular disease risk.

28447399	20170428	Genome-wide association study of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND): A CHARTER group study.	HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) often complicates HIV infection despite combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) and may be influenced by host genomics. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of HAND in 1,050 CNS HIV Anti-Retroviral Therapy Effects Research (CHARTER) Study participants. All participants underwent standardized, comprehensive neurocognitive, and neuromedical assessments to determine if they had cognitive impairment as assessed by the Global Deficit Score (GDS), and individuals with comorbidities that could confound diagnosis of HAND were excluded. Neurocognitive outcomes included GDS-defined neurocognitive impairment (NCI; binary GDS, 366 cases with GDS???0.5 and 684 controls with GDS?&lt;?0.5, and GDS as a continuous variable) and Frascati HAND definitions that incorporate assessment of functional impairment by self-report and performance-based criteria. Genotype data were obtained using the Affymetrix Human SNP Array 6.0 platform. Multivariable logistic or linear regression-based association tests were performed for GDS-defined NCI and HAND. GWAS results did not reveal SNPs meeting the genome-wide significance threshold (5.0?×?10-8) for GDS-defined NCI or HAND. For binary GDS, the most significant SNPs were rs6542826 (P?=?8.1?×?10-7) and rs11681615 (1.2?×?10-6), both located on chromosome 2 in SH3RF3. The most significant SNP for continuous GDS was rs11157436 (P?=?1.3?×?10-7) on chromosome 14 in the T-cell-receptor alpha locus; three other SNPs in this gene were also associated with binary GDS (P???2.9?×?10-6). This GWAS, conducted among ART-era participants from a single cohort with robust neurological phenotyping, suggests roles for several biologically plausible loci in HAND that deserve further exploration. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

28193307	20170215	Heritability and GWAS Studies for Monocyte-Lymphocyte Ratio.	The monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) is a useful biomarker for disease development, but little is known about the extent to which genetic and environmental factors influence MLR variation. Here, we study the genetic architecture of MLR and determine the influence of demographic and lifestyle factors on MLR in data from a Dutch non-patient twin-family population. Data were obtained in 9,501 individuals from the Netherlands Twin Register. We used regression analyses to determine the effects of age, sex, smoking, and body mass index (BMI) on MLR and its subcomponents. Data on twins, siblings and parents (N = 7,513) were analyzed by genetic structural equation modeling to establish heritability and genome wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from a genotyped subsample (N = 5,892) and used to estimate heritability explained by SNPs. SNP and phenotype data were also analyzed in a genome-wide association study to identify the genes involved in MLR. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses were performed to further explore the genetic findings. Results showed that age, sex, and age × sex interaction effects were present for MLR and its subcomponents. Variation in MLR was not related to BMI, but smoking was positively associated with MLR. Heritability was estimated at 40% for MLR, 58% for monocyte, and 58% for lymphocyte count. The Genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a locus on ITGA4 that was associated with MLR and only marginally significantly associated with monocyte count. For monocyte count, additional genetic variants were identified on ITPR3, LPAP1, and IRF8. For lymphocyte count, GWAS provided no significant findings. Taking all measured SNPs together, their effects accounted for 13% of the heritability of MLR, while all known and identified genetic loci explained 1.3% of variation in MLR. eQTL analyses showed that these genetic variants were unlikely to be eQTLs. In conclusion, variation in MLR level in the general population is heritable and influenced by age, sex, and smoking. We identified gene variants in the ITGA4 gene associated with variation in MLR. The significant SNP-heritability indicates that more genetic variants are likely to be involved. 	Twin_Res_Hum_Genet	D016428 D018486 D052061 D013485
28540026	20170526	Meta-analysis of GWAS of over 16,000 individuals with autism spectrum disorder highlights a novel locus at 10q24.32 and a significant overlap with schizophrenia.	Over the past decade genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been applied to aid in the understanding of the biology of traits. The success of this approach is governed by the underlying effect sizes carried by the true risk variants and the corresponding statistical power to observe such effects given the study design and sample size under investigation. Previous ASD GWAS have identified genome-wide significant (GWS) risk loci; however, these studies were of only of low statistical power to identify GWS loci at the lower effect sizes (odds ratio (OR) &lt;1.15). We conducted a large-scale coordinated international collaboration to combine independent genotyping data to improve the statistical power and aid in robust discovery of GWS loci. This study uses genome-wide genotyping data from a discovery sample (7387 ASD cases and 8567 controls) followed by meta-analysis of summary statistics from two replication sets (7783 ASD cases and 11359 controls; and 1369 ASD cases and 137308 controls). We observe a GWS locus at 10q24.32 that overlaps several genes includingPITX3, which encodes a transcription factor identified as playing a role in neuronal differentiation andCUEDC2previously reported to be associated with social skills in an independent population cohort. We also observe overlap with regions previously implicated in schizophrenia which was further supported by a strong genetic correlation between these disorders (Rg?=?0.23;P?=?9?×?10-6). We further combined these Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) ASD GWAS data with the recent PGC schizophrenia GWAS to identify additional regions which may be important in a common neurodevelopmental phenotype and identified 12 novel GWS loci. These include loci previously implicated in ASD such asFOXP1at 3p13,ATP2B2at 3p25.3, and a 'neurodevelopmental hub' on chromosome 8p11.23. This study is an important step in the ongoing endeavour to identify the loci which underpin the common variant signal in ASD. In addition to novel GWS loci, we have identified a significant genetic correlation with schizophrenia and association of ASD with several neurodevelopmental-related genes such asEXT1,ASTN2,MACROD2, andHDAC4.

28235828	20170226	Independent Maternal and Fetal Genetic Effects on Midgestational Circulating Levels of Environmental Pollutants.	Maternal exposure to environmental pollutants could affect fetal brain development and increase autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in conjunction with differential genetic susceptibility. Organohalogen congeners measured in maternal midpregnancy blood samples have recently shown significant, but negative associations with offspring ASD outcome. We report the first large-scale maternal and fetal genetic study of the midpregnancy serum levels of a set of 21 organohalogens in a subset of 790 genotyped women and 764 children collected in California by the Early Markers for Autism (EMA) Project. Levels of PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) and PBDE (polybrominated diphenyl ether) congeners showed high maternal and fetal estimated SNP-based heritability (h2 g ) accounting for 39-99% of the total variance. Genome-wide association analyses identified significant maternal loci for p,p'-DDE (P= 7.8 × 10-11) in theCYP2B6gene and for BDE-28 (P= 3.2 × 10-8) near theSH3GL2gene, both involved in xenobiotic and lipid metabolism. Fetal genetic loci contributed to the levels of BDE-100 (P= 4.6 × 10-8) and PCB187 (P= 2.8 × 10-8), near the potential metabolic genesLOXHD1andPTPRD, previously implicated in neurodevelopment. Negative associations were observed for BDE-100, BDE153, and the sum of PBDEs with ASD, partly explained by genome-wide additive genetic effects that predicted PBDE levels. Our results support genetic control of midgestational biomarkers for environmental exposures by nonoverlapping maternal and fetal genetic determinants, suggesting that future studies of environmental risk factors should take genetic variation into consideration. The independent influence of fetal genetics supports previous hypotheses that fetal genotypes expressed in placenta can influence maternal physiology and the transplacental transfer of organohalogens.

27523435	20160816	No evidence of large genetic effects on steroid response in asthma patients.	Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are considered the most effective anti-inflammatory therapy for asthma control and management; however, there is substantial treatment response variability. We sought to identify genetic markers of ICS response by conducting the largest pharmacogenetic investigation to date in 2672 ICS-treated patients with asthma. Genotyping and imputation was performed in fluticasone furoate (FF) or fluticasone propionate-treated patients with asthma from 3 phase IIB and 4 phase IIIA randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter studies. The primary end point analyzed was change in trough FEV1(?FEV1) from baseline to 8 to 12 weeks of treatment. More than 9.8 million common genetic variants (minor allele frequency ? 1%) were analyzed to test for association with ?FEV1. No genetic variant met the prespecified threshold for statistical significance. This study provides no evidence to confirm previously reported associations between candidate genetic variants and ICS response (?FEV1) in patients with asthma. In addition, no variant satisfied the criterion for genome-wide significance in our study. Common genetic variants are therefore unlikely to prove useful as predictive biomarkers of ICS response in patients with asthma. 	J._Allergy_Clin._Immunol.	D017427 D017428 D016428 D016448 D016449
28223688	20170223	Sequence variant at 8q24.21 associates with sciatica caused by lumbar disc herniation.	Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is common and often debilitating. Microdiscectomy of herniated lumbar discs (LDHsurg) is performed on the most severe cases to resolve the resulting sciatica. Here we perform a genome-wide association study on 4,748 LDHsurg cases and 282,590 population controls and discover 37 highly correlated markers associating with LDHsurg at 8q24.21 (between CCDC26 and GSDMC), represented by rs6651255[C] (OR=0.81; P=5.6 × 10-12) with a stronger effect among younger patients than older. As rs6651255[C] also associates with height, we performed a Mendelian randomization analysis using height polygenic risk scores as instruments to estimate the effect of height on LDHsurg risk, and found that the marker's association with LDHsurg is much greater than predicted by its effect on height. In light of presented findings, we speculate that the effect of rs6651255 on LDHsurg is driven by susceptibility to developing severe and persistent sciatica upon LDH. 	Nat_Commun	D016428
28072414	20170111	Evidence for genetic heterogeneity between clinical subtypes of bipolar disorder.	We performed a genome-wide association study of 6447 bipolar disorder (BD) cases and 12 639 controls from the International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD). Meta-analysis was performed with prior results from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Bipolar Disorder Working Group for a combined sample of 13 902 cases and 19 279 controls. We identified eight genome-wide significant, associated regions, including a novel associated region on chromosome 10 (rs10884920; P=3.28 × 10-8) that includes the brain-enriched cytoskeleton protein adducin 3 (ADD3), a non-coding RNA, and a neuropeptide-specific aminopeptidase P (XPNPEP1). Our large sample size allowed us to test the heritability and genetic correlation of BD subtypes and investigate their genetic overlap with schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. We found a significant difference in heritability of the two most common forms of BD (BD I SNP-h2=0.35; BD II SNP-h2=0.25; P=0.02). The genetic correlation between BD I and BD II was 0.78, whereas the genetic correlation was 0.97 when BD cohorts containing both types were compared. In addition, we demonstrated a significantly greater load of polygenic risk alleles for schizophrenia and BD in patients with BD I compared with patients with BD II, and a greater load of schizophrenia risk alleles in patients with the bipolar type of schizoaffective disorder compared with patients with either BD I or BD II. These results point to a partial difference in the genetic architecture of BD subtypes as currently defined. 	Transl_Psychiatry	D016428 D052061 D013485
28468790	20170505	Genome-Wide Association Studies and Meta-Analyses for Congenital Heart Defects.	Maternal and inherited (ie, case) genetic factors likely contribute to the pathogenesis of congenital heart defects, but it is unclear whether individual common variants confer a large risk. To evaluate the relationship between individual common maternal/inherited genotypes and risk for heart defects, we conducted genome-wide association studies in 5 cohorts. Three cohorts were recruited at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia: 670 conotruncal heart defect (CTD) case-parent trios, 317 left ventricular obstructive tract defect (LVOTD) case-parent trios, and 406 CTD cases (n=406) and 2976 pediatric controls. Two cohorts were recruited through the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium: 355 CTD trios and 192 LVOTD trios. We also conducted meta-analyses using the genome-wide association study results from the CTD cohorts, the LVOTD cohorts, and from the combined CTD and LVOTD cohorts. In the individual genome-wide association studies, several genome-wide significant associations (P?5×10-8) were observed. In our meta-analyses, 1 genome-wide significant association was detected: the case genotype for rs72820264, an intragenetic single-nucleotide polymorphism associated with LVOTDs (P=2.1×10-8). We identified 1 novel candidate region associated with LVOTDs and report on several additional regions with suggestive evidence for association with CTD and LVOTD. These studies were constrained by the relatively small samples sizes and thus have limited power to detect small to moderate associations. Approaches that minimize the multiple testing burden (eg, gene or pathway based) may, therefore, be required to uncover common variants contributing to the risk of these relatively rare conditions.

28115739	20170125	Genome-wide association study of therapeutic opioid dosing identifies a novel locus upstream of OPRM1.	Opioids are very effective analgesics, but they are also highly addictive. Methadone is used to treat opioid dependence (OD), acting as a selective agonist at the ?-opioid receptor encoded by the gene OPRM1. Determining the optimal methadone maintenance dose is time consuming; currently, no biomarkers are available to guide treatment. In methadone-treated OD subjects drawn from a case and control sample, we conducted a genome-wide association study of usual daily methadone dose. In African-American (AA) OD subjects (n=383), we identified a genome-wide significant association between therapeutic methadone dose (mean=68.0?mg, s.d.=30.1?mg) and rs73568641 (P=2.8 × 10-8), the nearest gene (306 kilobases) being OPRM1. Each minor (C) allele corresponded to an additional ~20?mg?day-1of oral methadone, an effect specific to AAs. In European-Americans (EAs) (n=1027), no genome-wide significant associations with methadone dose (mean=77.8?mg, s.d.=33.9?mg) were observed. In an independent set of opioid-naive AA children being treated for surgical pain, rs73568641-C was associated with a higher required dose of morphine (n=241, P=3.9 × 10-2). Similarly, independent genomic loci previously shown to associate with higher opioid analgesic dose were associated with higher methadone dose in the OD sample (AA and EA: n=1410, genetic score P=1.3 × 10-3). The present results in AAs indicate that genetic variants influencing opioid sensitivity across different clinical settings could contribute to precision pharmacotherapy for pain and addiction.

28070124	20170111	An endophenotype approach to the genetics of alcohol dependence: a genome wide association study of fast beta EEG in families of African ancestry.	Fast beta (20-28?Hz) electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillatory activity may be a useful endophenotype for studying the genetics of disorders characterized by neural hyperexcitability, including substance use disorders (SUDs). However, the genetic underpinnings of fast beta EEG have not previously been studied in a population of African-American ancestry (AA). In a sample of 2382 AA individuals from 482 families drawn from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA), we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on resting-state fast beta EEG power. To further characterize our genetic findings, we examined the functional and clinical/behavioral significance of GWAS variants. Ten correlated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (r2&gt;0.9) located in an intergenic region on chromosome 3q26 were associated with fast beta EEG power at P&lt;5 × 10-8. The most significantly associated SNP, rs11720469 (?: -0.124; P&lt;4.5 × 10-9), is also an expression quantitative trait locus for BCHE (butyrylcholinesterase), expressed in thalamus tissue. Four of the genome-wide SNPs were also associated with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Alcohol Dependence in COGA AA families, and two (rs13093097, rs7428372) were replicated in an independent AA sample (Gelernter et al.). Analyses in the AA adolescent/young adult (offspring from COGA families) subsample indicated association of rs11720469 with heavy episodic drinking (frequency of consuming 5+ drinks within 24?h). Converging findings presented in this study provide support for the role of genetic variants within 3q26 in neural and behavioral disinhibition. These novel genetic findings highlight the importance of including AA populations in genetics research on SUDs and the utility of the endophenotype approach in enhancing our understanding of mechanisms underlying addiction susceptibility.

27159506	20160510	Genome-wide association study of generalized anxiety symptoms in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos.	Although generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is heritable and aggregates in families, no genomic loci associated with GAD have been reported. We aimed to discover potential loci by conducting a genome-wide analysis of GAD symptoms in a large, population-based sample of Hispanic/Latino adults. Data came from 12,282 participants (aged 18-74) in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. Using a shortened Spielberger Trait Anxiety measure, we analyzed the following: (i) a GAD symptoms score restricted to the three items tapping diagnostic features of GAD as defined by DSM-V; and (ii) a total trait anxiety score based on summing responses to all ten items. We first calculated the heritability due to common variants (h2SNP) and then conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of GAD symptoms. Replication was attempted in three independent Hispanic cohorts (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, Women's Health Initiative, Army STARRS). The GAD symptoms score showed evidence of modest heritability (7.2%; P?=?0.03), while the total trait anxiety score did not (4.97%; P?=?0.20). One genotyped SNP (rs78602344) intronic to thrombospondin 2 (THBS2) was nominally associated (P?=?5.28?×?10-8) in the primary analysis adjusting for psychiatric medication use and significantly associated with the GAD symptoms score in the analysis excluding medication users (P?=?4.18?×?10-8). However, meta-analysis of the replication samples did not support this association. Although we identified a genome-wide significant locus in this sample, we were unable to replicate this finding. Evidence for heritability was also only detected for GAD symptoms, and not the trait anxiety measure, suggesting differential genetic influences within the domain of trait anxiety. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

28081215	20170113	Genome-Wide Association Studies of Multiple Keratinocyte Cancers.	There is strong evidence for a role of environmental risk factors involved in susceptibility to develop multiple keratinocyte cancers (mKCs), but whether genes are also involved in mKCs susceptibility has not been thoroughly investigated. We investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with susceptibility for mKCs. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 1,666 cases with mKCs and 1,950 cases with single KC (sKCs; controls) from Harvard cohorts (the Nurses' Health Study [NHS], NHS II, and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study) and the Framingham Heart Study was carried-out using over 8 million SNPs (stage-1). We sought to replicate the most significant statistical associations (p-value? 5.5x10-6) in an independent cohort of 574 mKCs and 872 sKCs from the Rotterdam Study. In the discovery stage, 40 SNPs with suggestive associations (p-value ?5.5x10-6) were identified, with eight independent SNPs tagging all 40 SNPs. The most significant SNP was located at chromosome 9 (rs7468390; p-value = 3.92x10-7). In stage-2, none of these SNPs replicated and only two of them were associated with mKCs in the same direction in the combined meta-analysis. We tested the associations for 19 previously reported basal cell carcinoma-related SNPs (candidate gene association analysis), and found that rs1805007 (MC1R locus) was significantly associated with risk of mKCs (p-value = 2.80x10-4). Although the suggestive SNPs with susceptibility for mKCs were not replicated, we found that previously identified BCC variants may also be associated with mKC, which the most significant association (rs1805007) located at the MC1R gene.

28011712	20161225	Genome-wide association study of Parkinson's disease in East Asians.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on Parkinson's disease (PD) have mostly been done in Europeans and Japanese. No study has been done in Han Chinese, which make up nearly a fifth of the world population. We conducted the first Han Chinese GWAS analysing a total of 22,729 subjects (5,125 PD cases and 17,604 controls) from Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Korea, mainland China and Taiwan. We performed imputation, merging and logistic regression analyses of 2,402,394 SNPs passing quality control filters in 779 PD cases, 13,227 controls, adjusted for the first three principal components. 90 SNPs with association P?&lt;?10-4 were validated in 9 additional sample collections and the results were combined using fixed-effects inverse-variance meta-analysis. We observed strong associations reaching genome-wide significance at SNCA, LRRK2 and MCCC1, confirming their important roles in both European and Asian PD. We also identified significant (P?&lt;?0.05) associations at 5 loci (DLG2, SIPA1L2, STK39, VPS13C and RIT2), and observed the same direction of associations at 9 other loci including BST1 and PARK16. Allelic heterogeneity was observed at LRRK2 while European risk SNPs at 6 other loci including MAPT and GBA-SYT11 were non-polymorphic or very rare in our cohort. Overall, we replicate associations at SNCA, LRRK2, MCCC1 and 14 other European PD loci but did not identify Asian-specific loci with large effects (OR?&gt;?1.45) on PD risk. Our results also demonstrate some differences in the genetic contribution to PD between Europeans and Asians. Further pan-ethnic meta-analysis with European GWAS cohorts may unravel new PD loci.

Several studies have now shown evidence of association between common genetic variants and quantitative facial traits in humans. The reported associations generally involve simple univariate measures and likely represent only a small fraction of the genetic loci influencing facial morphology. In this study, we applied factor analysis to a set of 276 facial linear distances derived from 3D facial surface images of 2187 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. We retained 23 facial factors, which we then tested for genetic associations using a genome-wide panel of 10,677,593 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In total, we identified genome-wide significant (p &lt; 5 × 10-8) associations in three regions, including two that are novel: one involving measures of midface height at 6q26 within an intron of PARK2 (lead SNP rs9456748; p = 4.99 × 10-8) and another involving measures of central upper lip height at 9p22 within FREM1 (lead SNP rs72713618; p = 2.02 × 10-8). In both cases, the genetic association was stronger with the composite facial factor phenotype than with any of the individual linear distances that comprise those factors. While the biological role of PARK2 in the craniofacial complex is currently unclear, there is evidence from both mouse models and Mendelian syndromes that FREM1 may influence facial variation. These results highlight the potential value of data-driven multivariate phenotyping for genetic studies of human facial morphology. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428
28494655	20170513	Significant Locus and Metabolic Genetic Correlations Revealed in Genome-Wide Association Study of Anorexia Nervosa.	The authors conducted a genome-wide association study of anorexia nervosa and calculated genetic correlations with a series of psychiatric, educational, and metabolic phenotypes. Following uniform quality control and imputation procedures using the 1000 Genomes Project (phase 3) in 12 case-control cohorts comprising 3,495 anorexia nervosa cases and 10,982 controls, the authors performed standard association analysis followed by a meta-analysis across cohorts. Linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to calculate genome-wide common variant heritability (single-nucleotide polymorphism [SNP]-based heritability [h2SNP]), partitioned heritability, and genetic correlations (rg) between anorexia nervosa and 159 other phenotypes. Results were obtained for 10,641,224 SNPs and insertion-deletion variants with minor allele frequencies &gt;1% and imputation quality scores &gt;0.6. The h2SNPof anorexia nervosa was 0.20 (SE=0.02), suggesting that a substantial fraction of the twin-based heritability arises from common genetic variation. The authors identified one genome-wide significant locus on chromosome 12 (rs4622308) in a region harboring a previously reported type 1 diabetes and autoimmune disorder locus. Significant positive genetic correlations were observed between anorexia nervosa and schizophrenia, neuroticism, educational attainment, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and significant negative genetic correlations were observed between anorexia nervosa and body mass index, insulin, glucose, and lipid phenotypes. Anorexia nervosa is a complex heritable phenotype for which this study has uncovered the first genome-wide significant locus. Anorexia nervosa also has large and significant genetic correlations with both psychiatric phenotypes and metabolic traits. The study results encourage a reconceptualization of this frequently lethal disorder as one with both psychiatric and metabolic etiology. 	Am_J_Psychiatry	D016428 D017418 D052061 D013485
27846195	20161116	Genome-wide association study of paliperidone efficacy.	Clinical response to the atypical antipsychotic paliperidone is known to vary among schizophrenic patients. We carried out a genome-wide association study to identify common genetic variants predictive of paliperidone efficacy. We leveraged a collection of 1390 samples from individuals of European ancestry enrolled in 12 clinical studies investigating the efficacy of the extended-release tablet paliperidone ER (n1=490) and the once-monthly injection paliperidone palmitate (n2=550 and n3=350). We carried out a genome-wide association study using a general linear model (GLM) analysis on three separate cohorts, followed by meta-analysis and using a mixed linear model analysis on all samples. The variations in response explained by each single nucleotide polymorphism (hSNP) were estimated. No SNP passed genome-wide significance in the GLM-based analyses with suggestive signals from rs56240334 [P=7.97×10 for change in the Clinical Global Impression Scale-Severity (CGI-S); P=8.72×10 for change in the total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)] in the intron of ADCK1. The mixed linear model-based association P-values for rs56240334 were consistent with the results from GLM-based analyses and the association with change in CGI-S (P=4.26×10) reached genome-wide significance (i.e. P&lt;5×10). We also found suggestive evidence for a polygenic contribution toward paliperidone treatment response with estimates of heritability, hSNP, ranging from 0.31 to 0.43 for change in the total PANSS score, the PANSS positive Marder factor score, and CGI-S. Genetic variations in the ADCK1 gene may differentially predict paliperidone efficacy in schizophrenic patients. However, this finding should be replicated in additional samples.

28613276	20170615	Genetic loci associated with heart rate variability and their effects on cardiac disease risk.	Reduced cardiac vagal control reflected in low heart rate variability (HRV) is associated with greater risks for cardiac morbidity and mortality. In two-stage meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies for three HRV traits in up to 53,174 individuals of European ancestry, we detect 17 genome-wide significant SNPs in eight loci. HRV SNPs tag non-synonymous SNPs (in NDUFA11 and KIAA1755), expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) (influencing GNG11, RGS6 and NEO1), or are located in genes preferentially expressed in the sinoatrial node (GNG11, RGS6 and HCN4). Genetic risk scores account for 0.9 to 2.6% of the HRV variance. Significant genetic correlation is found for HRV with heart rate (-0.74&lt;rg&lt;-0.55) and blood pressure (-0.35&lt;rg&lt;-0.20). These findings provide clinically relevant biological insight into heritable variation in vagal heart rhythm regulation, with a key role for genetic variants (GNG11, RGS6) that influence G-protein heterotrimer action in GIRK-channel induced pacemaker membrane hyperpolarization.

27897004	20161130	IDENTIFYING GENETIC ASSOCIATIONS WITH VARIABILITY IN METABOLIC HEALTH AND BLOOD COUNT LABORATORY VALUES: DIVING INTO THE QUANTITATIVE TRAITS BY LEVERAGING LONGITUDINAL DATA FROM AN EHR.	A wide range of patient health data is recorded in Electronic Health Records (EHR). This data includes diagnosis, surgical procedures, clinical laboratory measurements, and medication information. Together this information reflects the patient's medical history. Many studies have efficiently used this data from the EHR to find associations that are clinically relevant, either by utilizing International Classification of Diseases, version 9 (ICD-9) codes or laboratory measurements, or by designing phenotype algorithms to extract case and control status with accuracy from the EHR. Here we developed a strategy to utilize longitudinal quantitative trait data from the EHR at Geisinger Health System focusing on outpatient metabolic and complete blood panel data as a starting point. Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) as well as Complete Blood Counts (CBC) are parts of routine care and provide a comprehensive picture from high level screening of patients' overall health and disease. We randomly split our data into two datasets to allow for discovery and replication. We first conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with median values of 25 different clinical laboratory measurements to identify variants from Human Omni Express Exome beadchip data that are associated with these measurements. We identified 687 variants that associated and replicated with the tested clinical measurements at p&lt;5×10-08. Since longitudinal data from the EHR provides a record of a patient's medical history, we utilized this information to further investigate the ICD-9 codes that might be associated with differences in variability of the measurements in the longitudinal dataset. We identified low and high variance patients by looking at changes within their individual longitudinal EHR laboratory results for each of the 25 clinical lab values (thus creating 50 groups - a high variance and a low variance for each lab variable). We then performed a PheWAS analysis with ICD-9 diagnosis codes, separately in the high variance group and the low variance group for each lab variable. We found 717 PheWAS associations that replicated at a p-value less than 0.001. Next, we evaluated the results of this study by comparing the association results between the high and low variance groups. For example, we found 39 SNPs (in multiple genes) associated with ICD-9 250.01 (Type-I diabetes) in patients with high variance of plasma glucose levels, but not in patients with low variance in plasma glucose levels. Another example is the association of 4 SNPs in UMOD with chronic kidney disease in patients with high variance for aspartate aminotransferase (discovery p-value: 8.71×10-09 and replication p-value: 2.03×10-06). In general, we see a pattern of many more statistically significant associations from patients with high variance in the quantitative lab variables, in comparison with the low variance group across all of the 25 laboratory measurements. This study is one of the first of its kind to utilize quantitative trait variance from longitudinal laboratory data to find associations among genetic variants and clinical phenotypes obtained from an EHR, integrating laboratory values and diagnosis codes to understand the genetic complexities of common diseases.

28548082	20170527	Whole genome sequencing and imputation in isolated populations identify genetic associations with medically-relevant complex traits.	Next-generation association studies can be empowered by sequence-based imputation and by studying founder populations. Here we report ?9.5 million variants from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of a Cretan-isolated population, and show enrichment of rare and low-frequency variants with predicted functional consequences. We use a WGS-based imputation approach utilizing 10,422 reference haplotypes to perform genome-wide association analyses and observe 17 genome-wide significant, independent signals, including replicating evidence for association at eight novel low-frequency variant signals. Two novel cardiometabolic associations are at lead variants unique to the founder population sequences: chr16:70790626 (high-density lipoprotein levels beta -1.71 (SE 0.25), P=1.57 × 10-11, effect allele frequency (EAF) 0.006); and rs145556679 (triglycerides levels beta -1.13 (SE 0.17), P=2.53 × 10-11, EAF 0.013). Our findings add empirical support to the contribution of low-frequency variants in complex traits, demonstrate the advantage of including population-specific sequences in imputation panels and exemplify the power gains afforded by population isolates.

28703135	20170714	Genome-wide association study of neovascular age-related macular degeneration in the Thai population.	We performed a genome-wide association study on 377 cases of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and 1074 controls to determine the association of previously reported genetic variants associated with neovascular AMD in the Thai population. All patients were of Thai ancestry. We confirmed the association of age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) rs10490924 (P=7.38 × 10-17), HTRA1 rs11200638 (P=5.47 × 10-17) and complement factor H gene (CFH) rs800292 (P=2.53 × 10-8) with neovascular AMD, all loci passing the genome-wide significance level (P&lt;5.22 × 10-8). We also found association of the previously reported CFH rs10737680 (P=1.76 × 10-6) locus in the discovery sample. Two loci not previously reported to be associated with neovascular AMD were selected for replication in 222 cases and 623 controls. The loci included LINCO1317 rs6733379 and rs2384550 on chromosome 12. LINCO1317 rs6733379 (P=3.85 × 10-2) remained significantly associated with neovascular AMD after replication. In conclusion, we confirm that ARMS2, HTRA1 and CFH variants are associated with neovascular AMD in the Thai population. Findings from this study also suggest that variants contributing to the susceptibility of neovascular AMD in the Thai population are mostly similar to other Asians with additional local genetic risks that may specifically be identified in Thai population.

27595289	20160906	Novel HLA-DP region susceptibility loci associated with severe acute GvHD.	Despite HLA allele matching, significant acute GvHD remains a major barrier to successful unrelated donor BMT. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify recipient and donor genes associated with the risk of acute GvHD. A case-control design (grade III-IV versus no acute GvHD) and pooled GWA approach was used to study European-American recipients with hematological malignancies who received myeloablative conditioning non-T-cell-depleted first transplantation from HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1 allele level (10/10) matched unrelated donors. DNA samples were divided into three pools and tested in triplicate using the Affymetrix Genome-wide SNP Array 6.0. We identified three novel susceptibility loci in the HLA-DP region of recipient genomes that were associated with III-IV acute GvHD (rs9277378, P=1.58E-09; rs9277542, P=1.548E-06 and rs9277341, P=7.718E-05). Of these three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs9277378 and rs9277542 are located in non-coding regions of the HLA-DPB1 gene and the two are in strong linkage disequilibrium with two other published SNPs associated with acute GvHD, rs2281389 and rs9277535. Eighteen other recipient SNPs and 3 donor SNPs with a high level of significance (8E-07 or lower) were found. Our report contributes to emerging data showing clinical significance of the HLA-DP region genetic markers beyond structural matching of DPB1 alleles. 	Bone_Marrow_Transplant.	D016430 D016428
27599772	20160908	A common variant association study in ethnic Saudi Arabs reveals novel susceptibility loci for hypertriglyceridemia.	Hypertriglyceridemia (hTG) is a lipid disorder, resulting from an elevation in triglyceride levels, with a strong genetic component. It constitutes a significant risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD), a leading cause of death worldwide. In this study, we performed a common variant association study for hTG in ethnic Saudi Arabs. We genotyped 5501 individuals in a two-phase experiment using Affymetrix Axiom®Genome-Wide CEU 1 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Cruz, CA) that contains a total of 587,352 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The lead variant was the rs1558861 [1.99 (1.73-2.30); p = 7.37 × 10-22], residing on chromosome (chr) 11 at the apolipoprotein A-I/A-5 (APOA1/APOA5) locus. The rs780094 [1.34 (1.21-1.49); p = 8.57 × 10-8] on chr 2 at the glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) locus was similarly significantly associated, while the rs10911205 [1.29 (1.16-1.44); p = 3.52 × 10-6] on chr1 at the laminin subunit gamma-1 (LAMC1) locus showed suggestive association with disease. Furthermore, the rs17145738 [0.68 (0.60-0.77); p = 6.69 × 10-9] on chr7 at the carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein-encoding (MLXIPL) gene locus displayed significant protective characteristics, while another variant rs6982502 [0.76 (0.68-0.84); p = 5.31 × 10-7] on chr8 showed similar but weaker properties. These findings were replicated in 317 cases vs 1415 controls from the same ethnic Arab population. Our study identified several variants across the human genome that are associated with hTG in ethnic Arabs. 	Clin._Genet.	D016428
28065765	20170110	Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Risk Variants for Lichen Planus in Patients With Hepatitis C Virus Infection.	There is a close relationship between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and lichen planus, a chronic inflammatory mucocutaneous disease. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants associated with HCV-related lichen planus. We conducted a GWAS of 261 patients with HCV infection treated at a tertiary medical center in Japan from October 2007 through January 2013; a total of 71 had lichen planus and 190 had normal oral mucosa. We validated our findings in a GWAS of 38 patients with HCV-associated lichen planus and 7 HCV-infected patients with normal oral mucosa treated at a medical center in Italy. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in NRP2 (rs884000) and IGFBP4 (rs538399) were associated with risk of HCV-associated lichen planus (P &lt; 1 × 10-4). We also found an association between a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the HLA-DR/DQ genes (rs9461799) and susceptibility to HCV-associated lichen planus. The odds ratios for the minor alleles of rs884000, rs538399, and rs9461799 were 3.25 (95% confidence interval, 1.95-5.41), 0.40 (95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.63), and 2.15 (95% confidence interval, 1.41-3.28), respectively. In a GWAS of Japanese patients with HCV infection, we replicated associations between previously reported polymorphisms in HLA class II genes and risk for lichen planus. We also identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms in NRP2 and IGFBP4 loci that increase and reduce risk of lichen planus, respectively. These genetic variants might be used to identify patients with HCV infection who are at risk for lichen planus. 	Clin._Gastroenterol._Hepatol.	D016428
28598434	20170610	Genome-wide association study identifies multiple risk loci for renal cell carcinoma.	Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified six risk loci for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We conducted a meta-analysis of two new scans of 5,198 cases and 7,331 controls together with four existing scans, totalling 10,784 cases and 20,406 controls of European ancestry. Twenty-four loci were tested in an additional 3,182 cases and 6,301 controls. We confirm the six known RCC risk loci and identify seven new loci at 1p32.3 (rs4381241, P=3.1 × 10-10), 3p22.1 (rs67311347, P=2.5 × 10-8), 3q26.2 (rs10936602, P=8.8 × 10-9), 8p21.3 (rs2241261, P=5.8 × 10-9), 10q24.33-q25.1 (rs11813268, P=3.9 × 10-8), 11q22.3 (rs74911261, P=2.1 × 10-10) and 14q24.2 (rs4903064, P=2.2 × 10-24). Expression quantitative trait analyses suggest plausible candidate genes at these regions that may contribute to RCC susceptibility. 	Nat_Commun	D016428
28651948	20170628	Genetic sharing with coronary artery disease identifies potential novel loci for bone mineral density.	Bone mineral density (BMD) is a complex trait with high missing heritability. Numerous evidences have shown that BMD variation has a relationship with coronary artery disease (CAD). This relationship may come from a common genetic basis called pleiotropy. By leveraging the pleiotropy with CAD, we may be able to improve the detection power of genetic variants associated with BMD. Using a recently developed conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) method, we jointly analyzed summary statistics from two large independent genome wide association studies (GWAS) of lumbar spine (LS) BMD and CAD. Strong pleiotropic enrichment and 7 pleiotropic SNPs were found for the two traits. We identified 41 SNPs for LS BMD (cFDR&lt;0.05), of which 20 were replications of previous GWASs and 21 were potential novel SNPs that were not reported before. Four genes encompassed by 9 cFDR-significant SNPs were partially validated in the gene expression assay. Further functional enrichment analysis showed that genes corresponding to the cFDR-significant LS BMD SNPs were enriched in GO terms and KEGG pathways that played crucial roles in bone metabolism (adjP&lt;0.05). In protein-protein interaction analysis, strong interactions were found between the proteins produced by the corresponding genes. Our study demonstrated the reliability and high-efficiency of the cFDR method on the detection of trait-associated genetic variants, the present findings shed novel insights into the genetic variability of BMD as well as the shared genetic basis underlying osteoporosis and CAD.

28485404	20170510	Genetic contributors to variation in alcohol consumption vary by race/ethnicity in a large multi-ethnic genome-wide association study.	Alcohol consumption is a complex trait determined by both genetic and environmental factors, and is correlated with the risk of alcohol use disorders. Although a small number of genetic loci have been reported to be associated with variation in alcohol consumption, genetic factors are estimated to explain about half of the variance in alcohol consumption, suggesting that additional loci remain to be discovered. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of alcohol consumption in the large Genetic Epidemiology Research in Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort, in four race/ethnicity groups: non-Hispanic whites, Hispanic/Latinos, East Asians and African Americans. We examined two statistically independent phenotypes reflecting subjects' alcohol consumption during the past year, based on self-reported information: any alcohol intake (drinker/non-drinker status) and the regular quantity of drinks consumed per week (drinks/week) among drinkers. We assessed these two alcohol consumption phenotypes in each race/ethnicity group, and in a combined trans-ethnic meta-analysis comprising a total of 86?627 individuals. We observed the strongest association between the previously reported single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs671 in ALDH2 and alcohol drinker status (odd ratio (OR)=0.40, P=2.28 × 10-72) in East Asians, and also an effect on drinks/week (beta=-0.17, P=5.42 × 10-4) in the same group. We also observed a genome-wide significant association in non-Hispanic whites between the previously reported SNP rs1229984 in ADH1B and both alcohol consumption phenotypes (OR=0.79, P=2.47 × 10-20for drinker status and beta=-0.19, P=1.91 × 10-35for drinks/week), which replicated in Hispanic/Latinos (OR=0.72, P=4.35 × 10-7and beta=-0.21, P=2.58 × 10-6, respectively). Although prior studies reported effects of ADH1B and ALDH2 on lifetime measures, such as risk of alcohol dependence, our study adds further evidence of the effect of the same genes on a cross-sectional measure of average drinking. Our trans-ethnic meta-analysis confirmed recent findings implicating the KLB and GCKR loci in alcohol consumption, with strongest associations observed for rs7686419 (beta=-0.04, P=3.41 × 10-10for drinks/week and OR=0.96, P=4.08 × 10-5for drinker status), and rs4665985 (beta=0.04, P=2.26 × 10-8for drinks/week and OR=1.04, P=5 × 10-4for drinker status), respectively. Finally, we also obtained confirmatory results extending previous findings implicating AUTS2, SGOL1 and SERPINC1 genes in alcohol consumption traits in non-Hispanic whites. 	Mol._Psychiatry	D016428
28166213	20170207	Genome-wide association analyses for lung function and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease identify new loci and potential druggable targets.	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by reduced lung function and is the third leading cause of death globally. Through genome-wide association discovery in 48,943 individuals, selected from extremes of the lung function distribution in UK Biobank, and follow-up in 95,375 individuals, we increased the yield of independent signals for lung function from 54 to 97. A genetic risk score was associated with COPD susceptibility (odds ratio per 1 s.d. of the risk score (?6 alleles) (95% confidence interval) = 1.24 (1.20-1.27), P = 5.05 × 10-49), and we observed a 3.7-fold difference in COPD risk between individuals in the highest and lowest genetic risk score deciles in UK Biobank. The 97 signals show enrichment in genes for development, elastic fibers and epigenetic regulation pathways. We highlight targets for drugs and compounds in development for COPD and asthma (genes in the inositol phosphate metabolism pathway and CHRM3) and describe targets for potential drug repositioning from other clinical indications.

28471803	20170505	Search for genetic factor association with cancer-free prostate-specific antigen level elevation on the basis of a genome-wide association study in the Korean population.	We investigated the genetic markers associated with elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (sPSA) levels to improve the predictive power of sPSA in screening for prostate cancer. A genome-wide association study was carried out among 4124 healthy Korean male adults using the Affymetrix Axiom Customized Biobank Genotyping Arrays for sPSA levels. A subgroup analysis for increased sPSA levels who underwent a prostate biopsy (n=64) was also carried out. We detected 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the Solute carrier family 45member 3, AGAP7P, MSMB, LOC101929917, and KLK3 genes associated with sPSA levels. The top SNP associated with the log of the sPSA levels was rs72434280 in the Solute carrier family 45 member 3 gene (P value, discovery set=2.98×10, replication set=7.31×10). A case-control study utilizing available biopsy reports (49 patients with normal biopsies vs. 15 patients with biopsies indicating cancer) for the sPSA more than 3?ng/ml group was carried out for the respective SNPs after adjusting for age. Only the SNPs near the KLK3 gene were associated with prostate cancer. In the model of the predictive elevation of sPSA level, adding the genetic risk score [area under the curve (AUC)=0.697] to age and BMI (AUC=0.602) significantly improved the results of the AUC (P&lt;0.0001). We found seven SNPs associated with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels in healthy Korean men. Four SNPs were a novel marker in the Korean population. In men with increased prostate-specific antigen levels, genotyping SNP related to cancer-free elevation of sPSA level could be informative to decide the indication of prostate biopsy.

28374850	20170405	Genome-wide association analysis for chronic venous disease identifies EFEMP1 and KCNH8 as susceptibility loci.	Chronic venous disease (CVD) is a multifactorial condition representing one of the most common disorders among populations of Western countries. The heritability of about 17% suggests genetic risk factors in CVD etiology. However, so far the genetic causes are unknown. We undertook the hitherto first genome-wide association study (GWAS) for CVD, analyzing more than 1.93?M SNPs in 4,942 German individuals, followed by replication in two independent German data sets. The combined analysis of discovery and replication stages (2,269 cases and 7,765 controls) yielded robust associations within the two genes EFEMP1 and KCNH8 (rs17278665, rs727139 with P?&lt;?5?×?10-8), and suggestive association within gene SKAP2 (rs2030136 with P?&lt;?5?×?10-7). Association signals of rs17278665 and rs727139 reside in regions of low linkage disequilibrium containing no other genes. Data from the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects show that tissue specific marks overlap with the variants. SNPs rs17278665 and rs2030136 are known eQTLs. Our study demonstrates that GWAS are a valuable tool to study the genetic component of CVD. With our approach, we identified two novel genome-wide significant susceptibility loci for this common disease. Particularly, the extracellular matrix glycoprotein EFEMP1 is promising for future functional studies due to its antagonistic role in vessel development and angiogenesis. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
27992413	20161220	Genome-wide association study of primary sclerosing cholangitis identifies new risk loci and quantifies the genetic relationship with inflammatory bowel disease.	Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare progressive disorder leading to bile duct destruction; ?75% of patients have comorbid inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We undertook the largest genome-wide association study of PSC (4,796 cases and 19,955 population controls) and identified four new genome-wide significant loci. The most associated SNP at one locus affects splicing and expression of UBASH3A, with the protective allele (C) predicted to cause nonstop-mediated mRNA decay and lower expression of UBASH3A. Further analyses based on common variants suggested that the genome-wide genetic correlation (rG) between PSC and ulcerative colitis (UC) (rG= 0.29) was significantly greater than that between PSC and Crohn's disease (CD) (rG= 0.04) (P = 2.55 × 10-15). UC and CD were genetically more similar to each other (rG= 0.56) than either was to PSC (P &lt; 1.0 × 10-15). Our study represents a substantial advance in understanding of the genetics of PSC.

28654678	20170628	Genetic factors affecting EBV copy number in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from the 1000 Genome Project samples.	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpes virus 4, has been classically associated with infectious mononucleosis, multiple sclerosis and several types of cancers. Many of these diseases show marked geographical differences in prevalence, which points to underlying genetic and/or environmental factors. Those factors may include a different susceptibility to EBV infection and viral copy number among human populations. Since EBV is commonly used to transform B-cells into lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) we hypothesize that differences in EBV copy number among individual LCLs may reflect differential susceptibility to EBV infection. To test this hypothesis, we retrieved whole-genome sequenced EBV-mapping reads from 1,753 LCL samples derived from 19 populations worldwide that were sequenced within the context of the 1000 Genomes Project. An in silico methodology was developed to estimate the number of EBV copy number in LCLs and validated these estimations by real-time PCR. After experimentally confirming that EBV relative copy number remains stable over cell passages, we performed a genome wide association analysis (GWAS) to try detecting genetic variants of the host that may be associated with EBV copy number. Our GWAS has yielded several genomic regions suggestively associated with the number of EBV genomes per cell in LCLs, unraveling promising candidate genes such as CAND1, a known inhibitor of EBV replication. While this GWAS does not unequivocally establish the degree to which genetic makeup of individuals determine viral levels within their derived LCLs, for which a larger sample size will be needed, it potentially highlighted human genes affecting EBV-related processes, which constitute interesting candidates to follow up in the context of EBV related pathologies.

28212542	20170218	Two-stage genome-wide association study identifies a novel susceptibility locus associated with melanoma.	Genome-wide association studies have identified 21 susceptibility loci associated with melanoma. These loci implicate genes affecting pigmentation, nevus count, telomere maintenance, and DNA repair in melanoma risk. Here, we report the results of a two-stage genome-wide association study of melanoma. The stage 1 discovery phase consisted of 4,842 self-reported melanoma cases and 286,565 controls of European ancestry from the 23andMe research cohort and the stage 2 replication phase consisted of 1,804 melanoma cases and 1,026 controls from the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. We performed a combined meta-analysis totaling 6,628 melanoma cases and 287,591 controls. Our study replicates 20 of 21 previously known melanoma-loci and confirms the association of the telomerase reverse transcriptase, TERT, with melanoma susceptibility at genome-wide significance. In addition, we uncover a novel polymorphism, rs187843643 (OR = 1.96; 95% CI = [1.54, 2.48]; P = 3.53 x 10-8), associated with melanoma. The SNP rs187842643 lies within a noncoding RNA 177kb downstream of BASP1 (brain associated protein-1). We find that BASP1 expression is suppressed in melanoma as compared with benign nevi, providing additional evidence for a putative role in melanoma pathogenesis. 	Oncotarget	D016428 D017418
28703219	20170714	Genome-wide association and expression quantitative trait loci studies identify multiple susceptibility loci for thyroid cancer.	Thyroid cancer is the most common cancer in Korea. Several susceptibility loci of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) were identified by previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in Europeans only. Here we conducted a GWAS and a replication study in Koreans using a total of 1,085 DTC cases and 8,884 controls, and validated these results using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis and clinical phenotypes. The most robust associations were observed in the NRG1 gene (rs6996585, P=1.08 × 10-10) and this SNP was also associated with NRG1 expression in thyroid tissues. In addition, we confirmed three previously reported loci (FOXE1, NKX2-1 and DIRC3) and identified seven novel susceptibility loci (VAV3, PCNXL2, INSR, MRSB3, FHIT, SEPT11 and SLC24A6) associated with DTC. Furthermore, we identified specific variants of DTC that have different effects according to cancer type or ethnicity. Our findings provide deeper insight into the genetic contribution to thyroid cancer in different populations. 	Nat_Commun	D016428
28054174	20170106	Genome-wide meta-analyses of nonsyndromic orofacial clefts identify novel associations between FOXE1 and all orofacial clefts, and TP63 and cleft lip with or without cleft palate.	Nonsyndromic orofacial clefts (OFCs) are a heterogeneous group of common craniofacial birth defects with complex etiologies that include genetic and environmental risk factors. OFCs are commonly categorized as cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) and cleft palate alone (CP), which have historically been analyzed as distinct entities. Genes for both CL/P and CP have been identified via multiple genome-wide linkage and association studies (GWAS); however, altogether, known variants account for a minority of the estimated heritability in risk to these craniofacial birth defects. We performed genome-wide meta-analyses of CL/P, CP, and all OFCs across two large, multiethnic studies. We then performed population-specific meta-analyses in sub-samples of Asian and European ancestry. In addition to observing associations with known variants, we identified a novel genome-wide significant association between SNPs located in an intronic TP63 enhancer and CL/P (p = 1.16 × 10-8). Several novel loci with compelling candidate genes approached genome-wide significance on 4q21.1 (SHROOM3), 12q13.13 (KRT18), and 8p21 (NRG1). In the analysis of all OFCs combined, SNPs near FOXE1 reached genome-wide significance (p = 1.33 × 10-9). Our results support the highly heterogeneous nature of OFCs and illustrate the utility of meta-analysis for discovering new genetic risk factors. 	Hum._Genet.	D016428 D017418 D052061 D013485
28011710	20161225	Identification of novel loci affecting circulating chromogranins and related peptides.	Chromogranins are pro-hormone secretory proteins released from neuroendocrine cells, with effects on control of blood pressure. We conducted a genome-wide association study for plasma catestatin, the catecholamine release inhibitory peptide derived from chromogranin A (CHGA), and other CHGA- or chromogranin B (CHGB)-related peptides, in 545?US and 1252 Australian subjects. This identified loci on chromosomes 4q35 and 5q34 affecting catestatin concentration (P?=?3.40 × 10-30 for rs4253311 and 1.85 × 10-19 for rs2731672, respectively). Genes in these regions include the proteolytic enzymes kallikrein (KLKB1) and Factor XII (F12). In chromaffin cells, CHGA and KLKB1 proteins co-localized in catecholamine storage granules. In vitro, kallikrein cleaved recombinant human CHGA to catestatin, verified by mass spectrometry. The peptide identified from this digestion (CHGA360-373) selectively inhibited nicotinic cholinergic stimulated catecholamine release from chromaffin cells. A proteolytic cascade involving kallikrein and Factor XII cleaves chromogranins to active compounds both in vivo and in vitro. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D018486 D013485 D052061
27669169	20160927	Genetic Modifiers of Progression-Free Survival in Never-Smoking Lung Adenocarcinoma Patients Treated with First-Line Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors.	Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are relatively sensitive to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment and have longer progression-free survival (PFS) when treated with EGFR-TKI compared with platinum-based chemotherapy. However, many patients with advanced NSCLC who have mutated EGFR do not respond to first-line EGFR-TKI treatment and still have shorter PFS. The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants associated with PFS among patients with lung adenocarcinoma who were treated with first-line EGFR-TKIs. A genome-wide association study on PFS was performed in never-smoking women diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma and who were treated with first-line EGFR-TKIs (n?=?128). Significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected for follow-up association analysis (n?=?198) and for replication assay in another independent cohort (n?=?153). We identified SNPs at 4q12 associated with PFS at genome-wide significance (P?&lt;?10-8) and with an estimated hazard ratio of more than 4. This association was also replicated in a larger but similar cohort and in an independent NSCLC cohort. Follow-up functional analyses showed that these SNPs were associated with the expression of EGFR, which encodes the TKI target, and with a nearby gene neuromedin-U, which encodes a G protein-coupled receptor ligand known to be involved in the progression of NSCLC. Considering these as possible prognostic biomarkers for the treatment of patients with late-stage lung cancer, we found that these SNPs were not associated with EGFR mutation status or with polymorphism of the Bcl2-interacting mediator of cell death gene. Genetic variants in 4q12 merit further investigation to assess their potential as pharmacogenomic predictors for and to understand the biology underlying its influence on PFS in patients treated with TKI therapy.

28118524	20170125	A Multinational Arab Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies New Genetic Associations for Rheumatoid Arthritis.	Genetic factors underlying susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Arab populations are largely unknown. This genome-wide association study (GWAS) was undertaken to explore the generalizability of previously reported RA loci to Arab subjects and to discover new Arab-specific genetic loci. The Genetics of Rheumatoid Arthritis in Some Arab States Study was designed to examine the genetics and clinical features of RA patients from Jordan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. In total, &gt;7 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for association with RA overall and with seropositive or seronegative RA in 511 RA cases and 352 healthy controls. In addition, replication of 15 signals was attempted in 283 RA cases and 221 healthy controls. A genetic risk score of 68 known RA SNPs was also examined in this study population. Three loci (HLA region, intergenic 5q13, and 17p13 at SMTNL2/GGT6) reached genome-wide significance in the analyses of association with RA and with seropositive RA, and for all 3 loci, evidence of independent replication was demonstrated. Consistent with the findings in European and East Asian populations, the association of RA with HLA-DRB1 amino acid position 11 conferred the strongest effect (P = 4.8 × 10-16), and a weighted genetic risk score of previously associated RA loci was found to be associated with RA (P?=?3.41 × 10-5) and with seropositive RA (P?=?1.48 × 10-6) in this population. In addition, 2 novel associations specific to Arab populations were found at the 5q13 and 17p13 loci. This first RA GWAS in Arab populations confirms that established HLA-region and known RA risk alleles contribute strongly to the risk and severity of disease in some Arab groups, suggesting that the genetic architecture of RA is similar across ethnic groups. Moreover, this study identified 2 novel RA risk loci in Arabs, offering further population-specific insights into the pathophysiology of RA. 	Arthritis_&amp;_rheumatology_(Hoboken,_N.J.)

28632202	20170621	Genome-wide association study of borderline personality disorder reveals genetic overlap with bipolar disorder, major depression and schizophrenia.	Borderline personality disorder (BOR) is determined by environmental and genetic factors, and characterized by affective instability and impulsivity, diagnostic symptoms also observed in manic phases of bipolar disorder (BIP). Up to 20% of BIP patients show comorbidity with BOR. This report describes the first case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BOR, performed in one of the largest BOR patient samples worldwide. The focus of our analysis was (i) to detect genes and gene sets involved in BOR and (ii) to investigate the genetic overlap with BIP. As there is considerable genetic overlap between BIP, major depression (MDD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) and a high comorbidity of BOR and MDD, we also analyzed the genetic overlap of BOR with SCZ and MDD. GWAS, gene-based tests and gene-set analyses were performed in 998 BOR patients and 1545 controls. Linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to detect the genetic overlap between BOR and these disorders. Single marker analysis revealed no significant association after correction for multiple testing. Gene-based analysis yielded two significant genes: DPYD (P=4.42 × 10-7) and PKP4 (P=8.67 × 10-7); and gene-set analysis yielded a significant finding for exocytosis (GO:0006887, PFDR=0.019; FDR, false discovery rate). Prior studies have implicated DPYD, PKP4 and exocytosis in BIP and SCZ. The most notable finding of the present study was the genetic overlap of BOR with BIP (rg=0.28 [P=2.99 × 10-3]), SCZ (rg=0.34 [P=4.37 × 10-5]) and MDD (rg=0.57 [P=1.04 × 10-3]). We believe our study is the first to demonstrate that BOR overlaps with BIP, MDD and SCZ on the genetic level. Whether this is confined to transdiagnostic clinical symptoms should be examined in future studies. 	Transl_Psychiatry	D016428
28461288	20170503	A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of asthma in Puerto Ricans.	Puerto Ricans are disproportionately affected with asthma in the USA. In this study, we aim to identify genetic variants that confer susceptibility to asthma in Puerto Ricans.We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of asthma in Puerto Ricans, including participants from: the Genetics of Asthma in Latino Americans (GALA) I-II, the Hartford-Puerto Rico Study and the Hispanic Community Health Study. Moreover, we examined whether susceptibility loci identified in previous meta-analyses of GWAS are associated with asthma in Puerto Ricans.The only locus to achieve genome-wide significance was chromosome 17q21, as evidenced by our top single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs907092 (OR 0.71, p=1.2×10-12) atIKZF3Similar to results in non-Puerto Ricans, SNPs in genes in the same linkage disequilibrium block asIKZF3(e.g. ZPBP2,ORMDL3andGSDMB) were significantly associated with asthma in Puerto Ricans. With regard to results from a meta-analysis in Europeans, we replicated findings for rs2305480 atGSDMB, but not for SNPs in any other genes. On the other hand, we replicated results from a meta-analysis of North American populations for SNPs atIL1RL1,TSLPandGSDMBbut not forIL33Our findings suggest that common variants on chromosome 17q21 have the greatest effects on asthma in Puerto Ricans.

28530673	20170523	Genome-wide association meta-analysis of 78,308 individuals identifies new loci and genes influencing human intelligence.	Intelligence is associated with important economic and health-related life outcomes. Despite intelligence having substantial heritability (0.54) and a confirmed polygenic nature, initial genetic studies were mostly underpowered. Here we report a meta-analysis for intelligence of 78,308 individuals. We identify 336 associated SNPs (METAL P &lt; 5 × 10-8) in 18 genomic loci, of which 15 are new. Around half of the SNPs are located inside a gene, implicating 22 genes, of which 11 are new findings. Gene-based analyses identified an additional 30 genes (MAGMA P &lt; 2.73 × 10-6), of which all but one had not been implicated previously. We show that the identified genes are predominantly expressed in brain tissue, and pathway analysis indicates the involvement of genes regulating cell development (MAGMA competitive P = 3.5 × 10-6). Despite the well-known difference in twin-based heritability for intelligence in childhood (0.45) and adulthood (0.80), we show substantial genetic correlation (rg= 0.89, LD score regression P = 5.4 × 10-29). These findings provide new insight into the genetic architecture of intelligence. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D017418
28045058	20170104	Identification of genetic susceptibility loci for intestinal Behçet's disease.	Several recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified susceptibility loci/genes for Behçet's disease (BD). However, no study has specifically investigated the genetic susceptibility loci associated with intestinal involvement in BD. We aimed to identify distinctive genetic susceptibility loci/genes associated with intestinal involvement in BD and determine their roles in intestinal inflammation as well as their interactions with genes involved in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). GWAS and validation studies showed intestinal BD-specific associations with an NAALADL2 gene locus (rs3914501, P?=?3.8?×?10-4) and a YIPF7 gene locus (rs6838327, P?=?3.5?×?10-4). Validation, haplotype, and pathway analyses showed distinct genetic architectures between intestinal BD and BD without intestinal involvement. Furthermore, network analysis revealed shared pathogenic pathways between intestinal BD and IBD. Gene functional analyses indicated that down-regulation of NAALADL2 and YIPF7 expression was associated with exacerbating intestinal inflammatory responses both in vitro and in vivo. Our results provide new insights into intestinal BD-specific genetic variations, which represents a distinct pathway from BD without intestinal involvement. Functional consequences of the intestinal BD-specific NAALADL2 and YIPF7 expression patterns proved a suggestive association with intestinal inflammation risk, which warrants further validation.

28388302	20170408	Genome-Wide Association and Replication Study of Hepatotoxicity Induced by Antiretrovirals Alone or with Concomitant Anti-Tuberculosis Drugs.	Drug-induced hepatotoxicity (DIH) is a common adverse event that is associated with both antiretroviral (ARV) and anti-tuberculosis drugs (ATD). Moreover, the genetic variations predisposing ARV- and ARV-ATD-induced liver toxicity in African populations are not well investigated, despite the two diseases being the major global health problems in sub-Saharan Africa. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and replication study to identify the genetic variants linked to the risk of developing DIH due to ARV drugs alone, and ARV-ATD co-treatment in Ethiopian HIV-positive patients. Treatment-naïve newly diagnosed HIV patients (n?=?719) with or without tuberculosis (TB) co-infection were enrolled prospectively and received efavirenz-based ARV therapy with or without rifampicin-based short course ATD, respectively. Whole-genome genotyping was performed by using the Illumina Omni Express Exome Bead Chip genotyping array with 951,117 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a total of 41 cases of DIH, and 452 people without DIH (treatment tolerants). The replication study was carried out for 100 SNPs with the lowest p-values (top SNPs) by using an independent cohort consisting of 18 DIH cases and 208 treatment tolerants. We identified a missense SNP rs199650082 (2756G?A, R919Q, p?=?1.4?×?10-6, odds ratio [OR]?=?18.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]?=?7.1-46.9) in an endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus signaling-1 (ERN1) gene on chromosome 17 to be associated with DIH in the ARV-only cohort. In the ARV-ATD co-treatment groups, rs4842407, a long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) transcript variant on chromosome 12, was associated with DIH (p?=?5.3?×?10-7, OR?=?5.4, 95% CI?=?2.8-10.3). These genetic variants that are putatively associated with DIH due to ARV drugs alone and ARV-ATD co-treatment establish a foundation for future personalized medicine in people with HIV and TB and call for larger studies in independent populations.

28430825	20170422	Discovery and fine-mapping of adiposity loci using high density imputation of genome-wide association studies in individuals of African ancestry: African Ancestry Anthropometry Genetics Consortium.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified &gt;300 loci associated with measures of adiposity including body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (adjusted for BMI, WHRadjBMI), but few have been identified through screening of the African ancestry genomes. We performed large scale meta-analyses and replications in up to 52,895 individuals for BMI and up to 23,095 individuals for WHRadjBMI from the African Ancestry Anthropometry Genetics Consortium (AAAGC) using 1000 Genomes phase 1 imputed GWAS to improve coverage of both common and low frequency variants in the low linkage disequilibrium African ancestry genomes. In the sex-combined analyses, we identified one novel locus (TCF7L2/HABP2) for WHRadjBMI and eight previously established loci at P &lt; 5×10-8: seven for BMI, and one for WHRadjBMI in African ancestry individuals. An additional novel locus (SPRYD7/DLEU2) was identified for WHRadjBMI when combined with European GWAS. In the sex-stratified analyses, we identified three novel loci for BMI (INTS10/LPL and MLC1 in men, IRX4/IRX2 in women) and four for WHRadjBMI (SSX2IP, CASC8, PDE3B and ZDHHC1/HSD11B2 in women) in individuals of African ancestry or both African and European ancestry. For four of the novel variants, the minor allele frequency was low (&lt;5%). In the trans-ethnic fine mapping of 47 BMI loci and 27 WHRadjBMI loci that were locus-wide significant (P &lt; 0.05 adjusted for effective number of variants per locus) from the African ancestry sex-combined and sex-stratified analyses, 26 BMI loci and 17 WHRadjBMI loci contained ? 20 variants in the credible sets that jointly account for 99% posterior probability of driving the associations. The lead variants in 13 of these loci had a high probability of being causal. As compared to our previous HapMap imputed GWAS for BMI and WHRadjBMI including up to 71,412 and 27,350 African ancestry individuals, respectively, our results suggest that 1000 Genomes imputation showed modest improvement in identifying GWAS loci including low frequency variants. Trans-ethnic meta-analyses further improved fine mapping of putative causal variants in loci shared between the African and European ancestry populations. 	PLoS_Genet.	D016428 D017418
28375557	20170405	Genomewide association study on monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS).	To identify germ line variants contributing to the development of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), an asymptomatic premalignant precursor for multiple myeloma (MM). We conducted the first genomewide association study (GWAS) on MGUS on 243 German cases with a replication on 294 Czech cases. Identified loci were further analyzed in 1508 German MM patients. New MM loci recently reported in a meta-analysis were also tested in the MGUS GWAS. In GWAS, we identified 10 loci contributing to development of MGUS at P-value threshold of 10-5. The Czech cohort gave support for two associations (6q26, rs6933936; 7p21.3 rs10251201). In GWAS, rs974120 (8p23.2) reached genomewide significance (P=2.94×10-9), with a nominal significance in MM. The locus of rs974120 shows marks of transcriptional activity in leukemia according to ENCODE data. rs10251201 (7p21.3), rs9318227 (13q22.1), and rs10405859 (19q13.32) were associated with markers related to leukemogenesis and immune and inflammatory responses. Two newly identified candidate loci for MM, rs1948915 (8q24.21) and rs8058578 (16p11.2), were nominally associated with MGUS. These data allow a cautious first proposal for a germ line architecture of MGUS with links to leukemia and autoimmune conditions, the latter agreeing with a family study showing clustering of MGUS with autoimmune diseases.

28754176	20170730	Genome-wide gene by lead exposure interaction analysis identifies UNC5D as a candidate gene for neurodevelopment.	Neurodevelopment is a complex process involving both genetic and environmental factors. Prenatal exposure to lead (Pb) has been associated with lower performance on neurodevelopmental tests. Adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes are more frequent and/or more severe when toxic exposures interact with genetic susceptibility. To explore possible loci associated with increased susceptibility to prenatal Pb exposure, we performed a genome-wide gene-environment interaction study (GWIS) in young children from Mexico (n = 390) and Bangladesh (n = 497). Prenatal Pb exposure was estimated by cord blood Pb concentration. Neurodevelopment was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. We identified a locus on chromosome 8, containing UNC5D, and demonstrated evidence of its genome-wide significance with mental composite scores (rs9642758, pmeta = 4.35 × 10-6). Within this locus, the joint effects of two independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, rs9642758 and rs10503970) had a p-value of 4.38 × 10-9for mental composite scores. Correlating GWIS results with in vitro transcriptomic profiles identified one common gene, SLC1A5, which is involved in synaptic function, neuronal development, and excitotoxicity. Further analysis revealed interconnected interactions that formed a large network of 52 genes enriched with oxidative stress genes and neurodevelopmental genes. Our findings suggest that certain genetic polymorphisms within/near genes relevant to neurodevelopment might modify the toxic effects of Pb exposure via oxidative stress.

28139693	20170201	Genome-wide association study of prostate-specific antigen levels identifies novel loci independent of prostate cancer.	Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels have been used for detection and surveillance of prostate cancer (PCa). However, factors other than PCa-such as genetics-can impact PSA. Here we present findings from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PSA in 28,503 Kaiser Permanente whites and 17,428 men from replication cohorts. We detect 40 genome-wide significant (P&lt;5 × 10-8) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): 19 novel, 15 previously identified for PSA (14 of which were also PCa-associated), and 6 previously identified for PCa only. Further analysis incorporating PCa cases suggests that at least half of the 40 SNPs are PSA-associated independent of PCa. The 40 SNPs explain 9.5% of PSA variation in non-Hispanic whites, and the remaining GWAS SNPs explain an additional 31.7%; this percentage is higher in younger men, supporting the genetic basis of PSA levels. These findings provide important information about genetic markers for PSA that may improve PCa screening, thereby reducing over-diagnosis and over-treatment. 	Nat_Commun	D016428
28738859	20170726	Genes and pathways underlying susceptibility to impaired lung function in the context of environmental tobacco smoke exposure.	Studies aiming to assess genetic susceptibility for impaired lung function levels upon exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) have thus far focused on candidate-genes selected based on a-priori knowledge of potentially relevant biological pathways, such as glutathione S-transferases and ADAM33. By using a hypothesis-free approach, we aimed to identify novel susceptibility loci, and additionally explored biological pathways potentially underlying this susceptibility to impaired lung function in the context of ETS exposure. Genome-wide interactions of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) by ETS exposure (0 versus ?1 h/day) in relation to the level of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were investigated in 10,817 subjects from the Dutch LifeLines cohort study, and verified in subjects from the Swiss SAPALDIA study (n = 1276) and the Dutch Rotterdam Study (n = 1156). SNP-by-ETS exposure p-values obtained from the identification analysis were used to perform a pathway analysis. Fourty Five SNP-by-ETS exposure interactions with p-values &lt;10-4were identified in the LifeLines study, two being replicated with nominally significant p-values (&lt;0.05) in at least one of the replication cohorts. Three pathways were enriched in the pathway-level analysis performed in the identification cohort LifeLines, i.E. the apoptosis, p38 MAPK and TNF pathways. This unique, first genome-wide gene-by-ETS interaction study on the level of FEV1showed that pathways previously implicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a disease characterized by airflow obstruction, may also underlie susceptibility to impaired lung function in the context of ETS exposure.

27918536	20161206	Genome-wide analyses for personality traits identify six genomic loci and show correlations with psychiatric disorders.	Personality is influenced by genetic and environmental factors and associated with mental health. However, the underlying genetic determinants are largely unknown. We identified six genetic loci, including five novel loci, significantly associated with personality traits in a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (N = 123,132-260,861). Of these genome-wide significant loci, extraversion was associated with variants in WSCD2 and near PCDH15, and neuroticism with variants on chromosome 8p23.1 and in L3MBTL2. We performed a principal component analysis to extract major dimensions underlying genetic variations among five personality traits and six psychiatric disorders (N = 5,422-18,759). The first genetic dimension separated personality traits and psychiatric disorders, except that neuroticism and openness to experience were clustered with the disorders. High genetic correlations were found between extraversion and attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and between openness and schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The second genetic dimension was closely aligned with extraversion-introversion and grouped neuroticism with internalizing psychopathology (e.g., depression or anxiety). 	Nat._Genet.	D016428
28406950	20170414	Interaction of iron status with single nucleotide polymorphisms on incidence of type 2 diabetes.	The objective of this study is to find single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a risk of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Korean adults and to investigate the longitudinal association between these SNPs and T2D and the interaction effects of iron intake and average hemoglobin level. Data from the KoGES_Ansan and Ansung Study were used. Gene-iron interaction analysis was conducted using a two-step approach. To select candidate SNPs associated with T2D, a total of 7,935 adults at baseline were included in genome-wide association analysis (step one). After excluding T2D prevalent cases, prospective analyses were conducted with 7,024 adults aged 40-69 (step two). The association of selected SNPs and iron status with T2D and their interaction were determined using a Cox proportional hazard model. A total of 3 SNPs [rs9465871 (CDKAL1), rs10761745 (JMJD1C), and rs163177 (KCNQ1)] were selected as candidate SNPs related to T2D. Among them, rs10761745 (JMJD1C) and rs163177 (KCNQ1) were prospectively associated with T2D. High iron intake was also prospectively associated with the risk of T2D after adjusting for covariates. Average hemoglobin level was positively associated with T2D after adjusting for covariates in women. We also found significant interaction effects between rs10761745 (JMJD1C) and average hemoglobin levels on the risk of T2D among women with normal inflammation and without anemia at baseline. In conclusion, KCNQ1 and JMJD1C may prospectively contribute to the risk of T2D incidence among adults over the age of 40 and JMJD1C, but CDKAL1 may not, and iron status may interactively contribute to T2D incidence in women.

28749367	20170728	Genome-wide Association Study of Susceptibility to Particulate Matter-Associated QT Prolongation.	Ambient particulate matter (PM) air pollution exposure has been associated with increases in QT interval duration (QT). However, innate susceptibility to PM-associated QT prolongation has not been characterized. To characterize genetic susceptibility to PM-associated QT prolongation in a multi-racial/ethnic, genome-wide association study (GWAS). Using repeated electrocardiograms (19862004), longitudinal data on PM&lt;10 ?m in diameter (PM10), and generalized estimating equations methods adapted for low-prevalence exposure, we estimated approximately 2.5×106SNP×PM10interactions among nine Womens Health Initiative clinical trials and Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study subpopulations (n=22,158), then combined subpopulation-specific results in a fixed-effects, inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis. A common variant (rs1619661; coded allele:T) significantly modified the QT-PM10association (p=2.11×10?8). At PM10concentrations &gt;90th percentile, QT increased 7 ms across the CC and TT genotypes: 397 (95% confidence interval: 396, 399) to 404 (403, 404) ms. However, QT changed minimally across rs1619661 genotypes at lower PM10concentrations. The rs1619661 variant is on chromosome 10, 132 kilobase (kb) downstream from &lt;em&gt;CXCL12&lt;/em&gt;, which encodes a chemokine, stromal cell-derived factor 1, that is expressed in cardiomyocytes and decreases calcium influx across the L-type Ca2+channel. The findings suggest that biologically plausible genetic factors may alter susceptibility to PM10-associated QT prolongation in populations protected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Independent replication and functional characterization are necessary to validate our findings. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP347 	Environ._Health_Perspect.	D016428 D052061
28155865	20170204	A Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Genetic Variants Associated with Mathematics Ability.	Mathematics ability is a complex cognitive trait with polygenic heritability. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been an effective approach to investigate genetic components underlying mathematic ability. Although previous studies reported several candidate genetic variants, none of them exceeded genome-wide significant threshold in general populations. Herein, we performed GWAS in Chinese elementary school students to identify potential genetic variants associated with mathematics ability. The discovery stage included 494 and 504 individuals from two independent cohorts respectively. The replication stage included another cohort of 599 individuals. In total, 28 of 81 candidate SNPs that met validation criteria were further replicated. Combined meta-analysis of three cohorts identified four SNPs (rs1012694, rs11743006, rs17778739 and rs17777541) of SPOCK1 gene showing association with mathematics ability (minimum p value 5.67?×?10-10, maximum ? -2.43). The SPOCK1 gene is located on chromosome 5q31.2 and encodes a highly conserved glycoprotein testican-1 which was associated with tumor progression and prognosis as well as neurogenesis. This is the first study to report genome-wide significant association of individual SNPs with mathematics ability in general populations. Our preliminary results further supported the role of SPOCK1 during neurodevelopment. The genetic complexities underlying mathematics ability might contribute to explain the basis of human cognition and intelligence at genetic level. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
28441426	20170426	Identification of genes associated with dissociation of cognitive performance and neuropathological burden: Multistep analysis of genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional data.	The molecular underpinnings of the dissociation of cognitive performance and neuropathological burden are poorly understood, and there are currently no known genetic or epigenetic determinants of the dissociation. &quot;Residual cognition&quot; was quantified by regressing out the effects of cerebral pathologies and demographic characteristics on global cognitive performance proximate to death. To identify genes influencing residual cognition, we leveraged neuropathological, genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional data available for deceased participants of the Religious Orders Study (n = 492) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (n = 487). Given that our sample size was underpowered to detect genome-wide significance, we applied a multistep approach to identify genes influencing residual cognition, based on our prior observation that independent genetic and epigenetic risk factors can converge on the same locus. In the first step (n = 979), we performed a genome-wide association study with a predefined suggestive p &lt; 10-5, and nine independent loci met this threshold in eight distinct chromosomal regions. Three of the six genes within 100 kb of the lead SNP are expressed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC): UNC5C, ENC1, and TMEM106B. In the second step, in the subset of participants with DLPFC DNA methylation data (n = 648), we found that residual cognition was related to differential DNA methylation of UNC5C and ENC1 (false discovery rate &lt; 0.05). In the third step, in the subset of participants with DLPFC RNA sequencing data (n = 469), brain transcription levels of UNC5C and ENC1 were evaluated for their association with residual cognition: RNA levels of both UNC5C (estimated effect = -0.40, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.10, p = 0.0089) and ENC1 (estimated effect = 0.0064, 95% CI 0.0033 to 0.0096, p = 5.7 × 10-5) were associated with residual cognition. In secondary analyses, we explored the mechanism of these associations and found that ENC1 may be related to the previously documented effect of depression on cognitive decline, while UNC5C may alter the composition of presynaptic terminals. Of note, the TMEM106B allele identified in the first step as being associated with better residual cognition is in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs1990622A (r2 = 0.66), a previously identified protective allele for TDP-43 proteinopathy. Limitations include the small sample size for the genetic analysis, which was underpowered to detect genome-wide significance, the evaluation being limited to a single cortical region for epigenetic and transcriptomic data, and the use of categorical measures for certain non-amyloid-plaque, non-neurofibrillary-tangle neuropathologies. Through a multistep analysis of cognitive, neuropathological, genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data, we identified ENC1 and UNC5C as genes with convergent genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic evidence supporting a potential role in the dissociation of cognition and neuropathology in an aging population, and we expanded our understanding of the TMEM106B haplotype that is protective against TDP-43 proteinopathy.

28041642	20170103	A Genome-wide Association Study Identifies Risk Alleles in Plasminogen and P4HA2 Associated with Giant Cell Arteritis.	Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common form of vasculitis in individuals older than 50 years in Western countries. To shed light onto the genetic background influencing susceptibility for GCA, we performed a genome-wide association screening in a well-powered study cohort. After imputation, 1,844,133 genetic variants were analyzed in 2,134 case subjects and 9,125 unaffected individuals from ten independent populations of European ancestry. Our data confirmed HLA class II as the strongest associated region (independent signals: rs9268905, p = 1.94 × 10-54, per-allele OR = 1.79; and rs9275592, p = 1.14 × 10-40, OR = 2.08). Additionally, PLG and P4HA2 were identified as GCA risk genes at the genome-wide level of significance (rs4252134, p = 1.23 × 10-10, OR = 1.28; and rs128738, p = 4.60 × 10-9, OR = 1.32, respectively). Interestingly, we observed that the association peaks overlapped with different regulatory elements related to cell types and tissues involved in the pathophysiology of GCA. PLG and P4HA2 are involved in vascular remodelling and angiogenesis, suggesting a high relevance of these processes for the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this type of vasculitis.

28512992	20170518	+</sup>T-cells with bone erosion in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.	Bone erosion is a major problem worsening quality of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients' lives. However, causal factors responsible for bone erosion in RA have remained unclear. We aimed to examine genetic variants conferring bone erosion in RA using a Korean genome-wide association study (GWAS) and to search for possible biological mechanisms underlying the development of bone erosion. We obtained genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for 711 Korean RA patients using Illumina HapMap 550v3/660W arrays. Associations between SNPs and bone erosion status based on the Steinbrocker staging system were examined using multivariate logistic regression. Cell-type-specific enrichment of the epigenomic chromatin annotation H3K4me3 at the bone erosion associated variants was further investigated using National Institute of Health Roadmap Epigenomics data. As we tested the associations between 439 289 SNPs and bone erosion in 385 patients with erosive RA and 326 with non-erosive RA, none of the tested SNPs reached the genome-wide significance threshold, although many loci showed modest genetic effect on bone erosion status with suggestive association (e.g., rs2741200 [P = 3.75 × 10-6] in the SLA-TG locus and rs12422918 [P = 4.13 × 10-6] in SRGAP1). However, the top-ranked SNPs and their linked proxies, which were mostly located in non-coding variants, were significantly co-localized with the highly tissue-specific regulatory marker H3K4me3 in CD8+memory T-cells (P = 0.014). Although, there was no large-effect variants associated with bone erosion in our GWAS, we have shown that CD8+memory T-cells may have relevance with bone erosion in patients with RA through the analysis of ChiP-seq data.

28250457	20170303	Genome-wide analyses identify common variants associated with macular telangiectasia type 2.	Idiopathic juxtafoveal retinal telangiectasis type 2 (macular telangiectasia type 2; MacTel) is a rare neurovascular degenerative retinal disease. To identify genetic susceptibility loci for MacTel, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 476 cases and 1,733 controls of European ancestry. Genome-wide significant associations (P &lt; 5 × 10-8) were identified at three independent loci (rs73171800 at 5q14.3, P = 7.74 × 10-17; rs715 at 2q34, P = 9.97 × 10-14; rs477992 at 1p12, P = 2.60 × 10-12) and then replicated (P &lt; 0.01) in an independent cohort of 172 cases and 1,134 controls. The 5q14.3 locus is known to associate with variation in retinal vascular diameter, and the 2q34 and 1p12 loci have been implicated in the glycine/serine metabolic pathway. We subsequently found significant differences in blood serum levels of glycine (P = 4.04 × 10-6) and serine (P = 2.48 × 10-4) between MacTel cases and controls. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428
28656603	20170629	A genetic variant near GATA3 implicated in inherited susceptibility and etiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).	Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and associated lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common conditions. Little is known about their etiologies except that studies have suggested a substantial heritable component. Our objective is to provide a comprehensive, genome-wide evaluation of inherited risks and possible mechanisms of etiology in BPH. We performed a three-stage, genome-wide association study (GWAS) of men from three independent populations, the REduction by DUtasteride of prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial, the CLUE II cohort, and a Finnish hospital-based population. DNA samples were genotyped using the Illumina HumanOmniExpress BeadChip in REDUCE and CLUE II, and using the Sequenom iPLEX system for the confirmation stage in the Finnish population. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association between each SNP and BPH/LUTS. Fourteen SNPs reached P?&lt;?5.0?×?10-4in the meta-analysis of the two GWASs (CLUE II and REDUCE). A total of 773 SNPs were chosen for the confirmation step in the Finish cohort. Only one SNP (rs17144046) located ?489?kb downstream of GATA3 remained significant after correction for multiple testing (P?&lt;?6.5?×?10-5). This SNP marginally reached the GWAS significance level after performing a meta-analysis of the three stages (P-meta?=?8.89?×?10-7). Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses showed that the risk allele (G) of rs17144046 was significantly associated with increased expression of GATA3 (P?=?0.017). Reported studies indicated a close correlation between GATA3 and BPH pathogenesis and progression. Rs17144046 located near GATA3 was significantly associated with BPH/LUTS in three independent populations, but did not reach a stringent GWAS significance level. Genetic variants of GATA3 may play a role in the inherited susceptibility and etiology of BPH/LUTS. Further research in this area is needed. 	Prostate	D016428 D016448 D016449
28115744	20170125	A genome-wide association study identifies two novel susceptibility loci and trans population polygenicity associated with bipolar disorder.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several susceptibility loci for bipolar disorder (BD) and shown that the genetic architecture of BD can be explained by polygenicity, with numerous variants contributing to BD. In the present GWAS (Phase I/II), which included 2964 BD and 61?887 control subjects from the Japanese population, we detected a novel susceptibility locus at 11q12.2 (rs28456, P=6.4 × 10-9), a region known to contain regulatory genes for plasma lipid levels (FADS1/2/3). A subsequent meta-analysis of Phase I/II and the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium for BD (PGC-BD) identified another novel BD gene, NFIX (Pbest=5.8 × 10-10), and supported three regions previously implicated in BD susceptibility: MAD1L1 (Pbest=1.9 × 10-9), TRANK1 (Pbest=2.1 × 10-9) and ODZ4 (Pbest=3.3 × 10-9). Polygenicity of BD within Japanese and trans-European-Japanese populations was assessed with risk profile score analysis. We detected higher scores in BD cases both within (Phase I/II) and across populations (Phase I/II and PGC-BD). These were defined by (1) Phase II as discovery and Phase I as target, or vice versa (for 'within Japanese comparisons', Pbest~10-29, R2~2%), and (2) European PGC-BD as discovery and Japanese BD (Phase I/II) as target (for 'trans-European-Japanese comparison,' Pbest~10-13, R2~0.27%). This 'trans population' effect was supported by estimation of the genetic correlation using the effect size based on each population (liability estimates~0.7). These results indicate that (1) two novel and three previously implicated loci are significantly associated with BD and that (2) BD 'risk' effect are shared between Japanese and European populations.

28453575	20170429	Genome-wide association study of red blood cell traits in Hispanics/Latinos: The Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos.	Prior GWAS have identified loci associated with red blood cell (RBC) traits in populations of European, African, and Asian ancestry. These studies have not included individuals with an Amerindian ancestral background, such as Hispanics/Latinos, nor evaluated the full spectrum of genomic variation beyond single nucleotide variants. Using a custom genotyping array enriched for Amerindian ancestral content and 1000 Genomes imputation, we performed GWAS in 12,502 participants of Hispanic Community Health Study and Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) for hematocrit, hemoglobin, RBC count, RBC distribution width (RDW), and RBC indices. Approximately 60% of previously reported RBC trait loci generalized to HCHS/SOL Hispanics/Latinos, including African ancestral alpha- and beta-globin gene variants. In addition to the known 3.8kb alpha-globin copy number variant, we identified an Amerindian ancestral association in an alpha-globin regulatory region on chromosome 16p13.3 for mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin. We also discovered and replicated three genome-wide significant variants in previously unreported loci for RDW (SLC12A2 rs17764730, PSMB5 rs941718), and hematocrit (PROX1 rs3754140). Among the proxy variants at the SLC12A2 locus we identified rs3812049, located in a bi-directional promoter between SLC12A2 (which encodes a red cell membrane ion-transport protein) and an upstream anti-sense long-noncoding RNA, LINC01184, as the likely causal variant. We further demonstrate that disruption of the regulatory element harboring rs3812049 affects transcription of SLC12A2 and LINC01184 in human erythroid progenitor cells. Together, these results reinforce the importance of genetic study of diverse ancestral populations, in particular Hispanics/Latinos. 	PLoS_Genet.	D016428
28358029	20170331	Genome-wide association study identifies three novel loci in Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy.	The structure of the cornea is vital to its transparency, and dystrophies that disrupt corneal organization are highly heritable. To understand the genetic aetiology of Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), the most prevalent corneal disorder requiring transplantation, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 1,404 FECD cases and 2,564 controls of European ancestry, followed by replication and meta-analysis, for a total of 2,075 cases and 3,342 controls. We identify three novel loci meeting genome-wide significance (P&lt;5 × 10-8): KANK4 rs79742895, LAMC1 rs3768617 and LINC00970/ATP1B1 rs1200114. We also observe an overwhelming effect of the established TCF4 locus. Interestingly, we detect differential sex-specific association at LAMC1, with greater risk in women, and TCF4, with greater risk in men. Combining GWAS results with biological evidence we expand the knowledge of common FECD loci from one to four, and provide a deeper understanding of the underlying pathogenic basis of FECD.

28552477	20170530	Genome-wide association study of erythrocyte density in sickle cell disease patients.	Deoxy-hemoglobin S polymerization into rigid fibers is the direct cause of the clinical sequelae observed in sickle cell disease (SCD). The rate of polymerization of sickle hemoglobin is determined primarily by intracellular hemoglobin concentration, itself dependent on the amount of sickle hemoglobin and on red blood cell (RBC) volume. Dense, dehydrated RBC (DRBC) are observed in SCD patients, and their number correlates with hemolytic parameters and complications such as renal dysfunction, leg ulcers and priapism. To identify new genes involved in RBC hydration in SCD, we performed the first genome-wide association study for DRBC in 374 sickle cell anemia (HbSS) patients. We did not find genome-wide significant results, indicating that variants that modulate DRBC have modest-to-weak effects. A secondary analysis demonstrated a nominal association (P=0.003) between DRBC in SCD patients and a variant associated with mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) in non-anemic individuals. This intronic variant controls the expression of ATP2B4, the main calcium pump in erythrocytes. Our study highlights ATP2B4 as a promising target for modulation of RBC hydration in SCD patients.

28095793	20170119	Genetic variation underlying renal uric acid excretion in Hispanic children: the Viva La Familia Study.	Reduced renal excretion of uric acid plays a significant role in the development of hyperuricemia and gout in adults. Hyperuricemia has been associated with chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease in children and adults. There are limited genome-wide association studies associating genetic polymorphisms with renal urate excretion measures. Therefore, we investigated the genetic factors that influence the excretion of uric acid and related indices in 768 Hispanic children of the Viva La Familia Study. We performed a genome-wide association analysis for 24-h urinary excretion measures such as urinary uric acid/urinary creatinine ratio, uric acid clearance, fractional excretion of uric acid, and glomerular load of uric acid in SOLAR, while accounting for non-independence among family members. All renal urate excretion measures were significantly heritable (p &lt;2?×?10-6) and ranged from 0.41 to 0.74. Empirical threshold for genome-wide significance was set at p &lt;1?×?10-7. We observed a strong association (p?&lt;?8?×?10-8) of uric acid clearance with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in zinc finger protein 446 (ZNF446) (rs2033711 (A/G), MAF: 0.30). The minor allele (G) was associated with increased uric acid clearance. Also, we found suggestive associations of uric acid clearance with SNPs in ZNF324, ZNF584, and ZNF132 (in a 72 kb region of 19q13; p &lt;1?×?10-6, MAFs: 0.28-0.31). For the first time, we showed the importance of 19q13 region in the regulation of renal urate excretion in Hispanic children. Our findings indicate differences in inherent genetic architecture and shared environmental risk factors between our cohort and other pediatric and adult populations. 	BMC_Med._Genet.	D016428
27992416	20161220	Genome-wide association analyses of sleep disturbance traits identify new loci and highlight shared genetics with neuropsychiatric and metabolic traits.	Chronic sleep disturbances, associated with cardiometabolic diseases, psychiatric disorders and all-cause mortality, affect 25-30% of adults worldwide. Although environmental factors contribute substantially to self-reported habitual sleep duration and disruption, these traits are heritable and identification of the genes involved should improve understanding of sleep, mechanisms linking sleep to disease and development of new therapies. We report single- and multiple-trait genome-wide association analyses of self-reported sleep duration, insomnia symptoms and excessive daytime sleepiness in the UK Biobank (n = 112,586). We discover loci associated with insomnia symptoms (near MEIS1, TMEM132E, CYCL1 and TGFBI in females and WDR27 in males), excessive daytime sleepiness (near AR-OPHN1) and a composite sleep trait (near PATJ (INADL) and HCRTR2) and replicate a locus associated with sleep duration (at PAX8). We also observe genetic correlation between longer sleep duration and schizophrenia risk (rg= 0.29, P = 1.90 × 10-13) and between increased levels of excessive daytime sleepiness and increased measures for adiposity traits (body mass index (BMI): rg= 0.20, P = 3.12 × 10-9; waist circumference: rg= 0.20, P = 2.12 × 10-7).

28108127	20170122	Genome-wide association study in takotsubo syndrome - Preliminary results and future directions.	Takotsubo syndrome (TS) is an acute non-ischemic cardiomyopathy characterized by transient regional systolic dysfunction of the left and/or right ventricle with still unknown etiology. The aim of the current study was to conduct for the first time a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a cohort of TS patients to identify potential genetic risk variants. This single-center study was conducted at the University Heart Center Lübeck from 2008 to 2016. DNA isolation was done according to standard protocols. Imputation of genotypes were performed at the Michigan Imputation Server (https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu) using the 1000G Phase 3 v5 reference panel. The study population consisted of 96 TS patients (91 females, 5 males) with a mean age of 71.9±10.4years and 475 healthy controls (268 males, 207 females). The results of GWAS analysis showed several promising candidate loci (68 loci after applying threshold of p&lt;5?10-4and MAF&gt;5%). Of these 68 loci, 18 loci contained top single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were supported by SNPs in high Linkage Disequilibrium (r2&gt;0.8) with p&lt;10-3. Two out of the 18 loci contained SNP with hits in the GWAS catalog (traits: blood pressure, thyroid stimulating hormone). This first GWAS analysis in a larger cohort of patients with TS showed promising preliminary results. Further intensive research efforts of international collaborators are now necessary to enable deep-phenotyping of TS patients to ultimately assess a potential genetic cause of TS. 	Int._J._Cardiol.

28701861	20170714	A Preliminary Genome-Wide Association Study of Pain-Related Fear: Implications for Orofacial Pain.	Acute and chronic orofacial pain can significantly impact overall health and functioning. Associations between fear of pain and the experience of orofacial pain are well-documented, and environmental, behavioral, and cognitive components of fear of pain have been elucidated. Little is known, however, regarding the specific genes contributing to fear of pain. A genome-wide association study (GWAS;N= 990) was performed to identify plausible genes that may predispose individuals to various levels of fear of pain. The total score and three subscales (fear of minor, severe, and medical/dental pain) of the Fear of Pain Questionnaire-9 (FPQ-9) were modeled in a variance components modeling framework to test for genetic association with 8.5?M genetic variants across the genome, while adjusting for sex, age, education, and income. Three genetic loci were significantly associated with fear of minor pain (8q24.13, 8p21.2, and 6q26;p&lt; 5 × 10-8for all) near the genesTMEM65,NEFM,NEFL,AGPAT4, andPARK2. Other suggestive loci were found for the fear of pain total score and each of the FPQ-9 subscales. Multiple genes were identified as possible candidates contributing to fear of pain. The findings may have implications for understanding and treating chronic orofacial pain. 	Pain_Res_Manag	D016428
28630421	20170621	A genome-wide association study of anorexia nervosa suggests a risk locus implicated in dysregulated leptin signaling.	We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of anorexia nervosa (AN) using a stringently defined phenotype. Analysis of phenotypic variability led to the identification of a specific genetic risk factor that approached genome-wide significance (rs929626 in EBF1 (Early B-Cell Factor 1); P?=?2.04?×?10-7; OR?=?0.7; 95% confidence interval (CI)?=?0.61-0.8) with independent replication (P?=?0.04), suggesting a variant-mediated dysregulation of leptin signaling may play a role in AN. Multiple SNPs in LD with the variant support the nominal association. This demonstrates that although the clinical and etiologic heterogeneity of AN is universally recognized, further careful sub-typing of cases may provide more precise genomic signals. In this study, through a refinement of the phenotype spectrum of AN, we present a replicable GWAS signal that is nominally associated with AN, highlighting a potentially important candidate locus for further investigation.

28739605	20170726	LRP2</i>increases relapse risk in multiple sclerosis.	Due to the lack of prospective studies with longitudinal data on relapse, past genetic studies have not attempted to identify genetic factors that predict relapse risk (the primary endpoint of many pivotal clinical trials testing the efficacy of multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying drugs) at a genome-wide scale. We conducted a genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) to identify genetic variants that predict MS relapse risk, using a three-stage approach. First, GWAS was conducted using the southern Tasmania MS Longitudinal Study with 141 cases followed prospectively for a mean of 2.3 years. Second, GWAS was conducted using the Ausimmune Longitudinal Study with 127 cases having a classic first demyelinating event followed for 5 years from onset. Third, the top hits with p&lt;5.0×10-6from the first two stages were combined with a longitudinal US paediatric MS cohort with 181 cases followed for 5 years after onset. Predictors of time to relapse were evaluated by a mixed effects Cox model. An inverse variance fixed effects model was then used to undertake a meta-analysis. In the pooled results, using these three unique longitudinal MS cohorts, we discovered one novel locus (LRP2; most significant single nucleotide polymorphism rs12988804) that reached genome-wide significance in predicting relapse risk (HR=2.18, p=3.30×10-8). LRP2 is expressed on the surface of many central nervous system cells including neurons and oligodendrocytes and is a critical receptor in axonal guidance. The finding of a genetic locus that has extensive effects on neuronal development and repair is of interest as a potential modulator of MS disease course. 	J._Neurol._Neurosurg._Psychiatry	D016428
26701879	20151225	Identification of new susceptibility loci for gastric non-cardia adenocarcinoma: pooled results from two Chinese genome-wide association studies.	Although several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of non-cardia gastric cancer have been published, more novel association signals could be exploited by combining individual studies together, which will further elucidate the genetic susceptibility of non-cardia gastric cancer. We conducted a meta-analysis of two published Chinese GWAS studies (2031 non-cardia gastric cancer cases and 4970 cancer-free controls) and followed by genotyping of additional 3564 cases and 4637 controls in two stages. The overall meta-analysis revealed two new association signals. The first was a novel locus at 5q14.3 and marked by rs7712641 (per-allele OR=0.84, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.88; p=1.21×10-11). This single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker maps to the intron of the long non-coding RNA, lnc-POLR3G-4 (XLOC_004464), which we observed has lower expression in non-cardia gastric tumour compared with matched normal tissue (Pwilcoxon signed-rank=7.20×10-4). We also identified a new signal at the 1q22 locus, rs80142782 (per-allele OR=0.62; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.69; p=1.71×10-19), which was independent of the previously reported SNP at the same locus, rs4072037 (per-allele OR=0.74; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.79; p=6.28×10-17). Analysis of the new SNP conditioned on the known SNP showed that the new SNP remained genome-wide significant (Pconditional=3.47×10-8). Interestingly, rs80142782 has a minor allele frequency of 0.05 in East Asians but is monomorphic in both European and African populations. These findings add new evidence for inherited genetic susceptibility to non-cardia gastric cancer and provide further clues to its aetiology in the Han Chinese population.

27647854	20160921	The Genetic Landscape of Renal Complications in Type 1 Diabetes.	Diabetes is the leading cause of ESRD. Despite evidence for a substantial heritability of diabetic kidney disease, efforts to identify genetic susceptibility variants have had limited success. We extended previous efforts in three dimensions, examining a more comprehensive set of genetic variants in larger numbers of subjects with type 1 diabetes characterized for a wider range of cross-sectional diabetic kidney disease phenotypes. In 2843 subjects, we estimated that the heritability of diabetic kidney disease was 35% (P=6.4×10-3). Genome-wide association analysis and replication in 12,540 individuals identified no single variants reaching stringent levels of significance and, despite excellent power, provided little independent confirmation of previously published associated variants. Whole-exome sequencing in 997 subjects failed to identify any large-effect coding alleles of lower frequency influencing the risk of diabetic kidney disease. However, sets of alleles increasing body mass index (P=2.2×10-5) and the risk of type 2 diabetes (P=6.1×10-4) associated with the risk of diabetic kidney disease. We also found genome-wide genetic correlation between diabetic kidney disease and failure at smoking cessation (P=1.1×10-4). Pathway analysis implicated ascorbate and aldarate metabolism (P=9.0×10-6), and pentose and glucuronate interconversions (P=3.0×10-6) in pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease. These data provide further evidence for the role of genetic factors influencing diabetic kidney disease in those with type 1 diabetes and highlight some key pathways that may be responsible. Altogether these results reveal important biology behind the major cause of kidney disease. 	J._Am._Soc._Nephrol.	D016428
28641744	20170624	Polygenic risk score and heritability estimates reveals a genetic relationship between ASD and OCD.	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are both highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorders that conceivably share genetic risk factors. However, the underlying genetic determinants remain largely unknown. In this work, the authors describe a combined genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ASD and OCD. The OCD dataset includes 2998 individuals in nuclear families. The ASD dataset includes 6898 individuals in case-parents trios. GWAS summary statistics were examined for potential enrichment of functional variants associated with gene expression levels in brain regions. The top ranked SNP is rs4785741 (chromosome 16) with P value=6.9×10-7in our re-analysis. Polygenic risk score analyses were conducted to investigate the genetic relationship within and across the two disorders. These analyses identified a significant polygenic component of ASD, predicting 0.11% of the phenotypic variance in an independent OCD data set. In addition, we examined the genomic architecture of ASD and OCD by estimating heritability on different chromosomes and different allele frequencies, analyzing genome-wide common variant data by using the Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) program. The estimated global heritability of OCD is 0.427 (se=0.093) and 0.174 (se=0.053) for ASD in these imputed data. 	Eur_Neuropsychopharmacol	D016428 D052061
28425483	20170421	A genome-wide association study identifies six novel risk loci for primary biliary cholangitis.	Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease with a strong hereditary component. Here, we report a genome-wide association study that included 1,122 PBC cases and 4,036 controls of Han Chinese descent, with subsequent replication in a separate cohort of 907 PBC cases and 2,127 controls. Our results show genome-wide association of 14 PBC risk loci including previously identified 6p21 (HLA-DRA and DPB1), 17q12 (ORMDL3), 3q13.33 (CD80), 2q32.3 (STAT1/STAT4), 3q25.33 (IL12A), 4q24 (NF-?B) and 22q13.1 (RPL3/SYNGR1). We also identified variants in IL21, IL21R, CD28/CTLA4/ICOS, CD58, ARID3A and IL16 as novel PBC risk loci. These new findings and histochemical studies showing enhanced expression of IL21 and IL21R in PBC livers (particularly in the hepatic portal tracks) support a disease mechanism in which the deregulation of the IL21 signalling pathway, in addition to CD4 T-cell activation and T-cell co-stimulation are critical components in the development of PBC.

28222112	20170222	Genome-wide study of resistant hypertension identified from electronic health records.	Resistant hypertension is defined as high blood pressure that remains above treatment goals in spite of the concurrent use of three antihypertensive agents from different classes. Despite the important health consequences of resistant hypertension, few studies of resistant hypertension have been conducted. To perform a genome-wide association study for resistant hypertension, we defined and identified cases of resistant hypertension and hypertensives with treated, controlled hypertension among &gt;47,500 adults residing in the US linked to electronic health records (EHRs) and genotyped as part of the electronic MEdical Records &amp; GEnomics (eMERGE) Network. Electronic selection logic using billing codes, laboratory values, text queries, and medication records was used to identify resistant hypertension cases and controls at each site, and a total of 3,006 cases of resistant hypertension and 876 controlled hypertensives were identified among eMERGE Phase I and II sites. After imputation and quality control, a total of 2,530,150 SNPs were tested for an association among 2,830 multi-ethnic cases of resistant hypertension and 876 controlled hypertensives. No test of association was genome-wide significant in the full dataset or in the dataset limited to European American cases (n = 1,719) and controls (n = 708). The most significant finding was CLNK rs13144136 at p = 1.00x10-6 (odds ratio = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.58-0.80) in the full dataset with similar results in the European American only dataset. We also examined whether SNPs known to influence blood pressure or hypertension also influenced resistant hypertension. None was significant after correction for multiple testing. These data highlight both the difficulties and the potential utility of EHR-linked genomic data to study clinically-relevant traits such as resistant hypertension. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428
28662289	20170630	Genome-wide association analysis identifies a GLUL haplotype for familial hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma.	A family history of liver cancer increases the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by 2-fold to 10-fold among patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV). Previous genome-wide association studies have identified many possible susceptible loci associated with sporadic HBV-related HCC. However, despite family history being a well-known risk factor for HBV-related HCC, to the authors' knowledge its genetic mechanisms and associating loci remain largely unknown or unexplored, most likely due to the relative rarity of familial HCC and the difficulty of sample collection. The authors conducted a genome-wide association study with 139 male cases with familial HBV-related HCC and 139 non-HCC male controls with chronic HBV. The results were corroborated further with an independent cohort of 101 patients with familial HBV-related HCC and comparison with both the 1000 Genomes Project and the Taiwan Biobank. A total of 51 risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms (P?1E-04) were identified in the association analyses, which included 2 clusters of associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes at 1q25.3 (glutamate-ammonia ligase [GLUL]/transmembrane epididymal protein 1 [TEDDM1]/long intergenic non-protein-coding RNA 272 [LINC00272]/regulator of G-protein signaling-like 1 [RGSL1]) and 17q11.2 (solute carrier family 13 member 2 [SLC13A2]/forkhead box N1 [FOXN1]). Both the GLUL and SLC13A2/FOXN1 haplotypes have large effect sizes and were found to be different from those found from genome-wide association studies of sporadic HCCs. To the authors' knowledge, the current study is the first genome-wide association study to identify genetic factors for familial HBV-related HCC. The results identified 2 large effect susceptible haplotypes located at GLUL and SLC13A2/FOXN1. The current study findings also suggest different genetic susceptibility between familial and sporadic HBV-related HCC. Cancer 2017;123:3966-76. © 2017 American Cancer Society. 	Cancer	D016428
28698626	20170713	A genome-wide association study suggests the HLA Class II region as the major susceptibility locus for IgA vasculitis.	The genetic component of Immunoglobulin-A (IgA) vasculitis is still far to be elucidated. To increase the current knowledge on the genetic component of this vasculitis we performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) on this condition. 308 IgA vasculitis patients and 1,018 healthy controls from Spain were genotyped by Illumina HumanCore BeadChips. Imputation of GWAS data was performed using the 1000 Genomes Project Phase III dataset as reference panel. After quality control filters and GWAS imputation, 285 patients and 1,006 controls remained in the datasets and were included in further analysis. Additionally, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region was comprehensively studied by imputing classical alleles and polymorphic amino acid positions. A linkage disequilibrium block of polymorphisms located in the HLA class II region surpassed the genome-wide level of significance (OR?=?0.56, 95% CI?=?0.46-0.68). Although no polymorphic amino acid positions were associated at the genome-wide level of significance, P-values of potential relevance were observed for the positions 13 and 11 of HLA-DRB1 (P?=?6.67E-05, P?=?1.88E-05, respectively). Outside the HLA, potential associations were detected, but none of them were close to the statistical significance. In conclusion, our study suggests that IgA vasculitis is an archetypal HLA class II disease. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
28416822	20170419	Identification of six new genetic loci associated with atrial fibrillation in the Japanese population.	Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and leads to stroke. To investigate genetic loci associated with atrial fibrillation in the Japanese population, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that included 8,180 atrial fibrillation cases and 28,612 controls with follow-up in an additional 3,120 cases and 125,064 controls. We replicated previously reported loci and identified six new loci, near the KCND3, PPFIA4, SLC1A4-CEP68, HAND2, NEBL and SH3PXD2A genes. Five of the six new loci were specifically associated with atrial fibrillation in the Japanese population after comparing our data to those from individuals of European ancestry, suggesting that there might be different genetic factors affecting susceptibility across ancestry groups. Our study discovered variants in the HAND2, KCND3 and NEBL genes, which are relevant to atrial fibrillation susceptibility. The involvement of PPFIA4 and SH3PXD2A in axon guidance also suggested a role in disease pathogenesis. Our findings may contribute to a better understanding of atrial fibrillation susceptibility and pathogenesis. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428
28053049	20170106	Genome-wide association study with additional genetic and post-transcriptional analyses reveals novel regulators of plasma factor XI levels.	Coagulation factor XI (FXI) has become increasingly interesting for its role in pathogenesis of thrombosis. While elevated plasma levels of FXI have been associated with venous thromboembolism and ischemic stroke, its deficiency is associated with mild bleeding. We aimed to determine novel genetic and post-transcriptional plasma FXI regulators.We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for plasma FXI levels, using novel data imputed to the 1000 Genomes reference panel. Individual GWAS analyses, including a total of 16,169 European individuals from the ARIC, GHS, MARTHA and PROCARDIS studies, were meta-analysed and further replicated in 2,045 individuals from the F5L family, GAIT2 and MEGA studies. Additional association with activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was tested for the top SNPs. In addition, a study on the effect of miRNA on FXI regulation was performed using in silico prediction tools and in vitro luciferase assays.Three loci showed robust, replicating association with circulating FXI levels: KNG1 (rs710446, P-value?=?2.07?×?10-302), F11 (rs4253417, P-value ?=?2.86?×?10-193), and a novel association in GCKR (rs780094, P-value ?=?3.56 ×10-09), here for the first time implicated in FXI regulation. The two first SNPs (rs710446 and rs4253417) also associated with aPTT. Conditional and haplotype analyses demonstrated a complex association signal, with additional novel SNPs modulating plasma FXI levels in both the F11 and KNG1 loci. Finally, eight miRNAs were predicted to bind F11 mRNA. Over-expression of either miR-145 or miR-181 significantly reduced the luciferase activity in cells transfected with a plasmid containing FXI-3'UTR.These results should open the door to new therapeutic targets for thrombosis prevention.

28512139	20170518	A genome-wide association meta-analysis on lipoprotein (a) concentrations adjusted for apolipoprotein (a) isoforms.	High lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] concentrations are an independent risk factor for cardiovascular outcomes. Concentrations are strongly influenced by apo(a) kringle IV repeat isoforms. We aimed to identify genetic loci associated with Lp(a) concentrations using data from five genome-wide association studies (n = 13,781). We identified 48 independent SNPs in theLPAand 1 SNP in theAPOEgene region to be significantly associated with Lp(a) concentrations. We also adjusted for apo(a) isoforms to identify loci affecting Lp(a) levels independently from them, which resulted in 31 SNPs (30 in theLPA, 1 in theAPOEgene region). Seven SNPs showed a genome-wide significant association with coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. A rare SNP (rs186696265; MAF ?1%) showed the highest effect on Lp(a) and was also associated with increased risk of CAD (odds ratio = 1.73,P= 3.35 × 10-30). Median Lp(a) values increased from 2.1 to 91.1 mg/dl with increasing number of Lp(a)-increasing alleles. We found theAPOE2-determining allele of rs7412 to be significantly associated with Lp(a) concentrations (P= 3.47 × 10-10). EachAPOE2allele decreased Lp(a) by 3.34 mg/dl corresponding to ?15% of the population's mean values. Performing a gene-based test of association, including suspected Lp(a) receptors and regulators, resulted in one significant association of theTLR2gene with Lp(a) (P= 3.4 × 10-4). In summary, we identified a large number of independent SNPs in theLPAgene region, as well as theAPOE2allele, to be significantly associated with Lp(a) concentrations. 	J._Lipid_Res.	D016428
28077804	20170113	The complex genetics of gait speed: genome-wide meta-analysis approach.	Emerging evidence suggests that the basis for variation in late-life mobility is attributable, in part, to genetic factors, which may become increasingly important with age. Our objective was to systematically assess the contribution of genetic variation to gait speed in older individuals. We conducted a meta-analysis of gait speed GWASs in 31,478 older adults from 17 cohorts of the CHARGE consortium, and validated our results in 2,588 older adults from 4 independent studies. We followed our initial discoveries with network and eQTL analysis of candidate signals in tissues. The meta-analysis resulted in a list of 536 suggestive genome wide significant SNPs in or near 69 genes. Further interrogation with Pathway Analysis placed gait speed as a polygenic complex trait in five major networks. Subsequent eQTL analysis revealed several SNPs significantly associated with the expression of PRSS16, WDSUB1 and PTPRT, which in addition to the meta-analysis and pathway suggested that genetic effects on gait speed may occur through synaptic function and neuronal development pathways. No genome-wide significant signals for gait speed were identified from this moderately large sample of older adults, suggesting that more refined physical function phenotypes will be needed to identify the genetic basis of gait speed in aging.

27694927	20161004	A genome-wide association study identifies risk loci for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia at 10q26.13 and 12q23.1.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have shown that common genetic variation contributes to the heritable risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To identify new susceptibility loci for the largest subtype of ALL, B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL), we conducted a meta-analysis of two GWASs with imputation using 1000 Genomes and UK10K Project data as reference (totaling 1658 cases and 7224 controls). After genotyping an additional 2525 cases and 3575 controls, we identify new susceptibility loci for BCP-ALL mapping to 10q26.13 (rs35837782, LHPP, P=1.38 × 10-11) and 12q23.1 (rs4762284, ELK3, P=8.41 × 10-9). We also provide confirmatory evidence for the existence of independent risk loci at 9p21.3, but show that the association marked by rs77728904 can be accounted for by linkage disequilibrium with the rare high-impact CDKN2A p.Ala148Thr variant rs3731249. Our data provide further insights into genetic susceptibility to ALL and its biology. 	Leukemia	D016428
28346443	20170328	Genome-wide association study of glioma subtypes identifies specific differences in genetic susceptibility to glioblastoma and non-glioblastoma tumors.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have transformed our understanding of glioma susceptibility, but individual studies have had limited power to identify risk loci. We performed a meta-analysis of existing GWAS and two new GWAS, which totaled 12,496 cases and 18,190 controls. We identified five new loci for glioblastoma (GBM) at 1p31.3 (rs12752552; P = 2.04 × 10-9, odds ratio (OR) = 1.22), 11q14.1 (rs11233250; P = 9.95 × 10-10, OR = 1.24), 16p13.3 (rs2562152; P = 1.93 × 10-8, OR = 1.21), 16q12.1 (rs10852606; P = 1.29 × 10-11, OR = 1.18) and 22q13.1 (rs2235573; P = 1.76 × 10-10, OR = 1.15), as well as eight loci for non-GBM tumors at 1q32.1 (rs4252707; P = 3.34 × 10-9, OR = 1.19), 1q44 (rs12076373; P = 2.63 × 10-10, OR = 1.23), 2q33.3 (rs7572263; P = 2.18 × 10-10, OR = 1.20), 3p14.1 (rs11706832; P = 7.66 × 10-9, OR = 1.15), 10q24.33 (rs11598018; P = 3.39 × 10-8, OR = 1.14), 11q21 (rs7107785; P = 3.87 × 10-10, OR = 1.16), 14q12 (rs10131032; P = 5.07 × 10-11, OR = 1.33) and 16p13.3 (rs3751667; P = 2.61 × 10-9, OR = 1.18). These data substantiate that genetic susceptibility to GBM and non-GBM tumors are highly distinct, which likely reflects different etiology. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428
28289848	20170315	Genome-wide associations of CD46 and IFI44L genetic variants with neutralizing antibody response to measles vaccine.	Population-based studies have revealed 2-10% measles vaccine failure rate even after two vaccine doses. While the mechanisms behind this remain unknown, we hypothesized that host genetic factors are likely to be involved. We performed a genome-wide association study of measles specific neutralizing antibody and IFN? ELISPOT response in a combined sample of 2872 subjects. We identified two distinct chromosome 1 regions (previously associated with MMR-related febrile seizures), associated with vaccine-induced measles neutralizing antibody titers. The 1q32 region contained 20 significant SNPs in/around the measles virus receptor-encoding CD46 gene, including the intronic rs2724384 (p value = 2.64 × 10-09) and rs2724374 (p value = 3.16 × 10-09) SNPs. The 1q31.1 region contained nine significant SNPs in/around IFI44L, including the intronic rs1333973 (p value = 1.41 × 10-10) and the missense rs273259 (His73Arg, p value = 2.87 × 10-10) SNPs. Analysis of differential exon usage with mRNA-Seq data and RT-PCR suggests the involvement of rs2724374 minor G allele in the CD46 STP region exon B skipping, resulting in shorter CD46 isoforms. Our study reveals common CD46 and IFI44L SNPs associated with measles-specific humoral immunity, and highlights the importance of alternative splicing/virus cellular receptor isoform usage as a mechanism explaining inter-individual variation in immune response after live measles vaccine.

28604731	20170613	Genome-wide association analysis of insomnia complaints identifies risk genes and genetic overlap with psychiatric and metabolic traits.	Persistent insomnia is among the most frequent complaints in general practice. To identify genetic factors for insomnia complaints, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a genome-wide gene-based association study (GWGAS) in 113,006 individuals. We identify three loci and seven genes associated with insomnia complaints, with the associations for one locus and five genes supported by joint analysis with an independent sample (n = 7,565). Our top association (MEIS1, P &lt; 5 × 10-8) has previously been implicated in restless legs syndrome (RLS). Additional analyses favor the hypothesis that MEIS1 exhibits pleiotropy for insomnia and RLS and show that the observed association with insomnia complaints cannot be explained only by the presence of an RLS subgroup within the cases. Sex-specific analyses suggest that there are different genetic architectures between the sexes in addition to shared genetic factors. We show substantial positive genetic correlation of insomnia complaints with internalizing personality traits and metabolic traits and negative correlation with subjective well-being and educational attainment. These findings provide new insight into the genetic architecture of insomnia. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428
28348047	20170329	Genome-Wide Association Study Meta-Analysis of Long-Term Average Blood Pressure in East Asians.	Genome-wide single marker and gene-based meta-analyses of long-term average (LTA) blood pressure (BP) phenotypes may reveal novel findings for BP. We conducted genome-wide analysis among 18 422 East Asian participants (stage 1) followed by replication study of ?46 629 participants of European ancestry (stage 2). Significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms and genes were determined by aP&lt;5.0×10-8and 2.5×10-6, respectively, in joint analyses of stage-1 and stage-2 data. We identified 1 novelARL3variant, rs4919669 at 10q24.32, influencing LTA systolic BP (stage-1P=5.03×10-8, stage-2P=8.64×10-3, jointP=2.63×10-8) and mean arterial pressure (stage-1P=3.59×10-9, stage-2P=2.35×10-2, jointP=2.64×10-8). Three previously reported BP loci (WBP1L,NT5C2, andATP2B1) were also identified for all BP phenotypes. Gene-based analysis provided the first robust evidence for association ofKCNJ11with LTA systolic BP (stage-1P=8.55×10-6, stage-2P=1.62×10-5, jointP=3.28×10-9) and mean arterial pressure (stage-1P=9.19×10-7, stage-2P=9.69×10-5, jointP=2.15×10-9) phenotypes. Fourteen genes (TMEM180,ACTR1A,SUFU,ARL3,SFXN2,WBP1L,CYP17A1,C10orf32,C10orf32-ASMT,AS3MT,CNNM2, andNT5C2at 10q24.32;ATP2B1at 12q21.33; andNCR3LG1at 11p15.1) implicated by previous genome-wide association study meta-analyses were also identified. Among the loci identified by the previous genome-wide association study meta-analysis of LTA BP, we transethnically replicated associations of theKCNK3marker rs1275988 at 2p23.3 with LTA systolic BP and mean arterial pressure phenotypes (P=1.27×10-4and 3.30×10-4, respectively). We identified 1 novel variant and 1 novel gene and present the first direct evidence of relevance of theKCNK3locus for LTA BP among East Asians. 	Circ_Cardiovasc_Genet	D016428 D017418 D016448
28062682	20170108	Genome-wide association study of nevirapine hypersensitivity in a sub-Saharan African HIV-infected population.	The antiretroviral nevirapine is associated with hypersensitivity reactions in 6%-10% of patients, including hepatotoxicity, maculopapular exanthema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). To undertake a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic predisposing factors for the different clinical phenotypes associated with nevirapine hypersensitivity. A GWAS was undertaken in a discovery cohort of 151 nevirapine-hypersensitive and 182 tolerant, HIV-infected Malawian adults. Replication of signals was determined in a cohort of 116 cases and 68 controls obtained from Malawi, Uganda and Mozambique. Interaction with ERAP genes was determined in patients positive for HLA-C*04:01 . In silico docking studies were also performed for HLA-C*04:01 . Fifteen SNPs demonstrated nominal significance ( P? &lt; ? 1?×?10 -5 ) with one or more of the hypersensitivity phenotypes. The most promising signal was seen in SJS/TEN, where rs5010528 ( HLA-C locus) approached genome-wide significance ( P? &lt; ? 8.5?×?10 -8 ) and was below HLA -wide significance ( P? &lt; ? 2.5?×?10 -4 ) in the meta-analysis of discovery and replication cohorts [OR 4.84 (95% CI 2.71-8.61)]. rs5010528 is a strong proxy for HLA-C*04:01 carriage: in silico docking showed that two residues (33 and 123) in the B pocket were the most likely nevirapine interactors. There was no interaction between HLA-C*04:01 and ERAP1 , but there is a potential protective effect with ERAP2 [ P? = ? 0.019, OR 0.43 (95% CI 0.21-0.87)]. HLA-C*04:01 predisposes to nevirapine-induced SJS/TEN in sub-Saharan Africans, but not to other hypersensitivity phenotypes. This is likely to be mediated via binding to the B pocket of the HLA-C peptide. Whether this risk is modulated by ERAP2 variants requires further study. 	J._Antimicrob._Chemother.	D016428 D013485
28067908	20170110	Genome-wide association study implicates immune activation of multiple integrin genes in inflammatory bowel disease.	Genetic association studies have identified 215 risk loci for inflammatory bowel disease, thereby uncovering fundamental aspects of its molecular biology. We performed a genome-wide association study of 25,305 individuals and conducted a meta-analysis with published summary statistics, yielding a total sample size of 59,957 subjects. We identified 25 new susceptibility loci, 3 of which contain integrin genes that encode proteins in pathways that have been identified as important therapeutic targets in inflammatory bowel disease. The associated variants are correlated with expression changes in response to immune stimulus at two of these genes (ITGA4 and ITGB8) and at previously implicated loci (ITGAL and ICAM1). In all four cases, the expression-increasing allele also increases disease risk. We also identified likely causal missense variants in a gene implicated in primary immune deficiency, PLCG2, and a negative regulator of inflammation, SLAMF8. Our results demonstrate that new associations at common variants continue to identify genes relevant to therapeutic target identification and prioritization. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D017418
28167838	20170208	GLRB allelic variation associated with agoraphobic cognitions, increased startle response and fear network activation: a potential neurogenetic pathway to panic disorder.	The molecular genetics of panic disorder (PD) with and without agoraphobia (AG) are still largely unknown and progress is hampered by small sample sizes. We therefore performed a genome-wide association study with a dimensional, PD/AG-related anxiety phenotype based on the Agoraphobia Cognition Questionnaire (ACQ) in a sample of 1370 healthy German volunteers of the CRC TRR58 MEGA study wave 1. A genome-wide significant association was found between ACQ and single non-coding nucleotide variants of the GLRB gene (rs78726293, P=3.3 × 10-8; rs191260602, P=3.9 × 10-8). We followed up on this finding in a larger dimensional ACQ sample (N=2547) and in independent samples with a dichotomous AG phenotype based on the Symptoms Checklist (SCL-90; N=3845) and a case-control sample with the categorical phenotype PD/AG (Ncombined=1012) obtaining highly significant P-values also for GLRB single-nucleotide variants rs17035816 (P=3.8 × 10-4) and rs7688285 (P=7.6 × 10-5). GLRB gene expression was found to be modulated by rs7688285 in brain tissue, as well as cell culture. Analyses of intermediate PD/AG phenotypes demonstrated increased startle reflex and increased fear network, as well as general sensory activation by GLRB risk gene variants rs78726293, rs191260602, rs17035816 and rs7688285. Partial Glrb knockout mice demonstrated an agoraphobic phenotype. In conjunction with the clinical observation that rare coding GLRB gene mutations are associated with the neurological disorder hyperekplexia characterized by a generalized startle reaction and agoraphobic behavior, our data provide evidence that non-coding, although functional GLRB gene polymorphisms may predispose to PD by increasing startle response and agoraphobic cognitions.

28059113	20170107	Genome-wide association study identifies COL2A1 locus involved in the hand development failure of Kashin-Beck disease.	Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) is a chronic osteochondropathy. The pathogenesis of growth and development failure of hand of KBD remains elusive now. In this study, we conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of palmar length-width ratio (LWR) of KBD, totally including 493 study subjects. Affymetrix Genome Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 was applied for genome-wide SNP genotyping of 90?KBD patients. Association analysis was conducted by PLINK. Imputation analysis was performed by IMPUTE against the reference panel of the 1000 genome project. Two SNPs were selected for replication in an independent validation sample of 403?KBD patients. In the discovery GWAS, significant association was observed between palmar LWR and rs2071358 of COL2A1 gene (P value?=?4.68?×?10-8). In addition, GWAS detected suggestive association signal at rs4760608 of COL2A1 gene (P value?=?1.76?×?10-4). Imputation analysis of COL2A1 further identified 2 SNPs with association evidence for palmar LWR. Replication study observed significant association signals at both rs2071358 (P value?=?0.017) and rs4760608 (P value?=?0.002) of COL2A1 gene. Based on previous and our study results, we suggest that COL2A1 was a likely susceptibility gene involved in the hand development failure of KBD. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
28247064	20170302	Genome-wide association study identifies four novel loci associated with Alzheimer's endophenotypes and disease modifiers.	More than 20 genetic loci have been associated with risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but reported genome-wide significant loci do not account for all the estimated heritability and provide little information about underlying biological mechanisms. Genetic studies using intermediate quantitative traits such as biomarkers, or endophenotypes, benefit from increased statistical power to identify variants that may not pass the stringent multiple test correction in case-control studies. Endophenotypes also contain additional information helpful for identifying variants and genes associated with other aspects of disease, such as rate of progression or onset, and provide context to interpret the results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We conducted GWAS of amyloid beta (A?42), tau, and phosphorylated tau (ptau181) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 3146 participants across nine studies to identify novel variants associated with AD. Five genome-wide significant loci (two novel) were associated with ptau181, including loci that have also been associated with AD risk or brain-related phenotypes. Two novel loci associated with A?42near GLIS1 on 1p32.3 (? = -0.059, P = 2.08 × 10-8) and within SERPINB1 on 6p25 (? = -0.025, P = 1.72 × 10-8) were also associated with AD risk (GLIS1: OR = 1.105, P = 3.43 × 10-2), disease progression (GLIS1: ? = 0.277, P = 1.92 × 10-2), and age at onset (SERPINB1: ? = 0.043, P = 4.62 × 10-3). Bioinformatics indicate that the intronic SERPINB1 variant (rs316341) affects expression of SERPINB1 in various tissues, including the hippocampus, suggesting that SERPINB1 influences AD through an A?-associated mechanism. Analyses of known AD risk loci suggest CLU and FERMT2 may influence CSF A?42(P = 0.001 and P = 0.009, respectively) and the INPP5D locus may affect ptau181levels (P = 0.009); larger studies are necessary to verify these results. Together the findings from this study can be used to inform future AD studies. 	Acta_Neuropathol.	D016428
28051079	20170105	Genome-wide association scan of neuropathic pain symptoms post total joint replacement highlights a variant in the protein-kinase C gene.	Neuropathic pain-like joint symptoms (NP) are seen in a proportion of individuals diagnosed with osteoarthritis (OA) and post total joint replacement (TJR). In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using NP as defined by the painDETECT questionnaire (score &gt;12 indicating possible NP) in 613 post-TJR participants recruited from Nottinghamshire (UK). The prevalence of possible NP was 17.8%. The top four hits from the GWAS and two other biologically relevant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were replicated in individuals with OA and post TJR from an independent study in the same area (N=908) and in individuals from the Rotterdam Study (N=212). Three of these SNPs showed effect sizes in the same direction as in the GWAS results in both replication cohorts. The strongest association upon meta-analysis of a recessive model was for the variant allele in rs887797 mapping to the protein kinase C alpha (PRKCA) gene odds ratio (OR)possNP=2.41 (95% CI 1.74-3.34, P=1.29 × 10-7). This SNP has been found to be associated with multiple sclerosis and encodes a functional variant affecting splicing and expression of the PRKCA gene. The PRKCA gene has been associated with long-term potentiation, synaptic plasticity, chronic pain and memory in the literature, making this a biologically relevant finding. 	Eur._J._Hum._Genet.

27650483	20160922	African Ancestry-Specific Alleles and Kidney Disease Risk in Hispanics/Latinos.	African ancestry alleles may contribute to CKD among Hispanics/Latinos, but whether associations differ by Hispanic/Latino background remains unknown. We examined the association of CKD measures with African ancestry-specificAPOL1alleles that were directly genotyped and sickle cell trait (hemoglobin subunit?gene [HBB] variant) on the basis of imputation in 12,226 adult Hispanics/Latinos grouped according to Caribbean or Mainland background. We also performed an unbiased genome-wide association scan of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratios. Overall, 41.4% of participants were male, 44.6% of participants had a Caribbean background, and the mean age of all participants was 46.1 years. The Caribbean background group, compared with the Mainland background group, had a higher frequency of twoAPOL1alleles (1.0% versus 0.1%) and theHBBvariant (2.0% versus 0.7%). In the Caribbean background group, presence ofAPOL1alleles (2 versus 0/1 copies) or theHBBvariant (1 versus 0 copies) were significantly associated with albuminuria (odds ratio [OR], 3.2; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.7 to 6.1; and OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.8 to 3.8, respectively) and albuminuria and/or eGFR&lt;60 ml/min per 1.73 m2(OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5 to 5.4; and OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.7 to 3.5, respectively). The urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio genome-wide association scan identified associations with theHBBvariant among all participants, with the strongest association in the Caribbean background group (P=3.1×10-10versusP=9.3×10-3for the Mainland background group). In conclusion, African-specific alleles associate with CKD in Hispanics/Latinos, but allele frequency varies by Hispanic/Latino background/ancestry. 	J._Am._Soc._Nephrol.	D016428
28445677	20170427	Overexpression of the Cytokine BAFF and Autoimmunity Risk.	Genomewide association studies of autoimmune diseases have mapped hundreds of susceptibility regions in the genome. However, only for a few association signals has the causal gene been identified, and for even fewer have the causal variant and underlying mechanism been defined. Coincident associations of DNA variants affecting both the risk of autoimmune disease and quantitative immune variables provide an informative route to explore disease mechanisms and drug-targetable pathways. Using case-control samples from Sardinia, Italy, we performed a genomewide association study in multiple sclerosis followed by TNFSF13B locus-specific association testing in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Extensive phenotyping of quantitative immune variables, sequence-based fine mapping, cross-population and cross-phenotype analyses, and gene-expression studies were used to identify the causal variant and elucidate its mechanism of action. Signatures of positive selection were also investigated. A variant in TNFSF13B, encoding the cytokine and drug target B-cell activating factor (BAFF), was associated with multiple sclerosis as well as SLE. The disease-risk allele was also associated with up-regulated humoral immunity through increased levels of soluble BAFF, B lymphocytes, and immunoglobulins. The causal variant was identified: an insertion-deletion variant, GCTGT?A (in which A is the risk allele), yielded a shorter transcript that escaped microRNA inhibition and increased production of soluble BAFF, which in turn up-regulated humoral immunity. Population genetic signatures indicated that this autoimmunity variant has been evolutionarily advantageous, most likely by augmenting resistance to malaria. A TNFSF13B variant was associated with multiple sclerosis and SLE, and its effects were clarified at the population, cellular, and molecular levels.

28317148	20170321	Bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy: A genome-wide association study on multiple myeloma patients.	The proteasome-inhibitor bortezomib was introduced into the treatment of multiple myeloma more than a decade ago. It is clinically beneficial, but peripheral neuropathy (PNP) is a side effect that may limit its use in some patients. To examine the possible genetic predisposing factors to PNP, we performed a genome-wide association study on 646 bortezomib-treated German multiple myeloma patients. Our aim was to identify genetic risk variants associated with the development of PNP as a serious side effect of the treatment. We identified 4 new promising loci for bortezomib-induced PNP at 4q34.3 (rs6552496), 5q14.1 (rs12521798), 16q23.3 (rs8060632), and 18q21.2 (rs17748074). Even though the results did not reach genome-wide significance level, they support the idea of previous studies, suggesting a genetic basis for neurotoxicity. The identified single nucleotide polymorphisms map to genes or next to genes involved in the development and function of the nervous system (CDH13, DCC, and TENM3). As possible functional clues, 2 of the variants, rs12521798 and rs17748074, affect enhancer histone marks in the brain. The rs12521798 may also impact expression of THBS4, which affects specific signal trasduction pathways in the nervous system. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanism of action of the identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in the development of drug-induced PNP and to functionally validate our in silico predictions.

28628665	20170620	A chromosome 5q31.1 locus associates with tuberculin skin test reactivity in HIV-positive individuals from tuberculosis hyper-endemic regions in east Africa.	One in three people has been infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), and the risk for MTB infection in HIV-infected individuals is even higher. We hypothesized that HIV-positive individuals living in tuberculosis-endemic regions who do not get infected by Mycobacterium tuberculosis are genetically resistant. Using an &quot;experiment of nature&quot; design that proved successful in our previous work, we performed a genome-wide association study of tuberculin skin test positivity using 469 HIV-positive patients from prospective study cohorts of tuberculosis from Tanzania and Uganda to identify genetic loci associated with MTB infection in the context of HIV-infection. Among these individuals, 244 tested were tuberculin skin test (TST) positive either at enrollment or during the &gt;8 year follow up, while 225 were not. We identified a genome-wide significant association between a dominant model of rs877356 and binary TST status in the combined cohort (Odds ratio = 0.2671, p = 1.22x10-8). Association was replicated with similar significance when examining TST induration as a continuous trait. The variant lies in the 5q31.1 region, 57kb downstream from IL9. Two-locus analyses of association of variants near rs877356 showed a haplotype comprised of rs877356 and an IL9 missense variant, rs2069885, had the most significant association (p = 1.59x10-12). We also replicated previously linked loci on chromosomes 2, 5, and 11. IL9 is a cytokine produced by mast cells and TH2 cells during inflammatory responses, providing a possible link between airway inflammation and protection from MTB infection. Our results indicate that studying uninfected, HIV-positive participants with extensive exposure increases the power to detect associations in complex infectious disease. 	PLoS_Genet.	D016428
27669027	20160927	Genome-Wide Association Study of the Genetic Determinants of Emphysema Distribution.	Emphysema has considerable variability in the severity and distribution of parenchymal destruction throughout the lungs. Upper lobe-predominant emphysema has emerged as an important predictor of response to lung volume reduction surgery. Yet, aside from alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, the genetic determinants of emphysema distribution remain largely unknown. To identify the genetic influences of emphysema distribution in non-alpha-1 antitrypsin-deficient smokers. A total of 11,532 subjects with complete genotype and computed tomography densitometry data in the COPDGene (Genetic Epidemiology of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease [COPD]; non-Hispanic white and African American), ECLIPSE (Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints), and GenKOLS (Genetics of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) studies were analyzed. Two computed tomography scan emphysema distribution measures (difference between upper-third and lower-third emphysema; ratio of upper-third to lower-third emphysema) were tested for genetic associations in all study subjects. Separate analyses in each study population were followed by a fixed effect metaanalysis. Single-nucleotide polymorphism-, gene-, and pathway-based approaches were used. In silico functional evaluation was also performed. We identified five loci associated with emphysema distribution at genome-wide significance. These loci included two previously reported associations with COPD susceptibility (4q31 near HHIP and 15q25 near CHRNA5) and three new associations near SOWAHB, TRAPPC9, and KIAA1462. Gene set analysis and in silico functional evaluation revealed pathways and cell types that may potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of emphysema distribution. This multicohort genome-wide association study identified new genomic loci associated with differential emphysematous destruction throughout the lungs. These findings may point to new biologic pathways on which to expand diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

28429243	20170422	SLCO1B1 polymorphisms and plasma estrone conjugates in postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer: genome-wide association studies of the estrone pathway.	Estrone (E1), the major circulating estrogen in postmenopausal women, promotes estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) breast tumor growth and proliferation. Two major reactions contribute to E1 plasma concentrations, aromatase (CYP19A1) catalyzed E1 synthesis from androstenedione and steroid sulfatase (STS) catalyzed hydrolysis of estrone conjugates (E1Cs). E1Cs have been associated with breast cancer risk and may contribute to tumor progression since STS is expressed in breast cancer where its activity exceeds that of aromatase. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify SNPs associated with variation in plasma concentrations of E1Cs, E1, and androstenedione in 774 postmenopausal women with resected early-stage ER+ breast cancer. Hormone concentrations were measured prior to aromatase inhibitor therapy. Multiple SNPs in SLCO1B1, a gene encoding a hepatic influx transporter, displayed genome-wide significant associations with E1C plasma concentrations and with the E1C/E1 ratio. The top SNP for E1C concentrations, rs4149056 (p = 3.74E-11), was a missense variant that results in reduced transporter activity. Patients homozygous for the variant allele had significantly higher average E1C plasma concentrations than did other patients. Furthermore, three other SLCO1B1 SNPs, not in LD with rs4149056, were associated with both E1C concentrations and the E1C/E1 ratio and were cis-eQTLs for SLCO1B3. GWAS signals of suggestive significance were also observed for E1, androstenedione, and the E1/androstenedione ratio. These results suggest a mechanism for genetic variation in E1C plasma concentrations as well as possible SNP biomarkers to identify ER+ breast cancer patients for whom STS inhibitors might be of clinical value.

28031287	20161230	Genome-wide quantitative trait loci mapping of the human cerebrospinal fluid proteome.	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is virtually the only one accessible source of proteins derived from the central nervous system (CNS) of living humans and possibly reflects the pathophysiology of a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. However, little is known regarding the genetic basis of variation in protein levels of human CSF. We examined CSF levels of 1,126 proteins in 133 subjects and performed a genome-wide association analysis of 514,227 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to detect protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs). To be conservative, Spearman's correlation was used to identify an association between genotypes of SNPs and protein levels. A total of 421 cis and 25 trans SNP-protein pairs were significantly correlated at a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.01 (nominal P?&lt;?7.66 × 10-9). Cis-only analysis revealed additional 580 SNP-protein pairs with FDR?&lt;?0.01 (nominal P?&lt;?2.13 × 10-5). pQTL SNPs were more likely, compared to non-pQTL SNPs, to be a disease/trait-associated variants identified by previous genome-wide association studies. The present findings suggest that genetic variations play an important role in the regulation of protein expression in the CNS. The obtained database may serve as a valuable resource to understand the genetic bases for CNS protein expression pattern in humans. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D013485
28120872	20170126	Genome-wide association study identifies four SNPs associated with response to platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy for cervical cancer.	To identify genomic markers associated with the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in patients with cervical cancer, we performed a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the Han Chinese population. A total of 596 patients with stage IA2-IIIB cervical cancer were enrolled in this study. One single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs6812281, per allele OR?=?2.37, P?=?9.0?×?10-9) located at 4q34.3 reached GWAS significance (P?&lt;?5.0?×?10-8). Another three SNPs, rs4590782 (10q26.2, P?=?1.59?×?10-5, per allele OR?=?0.48), rs1742101 (14q32.11, P?=?7.11?×?10-6, per allele OR?=?0.52), and rs1364121 (16q23.3, P?=?3.15?×?10-6, per allele OR?=?1.98), exhibited strong evidence of associations with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with a C allele (CT?+?CC) of rs4590782 had better 5-year overall survival rates (82.9% vs. 75.8%, P?=?0.083) and 5-year disease-free survival rate (80.8% vs. 72.7%, P?=?0.021) than those without a C allele. Our findings help to characterize the genetic etiology of the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with cervical cancer. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
28078323	20170113	Genetic architecture of age-related cognitive decline in African Americans.	To identify genetic risk factors associated with susceptibility to age-related cognitive decline in African Americans (AAs). We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and an admixture-mapping scan in 3,964 older AAs from 5 longitudinal cohorts; for each participant, we calculated a slope of an individual's global cognitive change from neuropsychological evaluations. We also performed a pathway-based analysis of the age-related cognitive decline GWAS. We found no evidence to support the existence of a genomic region which has a strongly different contribution to age-related cognitive decline in African and European genomes. Known Alzheimer disease (AD) susceptibility variants in theABCA7andMS4Aloci do influence this trait in AAs. Of interest, our pathway-based analyses returned statistically significant results highlighting a shared risk from lipid/metabolism and protein tyrosine signaling pathways between cognitive decline and AD, but the role of inflammatory pathways is polarized, being limited to AD susceptibility. The genetic architecture of aging-related cognitive in AA individuals is largely similar to that of individuals of European descent. In both populations, we note a surprising lack of enrichment for immune pathways in the genetic risk for cognitive decline, despite strong enrichment of these pathways among genetic risk factors for AD.

27981573	20161217	Genomewide Association Study Identifies Novel Genetic Loci That Modify Antiplatelet Effects and Pharmacokinetics of Clopidogrel.	Genetic variants in the pharmacokinetic (PK) mechanism are the main underlying factors affecting the antiplatelet response to clopidogrel. Using a genomewide association study (GWAS) to identify new genetic loci that modify antiplatelet effects in Chinese patients with coronary heart disease, we identified novel variants in two transporter genes (SLC14A2 rs12456693, ATP-binding cassette [ABC]A1 rs2487032) and in N6AMT1 (rs2254638) associated with P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) and plasma active metabolite (H4) concentration. These new variants dramatically improved the predictability of PRU variability to 37.7%. The associations between these loci and PK parameters of clopidogrel and H4 were observed in additional patients, and its function on the activation of clopidogrel was validated in liver S9 fractions (P &lt; 0.05). Rs2254638 was further identified to exert a marginal risk effect for major adverse cardiac events in an independent cohort. In conclusion, new genetic variants were systematically identified as risk factors for the reduced efficacy of clopidogrel treatment. 	Clin._Pharmacol._Ther.	D016428
28610988	20170615	Genome-wide association study of heart rate and its variability in Hispanic/Latino cohorts.	Although time-domain measures of heart rate variability (HRV) are used to estimate cardiac autonomic tone and disease risk in multiethnic populations, the genetic epidemiology of HRV in Hispanics/Latinos has not been characterized. The purpose of this study was to conduct a genome-wide association study of heart rate (HR) and its variability in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, and Women's Health Initiative Hispanic SNP-Health Association Resource project (n = 13,767). We estimated HR (bpm), standard deviation of normal-to-normal interbeat intervals (SDNN, ms), and root mean squared difference in successive, normal-to-normal interbeat intervals (RMSSD, ms) from resting, standard 12-lead ECGs. We estimated associations between each phenotype and 17 million genotyped or imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), accounting for relatedness and adjusting for age, sex, study site, and ancestry. Cohort-specific estimates were combined using fixed-effects, inverse-variance meta-analysis. We investigated replication for select SNPs exceeding genome-wide (P &lt;5 × 10-8) or suggestive (P &lt;10-6) significance thresholds. Two genome-wide significant SNPs replicated in a European ancestry cohort, 1 one for RMSSD (rs4963772; chromosome 12) and another for SDNN (rs12982903; chromosome 19). A suggestive SNP for HR (rs236352; chromosome 6) replicated in an African-American cohort. Functional annotation of replicated SNPs in cardiac and neuronal tissues identified potentially causal variants and mechanisms. This first genome-wide association study of HRV and HR in Hispanics/Latinos underscores the potential for even modestly sized samples of non-European ancestry to inform the genetic epidemiology of complex traits.

27927781	20161209	Genetic Variants Associated with Circulating Parathyroid Hormone.	Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a primary calcium regulatory hormone. Elevated serum PTH concentrations in primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism have been associated with bone disease, hypertension, and in some studies, cardiovascular mortality. Genetic causes of variation in circulating PTH concentrations are incompletely understood. We performed a genome-wide association study of serum PTH concentrations among 29,155 participants of European ancestry from 13 cohort studies (n=22,653 andn=6502 in discovery and replication analyses, respectively). We evaluated the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with natural log-transformed PTH concentration adjusted for age, sex, season, study site, and principal components of ancestry. We discovered associations of SNPs from five independent regions with serum PTH concentration, including the strongest association with rs6127099 upstream ofCYP24A1(P=4.2 × 10-53), a gene that encodes the primary catabolic enzyme for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and 25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Each additional copy of the minor allele at this SNP associated with 7% higher serum PTH concentration. The other SNPs associated with serum PTH concentration included rs4074995 withinRGS14(P=6.6 × 10-17), rs219779 adjacent toCLDN14(P=3.5 × 10-16), rs4443100 nearRTDR1(P=8.7 × 10-9), and rs73186030 nearCASR(P=4.8 × 10-8). Of these five SNPs, rs6127099, rs4074995, and rs219779 replicated. Thus, common genetic variants located near genes involved in vitamin D metabolism and calcium and renal phosphate transport associated with differences in circulating PTH concentrations. Future studies could identify the causal variants at these loci, and the clinical and functional relevance of these variants should be pursued. 	J._Am._Soc._Nephrol.	D016428
28256260	20170304	Genetics of early-onset Parkinson's disease in Finland: exome sequencing and genome-wide association study.	Several genes and risk factors are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Although many of the genetic markers belong to a common pathway, a unifying pathogenetic mechanism is yet to be found. Also, missing heritability analyses have estimated that only part of the genetic influence contributing to PD has been found. Here, we carried out whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 438 Finnish patients with early-onset PD. We also reanalyzed previous data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on the same cohort. Variants in the CEL gene/locus were associated with PD in both GWAS and WES analysis. Exome-wide gene-based association tests also identified the MPHOSPH10, TAS2R19, and SERPINA1 genes in the discovery data set (p &lt; 2.5E-6). MPHOSPH10 had estimated odds ratio (OR) of 1.53, and the rs141620200 variant in SERPINA1 had OR of 1.27. We identified several candidate genes, but further investigation is required to determine the role of these genes in PD. 	Neurobiol._Aging	D016428
28476931	20170507	GPR158</i>Associated With Reduced Energy Expenditure in American Indians.	Pima Indians living in Arizona have a high prevalence of obesity, and we have previously shown that a relatively lower energy expenditure (EE) predicts weight and fat mass gain in this population. EE is a familial trait (heritability = 0.52); therefore, in the current study, we aimed to identify genetic variants that affect EE and thereby influence BMI and body fatness in Pima Indians. Genotypic data from 491,265 variants were analyzed for association with resting metabolic rate (RMR) and 24-h EE assessed in a whole-room calorimeter in 507 and 419 Pima Indians, respectively. Variants associated with both measures of EE were analyzed for association with maximum BMI and percent body fat (PFAT) in 5,870 and 912 Pima Indians, respectively. rs11014566 nominally associated with both measures of EE and both measures of adiposity in Pima Indians, where the G allele (frequency: Pima Indians = 0.60, Europeans &lt;0.01) associated with lower 24-h EE (? = -33 kcal/day per copy), lower RMR (? = -31 kcal/day), higher BMI (? = +0.6 kg/m2), and higher PFAT (? = +0.9%). However, the association of rs11014566 with BMI did not directionally replicate when assessed in other ethnic groups. rs11014566 tags rs144895904, which affected promoter function in an in vitro luciferase assay. These variants map toGPR158, which is highly expressed in the brain and interacts with two other genes (RGS7andCACNA1B) known to affect obesity in knockout mice. Our results suggest that common ethnic-specific variation inGPR158may influence EE; however, its role in weight gain remains controversial, as it either had no association with BMI or associated with BMI but in the opposite direction in other ethnic groups.

27506219	20160811	Pooling-Based Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Risk Loci in the Pathogenesis of Ovarian Endometrioma in Chinese Han Women.	Endometriosis, regarded as a complex disease, is influenced by multiple genetic factors. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in endometriosis have identified several susceptibility loci in Caucasian and Japanese populations. However, the overlapped susceptible loci were few. This case-control study tried to identify risk loci-related genes for ovarian endometrioma in Chinese Han women from central China using DNA pooling-based GWAS. Genome DNA samples were extracted from 3038 participants in central China. Pooling-based genome-wide scan and individual genotyping were performed using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 and IPLEX Gold system, which demonstrated 10 ovarian endometrioma-related novel risk loci. There were 3 of them with P value &lt; 5 × 10-06, separately locating in intron of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, chromosome 7 open reading frame 50, and Meis homeobox 1. In conclusion, the pooling-based GWAS for ovarian endometrioma identified some novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms in Chinese Han women of central China. Further assessment in other samples will be crucial to confirm the susceptibility of these results and explore the mechanisms of the related genes in the pathogenesis of ovarian endometrioma.

27839851	20161115	Genetic and methylation variation in the CYP2B6 gene is related to circulating p,p'-dde levels in a population-based sample.	Since the metabolism of the organochlorine pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is not fully known in humans, we evaluated if circulating levels of a major breakdown product of DDT, p,p'-DDE, were related to genome-wide genetic and methylation variation in a population-based sample. In the population-based Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study (1016 subjects all aged 70), circulating levels of p,p'-DDE were analyzed by high-resolution chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). Genetic variants were genotyped and imputed (1000 Genomes reference, March 2012 release). Methylation sites were assayed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 array in whole blood. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach was applied. Evidence for genome-wide significant association with p,p'-DDE levels was observed only for a locus at chromosome 19 corresponding to the CYP2B6 gene (lead SNP rs7260538). Subjects being homozygote for the G allele showed a median level of 472ng/g lipid, while the corresponding level for those being homozygote for the T allele was 192ng/g lipid (p=1.5×10-31). An analysis conditioned on the lead SNP disclosed a distinct signal in the same gene (rs7255374, position chr19:41520351; p=2.2×10-8). A whole-genome methylation analysis showed one significant relationship vs. p,p'-DDE levels (p=6.2×10-9) located 7kb downstream the CYP2B6 gene (cg27089200, position chr19:41531976). This CpG-site was also related to the lead SNP (p=3.8×10-35), but mediated only 4% of the effect of the lead SNP on p,p'-DDE levels. Circulating levels of p,p'-DDE were related to genetic variation in the CYP2B6 gene in the general elderly population. DNA methylation in this gene is not closely linked to the p,p'-DDE levels.

28537254	20170525	Large scale meta-analysis characterizes genetic architecture for common psoriasis associated variants.	Psoriasis is a complex disease of skin with a prevalence of about 2%. We conducted the largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for psoriasis to date, including data from eight different Caucasian cohorts, with a combined effective sample size &gt;39,000 individuals. We identified 16 additional psoriasis susceptibility loci achieving genome-wide significance, increasing the number of identified loci to 63 for European-origin individuals. Functional analysis highlighted the roles of interferon signalling and the NF?B cascade, and we showed that the psoriasis signals are enriched in regulatory elements from different T cells (CD8+T-cells and CD4+T-cells including TH0, TH1 and TH17). The identified loci explain ?28% of the genetic heritability and generate a discriminatory genetic risk score (AUC=0.76 in our sample) that is significantly correlated with age at onset (p=2 × 10-89). This study provides a comprehensive layout for the genetic architecture of common variants for psoriasis. 	Nat_Commun	D016428
28333968	20170324	A genome-wide association study of thyroid stimulating hormone and free thyroxine in Danish children and adolescents.	Hypothyroidism is associated with obesity, and thyroid hormones are involved in the regulation of body composition, including fat mass. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in adults have identified 19 and 6 loci associated with plasma concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4), respectively. This study aimed to identify and characterize genetic variants associated with circulating TSH and fT4 in Danish children and adolescents and to examine whether these variants associate with obesity. Genome-wide association analyses of imputed genotype data with fasting plasma concentrations of TSH and fT4 from a population-based sample of Danish children, adolescents, and young adults, and a group of children, adolescents, and young adults with overweight and obesity were performed (N = 1,764, mean age = 12.0 years [range 2.5-24.7]). Replication was performed in additional comparable samples (N = 2,097, mean age = 11.8 years [1.2-22.8]). Meta-analyses, using linear additive fixed-effect models, were performed on the results of the discovery and replication analyses. No novel loci associated with TSH or fT4 were identified. Four loci previously associated with TSH in adults were confirmed in this study population (PDE10A (rs2983511: ? = 0.112SD, p = 4.8 ? 10-16), FOXE1 (rs7847663: ? = 0.223SD, p = 1.5 ? 10-20), NR3C2 (rs9968300: ? = 0.194SD), p = 2.4 ? 10-11), VEGFA (rs2396083: ? = 0.088SD, p = 2.2 ? 10-10)). Effect sizes of variants known to associate with TSH or fT4 in adults showed a similar direction of effect in our cohort of children and adolescents, 11 of which were associated with TSH or fT4 in our study (p&lt;0.0002). None of the TSH or fT4 associated SNPs were associated with obesity in our cohort, indicating no pleiotropic effects of these variants on obesity. In a group of Danish children and adolescents, four loci previously associated with plasma TSH concentrations in adults, were associated with plasma TSH concentrations in children, suggesting comparable genetic determinants of thyroid function in adults and children.

27531626	20160818	The Interplay Between Risky Sexual Behaviors and Alcohol Dependence: Genome-Wide Association and Neuroimaging Support for LHPP as a Risk Gene.	To identify genetic mechanisms involved in the interplay of risky sexual behaviors (RSBs) and alcohol dependence (AD), we conducted genome-wide gene-by-AD (GW-GxAD) analyses of RSB in 3924 alcohol-exposed and sexually experienced subjects. RSBs were defined as a score based on lifetime experiences of unprotected sex and multiple sexual partners. Diagnosis of lifetime AD was defined by DSM-IV criteria. To follow-up the genetic findings, functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses were conducted in an independent sample. A trans-population genome-wide significant signal was identified in LHPP (rs34997829; z=-5.573, p=2.51 × 10-8) in the GxAD analysis that also showed associations in the AD-stratified association analysis (AD z=-2.032 and non-AD z=4.903). The clinical relevance of the result was confirmed by the significant interaction between LHPP rs34997829 and AD with respect to self-reported sexually transmitted disease (STD; z=-2.809, p=4.97 × 10-3). The neuroimaging follow-up analysis of LHPP rs34997829 showed reduced power of the left superior frontal gyrus (t=-3.386, p=9.56 × 10-4) and increased power at the right amygdala (t=3.287, p=1.33 × 10-3) in the resting amplitude of low frequency fluctuations analysis; and reduced activation of the anterior cingulate region (t=-2.961, p=3.69 × 10-3) in the monetary incentive delay task. In conclusion, LHPP locus is associated to AD-RSB interaction; and with brain circuitries previously implicated in the inhibition of risky behavior and impulsiveness, emotional regulation, and impulse control/error monitoring. Thus, LHPP is a strong candidate to influence RSB and STD risk in the context of AD. 	Neuropsychopharmacology	D016428
28545128	20170526	Common variants upstream of MLF1 at 3q25 and within CPZ at 4p16 associated with neuroblastoma.	Neuroblastoma is a cancer of the developing sympathetic nervous system that most commonly presents in young children and accounts for approximately 12% of pediatric oncology deaths. Here, we report on a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a discovery cohort or 2,101 cases and 4,202 controls of European ancestry. We identify two new association signals at 3q25 and 4p16 that replicated robustly in multiple independent cohorts comprising 1,163 cases and 4,396 controls (3q25: rs6441201 combined P = 1.2x10-11, Odds Ratio 1.23, 95% CI:1.16-1.31; 4p16: rs3796727 combined P = 1.26x10-12, Odds Ratio 1.30, 95% CI: 1.21-1.40). The 4p16 signal maps within the carboxypeptidase Z (CPZ) gene. The 3q25 signal resides within the arginine/serine-rich coiled-coil 1 (RSRC1) gene and upstream of the myeloid leukemia factor 1 (MLF1) gene. Increased expression of MLF1 was observed in neuroblastoma cells homozygous for the rs6441201 risk allele (P = 0.02), and significant growth inhibition was observed upon depletion of MLF1 (P &lt; 0.0001) in neuroblastoma cells. Taken together, we show that common DNA variants within CPZ at 4p16 and upstream of MLF1 at 3q25 influence neuroblastoma susceptibility and MLF1 likely plays an important role in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis.

28440896	20170426	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies a novel susceptibility signal at CACNA2D3 for nicotine dependence.	Nicotine dependence (ND) has a reported heritability of 40-70%. Low-coverage whole-genome sequencing was conducted in 1,889 samples from the UCSF Family study. Linear mixed models were used to conduct genome-wide association (GWA) tests of ND in this and five cohorts obtained from the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes. Fixed-effect meta-analysis was carried out separately for European (n?=?14,713) and African (n?=?3,369) participants, and then in a combined analysis of both ancestral groups. The meta-analysis of African participants identified a significant and novel susceptibility signal (rs56247223; p?=?4.11?×?10-8). Data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) study suggested the protective allele is associated with reduced mRNA expression of CACNA2D3 in three human brain tissues (p?&lt;?4.94?×?10-2). Sequence data from the UCSF Family study suggested that a rare nonsynonymous variant in this gene conferred increased risk for ND (p?=?0.01) providing further support for CACNA2D3 involvement in ND. Suggestive associations were observed in six additional regions in both European and merged populations (p?&lt;?5.00?×?10-6). The top variants were found to regulate mRNA expression levels of genes in human brains using GTEx data (p?&lt;?0.05): HAX1 and CHRNB2 (rs1760803), ADAMTSL1 (rs17198023), PEX2 (rs12680810), GLIS3 (rs12348139), non-coding RNA for LINC00476 (rs10759883), and GABBR1 (rs56020557 and rs62392942). A gene-based association test further supported the relation between GABBR1 and ND (p?=?6.36?×?10-7). These findings will inform the biological mechanisms and development of therapeutic targets for ND. 	Am._J._Med._Genet._B_Neuropsychiatr._Genet.	D016428
28521775	20170520	Genome-wide association study of subclinical interstitial lung disease in MESA.	We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of subclinical interstitial lung disease (ILD), defined as high attenuation areas (HAA) on CT, in the population-based Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis Study. We measured the percentage of high attenuation areas (HAA) in the lung fields on cardiac CT scan defined as voxels with CT attenuation values between -600 and -250 HU. Genetic analyses were performed in MESA combined across race/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic White (n?=?2,434), African American (n?=?2,470), Hispanic (n?=?2,065) and Chinese (n?=?702), as well as stratified by race/ethnicity. Among 7,671 participants, regions at genome-wide significance were identified for basilar peel-core ratio of HAA in FLJ35282 downstream of ANRIL (rs7852363, P?=?2.1x10-9) and within introns of SNAI3-AS1 (rs140142658, P?=?9.6x10-9) and D21S2088E (rs3079677, P?=?2.3x10-8). Within race/ethnic groups, 18 additional loci were identified at genome-wide significance, including genes related to development (FOXP4), cell adhesion (ALCAM) and glycosylation (GNPDA2, GYPC, GFPT1 and FUT10). Among these loci, SNP rs6844387 near GNPDA2 demonstrated nominal evidence of replication in analysis of n?=?1,959 participants from the Framingham Heart Study (P?=?0.029). FOXP4 region SNP rs2894439 demonstrated evidence of validation in analysis of n?=?228 White ILD cases from the Columbia ILD Study compared to race/ethnicity-matched controls from MESA (one-sided P?=?0.007). In lung tissue from 15 adults with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis compared to 15 adults without lung disease. ANRIL (P?=?0.001), ALCAM (P?=?0.03) and FOXP4 (P?=?0.046) were differentially expressed. Our results suggest novel roles for protein glycosylation and cell cycle disinhibition by long non-coding RNA in the pathogenesis of ILD. 	Respir._Res.	D016428
28317342	20170321	Genetic determinants of adiponectin regulation revealed by pregnancy.	This study investigated genetic determinants of adiponectin during pregnancy to reveal novel biology of adipocyte regulation. A genome-wide association study was conducted in 1,322 pregnant women from the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome Study with adiponectin measured at ?28 weeks of gestation. Variants reaching P?&lt;?5×10-5for de novo genotyping in two replication cohorts (Genetics of Glycemic regulation in Gestation and Growth N?=?522; ECOGENE-21 N?=?174) were selected. In the combined meta-analysis, the maternal T allele of rs900400 located on chr3q25 (near LEKR1/CCNL1) was associated with lower maternal adiponectin (??±?standard error [SE]?=?-0.18?±?0.03 standard deviation [SD] of adiponectin per risk allele; P?=?1.5 ×10-8; N?=?2,004; multivariable adjusted models). In contrast, rs900400 showed only nominal association with adiponectin in a large sample of nonpregnant women (??±?SE?=?-0.012?±?0.006; P?=?0.05; N?=?16,678 women from the ADIPOgen consortium). The offspring rs900400 T risk allele was associated with greater neonatal skinfold thickness (? ±SE?=?0.19?±?0.04 SD per risk allele; P?=?4.1×10-8; N?=?1,489) and higher cord blood leptin (??±?SE?=?0.28?±?0.05 log-leptin per risk allele; P?=?8.2 ×10-9; N?=?502), but not with cord blood adiponectin (P?=?0.23; N?=?495). The T allele of rs900400 was associated with higher expression of TIPARP in adipocytes. These investigations of adipokines during pregnancy and early life suggest that rs900400 has a role in adipocyte function. 	Obesity_(Silver_Spring)	D016428
28495826	20170513	Genetic Drivers of von Willebrand Factor Levels in an Ischemic Stroke Population and Association With Risk for Recurrent Stroke.	von Willebrand factor (vWF) plays an important role in thrombus formation during cerebrovascular damage. We sought to investigate the potential role of circulating vWF in recurrent cerebrovascular events and identify genetic contributors to variation in vWF level in an ischemic stroke population. We analyzed the effect of circulating vWF on risk of recurrent stroke using survival models in the VISP trial (Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention) and the use of vWF in reclassification over traditional factors. We conducted a genome-wide association study) with imputation, based on 1000 Genomes Project data, for circulating vWF levels and then interrogated loci previously associated with vWF levels. We performed expression quantitative trait locus analysis for vWF across different tissues. Elevated vWF levels were associated with increased risk for recurrent stroke in VISP. Adding vWF to traditional clinical parameters also improved recurrent stroke risk prediction. We identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms significantly associated with circulating vWF at theABOlocus (P&lt;5×10-8) and replicated findings from previous genetic associations of vWF levels in humans. Expression quantitative trait locus analyses demonstrate that most associatedABOsingle-nucleotide polymorphisms were also associated withvWFgene expression. Elevated vWF levels are associated with recurrent stroke in VISP. In the VISP population, genetic determinants of vWF levels that impactvWFgene expression were identified. These data add to our knowledge of the pathophysiologic and genetic basis for recurrent stroke risk and may have implications for clinical care decision making.

28062665	20170108	Genome-wide association studies identify PRKCB as a novel genetic susceptibility locus for primary biliary cholangitis in the Japanese population.	A previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) performed in 963 Japanese individuals (487 primary biliary cholangitis [PBC] cases and 476 healthy controls) identified TNFSF15 (rs4979462) and POU2AF1 (rs4938534) as strong susceptibility loci for PBC. In this study, we performed GWAS in additional 1,923 Japanese individuals (894 PBC cases and 1,029 healthy controls), and combined the results with the previous data. This GWAS, together with a subsequent replication study in an independent set of 7,024 Japanese individuals (512 PBC cases and 6,512 healthy controls), identified PRKCB (rs7404928) as a novel susceptibility locus for PBC (odds ratio [OR]?=?1.26, P?=?4.13?×?10-9). Furthermore, a primary functional variant of PRKCB (rs35015313) was identified by genotype imputation using a phased panel of 1,070 Japanese individuals from a prospective, general population cohort study and subsequent in vitro functional analyses. These results may lead to improved understanding of the disease pathways involved in PBC, forming a basis for prevention of PBC and development of novel therapeutics. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.

28177523	20170209	Association between genetic variation within vitamin D receptor-DNA binding sites and risk of basal cell carcinoma.	An increasing number of studies have reported a protective association between vitamin D and cancer risk. The vitamin D endocrine system regulates transcriptional programs involved in inflammation, cell growth and differentiation through the binding of vitamin D receptor (VDR) to specific VDR elements. However, limited attention has been given to the role of variation within VDR binding sites in the development of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Across 2,776 previously identified VDR binding sites, we identified 2,540 independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and examined their associations with BCC risk in a genome-wide association meta-analysis totaling 17,187 BCC cases and 287,054 controls from two data sets. After multiple testing corrections, we identified two SNPs at new loci (rs16917546 at 10q21.1: odds ratio (OR)?=?1.06, p?=?3.16 × 10-7and rs79824801 at 12q13.3: OR?=?1.10, p?=?1.88 × 10-5) for the first time as independently related to BCC risk in meta-analysis; and both SNPs were nominally significant in two data sets. In addition, the SNP rs3769823 within VDR binding site at a previously reported BCC susceptibility locus (2q33.1, rs13014235) also exhibited a significant association (OR?=?1.12, p?=?3.99 × 10-18). A mutually adjusted model suggested that rs3769823 explained the signal in this region. Our findings support the hypothesis that inherited common variation in VDR binding sites affects the development of BCC. 	Int._J._Cancer	D016428 D013485 D052061
28081371	20170113	GWAS Identifies New Loci for Painful Temporomandibular Disorder: Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos.	Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is a musculoskeletal condition characterized by pain and reduced function in the temporomandibular joint and/or associated masticatory musculature. Prevalence in the United States is 5% and twice as high among women as men. We conducted a discovery genome-wide association study (GWAS) of TMD in 10,153 participants (769 cases, 9,384 controls) of the US Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). The most promising single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested in meta-analysis of 4 independent cohorts. One replication cohort was from the United States, and the others were from Germany, Finland, and Brazil, totaling 1,911 TMD cases and 6,903 controls. A locus near the sarcoglycan alpha ( SGCA), rs4794106, was suggestive in the discovery analysis ( P = 2.6 × 106) and replicated (i.e., 1-tailed P = 0.016) in the Brazilian cohort. In the discovery cohort, sex-stratified analysis identified 2 additional genome-wide significant loci in females. One lying upstream of the relaxin/insulin-like family peptide receptor 2 ( RXP2) (chromosome 13, rs60249166, odds ratio [OR] = 0.65, P = 3.6 × 10-8) was replicated among females in the meta-analysis (1-tailed P = 0.052). The other (chromosome 17, rs1531554, OR = 0.68, P = 2.9 × 10-8) was replicated among females (1-tailed P = 0.002), as well as replicated in meta-analysis of both sexes (1-tailed P = 0.021). A novel locus at genome-wide level of significance (rs73460075, OR = 0.56, P = 3.8 × 10-8) in the intron of the dystrophin gene DMD (X chromosome), and a suggestive locus on chromosome 7 (rs73271865, P = 2.9 × 10-7) upstream of the Sp4 Transcription Factor ( SP4) gene were identified in the discovery cohort, but neither of these was replicated. The SGCA gene encodes SGCA, which is involved in the cellular structure of muscle fibers and, along with DMD, forms part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. Functional annotation suggested that several of these variants reside in loci that regulate processes relevant to TMD pathobiologic processes. 	J._Dent._Res.	D016428 D017418 D016448
28158719	20170204	Genome-wide association of white blood cell counts in Hispanic/Latino Americans: the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos.	Circulating white blood cell (WBC) counts (neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils) differ by ethnicity. The genetic factors underlying basal WBC traits in Hispanics/Latinos are unknown. We performed a genome-wide association study of total WBC and differential counts in a large, ethnically diverse US population sample of Hispanics/Latinos ascertained by the Hispanic Community Health Study and Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). We demonstrate that several previously known WBC-associated genetic loci (e.g. the African Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines null variant for neutrophil count) are generalizable to WBC traits in Hispanics/Latinos. We identified and replicated common and rare germ-line variants at FLT3 (a gene often somatically mutated in leukemia) associated with monocyte count. The common FLT3 variant rs76428106 has a large allele frequency differential between African and non-African populations. We also identified several novel genetic loci involving or regulating hematopoietic transcription factors (CEBPE-SLC7A7, CEBPA and CRBN-TRNT1) associated with basophil count. The minor allele of the CEBPE variant associated with lower basophil count has been previously associated with Amerindian ancestry and higher risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Hispanics. Together, these data suggest that germline genetic variation affecting transcriptional and signaling pathways that underlie WBC development and lineage specification can contribute to inter-individual as well as ethnic differences in peripheral blood cell counts (normal hematopoiesis) in addition to susceptibility to leukemia (malignant hematopoiesis).

27601451	20160908	Chronic Periodontitis Genome-wide Association Study in the Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos.	Chronic periodontitis (CP) has a genetic component, particularly its severe forms. Evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) has highlighted several potential novel loci. Here, the authors report the first GWAS of CP among a large community-based sample of Hispanics/Latinos. The authors interrogated a quantitative trait of CP (mean interproximal clinical attachment level determined by full-mouth periodontal examinations) among 10,935 adult participants (mean age: 45 y, range: 18 to 76 y) from the Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos. Genotyping was done with a custom Illumina Omni2.5M array, and imputation to approximately 20 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms was based on the 1000 Genomes Project phase 1 reference panel. Analyses were based on linear mixed models adjusting for sex, age, study design features, ancestry, and kinship and employed a conventional P &lt; 5 × 10-8statistical significance threshold. The authors identified a genome-wide significant association signal in the 1q42.2 locus ( TSNAX-DISC1 noncoding RNA, lead single-nucleotide polymorphism: rs149133391, minor allele [C] frequency = 0.01, P = 7.9 × 10-9) and 4 more loci with suggestive evidence of association ( P &lt; 5 × 10-6): 1q22 (rs13373934), 5p15.33 (rs186066047), 6p22.3 (rs10456847), and 11p15.1 (rs75715012). We tested these loci for replication in independent samples of European-American ( n = 4,402) and African-American ( n = 908) participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. There was no replication among the European Americans; however, the TSNAX-DISC1 locus replicated in the African-American sample (rs149133391, minor allele frequency = 0.02, P = 9.1 × 10-3), while the 1q22 locus was directionally concordant and nominally significant (rs13373934, P = 4.0 × 10-2). This discovery GWAS of interproximal clinical attachment level-a measure of lifetime periodontal tissue destruction-was conducted in a large, community-based sample of Hispanic/Latinos. It identified a genome-wide significant locus that was independently replicated in an African-American population. Identifying this genetic marker offers direction for interrogation in subsequent genomic and experimental studies of CP. 	J._Dent._Res.	D016428
28828242	20170823	Genome-wide association study identifies novel type II diabetes risk loci in Jordan subpopulations.	The prevalence of Type II Diabetes (T2D) has been increasing and has become a disease of significant public health burden in Jordan. None of the previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have specifically investigated the Middle East populations. The Circassian and Chechen communities in Jordan represent unique populations that are genetically distinct from the Arab population and other populations in the Caucasus. Prevalence of T2D is very high in both the Circassian and Chechen communities in Jordan despite low obesity prevalence. We conducted GWAS on T2D in these two populations and further performed meta-analysis of the results. We identified a novel T2D locus at chr20p12.2 at genome-wide significance (rs6134031,P = 1.12 × 10-8) and we replicated the results in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) dataset. Another locus at chr12q24.31 is associated with T2D at suggestive significance level (top SNP rs4758690,P = 4.20 × 10-5) and it is a robust eQTL for the gene,MLXIP(P = 1.10 × 10-14), and is significantly associated with methylation level inMLXIP, the functions of which involves cellular glucose response. Therefore, in this first GWAS of T2D in Jordan subpopulations, we identified novel and unique susceptibility loci which may help inform the genetic underpinnings of T2D in other populations.

28183528	20170211	Transethnic genome-wide scan identifies novel Alzheimer's disease loci.	Genetic loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been identified in whites of European ancestry, but the genetic architecture of AD among other populations is less understood. We conducted a transethnic genome-wide association study (GWAS) for late-onset AD in Stage 1 sample including whites of European Ancestry, African-Americans, Japanese, and Israeli-Arabs assembled by the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium. Suggestive results from Stage 1 from novel loci were followed up using summarized results in the International Genomics Alzheimer's Project GWAS dataset. Genome-wide significant (GWS) associations in single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based tests (P &lt; 5 × 10-8) were identified for SNPs in PFDN1/HBEGF, USP6NL/ECHDC3, and BZRAP1-AS1 and for the interaction of the (apolipoprotein E) APOE ?4 allele with NFIC SNP. We also obtained GWS evidence (P &lt; 2.7 × 10-6) for gene-based association in the total sample with a novel locus, TPBG (P = 1.8 × 10-6). Our findings highlight the value of transethnic studies for identifying novel AD susceptibility loci. 	Alzheimers_Dement	D016428
28649644	20170627	Constitutional variants are not associated with HER2-positive breast cancer: results from the SIGNAL/PHARE clinical cohort.	Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer is a subtype of interest regarding its outcome and the impressive impact of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 targeted therapy. Constitutional variants may be involved in the aetiology of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer, and we propose a case-case study to test the hypothesis that single nucleotide polymorphisms may be associated with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status. A Genome-Wide Association Study was used in a cohort of 9836 patients from the SIGNAL/PHARE study (NCT00381901-RECF1098). The main goal was to identify variants specifically related to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer. A two-staged genotyping strategy was carried out to cover as large a proportion of the genome as possible. All subjects were genotyped using the Illumina HumanCore Exome chip set. Principal Components Analysis andk-means were then used to characterize the ancestry of the participants. A random sample of subjects from the main &quot;European&quot; cluster was genotyped with the Omni5 chip set. These data were then used to impute missing genotypes from the remaining subjects genotyped only using the HumanCore Exome array. From the 9836 patients, a total of 8703 cases including 3230 patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer were analyzed. Despite having 80% power to detect an odds ratio of 1.23 in this population, no variant achieved genome-wide significance for association with the occurrence of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer vs. any other subtype of breast tumour. Our study was unable to identify constitutional polymorphisms that are strongly associated with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive status among breast cancer patients.

28498854	20170513	Single-trait and multi-trait genome-wide association analyses identify novel loci for blood pressure in African-ancestry populations.	Hypertension is a leading cause of global disease, mortality, and disability. While individuals of African descent suffer a disproportionate burden of hypertension and its complications, they have been underrepresented in genetic studies. To identify novel susceptibility loci for blood pressure and hypertension in people of African ancestry, we performed both single and multiple-trait genome-wide association analyses. We analyzed 21 genome-wide association studies comprised of 31,968 individuals of African ancestry, and validated our results with additional 54,395 individuals from multi-ethnic studies. These analyses identified nine loci with eleven independent variants which reached genome-wide significance (P &lt; 1.25×10-8) for either systolic and diastolic blood pressure, hypertension, or for combined traits. Single-trait analyses identified two loci (TARID/TCF21 and LLPH/TMBIM4) and multiple-trait analyses identified one novel locus (FRMD3) for blood pressure. At these three loci, as well as at GRP20/CDH17, associated variants had alleles common only in African-ancestry populations. Functional annotation showed enrichment for genes expressed in immune and kidney cells, as well as in heart and vascular cells/tissues. Experiments driven by these findings and using angiotensin-II induced hypertension in mice showed altered kidney mRNA expression of six genes, suggesting their potential role in hypertension. Our study provides new evidence for genes related to hypertension susceptibility, and the need to study African-ancestry populations in order to identify biologic factors contributing to hypertension.

28537267	20170525	Meta-analysis identifies five novel loci associated with endometriosis highlighting key genes involved in hormone metabolism.	Endometriosis is a heritable hormone-dependent gynecological disorder, associated with severe pelvic pain and reduced fertility; however, its molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we perform a meta-analysis of 11 genome-wide association case-control data sets, totalling 17,045 endometriosis cases and 191,596 controls. In addition to replicating previously reported loci, we identify five novel loci significantly associated with endometriosis risk (P&lt;5 × 10-8), implicating genes involved in sex steroid hormone pathways (FN1, CCDC170, ESR1, SYNE1 and FSHB). Conditional analysis identified five secondary association signals, including two at the ESR1 locus, resulting in 19 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) robustly associated with endometriosis, which together explain up to 5.19% of variance in endometriosis. These results highlight novel variants in or near specific genes with important roles in sex steroid hormone signalling and function, and offer unique opportunities for more targeted functional research efforts.

27696742	20161004	Genome-Wide Association Study of Radiographic Knee Osteoarthritis in North American Caucasians.	A major barrier to genetic studies of osteoarthritis (OA) is the need to obtain large numbers of individuals with standardized radiographic evaluations for OA. To address this gap, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of radiographically defined tibiofemoral knee OA in 3,898 cases and 3,168 controls from 4 well-characterized North American cohorts, and we performed replication analysis of previously reported OA loci. We performed meta-analysis using a 2-stage design. Stage 1 (discovery) consisted of a GWAS meta-analysis of radiographic knee OA carried out in the Osteoarthritis Initiative and the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project. Knee OA was defined as definite osteophytes and possible joint space narrowing or total joint replacement in one or both knees. Stage 2 (validation) was performed in the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study and the Genetics of Osteoarthritis study. We genotyped lead meta-analysis variants (P???1 × 10-4) from stage 1 and tested the association between these variants and knee OA. We then combined results from all cohorts in a meta-analysis. Lead variants from stage 1, representing 49 unique loci, were analyzed in stage 2; none met genome-wide significance in the combined analysis of stage 1 and stage 2. We validated 1 locus (rs4867568 near LSP1P3) with nominal significance (P?&lt;?0.05), which was also our top finding in the combined meta-analysis (odds ratio [OR] 0.84 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.79-0.91], P?=?3.02 × 10-6). We observed nominally significant associations (P?&lt;?0.05) with 3 previously reported OA loci: rs143383 in GDF5 (OR 1.12 [95% CI 1.04-1.21], P?=?2.13 × 10-3), rs835487 in CHST11 (OR 0.93 [95% CI 0.85-0.99], P?=?0.03), and rs8044769 in FTO (OR 1.10 [95% CI 1.03-1.19], P?=?6.13 × 10-3). These findings provide suggestive evidence of a novel knee OA locus and confirm previously reported associations in GDF5, CHST11, and FTO. 	Arthritis_&amp;_rheumatology_(Hoboken,_N.J.)

28416812	20170419	A new locus regulating MICALL2 expression was identified for association with executive inhibition in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.	Impaired executive inhibition is a core deficit of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is a common childhood-onset psychiatric disorder with high heritability. In this study, we performed a two-stage genome-wide association study of executive inhibition in ADHD in Han Chinese. We used the Stroop color-word interference test to evaluate executive inhibition. After quality control, 780 samples with phenotype and covariate data were included in the discovery stage, whereas 922 samples were included in the replication stage. We identified one new significant locus at 7p22.3 for the Stroop word interference time (rs11514810, P=3.42E-09 for discovery, P=0.01176 for replication and combined P=5.249E-09). Regulatory feature analysis and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data showed that this locus contributes to MICALL2 expression in the human brain. Most genes in the network interacting with MICALL2 were associated with psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, hyperactive-impulsive-like behavior was induced by reducing the expression of the zebrafish gene that is homologous to MICALL2, which could be rescued by tomoxetine (atomoxetine), a clinical medication for ADHD. Our results suggested that MICALL2 is a new susceptibility gene for executive inhibition deficiency related to hyperactive-impulsive behavior in ADHD, further emphasizing the possible role of neurodevelopmental genes in the pathogenic mechanism of ADHD.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 18 April 2017; doi:10.1038/mp.2017.74.

28604728	20170613	Identification of 19 new risk loci and potential regulatory mechanisms influencing susceptibility to testicular germ cell tumor.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have transformed understanding of susceptibility to testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs), but much of the heritability remains unexplained. Here we report a new GWAS, a meta-analysis with previous GWAS and a replication series, totaling 7,319 TGCT cases and 23,082 controls. We identify 19 new TGCT risk loci, roughly doubling the number of known TGCT risk loci to 44. By performing in situ Hi-C in TGCT cells, we provide evidence for a network of physical interactions among all 44 TGCT risk SNPs and candidate causal genes. Our findings implicate widespread disruption of developmental transcriptional regulators as a basis of TGCT susceptibility, consistent with failed primordial germ cell differentiation as an initiating step in oncogenesis. Defective microtubule assembly and dysregulation of KIT-MAPK signaling also feature as recurrently disrupted pathways. Our findings support a polygenic model of risk and provide insight into the biological basis of TGCT. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D017418
28254843	20170304	Genetics of Type 2 Diabetes in U.S. Hispanic/Latino Individuals: Results From the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL).	Few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of type 2 diabetes (T2D) have been conducted in U.S. Hispanics/Latinos of diverse backgrounds who are disproportionately affected by diabetes. We conducted a GWAS in 2,499 T2D case subjects and 5,247 control subjects from six Hispanic/Latino background groups in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). Our GWAS identified two known loci (TCF7L2andKCNQ1)reaching genome-wide significance levels. Conditional analysis on known index single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) indicated an additional independent signal atKCNQ1, represented by an African ancestry-specific variant, rs1049549 (odds ratio 1.49 [95% CI 1.27-1.75]). This association was consistent across Hispanic/Latino background groups and replicated in the MEta-analysis of type 2 DIabetes in African Americans (MEDIA) Consortium. Among 80 previously known index SNPs at T2D loci, 66 SNPs showed consistency with the reported direction of associations and 14 SNPs significantly generalized to the HCHS/SOL. A genetic risk score based on these 80 index SNPs was significantly associated with T2D (odds ratio 1.07 [1.06-1.09] per risk allele), with a stronger effect observed in nonobese than in obese individuals. Our study identified a novel independent signal suggesting an African ancestry-specific allele atKCNQ1for T2D. Associations between previously identified loci and T2D were generally shown in a large cohort of U.S. Hispanics/Latinos. 	Diabetes	D016428 D052061 D013485
28030426	20161229	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies on the intolerance of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.	To identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with switching from an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor to an angiotensin receptor blocker. Two cohorts of patients starting ACE-inhibitors were identified within the Rotterdam Study in the Netherlands and the Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside Scotland study in Scotland. Cases were intolerant patients who switched from an ACE-inhibitor to an angiotensin receptor blocker and controls were individuals who used ACE-inhibitors continuously for at least 2 years and did not switch. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) using an additive model was run in these sets and the results were meta-analysed using Genome-Wide Association Meta Analysis software. A total of 972 cases out of 5161 ACE-inhibitor starters were identified. Eight SNPs within four genes reached the genome-wide association study significance level (P&lt;5×10) in the meta-analysis [RNA binding protein, Fox-1 homolog (Caenorhabditis elegans), ?-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit ?-2, sarcoma (Src) homology 2 (SH2) B adaptor protein 1 and membrane bound O-acyltransferase domain containing 1]. The strongest associated SNP was located in an intron of RNA binding protein, Fox-1 homolog (Caenorhabditis elegans), which contains an RNA binding protein [rs2061538: minor allele frequency=0.16, odds ratio=1.52 (95% confidence interval: 1.32-1.76), P=6.2×10]. These results indicate that genetic variation in the above-mentioned genes may increase the risk of ACE-inhibitor-induced adverse reactions. 	Pharmacogenet._Genomics	D016428 D017418
26644207	20151209	Pharmacogenetic study of long-term response to interferon-? treatment in multiple sclerosis.	The aim of the study is the identification of genetic factors that influence the long-term response to interferon-? (IFN?) (4-year follow-up). We performed a genome-wide association study in 337 IFN?-treated Italian multiple sclerosis patients at the extreme of treatment response, and we meta-analyzed association effects, integrating results with pathway analysis, gene-expression profiling of IFN?-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 20 healthy controls (HC) and expression quantitative locus (eQTL) analyses. From meta-analysis, 43 markers were associated at P&lt;10-4, and two of them (rs7298096 and rs4726460) pointed to two genes, NINJ2 and TBXAS1, that were significantly downregulated after IFN? stimulation in HC (P=3.1 × 10-9and 5.6 × 10-10). We also observed an eQTL effect for the allele associated with favorable treatment response (rs4726460A); moreover, TBXAS1 appeared downregulated upon IFN? administration (?=-0.39; P=0.02). Finally, we found an enrichment of pathways related to inflammatory processes and presynaptic membrane, the latter with involvement of genes related to glutamatergic system (GRM3 and GRIK2), confirming its potential role in the response to IFN?.

27564568	20160827	Genomewide Approach Validates Thiopurine Methyltransferase Activity Is a Monogenic Pharmacogenomic Trait.	We performed a genomewide association study (GWAS) of primary erythrocyte thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity in children with leukemia (n = 1,026). Adjusting for age and ancestry, TPMT was the only gene that reached genomewide significance (top hit rs1142345 or 719A&gt;G; P = 8.6 × 10-61). Additional genetic variants (in addition to the three single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs], rs1800462, rs1800460, and rs1142345, defining TPMT clinical genotype) did not significantly improve classification accuracy for TPMT phenotype. Clinical mercaptopurine tolerability in 839 patients was related to TPMT clinical genotype (P = 2.4 × 10-11). Using 177 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), there were 251 SNPs ranked higher than the top TPMT SNP (rs1142345; P = 6.8 × 10-5), revealing a limitation of LCLs for pharmacogenomic discovery. In a GWAS, TPMT activity in patients behaves as a monogenic trait, further bolstering the utility of TPMT genetic testing in the clinic. 	Clin._Pharmacol._Ther.	D016428
28736931	20170725	Genetic Variants in HSD17B3, SMAD3, and IPO11 Impact Circulating Lipids in Response to Fenofibrate in Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes.	Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and dyslipidemia are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Fibrates are a class of drugs prescribed to treat dyslipidemia, but variation in response has been observed. To evaluate common and rare genetic variants that impact lipid responses to fenofibrate in statin-treated patients with T2D, we examined lipid changes in response to fenofibrate therapy using a genomewide association study (GWAS). Associations were followed-up using gene expression studies in mice. Common variants in SMAD3 and IPO11 were marginally associated with lipid changes in black subjects (P &lt; 5 × 10-6). Rare variant and gene expression changes were assessed using a false discovery rate approach. AKR7A3 and HSD17B13 were associated with lipid changes in white subjects (q &lt; 0.2). Mice fed fenofibrate displayed reductions in Hsd17b13 gene expression (q &lt; 0.1). Associations of variants in SMAD3, IPO11, and HSD17B13, with gene expression changes in mice indicate that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-?) and NRF2 signaling pathways may influence fenofibrate effects on dyslipidemia in patients with T2D.

28443625	20170427	Genome-wide meta-analysis of 241,258 adults accounting for smoking behaviour identifies novel loci for obesity traits.	Few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) account for environmental exposures, like smoking, potentially impacting the overall trait variance when investigating the genetic contribution to obesity-related traits. Here, we use GWAS data from 51,080 current smokers and 190,178 nonsmokers (87% European descent) to identify loci influencing BMI and central adiposity, measured as waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio both adjusted for BMI. We identify 23 novel genetic loci, and 9 loci with convincing evidence of gene-smoking interaction (GxSMK) on obesity-related traits. We show consistent direction of effect for all identified loci and significance for 18 novel and for 5 interaction loci in an independent study sample. These loci highlight novel biological functions, including response to oxidative stress, addictive behaviour, and regulatory functions emphasizing the importance of accounting for environment in genetic analyses. Our results suggest that tobacco smoking may alter the genetic susceptibility to overall adiposity and body fat distribution. 	Nat_Commun	D016428
27802415	20161102	Genome-Wide and Gene-Based Meta-Analyses Identify Novel Loci Influencing Blood Pressure Response to Hydrochlorothiazide.	This study aimed to identify novel loci influencing the antihypertensive response to hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy. A genome-wide meta-analysis of blood pressure (BP) response to hydrochlorothiazide was performed in 1739 white hypertensives from 6 clinical trials within the International Consortium for Antihypertensive Pharmacogenomics Studies, making it the largest study to date of its kind. No signals reached genome-wide significance (P&lt;5×10-8), and the suggestive regions (P&lt;10-5) were cross-validated in 2 black cohorts treated with hydrochlorothiazide. In addition, a gene-based analysis was performed on candidate genes with previous evidence of involvement in diuretic response, in BP regulation, or in hypertension susceptibility. Using the genome-wide meta-analysis approach, with validation in blacks, we identified 2 suggestive regulatory regions linked to gap junction protein ?1 gene (GJA1) and forkhead box A1 gene (FOXA1), relevant for cardiovascular and kidney function. With the gene-based approach, we identified hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 ?- and steroid ?-isomerase 1 gene (HSD3B1) as significantly associated with BP response (P&lt;2.28×10-4). HSD3B1 encodes the 3?-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme and plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of aldosterone and endogenous ouabain. By amassing all of the available pharmacogenomic studies of BP response to hydrochlorothiazide, and using 2 different analytic approaches, we identified 3 novel loci influencing BP response to hydrochlorothiazide. The gene-based analysis, never before applied to pharmacogenomics of antihypertensive drugs to our knowledge, provided a powerful strategy to identify a locus of interest, which was not identified in the genome-wide meta-analysis because of high allelic heterogeneity. These data pave the way for future investigations on new pathways and drug targets to enhance the current understanding of personalized antihypertensive treatment.

27576016	20160831	A Genome-Wide Association Study to Identify Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms for Acute Kidney Injury.	Acute kidney injury is a common and severe complication of critical illness and cardiac surgery. Despite significant attempts at developing treatments, therapeutic advances to attenuate acute kidney injury and expedite recovery have largely failed. Identifying genetic loci associated with increased risk of acute kidney injury may reveal novel pathways for therapeutic development. We conducted an exploratory genome-wide association study to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with genetic susceptibility to in-hospital acute kidney injury. We genotyped 609,508 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and performed genotype imputation in 760 acute kidney injury cases and 669 controls. We then evaluated polymorphisms that showed the strongest association with acute kidney injury in a replication patient population containing 206 cases with 1,406 controls. We observed an association between acute kidney injury and four single-nucleotide polymorphisms at two independent loci on metaanalysis of discovery and replication populations. These include rs62341639 (metaanalysis P?=?2.48?×?10-7; odds ratio [OR], 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-0.76) and rs62341657 (P?=?3.26?×?10-7; OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.55-0.76) on chromosome 4 near APOL1-regulator IRF2, and rs9617814 (metaanalysis P?=?3.81?×?10-6; OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.60-0.81) and rs10854554 (P?=?6.53?×?10-7; OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.57-0.79) on chromosome 22 near acute kidney injury-related gene TBX1. Our findings reveal two genetic loci that are associated with acute kidney injury. Additional studies should be conducted to functionally evaluate these loci and to identify other common genetic variants contributing to acute kidney injury. 	Am._J._Respir._Crit._Care_Med.	D016428
28207573	20170217	Genome-wide analysis of clopidogrel active metabolite levels identifies novel variants that influence antiplatelet response.	Clopidogrel is one of the most commonly used therapeutics for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes. However, considerable interindividual variation in clopidogrel response has been documented, resulting in suboptimal therapy and an increased risk of recurrent events for some patients. In this investigation, we carried out the first genome-wide association study of circulating clopidogrel active metabolite levels in 513 healthy participants to directly measure clopidogrel pharmacokinetics. We observed that the CYP2C19 locus was the strongest genetic determinant of active metabolite formation (P=9.5×10). In addition, we identified novel genome-wide significant variants on chromosomes 3p25 (rs187941554, P=3.3×10) and 17q11 (rs80343429, P=1.3×10), as well as six additional loci that showed suggestive evidence of association (P?1.0×10). Four of these loci showed nominal associations with on-clopidogrel ADP-stimulated platelet aggregation (P?0.05). Evaluation of clopidogrel active metabolite concentration may help identify novel genetic determinants of clopidogrel response, which has implications for the development of novel therapeutics and improved antiplatelet treatment for at-risk patients in the future.

28680059	20170707	GWAS follow-up study of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma identifies potential genetic loci associated with family history of upper gastrointestinal cancer.	Based on our initial genome-wide association study (GWAS) on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in Han Chinese, we conducted a follow-up study to examine the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with family history (FH) of upper gastrointestinal cancer (UGI) cancer in cases with ESCC. We evaluated the association between SNPs and FH of UGI cancer among ESCC cases in a stage-1 case-only analysis of the National Cancer Institute (NCI, 541 cases with FH and 1399 without FH) and Henan GWAS (493 cases with FH and 869 without FH) data (discovery phase). The top SNPs (or their surrogates) from discovery were advanced to a stage-2 evaluation in additional Henan subjects (2801 cases with FH and 3136 without FH, replication phase). A total of 19 SNPs were associated with FH of UGI cancer in ESCC cases with P?&lt;?10-5in the stage-1 meta-analysis of NCI and Henan GWAS data. In stage-2, the association for rs79747906 (located at 18p11.31, P?=?5.79?×?10-6in discovery) was replicated (P?=?0.006), with a pooled-OR of 1.59 (95%CI: 1.11-2.28). We identified potential genetic variants associated with FH of UGI cancer. Our findings may provide important insights into new low-penetrance susceptibility regions involved in the susceptibility of families with multiple UGI cancer cases. 	Sci_Rep	D016428
28739976	20170726	Novel Blood Pressure Locus and Gene Discovery Using Genome-Wide Association Study and Expression Data Sets From Blood and the Kidney.	Elevated blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and has a substantial genetic contribution. Genetic variation influencing blood pressure has the potential to identify new pharmacological targets for the treatment of hypertension. To discover additional novel blood pressure loci, we used 1000 Genomes Project-based imputation in 150 134 European ancestry individuals and sought significant evidence for independent replication in a further 228 245 individuals. We report 6 new signals of association in or nearHSPB7,TNXB,LRP12,LOC283335,SEPT9, andAKT2, and provide new replication evidence for a further 2 signals inEBF2andNFKBIACombining large whole-blood gene expression resources totaling 12 607 individuals, we investigated all novel and previously reported signals and identified 48 genes with evidence for involvement in blood pressure regulation that are significant in multiple resources. Three novel kidney-specific signals were also detected. These robustly implicated genes may provide new leads for therapeutic innovation. 	Hypertension	D016428
28714975	20170718	Association analyses based on false discovery rate implicate new loci for coronary artery disease.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in coronary artery disease (CAD) had identified 66 loci at 'genome-wide significance' (P &lt; 5 × 10-8) at the time of this analysis, but a much larger number of putative loci at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% (refs. 1,2,3,4). Here we leverage an interim release of UK Biobank (UKBB) data to evaluate the validity of the FDR approach. We tested a CAD phenotype inclusive of angina (SOFT; ncases= 10,801) as well as a stricter definition without angina (HARD; ncases= 6,482) and selected cases with the former phenotype to conduct a meta-analysis using the two most recent CAD GWAS. This approach identified 13 new loci at genome-wide significance, 12 of which were on our previous list of loci meeting the 5% FDR threshold, thus providing strong support that the remaining loci identified by FDR represent genuine signals. The 304 independent variants associated at 5% FDR in this study explain 21.2% of CAD heritability and identify 243 loci that implicate pathways in blood vessel morphogenesis as well as lipid metabolism, nitric oxide signaling and inflammation.

We conducted the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) in Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) to identify potential predictors of venlafaxine XR treatment outcome. Ninety-eight European American patients participated in a venlafaxine XR clinical trial for GAD, with Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) response/remission at 24 weeks as the primary outcome measure. All participants were genotyped with the Illumina PsychChip, and 266,820 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed. Although no SNPs reached genome-wide significance, 8 SNPs were marginally associated with treatment response/remission and HAM-A reduction at week 12 and 24 (p&lt;0.00001). Several identified genes may indicate markers crossing neuropsychiatric diagnostic categories. 	Psychiatry_Res	D016428
28358823	20170331	Genome-wide association screens for Achilles tendon and ACL tears and tendinopathy.	Achilles tendinopathy or rupture and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture are substantial injuries affecting athletes, associated with delayed recovery or inability to return to competition. To identify genetic markers that might be used to predict risk for these injuries, we performed genome-wide association screens for these injuries using data from the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort consisting of 102,979 individuals. We did not find any single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with either of these injuries with a p-value that was genome-wide significant (p&lt;5x10-8). We found, however, four and three polymorphisms with p-values that were borderline significant (p&lt;10-6) for Achilles tendon injury and ACL rupture, respectively. We then tested SNPs previously reported to be associated with either Achilles tendon injury or ACL rupture. None showed an association in our cohort with a false discovery rate of less than 5%. We obtained, however, moderate to weak evidence for replication in one case; specifically, rs4919510 in MIR608 had a p-value of 5.1x10-3 for association with Achilles tendon injury, corresponding to a 7% chance of false replication. Finally, we tested 2855 SNPs in 90 candidate genes for musculoskeletal injury, but did not find any that showed a significant association below a false discovery rate of 5%. We provide data containing summary statistics for the entire genome, which will be useful for future genetic studies on these injuries. 	PLoS_ONE	D016428 D017418
28490609	20170512	A Genome-Wide Association Study of IVGTT-Based Measures of First-Phase Insulin Secretion Refines the Underlying Physiology of Type 2 Diabetes Variants.	Understanding the physiological mechanisms by which common variants predispose to type 2 diabetes requires large studies with detailed measures of insulin secretion and sensitivity. Here we performed the largest genome-wide association study of first-phase insulin secretion, as measured by intravenous glucose tolerance tests, using up to 5,567 individuals without diabetes from 10 studies. We aimed to refine the mechanisms of 178 known associations between common variants and glycemic traits and identify new loci. Thirty type 2 diabetes or fasting glucose-raising alleles were associated with a measure of first-phase insulin secretion atP&lt; 0.05 and provided new evidence, or the strongest evidence yet, that insulin secretion, intrinsic to the islet cells, is a key mechanism underlying the associations at theHNF1A,IGF2BP2,KCNQ1,HNF1B,VPS13C/C2CD4A,FAF1,PTPRD,AP3S2,KCNK16,MAEA,LPP, WFS1, andTMPRSS6loci. The fasting glucose-raising allele nearPDX1, a known key insulin transcription factor, was strongly associated with lower first-phase insulin secretion but has no evidence for an effect on type 2 diabetes risk. The diabetes risk allele atTCF7L2was associated with a stronger effect on peak insulin response than on C-peptide-based insulin secretion rate, suggesting a possible additional role in hepatic insulin clearance or insulin processing. In summary, our study provides further insight into the mechanisms by which common genetic variation influences type 2 diabetes risk and glycemic traits. 	Diabetes	D016428 D017418 D052061 D013485
28604730	20170613	Large-scale association analysis identifies new lung cancer susceptibility loci and heterogeneity in genetic susceptibility across histological subtypes.	Although several lung cancer susceptibility loci have been identified, much of the heritability for lung cancer remains unexplained. Here 14,803 cases and 12,262 controls of European descent were genotyped on the OncoArray and combined with existing data for an aggregated genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis of lung cancer in 29,266 cases and 56,450 controls. We identified 18 susceptibility loci achieving genome-wide significance, including 10 new loci. The new loci highlight the striking heterogeneity in genetic susceptibility across the histological subtypes of lung cancer, with four loci associated with lung cancer overall and six loci associated with lung adenocarcinoma. Gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis in 1,425 normal lung tissue samples highlights RNASET2, SECISBP2L and NRG1 as candidate genes. Other loci include genes such as a cholinergic nicotinic receptor, CHRNA2, and the telomere-related genes OFBC1 and RTEL1. Further exploration of the target genes will continue to provide new insights into the etiology of lung cancer. 	Nat._Genet.	D016428 D017418
28270201	20170309	Exploration of haplotype research consortium imputation for genome-wide association studies in 20,032 Generation Scotland participants.	The Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) is a family-based population cohort with DNA, biological samples, socio-demographic, psychological and clinical data from approximately 24,000 adult volunteers across Scotland. Although data collection was cross-sectional, GS:SFHS became a prospective cohort due to of the ability to link to routine Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. Over 20,000 participants were selected for genotyping using a large genome-wide array. GS:SFHS was analysed using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to test the effects of a large spectrum of variants, imputed using the Haplotype Research Consortium (HRC) dataset, on medically relevant traits measured directly or obtained from EHRs. The HRC dataset is the largest available haplotype reference panel for imputation of variants in populations of European ancestry and allows investigation of variants with low minor allele frequencies within the entire GS:SFHS genotyped cohort. Genome-wide associations were run on 20,032 individuals using both genotyped and HRC imputed data. We present results for a range of well-studied quantitative traits obtained from clinic visits and for serum urate measures obtained from data linkage to EHRs collected by the Scottish National Health Service. Results replicated known associations and additionally reveal novel findings, mainly with rare variants, validating the use of the HRC imputation panel. For example, we identified two new associations with fasting glucose at variants near to Y_RNA and WDR4 and four new associations with heart rate at SNPs within CSMD1 and ASPH, upstream of HTR1F and between PROKR2 and GPCPD1. All were driven by rare variants (minor allele frequencies in the range of 0.08-1%). Proof of principle for use of EHRs was verification of the highly significant association of urate levels with the well-established urate transporter SLC2A9. GS:SFHS provides genetic data on over 20,000 participants alongside a range of phenotypes as well as linkage to National Health Service laboratory and clinical records. We have shown that the combination of deeper genotype imputation and extended phenotype availability make GS:SFHS an attractive resource to carry out association studies to gain insight into the genetic architecture of complex traits.

28314753	20170319	GSDMA and PRDM1 as susceptibility genes to systemic sclerosis.	Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease characterised by skin and systemic fibrosis culminating in organ damage. Previous genetic studies including genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 12 susceptibility loci satisfying genome-wide significance. Transethnic meta-analyses have successfully expanded the list of susceptibility genes and deepened biological insights for other autoimmune diseases. We performed transethnic meta-analysis of GWAS in the Japanese and European populations, followed by a two-staged replication study comprising a total of 4436 cases and 14?751 controls. Associations between significant single nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) and neighbouring genes were evaluated. Enrichment analysis of H3K4Me3, a representative histone mark for active promoter was conducted with an expanded list of SSc susceptibility genes. We identified two significant SNP in two loci,GSDMAandPRDM1, both of which are related to immune functions and associated with other autoimmune diseases (p=1.4×10-10and 6.6×10-10, respectively).GSDMAalso showed a significant association with limited cutaneous SSc. We also replicated the associations of previously reported loci including a non-GWAS locus,TNFAIP3. PRDM1encodes BLIMP1, a transcription factor regulating T-cell proliferation and plasma cell differentiation. The top SNP inGSDMAwas a missense variant and correlated with gene expression of neighbouring genes, and this could explain the association in this locus. We found different human leukocyte antigen (HLA) association patterns between the two populations. Enrichment analysis suggested the importance of CD4-naïve primary T cell. GSDMA andPRDM1are associated with SSc. These findings provide enhanced insight into the genetic and biological basis of SSc. 	Ann._Rheum._Dis.	D016428 D017418 D016454
28109725	20170123	6q12 and 11p14 variants are associated with postnatal exhaled nitric oxide levels and respiratory symptoms.	Exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) is a biomarker of airway inflammation and seems to precede respiratory symptoms, such as asthma, in childhood. Identifying genetic determinants of postnatal eNO levels might aid in unraveling the role of eNO in epithelial function or airway inflammation and disease. We sought to identify genetic determinants of early postnatal eNO levels and subsequent respiratory symptoms during the first year of life. Within a population-based birth cohort, eNO levels were measured in healthy term infants aged 5 weeks during quiet tidal breathing in unsedated sleep. We assessed associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms with eNO levels in a genome-wide association study and subsequent symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections during the first year of life and asked whether this was modified by prenatal and early-life environmental factors. We identified thus far unknown determinants of infant eNO levels: rs208515 (P = 3.3 × 10-8), which is located at 6q12, probably acting in &quot;trans&quot; and explaining 10.3% of eNO level variance, and rs1441519 (P = 1.6 × 10-6), which is located at 11p14, potentially affecting nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) expression, as shown by means of in vitro functional analyses. Moreover, the 6q12 locus was inversely associated with subsequent respiratory symptoms (P &lt; .05) and time to recovery after first respiratory symptoms during the first year of life (P &lt; .05). The identification of novel genetic determinants of infant eNO levels might implicate that postnatal eNO metabolism in healthy infants before first viral infections and sensitization is related to mechanisms other than those associated with asthma, atopy, or increased risk thereof later in life.

28761973	20170802	Enhanced Identification of Potential Pleiotropic Genetic Variants for Bone Mineral Density and Breast Cancer.	Epidemiological and clinical evidences have shown that bone mineral density (BMD) has a close relationship with breast cancer (BC). They might potentially have a shared genetic basis. By incorporating information about these pleiotropic effects, we may be able to explore more of the traits' total heritability. We applied a recently developed conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) method to the summary statistics from two independent GWASs to identify the potential pleiotropic genetic variants for BMD and BC. By jointly analyzing two large independent GWASs of BMD and BC, we found strong pleiotropic enrichment between them and identified 102 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BMD and 192 SNPs in BC with cFDR &lt; 0.05, including 230 SNPs that might have been overlooked by the standard GWAS analysis. cFDR-significant genes were enriched in GO terms and KEGG pathways which were crucial to bone metabolism and/or BC pathology (adjP &lt; 0.05). Some cFDR-significant genes were partially validated in the gene expressional validation assay. Strong interactions were found between proteins produced by cFDR-significant genes in the context of biological mechanism of bone metabolism and/or BC etiology. Totally, we identified 7 pleiotropic SNPs that were associated with both BMD and BC (conjunction cFDR &lt; 0.05); CCDC170, ESR1, RANKL, CPED1, and MEOX1 might play important roles in the pleiotropy of BMD and BC. Our study highlighted the significant pleiotropy between BMD and BC and shed novel insight into trait-specific as well as the potentially shared genetic architecture for both BMD and BC.

28011674	20161225	Rare genetic variants in SMAP1, B3GAT2, and RIMS1 contribute to pediatric venous thromboembolism.	Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have confirmed known risk mutations for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and identified a number of novel susceptibility loci in adults. Here we present a GWAS in 212 nuclear families with pediatric VTE followed by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify causative mutations contributing to the association. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) exceeded the threshold for genome-wide significance as determined by permutation testing using 100?000 bootstrap permutations (P&lt; 10-5). These SNPs reside in a region on chromosome 6q13 comprising the genes small ARF GAP1 (SMAP1), an ARF6 guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein that functions in clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and ?-1,3-glucoronyltransferase 2 (B3GAT2), a member of the human natural killer 1 carbohydrate pathway. Rs1304029 and rs2748331 are associated with pediatric VTE with unpermuted/permuted values ofP= 1.42 × 10-6/2.0 × 10-6andP= 6.11 × 10-6/1.8 × 10-5, respectively. Rs2748331 was replicated (P= .00719) in an independent study sample coming from our GWAS on pediatric thromboembolic stroke (combinedP= 7.88 × 10-7). Subsequent targeted NGS in 24 discordant sibling pairs identified 17 nonsynonymous coding variants, of which 1 located inSMAP1and 3 inRIMS1, a member of the RIM family of active zone proteins, are predicted as damaging by Protein Variation Effect Analyzer and/or sorting intolerant from tolerant scores. Three SNPs curtly missed statistical significance in the transmission-disequilibrium test in the full cohort (rs112439957:P= .08326,SMAP1; rs767118962:P= .08326,RIMS1; and rs41265501:P= .05778,RIMS1). In conjunction, our data provide compelling evidence forSMAP1,B3GAT2, andRIMS1as novel susceptibility loci for pediatric VTE and warrant future functional studies to unravel the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to VTE.

28453389	20170429	GWAS analysis of treatment resistant schizophrenia: interaction effect of childhood trauma.	In the current study, we aimed to compare the prevalence of adverse lifetime events in treatment resistant and non-treatment resistant schizophrenia in a genome-wide association study. Our sample consisted of 84 Caucasian participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, assessed cross-sectionally to collect information regarding drug effectiveness and childhood trauma. Using a genome-wide association analysis, we tested single-nucleotide polymorphisms for their association with resistance to antipsychotics defined according to American Psychiatric Association criteria. Two models were tested: a main model and an interaction model with the childhood trauma. Our analysis failed to demonstrate a significant relationship among 1,178,234 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and treatment-resistance in both the main model and in the childhood trauma interaction model. Even though we could not find any significant association, treatment resistance has clinical relevance and it may be determined by the interaction between biological and non biological factors.

28039329	20170101	A genome-wide interaction analysis of tricyclic/tetracyclic antidepressants and RR and QT intervals: a pharmacogenomics study from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium.	Increased heart rate and a prolonged QT interval are important risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and can be influenced by the use of various medications, including tricyclic/tetracyclic antidepressants (TCAs). We aim to identify genetic loci that modify the association between TCA use and RR and QT intervals. We conducted race/ethnic-specific genome-wide interaction analyses (with HapMap phase II imputed reference panel imputation) of TCAs and resting RR and QT intervals in cohorts of European (n=45?706; n=1417 TCA users), African (n=10?235; n=296 TCA users) and Hispanic/Latino (n=13?808; n=147 TCA users) ancestry, adjusted for clinical covariates. Among the populations of European ancestry, two genome-wide significant loci were identified for RR interval: rs6737205 inBRE(?=56.3, pinteraction=3.9e-9) and rs9830388 inUBE2E2(?=25.2, pinteraction=1.7e-8). In Hispanic/Latino cohorts, rs2291477 inTGFBR3significantly modified the association between TCAs and QT intervals (?=9.3, pinteraction=2.55e-8). In the meta-analyses of the other ethnicities, these loci either were excluded from the meta-analyses (as part of quality control), or their effects did not reach the level of nominal statistical significance (pinteraction&gt;0.05). No new variants were identified in these ethnicities. No additional loci were identified after inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis of the three ancestries. Among Europeans, TCA interactions with variants inBREandUBE2E2were identified in relation to RR intervals. Among Hispanic/Latinos, variants inTGFBR3modified the relation between TCAs and QT intervals. Future studies are required to confirm our results. 	J._Med._Genet.	D016428
28334792	20170324	GWAS identifies population-specific new regulatory variants in FUT6 associated with plasma B12 concentrations in Indians.	Vitamin B12 is an important cofactor in one-carbon metabolism whose dysregulation is associated with various clinical conditions. Indians have a high prevalence of B12 deficiency but little is known about the genetic determinants of circulating B12 concentrations in Indians. We performed a genome-wide association study in 1001 healthy participants in the Pune Maternal Nutrition Study (PMNS), replication studies in 3418 individuals from other Indian cohorts and by meta-analysis identified new variants, rs3760775 (P?=?1.2?×?10-23) and rs78060698 (P?=?8.3?×?10-17) in FUT6 to be associated with circulating B12 concentrations. Although in-silico analysis replicated both variants in Europeans, differences in the effect allele frequency, effect size and the linkage disequilibrium structure of credible set variants with the reported variants suggest population-specific characteristics in this region. We replicated previously reported variants rs602662, rs601338 in FUT2, rs3760776, rs708686 in FUT6, rs34324219 in TCN1 (all P?&lt;?5?×?10-8), rs1131603 in TCN2 (P?=?3.4?×?10-5), rs12780845 in CUBN (P?=?3.0?×?10-3) and rs2270655 in MMAA (P?=?2.0?×?10-3). Circulating B12 concentrations in the PMNS and Parthenon study showed a significant decline with increasing age (P?&lt;?0.001), however, the genetic contribution to B12 concentrations remained constant. Luciferase reporter and electrophoretic-mobility shift assay for the FUT6 variant rs78060698 using HepG2 cell line demonstrated strong allele-specific promoter and enhancer activity and differential binding of HNF4?, a key regulator of expression of various fucosyltransferases. Hence, the rs78060698 variant, through regulation of fucosylation may control intestinal host-microbial interaction which could influence B12 concentrations. Our results suggest that in addition to established genetic variants, population-specific variants are important in determining plasma B12 concentrations. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D013485
28334935	20170324	Genome-wide association study of iron traits and relation to diabetes in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL): potential genomic intersection of iron and glucose regulation?	Genetic variants contribute to normal variation of iron-related traits and may also cause clinical syndromes of iron deficiency or excess. Iron overload and deficiency can adversely affect human health. For example, elevated iron storage is associated with increased diabetes risk, although mechanisms are still being investigated. We conducted the first genome-wide association study of serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin saturation, and ferritin in a Hispanic/Latino cohort, the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (&gt;12 000 participants) and also assessed the generalization of previously known loci to this population. We then evaluated whether iron-associated variants were associated with diabetes and glycemic traits. We found evidence for a novel association between TIBC and a variant near the gene for protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 3B (PPP1R3B; rs4841132, ??=?-0.116, P?=?7.44 × 10-8). The effect strengthened when iron deficient individuals were excluded (??=?-0.121, P?=?4.78 × 10-9). Ten of sixteen variants previously associated with iron traits generalized to HCHS/SOL, including variants at the transferrin (TF), hemochromatosis (HFE), fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2)/myelin regulatory factor (MYRF), transmembrane protease, serine 6 (TMPRSS6), transferrin receptor (TFR2), N-acetyltransferase 2 (arylamine N-acetyltransferase) (NAT2), ABO blood group (ABO), and GRB2 associated binding protein 3 (GAB3) loci. In examining iron variant associations with glucose homeostasis, an iron-raising variant of TMPRSS6 was associated with lower HbA1c levels (P?=?8.66 × 10-10). This association was attenuated upon adjustment for iron measures. In contrast, the iron-raising allele of PPP1R3B was associated with higher levels of fasting glucose (P = 7.70 × 10-7) and fasting insulin (P?=?4.79 × 10-6), but these associations were not attenuated upon adjustment for TIBC-so iron is not likely a mediator. These results provide new genetic information on iron traits and their connection with glucose homeostasis. 	Hum._Mol._Genet.	D016428 D052061
28274756	20170310	Common genetic variation and risk of gallbladder cancer in India: a case-control genome-wide association study.	Gallbladder cancer is highly lethal, with notable differences in incidence by geography and ethnic background. The aim of this study was to identify common genetic susceptibility alleles for gallbladder cancer. In this case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS), we did a genome-wide scan of gallbladder cancer cases and hospital visitor controls, both of Indian descent, followed by imputation across the genome. Cases were patients aged 20-80 years with microscopically confirmed primary gallbladder cancer diagnosed or treated at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India, and enrolled in the study between Sept 12, 2010, and June 8, 2015. We only included patients who had been diagnosed less than 1 year before the date of enrolment and excluded patients with any other malignancies. We recruited visitor controls aged 20-80 years with no history of cancer visiting all departments or units of Tata Memorial Hospital during the same time period and frequency matched them to cases on the basis of age, sex, and current region of residence. We estimated association using logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, and five eigenvectors. We recruited samples for a replication cohort from patients visiting Tata Memorial Hospital between Aug 4, 2015, and May 17, 2016, and patients visiting the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India, between July, 2010, and May, 2015. We used the same inclusion and exclusion criteria for the replication set. We examined three of the most significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the replication cohort and did a meta-analysis of the GWAS discovery and replication sets to get combined estimates of association. The discovery cohort comprised 1042 gallbladder cancer cases and 1709 controls and the replication cohort contained 428 gallbladder cancer cases and 420 controls. We observed genome-wide significant associations for several markers in the chromosomal region 7q21.12 harbouring both the ABCB1 and ABCB4 genes, with the most notable SNPs after replication and meta-analysis being rs1558375 (GWAS p=3·8?×?10-9; replication p=0·01; combined p=2·3?×?10-10); rs17209837 (GWAS p=2·0?×?10-8; replication p=0·02; combined p=2·3?×?10-9), and rs4148808 (GWAS p=2·4?×?10-8; replication p=0·008; combined p=2·7?×?10-9). Combined estimates of per-allele trend odds ratios were 1·47 (95% CI 1·30-1·66; p=2·31?×?10-10) for rs1558375, 1·61 (1·38-1·89; p=2·26?×?10-9) for rs17209837, and 1·57 (1·35-1·82; p=2·71?×?10-9) for rs4148808. GWAS heritability analysis suggested that common variants are associated with substantial variation in risk of gallbladder cancer (sibling relative risk 3·15 [95% CI 1·80-5·49]). To our knowledge, this study is the first report of common genetic variation conferring gallbladder cancer risk at genome-wide significance. This finding, along with in-silico and biological evidence indicating the potential functional significance of ABCB1 and ABCB4, underlines the likely importance of these hepatobiliary phospholipid transporter genes in the pathology of gallbladder cancer.

28283553	20170312	Genome-wide association study of sepsis in extremely premature infants.	To identify genetic variants associated with sepsis (early-onset and late-onset) using a genome-wide association (GWA) analysis in a cohort of extremely premature infants. Previously generated GWA data from the Neonatal Research Network's anonymised genomic database biorepository of extremely premature infants were used for this study. Sepsis was defined as culture-positive early-onset or late-onset sepsis or culture-proven meningitis. Genomic and whole-genome-amplified DNA was genotyped for 1.2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); 91% of SNPs were successfully genotyped. We imputed 7.2 million additional SNPs. p Values and false discovery rates (FDRs) were calculated from multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for gender, gestational age and ancestry. Target statistical value was p&lt;10-5. Secondary analyses assessed associations of SNPs with pathogen type. Pathway analyses were also run on primary and secondary end points. Data from 757 extremely premature infants were included: 351 infants with sepsis and 406 infants without sepsis. No SNPs reached genome-wide significance levels (5×10-8); two SNPs in proximity to FOXC2 and FOXL1 genes achieved target levels of significance. In secondary analyses, SNPs for ELMO1, IRAK2 (Gram-positive sepsis), RALA, IMMP2L (Gram-negative sepsis) and PIEZO2 (fungal sepsis) met target significance levels. Pathways associated with sepsis and Gram-negative sepsis included gap junctions, fibroblast growth factor receptors, regulators of cell division and interleukin-1-associated receptor kinase 2 (p values&lt;0.001 and FDR&lt;20%). No SNPs met genome-wide significance in this cohort of extremely low birthweight infants; however, areas of potential association and pathways meriting further study were identified.

28128768	20170128	Effects of Multiple Genetic Loci on Age at Onset in Frontotemporal Dementia.	In frontotemporal dementia (FTD), age at disease onset (AAO) is unpredictable in both early and late-onset cases; AAO variability is found even in autosomal dominant FTD. The present study was aimed at identifying genetic modifiers modulating AAO in a large cohort of Italian FTD patients. We conducted an association analysis on 411 FTD patients, belonging to 7 Italian Centers, and for whom AAO was available. Population structure was evaluated by principal component analysis to infer continuous axes of genetic variation, and single linear regression models were applied. A genetic score (GS) was calculated on the basis of suggestive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found by association analyses. GS showed genome-wide significant slope decrease by -3.86 (95% CI: -4.64 to -3.07, p?&lt;?2×10-16) per standard deviation of the GS for 6 SNPs mapping to genes involved in neuronal development and signaling, axonal myelinization, and glutamatergic/GABA neurotransmission. An increase of the GS was associated with a decrease of the AAO. Our data indicate that there is indeed a genetic component that underpins and modulates up to 14.5% of variability of AAO in Italian FTD. Future studies on genetic modifiers in FTD are warranted.
